(AI image)

Is it ‘Buy China, Sell India’ now? In the past two years, investors in emerging markets who followed the ""Buy India, Sell China"" strategy have made significant profits. However, they are now starting to reverse their positions in response to Beijing's massive stimulus package aimed at reviving the economy and markets.The Chinese stock market has experienced a remarkable resurgence, with the CSI300 index surging 25% in a single week and the Hang Seng index gaining 16%.In contrast, the Nifty and Sensex indices in India have been under selling pressure, with foreign institutional investors (FIIs) withdrawing more than a billion dollars in a single day's trade, resulting in a nearly 1,300-point drop in the Sensex.China has taken steps to boost liquidity and stimulate consumption demand by reducing the reserve ratio for banks and lowering the mortgage rate for existing housing by 50 basis points each. The People's Bank of China has also indicated that it will implement policy easing in the near future.Institutional investors are concerned about peak valuations in the Indian market, which has been driven by retail investor liquidity. Meanwhile, FIIs have compelling reasons to invest in the Chinese resurgence story, including a large stimulus package, attractive valuations, and an underweight stance, according to an ET report.Joanne Siew Chin of DBS Group was quoted as saying, ""India has performed strongly and we are looking at other markets. China and ASEAN could actually outperform. India is actually quite a domestic liquidity market.""The Singaporean financial services firm believes that China will outperform India for the remainder of 2024, following the government's announcement of a range of monetary and liquidity measures and its commitment to further fiscal support.According to Chetan Seth of Nomura, ""Feedback from investors, and assessing some market indicators suggest that, this time around, the rally might be more sustainable relative to previous start-stop rallies. As we noted in the past, investors have been underweight HK/China stocks, and this may cause many of them to chase stocks to neutralise those positions. We suspect that many of the China bulls will likely also emerge from the long winter hibernation.""Recently, India's weight in the MSCI AC World Investable Market Index surpassed that of China, providing FIIs with sufficient room to reallocate their investments. The low valuations of Chinese stocks are also contributing to the ongoing momentum.Dr. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit believes that this could be a tactical trade that may continue for some time, with FIIs potentially selling in India and shifting more funds to better-performing markets. However, he notes that FII selling is unlikely to have a significant impact on the Indian market, as massive domestic investments can easily absorb the sales.Kotak Institutional Equities analysts observed that FII inflows in India have been primarily passive and that active FIIs may consider deploying additional inflows into China.However, they doubt that active FPIs will sell a substantial portion of their holdings in India to invest in China. The analysts also noted that any change in the relative weights of the two countries in various benchmark indices will only affect incremental flows from Global Emerging Markets (GEM) ETF funds.","Investors in emerging markets who followed the ""Buy India, Sell China"" strategy have made significant profits.

Good news for freshers! Indian IT sector entry-level hiring set to double in FY25,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/good-news-for-freshers-indian-it-sector-entry-level-hiring-set-to-double-in-fy25/articleshow/113842030.cms,"<p>The Indian IT industry experienced a turning point in the June quarter, with several companies reporting net headcount additions. (AI image) <br></p>

IT Sector Hiring Outlook

Indian IT sector to see hiring revival: The IT services sector is poised for a significant resurgence in fresher hiring this year, with estimates suggesting a nearly twofold increase in entry-level recruitment compared to the previous fiscal year. Data obtained by ET indicates that the sector is expected to exceed 150,000 fresher hires in FY25.Experts attribute this positive outlook to the growing demand in business, especially in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) segment, which represents the largest vertical for most IT companies.Additionally, substantial large deal wins and global expansion by major IT players contribute to this optimism.The Indian IT industry experienced a turning point in the June quarter, with several companies reporting net headcount additions after a period of decline.This increase in fresher hiring comes after a subdued FY24, during which clients reduced their technology spending. IT companies have also been expanding their operations beyond their primary geographies to mitigate risks. Recent months have shown signs of recovery in core regions, especially with interest rate cuts by central banks in Europe and the US.""FY2024 saw the lowest intake of freshers in the IT sector since 2000. However, FY2025 is expected to witness a significant rebound, with a potential 100% year-on-year (YoY) growth, surpassing 150,000 entry-level hires,"" said Kapil Joshi, Deputy CEO at Quess IT Staffing. This contrasts with the roughly 60,000 net hires reported by the $250 billion technology services industry in FY24.Aditya Narayan Mishra, MD & CEO of staffing firm CIEL HR, notes, ""Fresher hiring demand is projected to rise by 10-15% in the second half of FY25 compared to the same period last year. This growth is primarily driven by a reduction in bench strength and an optimistic industry outlook for the coming months."" CIEL HR estimates suggest that Indian IT services firms have already hired around 150,000-170,000 freshers in the calendar year 2024.Mishra further commented, ""This reflects a cautious yet strategic hiring approach amid economic uncertainties. Compared to the same period last year, there has been an estimated 10% increase in fresher hiring, signaling a gradual recovery in the sector. Organisations are taking a balanced recruitment approach, aligning fresher intake with project demands while maintaining a prudent outlook on overall growth.""Also Read | Infosys ‘Power’ programme offering freshers Rs 9 lakh salary; substantially higher than Rs 3-3.5 lakh entry-level fresher pay Accenture , the global IT leader, reported a significant increase in headcount during the June-August quarter, with 24,000 new hires, the highest in the past ten quarters. The company's Chair and CEO, Julie Sweet, emphasized that the majority of the hiring is taking place in India, particularly in the technology sector, and includes onboarding new college graduates to refresh their talent pyramid.A report by Nuvama suggests that most companies expanded their workforce in Q1 FY25 and are now focusing on optimizing their talent pyramid. They are preparing to onboard freshers hired in the previous quarters, and this deployment is expected to contribute to future growth. Notably, Infosys has sent onboarding emails to more than 1,000 engineering graduates who had been waiting for placement for over two years.In Q1, Infosys and Wipro announced plans to resume campus hiring this fiscal year after a one-year hiatus. TCS , the industry leader, has committed to hiring 40,000 freshers in FY25, while the top four IT players, including HCLTech , have collectively pledged to hire around 82,000 freshers.Recent reports indicate that these four IT companies signed at least 33 deals in July and August, necessitating the need for talent to execute the projects.","The Indian IT industry experienced a turning point in the June quarter, with several companies reporting net headcount additions.

"Employees take note! Should you be worried about new TDS deposit rules for employers effective from October 1, 2024?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/employees-take-note-should-you-be-worried-about-new-tds-deposit-rules-for-employers-effective-from-october-1-2024/articleshow/113847170.cms,"Employees may be concerned that the relaxation in TDS compliance granted to companies. (AI image)

What are the new TDS Deposit Rules?

New TDS Deposit Rules Explained with Example

Should employees be worried?

New TDS Deposit Rules : The government has eased the regulations surrounding the time frame within which companies or deductors must deposit TDS (deducted from payments made by them) with the government before a prosecution notice is issued. The standard due date for depositing TDS with the government is the 7th of the month following the month in which it is deducted.Employees may be concerned that the relaxation in TDS compliance granted to companies could affect the timely deposit of the tax against their respective PANs.According to an ET report, there have been recent instances of companies, such as SpiceJet and Byju's, not depositing TDS with the government on time, resulting in employees encountering income tax issues.Previously, companies had 60 days from the original due date to deposit the outstanding TDS (tax deducted at source). However, starting from October 1, 2024, the new income tax laws provide companies with additional time to accomplish this.From October 1 onwards, companies will have until the deadline to file the TDS return to deposit TDS with the government. Nevertheless, if the TDS is deposited after the original due date, penal interest would have to be paid in addition.Also Read | New TDS rates from October 1, 2024: What are the revised tax deducted at source rates? Check list of changes for these transactions This effectively grants an extra 20 days to make the TDS deposit, i.e., 60 days from the original due date plus an additional 20 days.The income tax department has introduced a new rule regarding the prosecution notice for companies that fail to deposit the TDS by the due date for filing the TDS return.Previously, the notice would be sent after 60 days from the due date for depositing the TDS. However, under the new TDS laws, the notice will be sent immediately if the company fails to deposit the TDS, along with the penal interest, by the TDS return filing deadline. This change applies only if the TDS amount exceeds Rs 25 lakh.To illustrate this change, consider a scenario where a company deducts tax from an employee's April salary. The last date to deposit the tax deducted in April is May 7, and the last date to file the TDS return for the tax deducted in April, May, and June is July 31. Under the earlier laws, if the company failed to deposit the tax deducted by July 7 (60 days from the due date of May 7), the income tax department would send a notice asking why the company should not be prosecuted.With the new TDS laws, the income tax department will send the prosecution notice if the company fails to deposit the TDS, along with the penal interest, by July 31, the TDS return filing deadline.According to the income tax laws, the tax deductor must deposit the TDS dues on or before the seventh of the subsequent month, with an exception in April. For government employees, the March TDS is deposited on or before April 7, while for others, it is April 30.Also Read | Latest post office small savings schemes interest rates Oct-Dec 2024: Government announces rates for PPF, SSY, SCSS, NSC - check list The recent amendments to the TDS laws provide companies with additional time to deposit the TDS with the government. However, concerns have been raised about the potential negative impact on employees.Many employees do not regularly review their Form 26AS and Annual Information Statement ( AIS ) during the financial year to verify if their employer has deposited the tax deducted from their salary against their PAN.Typically, employees check their Form 26AS and AIS in the following year while filing their income tax returns. When employers fail to deposit the TDS, employees are often surprised when they review their Form 26AS and AIS.Media reports have highlighted instances where employees of Byju's received tax notices from the income tax department regarding unpaid TDS dues. Recently, SpiceJet acknowledged that TDS dues remained unpaid between April 2020 and August 2023.Pranay Bhatia, Partner & Leader, Corporate Tax, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India, was quoted as saying by ET, ""The new TDS laws provide extra time for companies to deposit TDS dues with the government. While this relaxation will help companies, it will not adversely affect the employees' TDS credit. The income tax department can still send the prosecution notice to the companies if they fail to deposit the tax deducted on or before the due date to file TDS return statement.""Naveen Wadhwa, Vice President of Research and Advisory Division, Taxmann, adds, ""The relaxation of TDS laws from October 1, 2024, offers companies extra time to deposit TDS along with the penal interest before the prosecution notice is sent. However, the new TDS laws will not adversely impact employees' TDS credit against their PAN.""Recent reports have highlighted instances where employers have withheld TDS from their employees' salaries but failed to remit the funds to the government. As a result, numerous employees faced difficulties in claiming TDS credit when submitting their income tax returns.According to Wadhwa, ""Section 205 of the Income-tax Act prohibits tax recovery from taxpayers, provided tax is deducted from their salary or any other income but not deposited with the tax department. However, taxpayers must provide proof to the income tax department that tax has been deducted from their salary.""By furnishing evidence of TDS deductions, individuals can ensure they receive the appropriate TDS credit and prevent any additional tax liabilities.","The government has eased the regulations surrounding the time frame within which companies or deductors must deposit TDS (deducted from payments made by them) The standard due date for depositing TDS with the government is the 7th of the month following the month in which it is deducted. From October 1 onwards, companies will have until the deadline to file the TDS return to deposit T DS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113848173,imgsize-50376,width-400,resizemode-4/113848173.jpg"

Tesla's quarterly deliveries disappoint ahead of robotaxi unveiling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/teslas-quarterly-deliveries-disappoint-ahead-of-robotaxi-unveiling/articleshow/113890150.cms,"Tesla reported a smaller-than-expected rise in third-quarter deliveries on Wednesday as incentives and financing deals failed to lure enough customers for its aging electric vehicles , sending shares down more than 6 per cent.That puts the EV maker - already grappling with rising competition and slowing demand for EVs - at risk of its first-ever decline in annual deliveries after years of rapid growth.Shares of the world's most valuable automaker were on track to erase by the end of Wednesday's session all of the gains made so far this year. The stock had risen in recent weeks on investor hopes for Tesla's Oct. 10 event in Los Angeles where it is expected to unveil its robotaxi product in a bid to shift focus to AI-powered autonomous technologies. Tesla has been slashing prices and extending incentives, including insurance offers and zero-interest financing, especially in China, which accounts for a third of its sales.That helped boost China sales in July and August, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. Analysts believe the China strength continued in September but that U.S. and European demand was low.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

The move comes as high valuations in Indian private markets have slowed down closure of startups' late-stage growth deals.The exuberance of public markets , which have been on a bull run, is being mirrored in the private markets where companies are seeking higher valuations from investors.In a letter to its limited partners early on Wednesday, the venture capital firm said that Indian public markets have re-rated up (investors are willing to pay a higher price for shares) and mid-cap P/E multiples have expanded significantly in the last year. ""This has resulted in high valuations in late-stage growth and pre-IPO companies. In such an environment, we are choosing to remain disciplined and will continue to invest cautiously,"" the firm said in the letter seen by TOI.The fund - the VC firm's largest for the region, and floated in 2022 - had earmarked $2 billion for the Indian market and invests across seed, venture and growth stages. However, with the fund resizing, allocations will largely be slashed for late-stage growth deals.Growth stage startups run scaled up businesses and investors typically cut larger cheques for them to fund their expansion. Peak XV Partners invests $30 million and above in growth deals and has backed startups like Bluestone and Neo through the fund. ""While this may be contrarian to market exuberance, this will serve our founders and LPs well in the long term.

Panel considers lower GST on several mass-use items,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/panel-considers-lower-gst-on-several-mass-use-items/articleshow/113886574.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ministerial panel on GST rate rationalisation is weighing lower rates for several mass-use items , including medicines and tractors, to 5%, while leaving the tax on products, such as cement, unchanged.Lower revenue from tractors, which currently face 12% or 28% GST depending on their classification, may partly be compensated by an increase in GST on high-end EVs, that cost upwards of Rs 40 lakh and are imported, from the current 5%, a source familiar with the discussions told TOI.A reduction in GST on health and term insurance is, however, imminent. The only question is what the rate will be. Health covers could see the tax rate drop from 18% to 12%, while term insurance may attract 5% GST, amid suggestions of putting in the 'nil' rate segment. But a zero rate would mean that those who supply goods and services to life insurance companies may not get input tax credit, making it an unattractive proposition for them. As a result, 5% GST on term insurance appears to be a safer bet.Although a reduction in the number of slabs from four to three is unlikely, the ministerial panel headed by Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, is looking to reduce the number of items in the 12% bracket. Which means some of the items may be pushed into the 5% slab, while there would be others that can move to 18% as part of a slow transition to a three-rate structure.Things are likely to be clearer by the month-end as the panel on insurance, also headed by Chaudhary, is scheduled to meet on Oct 19, while the one on rate rationalisation will discuss item-wise details a day later. By then the officials in the fitment committee would have also worked out the details.While several state FMs in the GoM (group of ministers) have indicated their willingness for a three-rate structure, Kerala, Karnataka and West Bengal are backing a status quo. In fact, Kerala FM K N Balagopal is seen to be more reluctant than his peers when it comes to lower rates, despite the Opposition seeking to blame the BJP-led govt at the Centre for the levies. The southern state's poor finances may be a reason for the reluctance.Revenue loss is going to be a key consideration for the states and the GoM is cognizant of the pressures. For instance, lowering rates on medicines from 12% to 5% will leave an over Rs 11,000 crore hole for the Centre and the states. Similarly, health insurance fetches over Rs 8,000 crore GST. The 18% and the 28% slabs are the main revenue generators, with the latter accounting for 72-73% of the collections.But, fears of cartelisation in certain industries is also coming to their disadvantage. For instance, cement is likely to be left untouched at 28%, given the industry's track record at fixing prices. Similarly, revenue implications will also weigh on sin goods, such as cigarette, soft drinks and even packed namkeen.","Ministerial panel on GST rate rationalisation is weighing lower rates for several mass-use items, including medicines and tractors.

HYDERABAD: Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Hetero are among half a dozen generic drug makers to have entered into non-exclusive, royalty-free voluntary licencing agreements with Gilead Sciences Ireland UC to manufacture and distribute the latter's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug Lenacapavir in India and 120 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Apart from Dr Reddy’s Labs and Hetero, Emcure, Eva Pharma, Ferozsons Laboratories Ltd and Mylan too have inked pacts with Gilead for the first-in-class HIV-1 capsid inhibitor that was launched under the brand name Sunlenca in the US and Europe in 2022. While most antivirals act on just one stage of viral replication, Lenacapavir is designed to inhibit HIV at multiple stages of its lifecycle and has no known cross resistance exhibited in vitro to other existing drug classes, Gilead Sciences said.The licensee generic drugmakers will build manufacturing capacity for Lenacapavir, which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for the treatment of heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection.While Lenacapavir has been approved in multiple countries for the treatment of adults with multi-drug resistant HIV in combination with other antiretrovirals, it is also currently under investigation for the prevention of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Earlier this month, Gilead announced promising results from a pivotal Phase-3 clinical trial that showed Lenacapavir reduced HIV infections by 96% compared to the background HIV incidence.Gilead Sciences said the agreements were signed in advance of any global regulatory submissions to enable these countries to quickly introduce generic versions of Lenacapavir for HIV prevention, if approved.Dr Reddy’s said it will be responsible for technology transfer at its manufacturing site, conducting bioequivalence/clinical studies, product registration and launch in the agreed markets.The Hyderabad-based company said the agreement also grants it a licence to manufacture and commercialise Lenacapavir for the indication of prevention of HIV (PrEP) in 120 countries, if approved.Hetero Group managing director Dr Vamsi Krishna Bandi said the company intends to leverage its strong research focus, manufacturing scale and distribution expertise to expand access to Lenacapavir in all the 120 high incidence resource limited countries.","Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Hetero are among half a dozen generic drug makers to have entered into non-exclusive, royalty-free voluntary licencing agreements with Gilead Sciences Ireland UC.

Who is Erika Diarte-Carr? Utah mom plans her own funeral after being given 3 months to live,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-erika-diarte-carr-utah-mom-plans-her-own-funeral-after-being-given-3-months-to-live/articleshow/113788280.cms,"Erika Diarte-Carr, 33, learned she has Stage 4 small cell lung carcinoma, a rare form of cancer.

Erika Diarte-Carr , a 33-year-old mother of two from Utah, is facing a heart-wrenching reality after being given just three months to live. The young mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 small cell lung carcinoma in May 2022 while undergoing shoulder surgery. Her journey has been both physically and emotionally taxing, and in January, she received another devastating diagnosis: Cushing Syndrome .This rare disorder, caused by an overproduction of cortisol, affects only a small fraction of the population—between 40 to 70 people out of every million, according to the National Institutes of Health. The syndrome, if left untreated, can be life-threatening, adding further complexity to Erika's already difficult battle with cancer.On her GoFundMe page, Erika recently shared the grim news from her oncologist. “I have been given 3 months to live,” she wrote. “3 months to spend with my babies and loved ones. 3 months to make the best of what time I have left.” Her children, Jeremiah, 7, and Aaliyah, 5, are at the forefront of her thoughts as she faces the unimaginable task of planning her own funeral.With financial concerns weighing heavily, Erika explained that she has been unable to work and has no life insurance or savings. “I need to make sure my kids will be okay after I am gone,” she wrote. Her initial goal was to raise $5,000 to cover funeral costs and leave something behind for her children.In an extraordinary show of support, Erika’s story has touched the hearts of many. As of this week, her GoFundMe has raised over $840,000 from more than 29,000 donors, far surpassing her initial goal. Humbled by the generosity, she plans to set up a trust fund for her children. “That way, I can leave behind something for them and still ensure they are going to be ok as they grow up,” Erika shared.Her gratitude shines through as she reflects on the kindness of strangers. “Me and my family thank you ALL from the bottom of our hearts,” she wrote, adding, “[My children] are my whole life, light, and soul. My children are my fight and what keep me going.”In the little time she has left, Erika hopes to create lasting memories with her children. The three will soon embark on a special trip together, and she’s hopeful they will spend one final Christmas as a family.","Erika Diarte-Carr, 33, was diagnosed with Stage 4 small cell lung carcinoma.

Boeing weighs raising at least $10 billion selling stock,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-weighs-raising-at-least-10-billion-selling-stock/articleshow/113860184.cms,"Suspended talks

‘Perfectly Comfortable’

Boeing Co. is considering raising at least $10 billion by selling new stock, as the planemaker seeks to replenish cash reserves depleted further by an ongoing strike , according to people familiar with the discussions.The company is working with advisers to explore its options, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing confidential matters. Raising equity isn’t likely to happen for at least a month, assuming the planemaker can resolve the strike, because Boeing wants a firm grasp of the financial toll from the walkout by 33,000 workers, the people said.A spokesman for Boeing declined to comment.No final decision on timing and the amount has been made, and Boeing could end up deciding against the move, the people said.Boeing is under pressure to shore up its finances and hold onto its investment-grade credit rating. The company is one step away from dropping into speculative territory, which would further drive up the cost to service its $58 billion debt load. The situation has been exacerbated by the strike now in its third week that has shut down output of Boeing’s single-aisle airliner, as each day of stoppage further dents reserves.The US planemaker has seen its financial reserves dwindle in the wake of a near-catastrophic accident in January that forced Boeing to slow production of its cash-cow 737 Max airliner. Should Boeing proceed, a sale of that magnitude would stand to be the biggest by a public company since Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s $12.3 billion sale in June.The stock fell 1% as of 9:45 a.m. in New York as investors weighed the effect of a potential share sale. Through Monday, the planemaker had lost 42% this year, lowering its value to $93.6 billion — and putting Boeing on course for its worst annual return since the financial crisis in 2008.While a potential sale may dilute stock owners, the extra funds would help the company maintain its investment grade credit rating, said Rob Stallard, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners. He said the equity raise could reach as high as $15 billion.Boeing faces a liquidity squeeze after burning through $8.25 billion in free cash during the first half. The US planemaker slowed work on its cash-cow 737 Max and other jets to address quality lapses brought to light by the accident on an aircraft on Jan. 5. Workers have rebuffed two offers from the company for higher pay, and the two sides have engaged a mediator to help overcome the impasse.Analysts expect Boeing to suffer a $3.36 billion cash outflow in the third quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The strike stands to cost the company about $1.5 billion for each month that workers stay off the job, according to estimates by JPMorgan Chase & Co.The outflows risk lowering Boeing’s cash balance to the point where the three major ratings agencies would be compelled to act. Fitch Ratings has warned that an extended strike could have a “meaningful operational and financial impact, increasing the risk of a downgrade.”Chief Financial Officer Brian West told analysts at a Morgan Stanley conference last month that Boeing “will take any necessary actions” to preserve its investment grade rating and repair its balance sheet. Boeing has already initiated a savings plan that includes furloughs for workers, a hiring freeze as well as a pay cut for executives.“We are perfectly comfortable to supplement our liquidity position to support those two objectives,” West said when asked if the company might need to raise debt or equity.While Boeing is currently cash-strapped, the company is pointing to an order backlog of 5,490 aircraft, representing about half a trillion dollars worth of revenue. The 737 Max is largely sold out until the end of the decade, and European arch-rival Airbus SE is also struggling to ramp up production and has been unable to meaningfully capitalize on Boeing’s woes.The US planemaker has a history of tapping markets shortly after it releases quarterly earnings, and the next such report is slated for late October. The company most recently issued $10 billion of bonds at the end of April, about a week after it published its first-quarter results.The company has also said it wants to buy back Spirit AeroSystems Inc., the troubled supplier at the heart of some of its current manufacturing woes. While Boeing plans to pay for the $4.7 billion transaction in stock, the reintegration of its most important supplier will require additional investments to turn the business around.","Boeing is under pressure to shore up its finances and hold onto its investment- grade credit rating.

Xionism In Lux: Why global luxury biz bosses will obsess over China’s communist boss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/xionism-in-lux-why-global-luxury-biz-bosses-will-obsess-over-chinas-communist-boss/articleshow/113855683.cms,"Xi signed off on a stimulus package for China, which, by its own record-breaking standards, is currently an economic laggard.

China’s boss hopes the stimulus will, among other things, get Chinese consumers to spend more.

Top end Chinese consumers have been especially spooked by serial blowups in the debt-ridden Chinese property sector. Real estate accounts for 70% of household wealth in China.

Xi’s periodic targeting of Chinese super-rich hasn’t helped consumer confidence either. If your govt is targeting you for being wealthy, getting the next ‘it’ thing in luxury loses its allure.

This was globally consequential because ever since its economic ‘miracle’, China has been a big spender on luxury goods . It accounts for nearly a quarter of global luxury sales.

. It accounts for nearly a quarter of global luxury sales. Most top-notch global luxury companies are European. Sluggish China sales had dampened their earnings and, therefore, stock prices.

More so because American, European, South Korean and Japanese luxury consumers started reducing their spending from last year.

Post-Xi’s stimulus, the hope was that Chinese will, sooner rather than later, spend more, including on luxuries.

In anticipation, stock markets pushed up share prices of major European luxury companies.

And that’s why the net worth of Bernard Arnault , boss of French luxury company LVMH (he and his family own 48% of the company) jumped. LVMH shares have risen 11% since Sept 24, when China made the stimulus announcement.

Not just luxury stocks

But bit of bad news for India

The $18 trillion question

The neologism 'Xionism' was created by The Times of India.

A hardnosed Chinese communist boss okays some policies, and an art-collecting French billionaire gets even richer. Weird? Not at all. Globally, the big money stuff often works like this.The link is demand. And it worked like this:Arnault isn’t the only luxury boss feeling richer. Top European luxury brands (the list includes British brand, Burberry) have all seen their stocks jump.Inof the extent of stock price jump betweenand, the list reads:Stocks of major auto companies, mining companies, and financial firms also jumped after the Chinese stimulus.It’s the same logic. If Chinese consumers start spending more, discretionary high-end products and services – diamonds to sleek cars to high-end investment advice – will see a jump in demand. Benchmark stock indices in the West rose for the same reason.Sensex and Nifty, despite some dampeners now and then, have been on fire. Thanks to good macro numbers, healthy GDP growth and a growing domestic investor class. But also, thanks to somnolent Chinese stock markets, which led global investors to put more money in Indian stocks. Post-stimulus, Chinese stocks staged a recovery. Result? Indian markets were hit on Monday and were flat on Tuesday.If Xi’s stimulus works as well as he hopes it would, a bull run in China’s stock markets may well get the Dalal Street bear out of hibernation. How bearish, will depend on how much FPIs switch from India to China and how much domestic investors can pump in.But will Xi’s stimulus really charge the nearly $18 trillion Chinese economy? As is frequently the case, economists don’t agree. Optimists argue that between making real estate financing easier and lowering mortgage and general lending rates, enough was done. Pessimists say Xi should have increased govt spending and okayed a bigger deficit to boost domestic demand.We don’t know who’ll turn out to be right. But we do know Europe’s luxury bosses will be obsessing over this question.","Xi signed off on a stimulus package for China, which, by its own record-breaking standards, is currently an economic laggard.
