Gautam Adani takes a dig at Hindenburg report at Adani Group AGM; says short-seller attack was designed to defame group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gautam-adani-takes-a-dig-at-hindenburg-report-at-adani-group-agm-says-short-seller-attack-was-designed-to-defame-group/articleshow/111226224.cms,"Adani Group AGM: Top 10 Takeaways

Gautam Adani claimed that amplified by a segment of biased media, Hindenburg's allegations were intended to tarnish the group’sreputation, inflict maximum harm, and undermine its market value. In a scenario where many companies would have faltered, Adani said that the group’s liquidity proved to be its strongest asset. To further strengthen financial reserves, Adani group secured an additional Rs 40,000 crore, ensuring it can comfortably manage debt repayments for the next two years. Envision the massive redevelopment project in Mumbai’s Dharavi as the group transforms the world’s largest slum over the next decade, providing improved living conditions for over one million residents. We achieved our highest EBITDA of Rs 82,917 crore (approximately $10 billion), reflecting an impressive 45% increase, he said. This outstanding performance propelled the PAT to a record Rs 40,129 crore, a significant 71% growth. Three of the group’s portfolio companies—Ambuja, ACC, and APSEZ—have now achieved AAA ratings. India is no longer at a crossroads; we are on the verge of entering our greatest growth phase, he said. With our demographic advantage, we are well on our way to becoming the largest middle class the world has ever seen, Adani added. The foundation for growth is firmly established, and the next decade promises even greater advancements. Our infrastructure spending is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20-25%, reaching a cumulative total of $2.5 trillion, he said. The foundation for growth is firmly established, and the next decade promises even greater advancements, he claimed.

Adani Group Chairman, Gautam Adani , has hit out about the controversy sparked by the US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research in January 2023, which plunged the company into significant turmoil due to allegations of corporate governance lapses. At the time as well, Adani had refuted all the accusations.According to an ET report, at Adani Enterprises' Annual General Meeting on Monday, Gautam Adani said, “Typical short sellers target gains from financial markets. This was different. It was a two-sided attack – a vague criticism of our financial standing and, at the same time, an information distortion campaign, dragging us into a political battlefield.”Adani claimed that the short-seller attack was designed to defame group, do maximum damage. He also said that the headwinds that tested the Adani Group made it stronger.With the National Democratic Alliance, led by Narendra Modi , securing power for a third consecutive term, the Adani Group is well-equipped to further the economic and social initiatives that have fueled its remarkable progress over the past ten years, Gautam Adani said at the AGM, according to the ET report.Adani asserted, ""India is no longer at the crossroads of destiny – we stand on the brink of our greatest growth phase. By the end of this decade, our nation is set to become the world's third-largest economy."" He further added, ""Given our demographic dividend, we are well on our way to being the largest middle class that the world will ever witness.""Adani also said, ""Despite never having faced any challenges with debt repayments, we chose to drop our Debt to EBITDA ratio to 2.5x in just six months. It now stands even lower at 2.2x. This approach has not only strengthened our financial resilience but has also increased our headroom for future expansion.""","Gautam Adani claimed that Hindenburg's allegations were intended to tarnish the group’sreputation, inflict maximum harm, and undermine its market value.

The group attributed the write-off to a ""significant decrease in value for equity investors,"" recognizing a fair value loss of $493 million in other comprehensive income for the current year.According to an ET report, this move aligns with an earlier HSBC note, which assigned zero value to Prosus' nearly 10% stake in Byju's, citing multiple legal cases and funding challenges. HSBC had previously valued the stake by applying an 80% discount to the latest publicly disclosed valuation.Over the years, Prosus has invested $500 million in Byju's, making it one of its largest edtech bets in India. However, the investment has since turned sour. In addition to the Byju's write-off, Prosus has also marked its investment in Primrose Hill (ZestMoney) to zero, as compared to $38 million in the previous fiscal year.The write-off comes amidst ongoing legal troubles for Byju's. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has prohibited the edtech firm from proceeding with its second rights issue, directing it to maintain status quo in its shareholding. Byju's has filed a petition with the Karnataka High Court challenging the NCLT order, with the matter scheduled for hearing on Monday.Prosus is also engaged in a legal battle with Byju's in the Karnataka High Court, following the edtech firm's petition against a group of investors seeking the removal of CEO Raveendran from the company.

Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/standard-deduction-may-rise-under-new-tax-regime/articleshow/111212512.cms,"NEW DELHI: The finance ministry is assessing the possibility of raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime, without tinkering with the exemption-laced older regime.Besides, as the NDA govt readies to present its first Budget of its third term, it is unlikely to undertake major tweaks in capital gains mechanism, an issue on which the income tax department has been seeking a review. There have been suggestions to align the holding period across asset classes but govt may not be inclined to disturb the system, at least for the moment.While discussions on the contours of the Budget have just begun with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman undertaking public consultations, most of the exercise is currently limited to the finance ministry and internal assessment is being undertaken on multiple issues some of which will be discussed with other wings of govt before the finance ministry takes a final call, based on feedback from the PMO.The overall mood indicates that most wings of govt are in favour of offering concessions to taxpayers, especially the middle class, which has been a supporter of the Modi regime but is increasingly raising questions about the returns it gets for the tax it pays, be it through public healthcare or education.In the 2023 Budget, FM had introduced a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for salaried taxpayers and those who earn pension under the new tax regime, which became the default option, unless you opted out. Also, rebate under Section 87A was increased under the new tax regime for taxable incomes not exceeding Rs 7 lakh, allowing those earning up to this level (taxable income) to not pay any tax under the new regime. The highest surcharge under the new regime was also removed.Currently, individuals with a taxable income of upwards of Rs 3 lakh have to pay 5% income tax and there have been suggestions from industry leaders to tweak the rates in the higher brackets to boost consumption. A higher standard deduction will benefit all the salaried taxpayers, including those in the upper segment although it will entail some revenue loss.","The finance ministry is assessing the possibility of raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime.

Existing cases will be handled by principal bench of GST Appellate Tribunal, an official statement said.Sitharaman also said that some of the group of ministers have been recast as 11 new finance ministers have joined the Council with the one on rationalisation, now headed by Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, been asked to make a presentation at the next meeting of the all-powerful body, which is likely to be held after a couple of months. “When GST Council meets next, GoM will make a presentation and discussion on rationalisation will start,” FM said while stating that a decision may not be taken during the meeting itself. It is unlikely that the ministers are going to rush ahead with a decision given that crucial assembly polls are due at the end of the year.At Saturday’s meeting, Karnataka sought a discussion on compensation cess that is levied on several products to cover the “revenue loss” states. While the cess was for five years, it had to be extended up to March 2026 following the outbreak of Covid-19 as state had to borrow from the market to meet the shortfall in collections. With borrowings likely to be repaid only in 2025-26, the GST Council will deliberate on the future of the levy and the sharing formula in case some amount is left in the kitty after repaying the loans.Asked about including petrol and diesel within the ambit of GST, FM said that the law has a provision for their inclusion but it was for the states to first decide on it and then fix the rate of tax. Responding to another query, revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the issue of GST exemption for fertiliser too has been referred to the group of ministers.",The panel of finance ministers headed by Union FM Nirmala Sitharaman decided to end the ant-profiteering provision from April.

Explainer: Why food prices will remain high in India. Why has the monsoon not helped?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-why-food-prices-will-remain-high-in-india-why-has-the-monsoon-not-helped/articleshow/111169276.cms,"Here are FAQs in food prices in India:

What is driving food inflation higher?

Why has the monsoon not helped?

When will prices come down?

Can government intervention help?

Why are food prices still a concern despite easing retail inflation?

(With inputs from agencies)

Food inflation in India, driven primarily by supply-side factors such as adverse weather conditions affecting crops, has remained persistently high at around 8% year-on-year since November 2023. Despite the early arrival of monsoon rains and forecasts predicting above-normal rainfall, there is little optimism that food prices will ease soon. The elevated food prices, which account for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket, have kept headline inflation above the central bank's target of 4%, thereby preventing any cuts in interest rates.Adverse weather conditions: The drought last year and an ongoing heat wave have significantly reduced the supplies of key food items such as pulses, vegetables, and cereals.Supply chain disruptions: High temperatures in nearly half of the country, soaring 4-9 degrees Celsius above normal, have spoiled harvested and stored vegetables and hindered the planting of crops like onions, tomatoes, eggplant, and spinach.Seasonal planting challenges: Farmers usually prepare vegetable seedlings before the June-September monsoon rains, but this year, excessive heat and water scarcity have disrupted both seedling planting and replanting, exacerbating the shortage.Although the annual monsoon arrived early and advanced swiftly to cover the western state of Maharashtra ahead of schedule, this initial momentum soon waned, resulting in an 18% rainfall deficit so far this season. The weakened monsoon has delayed the planting of summer-sown crops, which rely on sufficient rainfall. Despite June's patchy rains, India's weather office has forecast above-average rainfall for the rest of the monsoon season, providing some hope for agricultural output.Vegetable prices are expected to fall from August onwards if the monsoon revives and covers the entire country as per the usual schedule. However, potential floods or a prolonged dry spell in July and August could disrupt the production cycle. Prices of milk, cereals, and pulses are unlikely to decrease soon due to tight supplies. Wheat supplies are dwindling, with no plans from the government to import grain, which will likely allow wheat prices to rise further. Rice prices may also increase as the government has raised the minimum support price of paddy rice by 5.4%.Government interventions, such as restricting exports and easing imports, can help bring down the prices of some food commodities. However, ""the government can do little when it comes to prices of vegetables, which are highly perishable and difficult to import."" While measures like restricting exports of sugar, rice, onions, and wheat have been implemented, these have proved unpopular among farmers and have led to electoral losses for the ruling party in rural areas. With state elections approaching in key agricultural states, the central government may allow some crop prices to rise instead of taking aggressive measures.Retail inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has been gradually easing, reaching a 12-month low of 4.8% in May 2024. However, ""this positive trend faces potential reversals due to persistent food price pressures,"" especially in vegetables and pulses, with overall food inflation remaining steady at 7.9%. The central bank has consistently cautioned about volatile food prices, which are particularly affected by weather-related shocks like the recent heat wave. These fluctuations have kept food inflation elevated, complicating the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) goal of maintaining inflation at its 4% target.Economic outlook and monetary policy implicationsDue to stubborn food price pressures, the RBI has maintained its policy rate at 6.5%, emphasizing a focus on withdrawing accommodation to align inflation with its target while supporting growth. Prospects of interest rate cuts are on hold as the RBI evaluates inflationary pressures amid volatile weather conditions. Despite these challenges, India's real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2024-25 is largely maintaining momentum, with global economic growth prompting many central banks worldwide to adopt a less restrictive monetary policy stance.","Food inflation in India has remained persistently high at around 8% year-on-year since November 2023.

The stock rose as much as 5% on Tuesday, set to snap a three-day rout that had pushed it into a technical correction - when a stock drops 10% or more from a recent peak - for the first time since April.While the rout displayed some concerning signals, analysts are focusing on the stock's longer-term trend.""This is just how Nvidia trades,"" an analyst said.Among Nvidia selloffs of this scale, the stock tends to rebound on the fourth day - which would be today - about 63% of the time, according to Daniel O'Regan, MD of equity trading at Mizuho Securities.While technical analysis for insight in historic trading patterns isn't precise, it can provide a useful road map for investors.Nvidia has soared this year amid unrelenting demand for its chips that dominate the market for artificial intelligence computing. The latest leg of the advance saw the stock rise 43% from its May 22 earnings report and stock split announcement to the June 18 peak when it closed with a market value of $3.34 trillion, topping Microsoft. Nvidia is still up 144% this year.High options activity was often cited as one of the main reasons for the stock's climb: market makers in the contracts had to constantly hedge their positions by trading the stock as it moved higher in what is called a gamma squeeze. That pressure may be easing following the correction.Buff Dormeier, chief technical analyst at Kingsview Partners, sees short-term support around the $115 level. That's near a key Fibonacci retracement level, a tool used by technical analysts to identify support or resistance lines for stocks and other assets. The 38.2% retracement from the stock's intraday low in April to its record high last week is about 2% below Monday's closing price.Analysts such as Dormeier believe the long-term uptrend remains intact for Nvidia, but they're keeping an eye on the $100 level.""For a stock in an uptrend like Nvidia, breaching that first level of support wouldn't be a concern,"" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Granite Wealth Management. A drop below $100, however, would be, he said.""That may not have long-term implications, but it would signal that you should be patient, especially in a period where the market is likely to be volatile and have a downward bias as we await the election and the Fed weighing in on rates.""","N Nvidia shares rose as much as 5% on Tuesday, set to snap a three-day rout that had pushed it into a technical correction.

The incidence of borrowing increased when treatment costs exceeded Rs 1 lakh, with the trend being more pronounced in smaller towns.""The study reiterates the importance of increasing the proportion of cashless claims in line with Irdai's recent initiatives... It is also critical to note that approximately 70% of respondents said that they would have either needed financial assistance or drawn upon their investments if cashless claims had not been available,"" said PolicyBazaar CEO Sarbvir Singh.While cashless treatment is the preferred option among policyholders, many are unable to access the same with their chosen healthcare providers. Even after increased insurance coverage, about 47% of health costs in India are still paid out-of-pocket - significantly higher than the global average of 18%.The survey also found that 89% of respondents who received cashless claims were satisfied, compared to 79% of those who received reimbursements. Dissatisfaction was higher among reimbursement claimants (12%) than cashless claimants (4%).Moreover, the average wait time for approval after doctor discharge in the cashless category was 3.8 hours, but 6% of claimants were dissatisfied due to the wait time exceeding 8.5 hours. Under new health insurance guidelines, insurers must clear applications for cashless treatment within one hour and settle claims for discharge within three hours. A key reason for delays in settlement after the discharge was insurers calling for supplementary information, leaving attendants to navigate the complexities of the process.The findings are part of a study based on a face-to-face survey of 2,128 insurance claimants conducted by PolicyBazaar, aiming to assess policyholders' satisfaction with the claim process.Of the total claimants, 94% had their claims approved, with a higher approval rate of 97% for those who had purchased policies online. Overall, 86% of claimants expressed satisfaction with the process. Among the 6% of claims that were rejected, half of them were due to non-disclosure of pre-existing or uncovered diseases, often attributed to a lack of awareness. The integration of online platforms has reduced the rejection rate from an average of 6% to 2.5%.The survey also revealed the highest average claim size is in the South at a little over Rs 2 lakh, surpassing the metro average of Rs 1.6 lakh.

"Moving towards 8% growth, RBI to focus on inflation: RBI governor Das",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/moving-towards-8-growth-rbi-to-focus-on-inflation-rbi-governor-das/articleshow/111268699.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that the country is at the threshold of a major structural shift in its growth trajectory and is moving towards an annual growth of 8% in a sustained manner. He said that such a growth outlook gives RBI the space to 'single-mindedly and unambiguously' focus on inflation .While Das's economic outlook is the most optimistic it has been in recent years, the message - coming on the back of a cautionary observation on credit growth outpacing deposits - rules out any near-term interest rate reduction.Das also said that the central bank's nowcasting team is projecting that growth in Q1FY25 could be higher than the 7.3% projected by the monetary policy committee. Supporting the higher growth forecast was the continuation of the Q4FY24 growth momentum in Q1FY25, a pick up in rural consumption, favourable monsoon and a rise in external demand.On inflation, Das said that after spiking in the wake of the Ukraine war, inflation in India has improved from 7.8% in April 2022 to 4.7% in May this year, thanks to measures taken by RBI and govt. He said maintaining a 4% inflation target is crucial as this level supports a healthier economy and financial system.""But inflation is moderating at a slow pace. We are still at 4.7%, within striking distance of 5%. One severe weather event and vegetable prices may go up and we will be at 5%. So, we must navigate our path towards the 4% inflation target with clear and unambiguous focus and commitment to bring down the inflation to 4%. There cannot be any wavering; there cannot be any distractions at this stage,"" said Das.Das likened RBI's current inflation battle to a game of chess in which there can be no wrong moves. ""In cricket, you play one shot very badly, but you can play the next shot very well. But chess is one game where if you make one wrong move, you can lose the game. It is like that in the battle against inflation. We cannot afford to make any wrong move,"" said Das.Pointing out the 8.3% average growth in the last three financial years, Das said that last year, India contributed 18.5% to global growth, with the IMF projecting a further increase. He said that the growth was driven by structural reform, which included GST, bankruptcy laws, and a flexible inflation-targeting regime under the RBI's monetary policy.Das expressed confidence about achieving 7.2% growth this year despite facing risks such as weather events, geopolitical conflicts, global trade fragmentation, and financial sector volatility. On the positive side, global growth is improving, with the IMF projecting a 3.2% increase for this year and the next. On the debate over which sector should drive growth, Das said that India's growth story must be multi-sectoral, driven by manufacturing, services, agriculture, and exports. ""As a large economy, it cannot rely on a single sector for growth. The growth story has to be sustained by multiple sectors,"" said Das.",RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said the country is at the threshold of a major structural shift in its growth trajectory.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107371891,imgsize-720422,width-400,resizemode-4/107371891.jpg"
What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

There is no space to drain the water from the roof.""He added that it would become difficult to offer prayers at the roof if there is heavy rainfall.Sri Ram Mandir Construction Committee chairman, Nripendra Mishra said: ""I am in Ayodhya. I saw the rainwater dropping from the first floor. This is expected because Guru Mandap is exposed to the sky as the second floor and completion of Shikhar will cover this opening.""""I also saw some seepage from the conduit as this work on the first floor is in progress. On completion, the conduit will be closed. There is no drainage in the Sanctum Santorum because all the Mandaps have measured slope for clearance of water and the water in Sanctum Santorum is manually absorbed,"" he added.""Moreover, the devotees are not performing Abhishek on the deity. There is no design or construction issue. The Mandaps which are open may get rainwater drops which was debated but the decision was to keep them open as per Nagar architectural norms.,"" he added.","Head priest Acharya Satyendra Das on Monday said the temple's roof has started leaking after the city witnessed heavy rainfall. He added that there is no proper way to drain it. Construction panel chief Nripendra Mishra said: ""I am in Ayodhya. I saw the rainwater dropping from the first floor""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111236626,imgsize-114846,width-400,resizemode-4/111236626.jpg"

"French snap elections spark investor worries, Paris stock market head says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/french-snap-elections-spark-investor-worries-paris-stock-market-head-says/articleshow/111251052.cms,"Civil war

The prospect of a politically extreme party with little or no government experience reaching power after France's parliamentary elections is worrying investors, the chief executive of Paris stock market operator Euronext said on Tuesday.The far-right National Rally (RN) party looks set to win the most votes in snap parliamentary elections coming up on June 30 and July 7 and could form France's next government, with a left-wing coalition called New Popular Front forecast to come in second.""If a team that has never governed comes to power, there is total uncertainty, a complete unknown"", Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah told France Inter radio, adding:""There is also a lot of concern about other things that are not economic, for example about what is happening to the unity of French society and the risks that this unity, which could be damaged, could have an impact on business.""President Emmanuel Macron 's surprise call for snap elections earlier this month triggered a heavy selloff of French stocks and bonds.France's economic model made the country vulnerable if interest rates attached to its sovereign and corporate bonds shoot up, said Boujnah, whose company also runs stockmarkets in other European hubs including Amsterdam and Milan.""To continue to finance a system in which 58% of what we create is injected into public spending, we have to borrow heavily from the rest of the world. And we need the rest of the world to give us loans,"" he said.Investors and ratings agencies have raised concern about RN's policies such as a pledge to cut value-added tax on energy from 20% to 5.5%. Standard & Poor's said this could weigh further on France's rating after it downgraded the country last month.Seeking to cast his centrist camp as the last hope for stability, Macron said in a podcast released on Monday that both the RN party and the New Popular Front risked bringing ""civil war"" to France.RN leader Le Pen on Tuesday rebuffed these allegations.""I think the French have realised that the chaos is him (Macron), he has embodied chaos since he was first elected"", she told RTL radio.",Far-right National Rally (RN) party looks set to win the most votes in snap parliamentary elections coming up on June 30 and July 7.

According to a research report from a prominent stock exchange bank, the total market capitalisation of the major US-based Bitcoin mining companies recently reached a new all-time high, suggesting growing investor interest and capital inflows in the Bitcoin mining sector.Meanwhile, investors continue to express bullish sentiments about an emerging meme cryptocurrency called Raboo ($RABT) as it keeps edging closer towards a notable presale milestone, which is raising $2 million from the sale of its native tokens. Here’s more about investors' interest in the mining companies as well as the force driving the new presale crypto toward incredible heights.Following the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, the market capitalisation of major US Bitcoin mining companies has been increasing. The increase persisted till June 15th, when the total market capitalisation of the mining companies reached a new all-time high of $22.8 billionInterestingly, analysts claim the growth of Bitcoin mining companies outperformed BTC’s price growth, hinting at investors’ belief that investing in the mining sector could be more profitable than holding BTC.Although Bitcoin's price is currently at $64,700, it has been down 2.7% over the past week. Amid the notable achievements of its mining companies, experts remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency, believing that its downtrend may not persist long-term.Investors are continually captivated by this promising meme coin project called Raboo, which keeps displaying remarkable growth by raising over $1.8 million from the sale of its presale tokens. As a project that allows its investors to earn passive income by simply posting quality memes on social media, Raboo has positioned itself not only for more milestones but also to become one of the most desirable presale tokens in the meme coin space.One of the factors that has attracted investors to Raboo is its strategic token burn mechanism, which aims to maintain token scarcity by constantly removing tokens from circulation so that the value of $RABT can easily increase. Remarkably, Raboo also plans to implement a zero buy-and-sell tax structure, an innovative approach that ensures smooth and frictionless transactions, allowing investors to maximise their returns without the burden of excessive fees.Raboo currently sells its presale tokens at just $0.0048 in Stage 4 of the presale; numerous investors are buying into this new meme coin sensation. This is because the token also boasts of a potential surge in demand and value that could potentially reach 100-fold after it enters the market.The total market capitalization of the US based Bitcoin mining companies reaching a new all-time high, implies that more people now prefer mining Bitcoin than just holding its tokens.Meanwhile, Raboo is expected to attract more investors to take part in its presale especially when it reaches the $2 million milestone. The platform's strategic token burn mechanism and plans for a zero buy-and-sell tax structure is also expected to heightened its appeal, making it a presale crypto with further upside potential.Telegram channel: Telegram: https://t.me/RabootokenPortal Twitter handle: Twitter: https://twitter.com/Raboo_Official",Raboo ($RABT) is raising $2 million from the sale of its native tokens.
