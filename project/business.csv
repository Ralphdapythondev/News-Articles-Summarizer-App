"Asked to quit, Paytm employees cry foul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/asked-to-quit-paytm-employees-cry-foul/articleshow/110979880.cms,"MUMBAI: ""I started crying at the meeting. I told them that I was willing to work even at a lower salary and designation,"" said a Paytm employee who is staring at an imminent job cut . Executives from the HR department reached out to him over a call late last month, stating that his role would be eliminated as part of an organisational restructuring and asking him to tender his resignation by early June.Facing an uncertain future in the wake of RBI's decision to put an end to Paytm Payments Bank and the wallet business, scores of employees are being asked to ""voluntarily resign"" without being given any prior notice, several have been denied severance pay and many are being asked to pay back their joining and retention bonuses to the company, several former and present employees of Paytm told TOI.The fintech has not furnished any formal communication outlining the restructuring process and the resultant job losses to any of the impacted employees and has warned them against recording any of the HR meetings. ""The calls with HRs are being labelled as 'connect' or 'discussion'. There is no formal documentation of any kind,"" an employee alleged.A review of a few of Paytm's offer letters showed that the amount of joining and retention bonuses will be ""recoverable"" by the company if they ""leave the employment"" before 18 months of taking up the role. In some cases, the same clause applies in cases of termination ""for any cause"" as well.For those whose offers letters do not include the termination clause, Paytm's justification is that it is mentioned in their appointment letters which were provided after joining. Employees said that many of them did not receive any appointment letters either via mails or postal deliveries and those who did were never asked to sign the papers and acknowledge.Some of the employees TOI spoke with alleged that their offer letters do not mention pay back of bonuses in case of termination.Paytm has refuted the allegations. ""We strongly deny allegations pertaining to any forced action on employees or unfair treatment. We have rigorously ensured that our HR teams have informed employees about their termination through official channels only. Further, we would also emphasise that all transitions are duly undertaken as per norms laid out in the appointment letter of these employees. To help them adjust and plan their next move, we are honouring full notice periods of these employees while also extending additional support such as outplacement, and processing of due bonuses at the time of their full and final settlements. Our focus remains on building a leaner organisation that is well-positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value to our stakeholders. We remain committed to supporting our employees during this transition,"" a company spokesperson said in response to queries from TOI.A former employee whose services were recently terminated by the company because he refused to resign said Paytm did not furnish an experience letter.While several employees voluntarily resigned over the past few months, fearing the repercussions of being served with a termination notice, a section of employees are waging a silent battle - they have refused to resign, raised concerns with Paytm's internal employee escalation team and are seeking a ""fair exit process"".The impacted employees have also formed a social media group to deliberate and decide on the next course of action. Some of them are consulting lawyers with at least one employee having already filed a complaint with the labour ministry.If an employee raises a complaint with Paytm's employee escalation team, the company is supposed to investigate the matter and present a report to the employee. An affected employee with the lending team is still awaiting a report to the complaint raised.""Just two months ago, (founder) Vijay Shekhar Sharma in a townhall had said that no one from the lending team will be laid off. I thought my job was safe,"" the person said.Some employees said that layoffs have been happening since Oct ""I was abruptly laid off on Jan 5. My finances were strained and I had to take a loan to pay back my bonus of Rs 2 lakh,"" alleged former staffer Prakher Srivastava.","Employees say they have been asked to ""voluntarily resign"" without being given any prior notice. Many have been denied severance pay and many are being asked to pay back their joining and retention bonuses to the company, several former and present employees of Paytm told TOI. The fintech has not furnished any formal communication outlining the restructuring process.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110984169,imgsize-1139604,width-400,resizemode-4/110984169.jpg"

"Adani buys Penna Cement from Reddys in Rs 10,000 crore deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-buys-penna-cement-from-reddys-in-rs-10000-crore-deal/articleshow/110979861.cms,"MUMBAI: The Gautam Adani family owned Ambuja Cements is buying Penna Cement Industries in a deal valued at Rs 10,442 crore including debt, expanding its presence in the south. The transaction marks Ambuja's fourth M&A after Adani checked into the sector through the former in Sept 2022.Hyderabad-based Penna, promoted by P Prathap Reddy and family, has an annual production capacity of 14 million tons (of which 4 million tons is under construction). It also has limestone reserves and captive power plants.The Penna acquisition, to be financed by internal accruals, will improve Ambuja's share by 8% in south India and comes months after market leader UltraTech Cement ramped up its play in the region by buying Kesoram Industries' building materials units. As of April end, Ambuja had cash of Rs 24,338 crore on its books, having received warrant money of Rs 8,339 crore from the Adani family.The Penna transaction will help Ambuja and its arms, including ACC and Sanghi Industries, beef up capacity to 89 million tons, moving towards its larger goal of 140 million tons by 2028. UltraTech, owned by Kumar Mangalam Birla, has a capacity of over 150 million tons. In April, India's third-largest player Shree Cement, led by Hari Mohan Bangur, inaugurated a 3-million-ton plant in Andhra Pradesh to bolster its capacity to 56 million tons.Ambuja previously acquired Gujarat-based Sanghi, My Home's cement unit in Tamil Nadu and Asian Concretes and Cements' plants in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.Prathap Reddy had earlier looked at an IPO for his cement business but subsequently changed plans. In Oct 2021, Penna received markets regulator Sebi's nod for a Rs 1,550-crore IPO but did not proceed with it. ""Initially we thought (of an IPO) but it got delayed. I have decided to do (away) with (the cement business),"" Reddy told TOI.The businessman, known as 'Penna' Reddy in Hyderabad circles, was considered a confidant of former Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's father YS Rajasekhara Reddy, the unified Andhra Pradesh CM who died in a chopper crash in Sept 2009. Reddy was made an accused in the Penna chargesheet in the Jagan disproportionate assets case that is being probed by CBI and ED. Jagan's YSR Congress Party lost the recent Andhra assembly polls to Nara Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party.Incorporated in Oct 1991, Penna had a turnover of Rs 1,241 crore in FY24. In FY22, its turnover was Rs 3,204 crore. In May 2019, Penna had acquired Sri Lanka-based Singha Cement that operates a 0.5 mtpa cement packing terminal in Colombo.Penna's seven plants in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan (under construction) and limestone reserves ""provide an opportunity to increase cement capacity through debottlenecking and additional investment"", said Ambuja Cements CEO Ajay Kapur . ""Importantly, the bulk cement terminals will prove to be a game-changer by giving access to the eastern and southern parts of peninsular India, apart from an entry to Sri Lanka, through the sea route,"" Kapur added.","Ambuja Cements is buying Penna Cement Industries in a deal valued at Rs 10,442 crore including debt.

"Market crash worse than the 2008 recession, warns Economist Harry Dent",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-crash-worse-than-the-2008-recession-warns-economist-harvey-dent/articleshow/110947932.cms,"NEW DELHI: Financial author and economist predicted another "" crash of a lifetime ,"" which could be worse than the 2008 crash. In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Dent warned that the ""everything"" bubble has not yet burst, and the resulting crash could be more severe than the Great Recession.Dent highlighted the unique nature of the current situation, stating, ""In 1925 to '29, it was a natural bubble. There was no stimulus behind that, artificial stimulus per se. So this is new. This has never happened."" He likened the government's response to attempting to cure a hangover by drinking more alcohol. Dent suggested that the long-term effects of continuously pumping money into the economy remain to be seen, but he expects a larger crash than the one experienced in 2008-2009 due to the prolonged duration of the current bubble.Despite the strong performance of US stocks in May, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones all posting gains, Dent predicts significant decline. ""I think we're going to see the S&P go down 86% from the top, and the Nasdaq 92%. A hero stock like Nvidia, as good as it is, and it is a great company, [goes] down 98%. Boy, this is over,"" said the economist.Dent has slightly adjusted the timing of his prediction, now expecting market bottoms to occur between early and mid-2025. He identifies the real estate market as the epicenter of the bubble, claiming that US homes have already increased in value by double or more than their future worth. Dent points to the widespread ownership of homes and the prevalence of speculative second and third home purchases as contributing factors.In response to critics who label his hypotheses as ""crazy"" or accuse him of fearmongering, Dent said ""I just say what I see and, frankly, don't give a damn if people don't like it, because you [have] got to choose: are you going to tell the truth, or are you going to make people happy?"" He rejects the ""perma-bear"" label, arguing that his predictions are based on historical analysis and the unprecedented power of central banks to create money out of thin air.Dent advises investors to seek safety in the most secure bonds, emphasizing the United States' position as the world's largest economy and its ability to endure the anticipated downturn. He expects the upcoming crash to be more severe than the one experienced in 2009, as the previous crash was mitigated by stimulus measures. Dent believes this crash will purge excess from the markets, allowing the millennial generation to benefit from a healthier boom in the future.","Financial author and economist predicted another "" crash of a lifetime,"" which could be worse than the 2008 crash.

"Bangladesh military unhappy with weapons imported from China; complains of ‘sub-standard’, faulty parts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bangladesh-military-unhappy-with-weapons-imported-from-china-complains-of-sub-standard-faulty-parts/articleshow/110961484.cms,"Bangladesh, a long-time purchaser of Chinese military equipment , has lodged complaints with Beijing regarding the supply of defective components and technical issues with its imported military hardware . Bangladesh is not alone in facing problems with Chinese military hardware. Other countries, such as Myanmar, have also faced issues with Chinese fighter jets, according to an ET report.Experts on the Chinese defense industry argue that Beijing lacks the necessary expertise to produce highly sophisticated military hardware and is not yet considered a top-class manufacturer of modern defense equipment. They allege that most of the weapons sold by China are based on outdated technology that it had copied from the West.Developing countries frequently purchase Chinese weapons due to their lower cost compared to similar systems from the West. China sells arms through state-run export organizations like the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), NORINCO, and CVIC.Sources familiar with the matter told ET, the Bangladesh military has recently accused Chinese companies of providing faulty spare parts for its corvettes, petrol crafts, and onshore patrol vehicles. These vessels were found to have manufacturing defects and technical problems.Also Read | India’s Defence Preparedness: From Agni-V MIRV missile test to 5th generation fighter aircraft, Su-30MKI upgrade & Tejas - top developments In a separate incident, the Bangladesh Air Force reported technical issues with Chinese-made F-7 fighter jets and short-range air defense systems. The air force also encountered problems with firing ammunition for its Chinese-made K-8W aircraft shortly after delivery.Sources indicated that Chinese-supplied airborne interception radars and radars on Bangladesh's fighter aircraft have failed to meet accuracy standards.The Bangladesh Army had purchased Main Battle Tanks (MBT 2000) from China's North Industries Corporation (NORINCO). However, NORINCO is reportedly facing difficulties in supplying parts to Bangladesh for the repair and maintenance of these tanks.The Bangladesh Navy has also faced challenges with two Chinese-made frigates (BNS Umar Farooq and BNS Abu Ubaidah) experiencing multiple defects soon after arriving at Mongla port in Bangladesh. The Chinese companies demanded additional payments to repair these boats.Also Read | Modi 3.0 must bite the bullet to make military future-ready A decade ago, China sold two refurbished Ming-class submarines to Bangladesh for just over $100 million each, but Dhaka later discovered that the submarines were obsolete.In September of last year, the Bangladesh Navy informed China Vanguard Industry Co. Ltd. (CVIC) of issues with the C704 system installed on warship 'BNS Nirmul', but the company only agreed to upgrade the system at an additional cost.Bangladesh had also purchased 45 Multi Launch Rocket System (MLRS) units from China but is now planning to replace 36 of them with Turkish-made MLRS.","Bangladesh has lodged complaints with Beijing regarding the supply of defective components and technical issues with its imported military hardware.

Snowflake’s taking AI to where data resides: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/snowflakes-taking-ai-to-where-data-resides-ceo/articleshow/110955730.cms,"It has been about four years since Snowflake entered the Indian market. How has the journey been so far?

How has the rise of GenAI impacted cloud-based data storage and analytics service businesses?

You have just announced Snowflake Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search…

Where else do you see Gen AI having an impact?

You say that Snowflake LLM Arctic with its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture allows AI models to be built faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. How does it do this?

How do you see the adoption of Gen AI-based products in enterprises?

SAN FRANCISCO: “We receive five billion queries on our Data Cloud every day,” says Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake, the cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions. The number is significant, considering Google receives an average of 8.5 billion search requests every day. Ramaswamy was speaking at the firm’s ‘Snowflake Summit 2024’ in San Francisco earlier this week, where the company announced a slew of new technologies that “take AI to where data resides”. The company also announced a tie up with Nvidia that will allow Snowflake customers and partners to build AI-powered applications. Ramaswamy, an IIT Madras alumnus who was in Google for over 15 years and who was appointed CEO of Snowflake in Feb, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the summit. Excerpts:Snowflake operates in two buckets in India. One is with India-based customers like Swiggy, Urban Company, and Piramal Capital, so they can unlock the full value of their data. The second pertains to the trend of American companies moving their core infrastructure to India. We are investing heavily in having a presence in India, in training more people on Snowflake. Companies like Morgan Stanley, for example, have their very senior staff in India taking care of data operations using Snowflake. We have close to 500 people in our Pune centre of excellence, and a lot more expansion is to come.Generative AI is going to have an impact from bottom to top in the stack. For example, there’s a Snowflake feature that transcribes videos, and after indexing the text, you can create a chatbot based on it. And the thing that people are most excited about is that instead of getting a bunch of links, you get answers. We also help them get grounded, cited answers, so that they know where the answers are coming from. Our value prop at Snowflake is to create a single unified product, where things like AI are tightly integrated, and we see ourselves as more an AI Data Cloud.Cortex Analyst is a bit of a North Star for the business analytics area — it will let a business user talk to their data and get answers back. If a business user asks an unreasonable question, the product will say ‘no’. As soon as you give people a chatbot, they start asking ridiculous things like ‘what is my revenue going to be 15 years from now’. A piece of SQL is certainly not going to give you that information. I generally see AI as an enhancer for data access and visualisation. Cortex Analyst is all about asking natural language questions of structured data. Cortex Search is about getting documents indexed so that you can create a chatbot very easily.In cleaning data, for instance. Data has always been messy. There’s no magic wand making sure that you have clean data. For example, think about all the documents that you have consumed. Whenever you search, for example, you are going to run into outdated documents. Making sure that these are marked as outdated or updated will be an ongoing event. We see language models helping with several of these problems. Companies currently spend millions of dollars every year just on data engineering – for cleaning up data, and getting it into a good place.Just like standard AI models, MoE is a stack of parameters, one on top of each other. There are often 24 to 32 layers of neurons that are different kinds of behaviour and connections. In dense models like GPT-3, when a new token (unit of input like a word, an image, etc) comes in for training, it ends up affecting every parameter (GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters) at every layer. For instance, you take a sentence, mask a word in it, and ask the model to predict the word by feeding this sentence in. In the process, every token ends up affecting all parameters and this just makes it computationally expensive to update the model to train on a large amount of data. With MoE, you do an arbitrary subdivision of the token space and, during training, you will have portions of the neural network that get activated for different buckets of tokens (instead of having to impact all the parameters). So, you end up constructing models that are a combination of dense networks that are activated for every token, and sparse experts that are activated only partially. Now, this process can end up producing models that are almost as good as the dense models, but for a smaller amount of compute. And, you can train models faster and more efficiently.Canva, Zoom and Bayer and many others are harnessing Cortex AI to create applications and drive productivity. We have several hundred others building applications to talk to their enterprise data with natural language for business-critical decision making.","Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions.

The study measures efficiency by assessing how well banks utilise resources to generate output at an optimal scale.

In the relative performance of individual banks over the full sample period from FY06-23, SBI leads among public sector banks with a score of nearly 98%, followed by Union Bank of India at 92.5%. In the private sector, HDFC Bank tops the list with a score of nearly 98%, followed by Axis Bank at 94.4%.

PSBs have generally been more efficient than private banks except during FY19-23, likely due to mergers and rationalisation of business, branches, and employees, the study showed.

The demand for lower duty on hybrids is being raised by top Japanese companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Toyota and Honda, which argue that the technology helps reduce emissions while boosting fuel efficiency.

In the documents filed with Sebi for its maiden IPO, Hyundai said, ""... with the objective to address climate issues, govt of India proposes to reduce GST on hybrid passenger vehicles to 5% and 12% on flex engines, while the GST on diesel and petrol vehicles is proposed to remain at 28%... In the event such amendment becomes effective, it could have an adverse impact on the sales volumes of our diesel and petrol vehicles which could affect our margins, business, and results of operations.""

Tata Motors and Mahindra have already been opposing any special benefits for hybrids. The two companies have said only electrics should get the special 5% GST rate, emphasising that only ""zero emission vehicles"" should get benefits and not those that offer only ""fuel efficiency improvement technologies"".

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

India’s stock value tops $5 trillion as Modi’s win powers rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-stock-value-tops-5-trillion-as-modis-win-powers-rally/articleshow/111071763.cms,"India’s stock market value exceeded $5 trillion for the first time, with the latest boost coming from a commitment by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s new coalition for policy continuity in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.The country’s equity market has joined the ranks of the US, China, Japan and Hong Kong after topping the threshold last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It took India about six months to add the latest $1 trillion to the capitalization of companies listed on its exchanges.Indian stocks have been scaling new peaks since the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party secured sufficient support from key allies to form a coalition government , ensuring Modi’s return to power for a third straight term. The victory, alongside robust economic growth and a recent upgrade of India’s ratings outlook by S&P Global Ratings, are combining to burnish India’s appeal for global investors.The formation of the new government with most key ministers retaining their portfolios “broadly affirms policy continuity,” according to Goldman Sachs strategist Sunil Koul. India remains a market with exceptionally stable macroeconomics and earnings growth is expected to continue, driving stocks higher, Koul said in a Bloomberg Television interview last week.A distinctive feature of gains in recent years has been the extent to which millions of young Indians have taken to equity investments.

Gig workforce: Why freelance techies are in demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-freelance-techies-are-in-demand/articleshow/111067151.cms,"BENGALURU: The gig workforce is emerging as one of the levers for enterprises to bridge the tech talent demand-supply gap. Gig workers get paid from $5 per hour for basic work, while mid-level prompt engineers, prompt engineering specialists, and senior AI engineers can make from $15 to $400 per hour, respectively, depending on the complexity of the programmes.Covid has transformed the talent landscape, and enabled firms to tap into the gig talent pool. Hiring gig workers provides access to a larger talent base, while saving on additional recruiting costs. Anshuman Chaubey, a freelance techie with five years of experience, exemplifies this trend. He began taking up gig roles after completing internship at an MNC and now has a team of four developers assisting him with the increased workload.Job portal foundit.com reports that IT-related gig work makes up 30% of the job market, up from 12% at the end of March. Software development, data analytics and UI/UI design are the most sought-after skills in the gig space.According to a Nasscom Aon report , India's tech gig workforce is projected to reach 23.5 million by 2030 - up from 7 million in 2021. This means gig workers will constitute 4.1% of the total workforce in India by fiscal 2030, compared to 1.5% in FY22.Manpower Group, an HR solutions firm, has observed a 10% increase in demand for IT gig work compared to the previous year. Sanju Ballurkar, president of Experis, a subsidiary of Manpower Group specialising in tech staffing, said, ""Gig is becoming accepted from a customer's perspective as it is a more efficient way for non-tech companies to get tech work done without investing in a full-fledged IT team.""Pharma companies, oil and gas firms, and tech firms are the primary users of gig workers for accelerating their tech road maps. Troogue.ai, a gig working platform, said 85% of the projects on their platform are outsourced by GCCs seeking gig workers or contractors. As companies aim to reduce costs, more opportunities for gig work are expected to emerge.Gig work is primarily available for those with specialised skills in cloud, data, and cybersecurity, where firms require expertise to work on hybrid cloud strategies bound by data governance and compliance frameworks.","IT-related gig work makes up 30% of the job market, up from 12% at the end of March.

"In a 1st, ARCs gain more from loan rejig than selloff in FY24",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/in-a-1st-arcs-gain-more-from-loan-rejig-than-selloff-in-fy24/articleshow/111067017.cms,"MUMBAI: For the first time ever, asset reconstruction companies saw the value of bad loan restructuring exceeding recovery through sale of non-performing assets in FY24. Traditionally, ARCs are seen as scrap dealers of the financial sector as they resort to salvaging value from banks' bad loans by selling them to the highest bidder. However, ARCs are now stepping into a role largely performed by lenders.In FY24, the amount of loan assets restructured by ARCs rose to Rs 7,948 crore from Rs 5,546 crore in the previous year - a 43% growth over the previous year - accounting for 25% of total resolutions. At the same time, ARCs obtained Rs 7,469 crore from asset sales , which decreased 13% year-on-year.""There is a perception that ARCs are more into asset sales than restructuring. This year, for a change, the amount of restructuring exceeds the recovery through asset sale,"" said Hari Hara Mishra, CEO, Association of Asset Reconstruction Companies.""In terms of resolution strategy, value maximisation is attained in restructuring, and hence, the focus will be on this, wherever possible, in units which have revival potential,"" he said.Loan restructuring involves modifying an existing loan's terms - such as extending the term, reducing the interest rate, or changing the repayment schedule - to help borrowers manage their repayments, requiring both financial analysis skills and industry knowledge. Restructuring is one of the four ways bad banks recover from bad loans. The other three are sale, liquidation, and one-time settlement, which formed the largest component of loan resolution by ARCs in FY24.According to the Association of Asset Reconstruction Companies, the book value of total assets acquired by ARCs rose 15% by Rs 1.2 lakh crore in FY24 to Rs 9.7 lakh crore. While the book value includes the total claims of the lenders, the realisable value is reflected in the value of security receipts - which are instruments used by ARCs to package and sell the bad loans they have acquired to investors to generate liquidity. The number of security receipts issued by ARCs rose 15% to Rs 2.8 lakh crore, Rs 1.5 lakh crore of which are currently outstanding. According to bankers, the new expected credit loss provisioning incentivises them to have squeaky clean asset quality. This is because they have to start making hefty provisions at the first sign of distress. This gives an opportunity for ARCs to step in as they provide more flexible repayment options that bankers cannot.","For the first time ever, asset reconstruction companies saw the value of bad loan restructuring exceeding recovery through sale of non-performing assets in FY24.

Tit-for-tat: China opens anti-dumping probe into European pork,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tit-for-tat-china-opens-anti-dumping-probe-into-european-pork/articleshow/111067318.cms,"NEW DELHI: On Monday, China's commerce ministry announced the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation into imported pork and its by-products from the European Union, with a focus on Spain , the Netherlands, and Denmark. This move appears to be a response to the European Commission's decision to impose anti-subsidy duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese cars starting from July.The investigation, which will commence on June 17, was triggered by a complaint filed by the China Animal Husbandry Association on behalf of the domestic pork industry. The probe will cover pork intended for human consumption, including fresh, cold, and frozen whole cuts, as well as pig intestines, bladders, and stomachs. Global food companies are now on high alert for potential retaliatory tariffs from China.Spain, the top supplier of pork to China, has stated through its pork producers group Interporc that they will fully cooperate with the investigation. ""The EU and China have plenty of time to reach agreements,"" Interporc said in a statement. European pork producers are expected to continue exporting to China tariff-free during the investigation, pending a decision and tariff announcement by the Chinese authorities.The Chinese commerce ministry has set a deadline of June 17, 2025, for the completion of the investigation, with a possible six-month extension if necessary. The Danish Agriculture & Food Council has warned that the country's pork sector would be ""hit incredibly hard"" by any restrictions on sales to China. Pork suppliers from South America, the United States, and Russia could potentially gain market share if Beijing decides to restrict imports from the European Union.The European Commission has expressed confidence in the face of China's investigation, with a spokesperson stating that the EU would intervene appropriately to ensure the investigation complies with all relevant World Trade Organisation rules. The EU accounts for more than half of the approximately $6 billion worth of pork China imported in 2023, with Spain, the Netherlands, and Denmark being the top three suppliers.The growing concern over Chinese industrial overcapacity flooding the EU with cheap products, including electric vehicles, is opening a new front in the West's trade war with Beijing. The EU's trade policy is becoming increasingly protective against the global ramifications of China's production-focused, debt-driven development model. Governments typically impose anti-dumping duties on imported goods when they suspect the item in question is being sold for less than its production cost, in order to protect domestic firms.","China's commerce ministry announced the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation into imported pork and its by-products from the European Union.

"Institutional investors stock up on altcoins, fueling speculation of bull run",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/institutional-investors-stock-up-on-altcoins-fueling-speculation-of-bull-run-5-altcoins-set-to-moon/articleshow/111059765.cms,"Angry Pepe Fork ranks among top altcoins

Bullish momentum drops for the Ethereum price

Chainlink Price faces bearish pressure

Toncoin trading volume increases

Avalanche Price Prediction

Role of institutional investors

Institutional investors are finding altcoins as important assets to invest in while speculations about the impending bull run continue. Moreover, the cryptocurrency community is excited and anticipatory as institutional giants stock up on a wide variety of altcoins such as Ethereum , Chainlink, Toncoin, Avalanche, and Angry Pepe Fork, setting the stage for an explosive price increase.With its revolutionary Conquer To Earn model, Angry Pepe Fork (APORK) introduces a unique innovation by establishing a gamified staking system that rewards long-term network contributions and broad user engagement. Because it provides a variety of flexible staking options to suit different risk tolerance profiles, it turns ownership from a passive investment into an active value-generating process.Users can customise their involvement according to their desired APORK rewards by staking their tokens for 30, 60, or 90 days. With a current market value of only $0.014 in the first presale stage, the altcoin has a 100x growth potential because of the interest from institutional investors which will result in a price surge, making it an attractive opportunity for early investors to receive a high rate of return.Furthermore, with a 1.9 billion token supply cap, APORK enforces token scarcity in contrast to inflationary tokens. Combining this with the fact that APORK is built on the high-performance Solana blockchain, which enables quick and affordable transactions, makes it a competitive alternative to some other top altcoins that are purely speculative.Angry Pepe Fork is garnering a lot of investors’ attention because of its collective earning model, which gives all community members a piece in the project's success. Additionally, the project's limited token supply ensures its long-term viability and rewards early adopters and backers. Meanwhile, if you are a fan of Angry Pepe Frog or you missed out on the native Pepe coin, APORK will be of great interest to you.The cryptocurrency community is still waiting on S-1 approval to start tradingEthereum ETFs , even though the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a spot Ethereum ETF. Some remarks are now expected this week, according to a source who is in contact with the SEC. Analyst Nate Geraci stated in a post on X that the regulatory body will be providing comments to at least one of the multiple potential issuers who applied this week.Notably, spot Ethereum ETFs issuers had expected an update from the regulatory body regarding the status of their application ever since the May 31 deadline for submitting the first draft of S-1 registrations passed. Nothing concrete has emerged from the Gary Gensler-led commission thus far. Meanwhile, the bullish momentum on the Ethereum price has dropped as the altcoin is currently trading below $3,500 levels.Many altcoins were severely impacted by the altcoin depression, which struck in the worst circumstances to date. The majority of the most popular altcoins, including Chainlink, were trending upwards last week until the US labour reports were released on Friday. May brought more jobs than expected, and after the uptrend declined, the Chainlink coin owners sold off their holdings.Due to the sell-off, the Chainlink price is currently trading at a seven-day loss of 16%.

Increased liquidity: Large-volume trading by institutional investors can greatly boost liquidity in the altcoin market.

It alone spent $51.5 billion which is more than more than all other nuclear-armed countries combined.China and Russia followed as the next highest spenders, with $11.8 billion and $8.3 billion respectively.The report also highlighted a rise in Britain's nuclear weapons spending for the second consecutive year, with a 17 percent increase to $8.1 billion.""I think it is fair to say there is a nuclear arms race under way,"" ICAN chief Melissa Parke told AFP.Additionally, another report by The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) suggests that these nations are infusing more funds to modernize and deploy new weapons.It further reports that while the total estimated number of nuclear warheads worldwide slightly decreased to 12,121 from 12,512 at the beginning of this year from a year earlier, 9,585 were held in stockpiles for potential use, with 2,100 maintained in a state of ""high operational alert"" on ballistic missiles.The United States and Russia held nearly all of these warheads, but China was also believed to have some warheads on high alert for the first time.""While the global total of nuclear warheads continues to fall as Cold War-era weapons are gradually dismantled, regrettably we continue to see year-on-year increases in the number of operational nuclear warheads,"" said Sipri director Dan Smith.","World's nine nuclear-armed states collectively spent $91 billion on their arsenals last year, $10.8 billion more than the previous year.

"Despite Nike's exit, Russian retailers continue to sell Western brands via backdoor channels",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/despite-nikes-exit-russian-retailers-continue-to-sell-western-brands-via-backdoor-channels/articleshow/111036837.cms,"Following Nike 's decision to halt sales to Russia shortly after the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago, an online sports retailer owned by Russia's Zenit soccer club, footballstore.ru, continues to offer dozens of Nike-branded items, including the US sportswear maker 's Phantom GT2 Elite soccer boots for around $330.Wijnand Herinckx, a 40-year-old Dutch citizen residing in Moscow, has established a thriving business that supplies Russian consumers with Western goods from companies that have withdrawn from Russia. Herinckx said, ""Nike does not want their products to be shipped to Russia,"" but added, ""They are also not telling us not to do it.""According to a report from Reuters, both Nike and Lego informed that they have not authorized Herinckx's imports of their products to Russia. Reuters discovered that Herinckx's business obtains branded goods, including Nike and Lego, by using intermediaries with no apparent connection to Russia as buyers, then shipping the goods to Russia, often via Turkey, and finally delivering them to retailers in Russia.While Western governments' restrictions have primarily targeted industrial products that could be used to build weapons for Russia's war machine, companies like Herinckx's are indirectly supporting the Russian economy by providing consumers with access to foreign goods they have grown accustomed to since the collapse of communism. Customs data analysed by Reuters revealed that the value of Nike products imported to Russia plummeted 81% in 2022 to $21 million but rebounded in 2023 to at least $74 million.Legal specialists suggest that seeking recourse under Russian law would be challenging for Western brands, leaving few other legal options for enforcing intellectual property rights typically tied to the territory where the infringement occurred. The availability of Western brands allows Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""project a message that the war does not undermine the 'normal life' of the Russian middle class,"" according to Russian economist Sergei Guriev.","Wijnand Herinckx, a 40-year-old Dutch citizen residing in Moscow, has established a thriving business that supplies Russian consumers with Western goods from companies that have withdrawn from Russia.
