However, iPhone revenues experienced a decline, dropping to $45.96 billion from $51.33 billion in the quarter ending in March.The decrease in iPhone sales was attributed to a sales decline in Apple's Greater China region, which encompasses Mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

When will gold prices hit Rs 2 lakh mark? Here’s what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-will-gold-prices-hit-rs-2-lakh-mark-heres-what-experts-say/articleshow/109750709.cms,"Gold Prices Outlook:

Gold prices: What should investors do?

Gold has been a cherished asset for Indian households, consistently delivering impressive returns compared to other investment options. Even as gold prices touch new highs this year, one wonders when the yellow metal will hit levels of Rs 1 lakh, or even Rs 2 lakh? What does historical data on the movement of gold suggest and what should investors do?Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015.This follows a similar pattern observed in the previous 9-year period, when the price tripled from Rs 8,250 in 2006. Going back further, it took approximately 19 years for the gold price to triple from Rs 2,570 per 10 g in 1987, preceded by tripling cycles of around 8 years and 6 years, states an ET report by Naveen Kumar.If the price continues to triple from its current level, gold could surpass the Rs 2 lakh per 10 gram mark. However, investors are keen to know how long it will take for the price to reach this milestone. Here is what experts have to say on future returns and timeline for gold to hit the Rs 2 lakh level:Gold prices are sensitive to global events, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, which can cause rapid increases in relatively short periods. In the past 5 years, factors like rupee weakness, geopolitical issues, the pandemic, and war have contributed to a 75% increase in gold prices, from Rs 40,000 to over Rs 7,00,000, in just 3.3 years. In contrast, from 2014 to 2018, gold prices only increased by 12%, from Rs 28,000 to Rs 31,250.Also Read | Important updates for NPS subscribers: New charges and security measures announced by PFRDA Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities, states, ""Historical data shows that major global changes, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, can significantly influence gold prices, leading to rapid increases within relatively short periods. The recent past of 5 years has shown rupee weakness as well as geopolitical issues and pandemic and war. All these together have given gold a spurt from Rs 40,000 to Rs 7,00,00+ — a gain of 75% in a matter of 3.3 years. In 2014, gold price was Rs 28,000 and in 2018 it was Rs 31,250, which is only 12% in a matter of 5 years.""Trivedi also suggests that gold prices could potentially reach Rs 2 lakh within the next 7-12 years, given recent trends.Some experts, like Surendra Mehta, National Secretary of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, are even more optimistic about gold prices tripling and crossing Rs 2 lakh. Mehta believes that escalating geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel after Ramzan, as well as China-Taiwan tensions, could bring uncertainty and lead to de-dollarisation. He predicts that these factors, along with heavy paper trading of gold in SGE and Comex, could cause gold prices to triple within the next 6 years.However, it's important to note that the tripling period for gold prices can vary significantly. Vikram Dhawan, Fund Manager and Head - Commodities at Nippon India Mutual Fund, points out that there has been an instance where the tripling period extended to almost 19 years. Dhawan reminds us that gold, like any other asset, is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns.He states, ""Like any other asset, gold is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns. However, as long as there is no better alternative, gold will continue to be in great demand from consumers and investors alike, hopefully rising to meet their return expectations.""Also Read | New mutual fund KYC rules: Is your KYC validated, verified, registered or on hold? Find out Gold is widely regarded as one of the most effective hedges against inflation. According to Harsh Gahlaut, Co-founder and CEO of FinEdge, ""Gold price is directly correlated to inflation. Inflation has been high across geographies and will take time to cool off. As long as inflation remains high, gold prices will continue to get support and see an upward trend in the future.""The trajectory of inflation will also play a crucial role in determining the pace at which gold prices increase. Hareesh V, Head of Commodities at Geojit Financial Services, explains, ""Inflation and gold prices often have a complex relationship. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation because its value tends to hold relatively steady or even increase during times of inflation.""In addition to inflation, various other factors also contribute to the fluctuations in gold prices. Dhawan elaborates, ""When inflation rates rise, the purchasing power of fiat currencies decreases, leading investors to turn to gold as a store of value, thus driving up its price. This relationship is complex and not always direct, as other economic factors can also impact gold prices during periods of high inflation.""The availability of gold has remained consistent, and any sudden increase in demand has the potential to drive prices higher in the short term. ""The total supply of gold is limited, which is the one reason the metal is considered a valuable asset. The supply of gold comes from two main sources — mining and recycling. The amount of new gold mined each year is relatively stable. The rest of the demand is usually met by recycling scrap gold,"" says Hareesh.The growing demand from central banks is expected to persist and may contribute to rising prices. ""There has been large-scale buying from some large central banks as they are considerably increasing their gold holdings — like Russia, China, India, etc. Since the supply of gold is limited, this increase in sovereign treasury holdings will continue to put pressure on supply and will support gold prices. We do not see the supply-side pressure easing in the near future as the risk of geopolitical conflicts does not seem to be easing,"" says Gahlaut.Also Read | Using a credit card? From usage beyond limit to overlimit fees - top queries answered based on RBI’s new FAQs While jewellery has traditionally been a significant driver of demand, it may not continue to play the same role in the future. However, the demand for bullion is anticipated to increase. ""I can see that in a country like India, gold is converting its orbit from consumption item to investment item at a much faster pace. So, sale of jewellery will keep dropping with improved sale of bullion due to financialisation of gold,"" says Mehta.The shifting dynamics of the global landscape may have a lasting effect on the trajectory of gold prices. Dhawan suggests, ""A decline in the credit rating of the US, whether actual or perceived, may propel gold into a multi-decade bull run. Re-globalisation leading to competitive currency devaluations, along with trade disputes, is conducive for gold prices. On the positive side, bigger and wealthier emerging economies that have a cultural affinity towards gold, like India, may lead to a material increase in gold consumption, underpinning the prices.""If the present situations persist or intensify, gold prices are expected to surge even higher. Gahlaut states, ""Any escalation of regional or global conflicts, outright wars breaking out, and dollar domination coming under pressure as a global currency can lead to a spike in gold prices. While returns from gold are not linear, gold will continue to play an important role as a risk reduction tool and as a hedge against inflation.""The implementation of ESG regulations could potentially cause a significant decrease in the supply of gold. Dhawan explains, ""The strict adoption of environmental, social & governance (ESG) rules worldwide is a threat to gold production. This is because gold mines are among the most expensive and most toxic places.""When considering whether to link your investment strategy to the rapid tripling of gold prices, it's essential to approach the decision with caution. ""In conclusion, the trajectory of gold prices will be shaped by a combination of economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. While predicting exact price movements is challenging, the fundamental role of gold as a safe-haven asset suggests continued potential for growth in the future,"" says Trivedi.Incorporating gold into your investment portfolio can be a wise choice for diversification purposes. ""Diversifying investments and considering different assets, including gold, can help mitigate risks associated with inflation. During deflationary phases, gold tends to perform well compared to most asset classes,"" says Dhawan.Also Read | Mutual Fund KYC issues: What problems are MF investors facing with new rules and how they can check their KYC status However, it's crucial not to base your entire gold investment strategy solely on the expectation of its tripling potential. ""While it is impossible to predict how long gold will take to triple from the current level, it is important to note that as an asset class, gold plays a critical role as a hedge against inflation, volatility, geopolitical and currency risks and, therefore, will remain an important part of asset allocation in a person's portfolio,"" says Gahlaut.Investing in gold can be beneficial at any time when you are aiming to diversify your investment portfolio. Nevertheless, as the price of gold continues to rise, there may be opportunities to purchase gold during dips in the market. ""Higher prices may eventually lead to reactions from the supply side. However, as gold is under-owned and global gold ETF holdings are at a five-year low, pullbacks may bring in dip buying from investors. Moreover, central banks continue to be net buyers,"" says Dhawan.","Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015.

Instead, it is a formal request for the entities to provide an explanation as to why legal action, including financial penalties, should not be taken against them based on the findings of the investigation.Adani Ports and SEZ, in its disclosures, stated, ""The allegations are that the company has not obtained the requisite approvals, and have not made the required disclosure in the financial statements/ annual report.

We don't see much point in importing cars here. We want to continue our strategy to make cars in India, and our priority is not to import electric cars,"" Koskas said. The EV policy promises subsidised customs duty of 15% for companies to import their green models here, but only when they commit to invest a minimum of $500 million for a factory, apart from substantial local value addition.Citroen, that has followed group company Jeep into India, also said it sees India as a big opportunity for growth , though stiff competition from rivals and demanding customers are challenges ahead.""If you succeed in India, you can succeed anywhere in the world. It is one of the most competitive markets in the world. Cars here are most competitive and expectations of customers is among the highest.

This is his third visit to the country over last 12-13 months.

And so, we were very, very pleased about it. It was a new March quarter revenue record for us. As you know, as I have said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it’s a major focus for us.”Apple is growing sales channels in the country, apart from engaging deeper with the developer ecosystem, says Cook. He had visited India last year to inaugurate two company-owned stores. He also met PM Narendra Modi and other partners.“We just opened a couple of stores last year, as you know, and we see (an) enormous opportunity there. We’re continuing to expand our channels, and also working on the developer ecosystem as well. And we’ve been very pleased that there is a rapidly-growing base of developers there. And so, we’re working on entire ecosystem from developer to market to operations, the whole thing. And I just — I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.”Apple has seen fast adoption of its products in India as the company sells across channels — both offline and online. The adoption has been enabled by growing product finance opportunities , as well as lucrative buybacks, at the level of retail.The company is also helped by higher production within India where Foxconn, Tatas and Pegatron are manufacturing locally. This makes the products competitive. “In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there, from a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive,” Cook said.As Apple moves production out of China, India seems to be a clear beneficiary. The company is understood to have had a record production of $14 billion in India last year, with a bulk of the output being exported. Apple said it is also working with partners in India and US to replenish 100% of water it uses in places that need it most, “with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over next two decades.” Globally, Apple posted a quarterly revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year-on-year.

RBI tightens norms for loans to projects like roads & ports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-tightens-norms-for-loans-to-projects-like-roads-ports/articleshow/109826071.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI has proposed stricter regulations for project financing , which will make it more expensive for lenders to provide loans for infrastructure and industrial projects like roads, ports and power plants.The new norms require lenders to set aside 5% of the money they have lent as general provisions for all existing and new loans. Currently, banks have to provide only 0.4% of the loan amount for exposures that are not in default.This move could impact profits of banks with significant exposure to such projects. The norms come at a time when asset quality has substantially improved in project lending, partly because most of the funding has been done in projects where govt was a counterparty.Bankers added that the new norms require 1% provision even after project completion, which is more than double the existing provision.According to a senior public sector bank official, the cost of project financing will increase due to higher interest rates. The provisions will also reduce banks’ profits as they have to be carved out of their earnings. The new norms have also reduced the flexibility available for lenders, as they have hard-coded what needs to be done under different scenarios such as project delays.However, RBI might have decided to tighten the prudential norms as a slew of projects are expected to come up for financing in the private sector, including renewable power and other areas.“The lenders have already been adding risk premium while funding under construction projects, however, higher provisons and capital allocation will further increase borrowing costs for projects during construction phase. On the positive side, increased provisions during construction phase improve resilience of lenders to address the potential risk of such projects,” said Anil Gupta, senior vice-president at Icra.He added that lenders who have higher share of under construction projects with longer gestation periods may also face sustained impact on their capital adequacy.Once a project starts operating, lenders can reduce the provisioning to 2.5% of the money lent. If the project is performing well and has sufficient cash flow to repay loans, the provisions can be further reduced to 1% of the money lent.RBI also revised its rules on exposure to capital markets, considering the T+1 settlement introduced by stock exchanges. Under T+1, the maximum risk is assumed at 30%, assuming that stocks may go down 20% one day and 10% the next. The earlier norms were prescribed by RBI based on T+2 rolling settlement for equities.",The new norms require lenders to set aside 5% of the money they have lent as general provisions for all existing and new loans. The move could impact profits of banks with significant exposure to such projects.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities.

Fruits pack a punch in India’s mocktail mkt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fruits-pack-a-punch-in-indias-mocktail-mkt/articleshow/109825506.cms,"Chennai: Fuelled by a shift to healthier choices and ease of consumption, readymade punches and mocktail companies using ‘natural’ ingredients — from fruits and roots to herbs and spices — are making a foray into India’s beverage market.From boozy highs and soda burps, party animals are switching their loyalties to fruity concoctions. According to a Statista study, the global non-alcoholic drinks market is anticipated to experience a volume growth of 2.3% this year.By 2027, it is projected to reach 944.6 billion litres — clocking a CAGR of 4.6% between 2023-27. Currently, India’s ready-to-drink juice, mocktail and non-alcoholic beverage market comprises over 200 players.Makers are raking in the most from millennials as well as health-conscious Gen Zs, that lap up everything that is natural and organic. “The post-Covid era has ignited a profound shift towards healthier living, and that has stimulated a demand for non-alcoholic alternatives. Lifestyle changes have increased consumer awareness of alcohol’s harmful effects, but they still desire some non-alcoholic drink options that taste similar. This pattern is especially prevalent among consumers between 25 to 34 years of age,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of startup information and market trends provider Tracxn.Singh added that in recent years, new brands have emerged to meet the increasing demand, and India holds a strong position among other leading countries in terms of the funding raised in this area. There is high interest in the market — startups are getting fresh funding from angel investors, while FMCG majors are looking to buy stakes in the companies. Bengaluru-based Swizzle received a seed funding of nearly $67,000 from angel investors Akshay Singhal and Monika Rao this Feb. Coolberg got $1.1 million in its latest round from institutional and angel investors including Ashok Kumar Damani. Institutional investors including Emami, Venture Catalysts as well as nine unicorns invested an undisclosed amount in AloFrut last Sept. Data provided to TOI by Tracxn shows that top players in this sector received over $33 million in funding from institutional and angel investors between 2019-24.Harsha V Agarwal, vice chairman and managing director of Emami, echoes similar sentiments. “With health & wellness being the buzzword for consumers today, we see tremendous potential in the segment,” she said.Deepender Singh, co-founder of ready-to-drink mocktail brand Swizzle, said, “Consumers are not only seeking products that are better for their health but also ones that are produced ethically, with minimal impact on the environment.” Swizzle, which achieved a 210% growth in FY23, aims to reach a projected revenue of Rs 12 crore by the end of FY25.Reiterating the trend, Rishabh Gupta, promoter of Haryana-headquartered Axiom Ayurveda that makes canned fruit mocktails under the brand AloFrut, compares the uptick in this market with demand for energy drinks. “Energy drinks as a category have strengthened their market in India in the last 10 years, and I see it grow at a similar pace in the next five years. So, at the stage energy drinks are now, I see a similar growth trajectory in the fruit or natural ingredient-based mocktail market in the next five to seven years,” said Gupta. “After Covid, house parties have increased, and people are looking for options other than cola. The RTD mocktails offer them a good alternative, without even needing a bartender,” he added.Vaishali Mehta, co-founder of Swa, a Bangalore-based women-run initiative that handcrafts artisanal syrups, is upbeat about more natural concoctions making their presence felt in party circles. Mehta says that in India, most beverages use artificial concentrates and preservatives in the name of exotic flavours. “Our company brings locally grown ingredients including jamun, jackfruit, kokam, bird’s eye chilli, passion fruit into beverages,” she added.","India’s ready-to-drink juice, mocktail and non-alcoholic beverage market comprises over 200 players.

LAS VEGAS: Google has added Bengali , Tamil and Telugu , among 52 additional languages it has announced, to its ‘Workspace’ — a platform with 3 billion users comprising AI-powered apps like Gmail, Chat, Meet, Calendar, Drive and Docs.The tech giant is seeing “India as a strong market with Workspace, both in consumer space as well as businesses”, Google Workspace VP and GM Aparna Pappu said at the Google Cloud Next ’24 conference here recently.She also announced an AI-powered video creation app for work — Google Vids — to be launched in June in Google Workspace Labs, along with a slew of other new offerings.“In our initial launch, we had supported Hindi. Of the 52 additional languages that we have launched and announced, we have Bengali, Tamil and Telugu in there as well. That’s because that’s where user interest is,” she added.“We have been spending a lot of time understanding what small businesses mean in India. A team will be visiting India to find out aspects like what businesses need over there, does our road map match theirs,” she said.“Vids is video, writing, production and editing assistant — all in one — and can work alongside Google’s other productivity tools like Docs, Sheets and Slides. People tell stories at work everyday, whether it’s HR onboarding new employees to the organisation’s mission, training team creating digital learning experiences or a sales person pitching a new client on the benefits of their offering. Now, everyone can be a great storyteller through video,” she said.On the menace of fake videos especially in an election year, Aparna said: “One of the things that makes Workspace a great space to deploy AI is the key principle that the user is in charge. The user makes the decision. You take responsibility as an author and as a collaborator. Your name is associated with the document. That changes the nature of kind of stuff people create,” she said.And, as govts across the world deliberate on introducing legislation to regulate technologies such as AI, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said the need to ensure that any policy introduced should be implementable technologically. “We are discussing the issue with govts including the US and countries in Europe and Latin America. We have always been open to policy and regulation models,” Kurian said, during a roundtable with mediapersons. “We need to ensure that whenever a policy is drawn up, it can actually be implemented technologically. Because all this is piece of software, and you would want to put a policy on there, that can be implemented on software,” Kurian said.","Google has added Bengali, Tamil and Telugu, among 52 additional languages it has announced, to its ‘Workspace’ The tech giant is seeing “India as a strong market with Workspace, both in consumer space as well as businesses’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109826330,imgsize-458138,width-400,resizemode-4/109826330.jpg"

This requirement was creating a hindrance towards complete digital onboarding of the clients.“While onboarding a client, portfolio manager shall ensure that the new client has separately signed the annexure on fees and charges, and added a note that they have understood the structure for fees and charges in handwritten in case the client is onboarded through physical mode and typed using keyboard or written electronically using fingers/a stylus pen, in case the client is onboarded through digital mode,” Sebi said.The regulator added that the standard procedure for client onboarding through digital mode will be specified by industry body Association of Portfolio Managers in India ( Apmi ) in consultation with Sebi.

He meticulously documented his findings, including improperly drilled holes in the aft pressure bulkhead, a component crucial for maintaining cabin pressure.In April 2023, Spirit terminated Dean's employment, a move he believed was in retaliation for exposing the plane's flaws.The timing of Dean's demise echoes that of Barnett, who took his own life in March while involved in a lawsuit alleging retaliation for disclosing safety concerns related to the 787 Dreamliner.Former Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour recently testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill, shedding light on a culture within Boeing that allegedly prioritizes pushing flawed components despite safety risks. Salehpour, with 17 years of Boeing experience, turned whistleblower after facing repercussions for raising safety issues regarding the popular 787 Dreamliner and 777 aircraft.While Boeing acknowledged the presence of imperfections, it emphasized ongoing efforts toward improvement. Boeing contested Salehpour's assertions regarding the Dreamliner's safety, citing extensive testing purportedly demonstrating no signs of fatigue.","Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, passed away at the age of 45 on Tuesday.

Cutting close to deadline

NEW DELHI: After weeks of suspense, the Congress on Friday finally declared its candidates for the Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituencies of Uttar Pradesh.Rahul Gandhi has been fielded from Rae Bareli while Kishori Lal Sharma will be contesting from Amethi.The Congress, which is contesting 17 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh as part of the seat-sharing deal with the Samajwadi Party (SP), had announced candidates for all the seats barring Amethi and Rae Bareli.Rae Bareli is also a bastion of the Congress. From 1967 to 1977, the seat was held by former prime minister Indira Gandhi, and from 2004 until her appointment to the Rajya Sabha in 2024, by Sonia Gandhi .Rahul will file his nomination from the constituency on Friday. He will be pitted against BJP's Dinesh Pratap Singh. He had been fielded by the party from the seat in 2019 too.Singh had lost to Sonia by a margin of 1.67 lakh votes.On being selected again to fight from Rae Bareli, Singh said: ""I assure the country that farewell of 'nakli' Gandhis from Rae Bareli is certain. It is certain that BJP's 'lotus' will bloom, and Congress will lose. I have even fought against 4-time MP Sonia Gandhi, so Priyanka Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi are not important to me. Whichever Gandhi comes to Rae Bareli, they will lose.""The announcement comes on the last day for filing of nominations for Phase 5 of the Lok Sabha elections. Both the constituencies are going to the polls on May 20.Rahul's defeat in Amethi, once considered a Congress 'pocket borough', at the hands of Irani in the 2019 polls was seen as a significant blow to the party's national prestige. Irani won the seat by a margin of around 55,000 votes.Rahul represented Amethi in the Lok Sabha from 2004 to 2019. His father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, too, was an elected member of Amethi in the Lower House from 1981 till his death in 1991.

The woman told cops that Bose asked the supervisor to leave after some time, following which he assured her of a promotion and then ""touched her cheek"", prompting her to protest.A video circulating since the evening shows the woman complaining to a senior cop that she had been molested. ""This is not the first time this has happened to me,"" she is heard saying on phone before explaining why she had not complained earlier: ""I had kept quiet as I was scared of losing my (contractual) job."" She felt impelled to complain on Thursday, after the latest incident , to protect others from facing the ordeal she had faced. She is also seen referring to another woman who made similar complaints in the past.""We are duty-bound to register a case and begin a probe since a woman has lodged this complaint,"" a senior police officer said. Other seniors told TOI they had recorded the woman's statement but did not register any FIR. ""Article 361 of the Indian Constitution insulates the governor from any criminal proceeding while in office,"" another senior official said, adding that legal experts would be consulted.Raj Bhavan issued a statement a couple of hours later. ""Truth shall triumph. I refuse to be cowed by engineered narratives. If anybody wants some election benefits by maligning me, God bless them. But they cannot stop my fight against corruption and violence in Bengal,"" it read. Another statement thanked Raj Bhavan staff ""who expressed solidarity against derogatory narratives circulated by two disgruntled employees as political parties' agents"".Yet another release issued after 10pm banned the entry of cops and state finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya in Raj Bhavan premises. The cop ban was to prevent their entry ""in the guise of conducting unauthorised, illegitimate, sham and motivated investigations to placate political bosses during election"", the statement said, banning minister Bhattacharya's entry in Raj Bhavan premises in Kolkata, Darjeeling and Barrackpore. Governor C V Ananda Bose would not attend any finance department event, the statement said, adding that the attorney-general would be consulted for legal steps against Bhattacharya. PM Narendra Modi reached Raj Bhavan at 10pm, where he stayed the night. He is slated to leave Raj Bhavan on Friday morning for campaigning in East Burdwan, Nadia and Birbhum.The TMC posted on X: ""Appalling and unthinkable! The sanctity of Raj Bhavan, a symbol of our constitutionality, has been tarnished. Hours before the PM was supposed to arrive at Raj Bhavan to spend the night, a woman was allegedly molested by the governor under the false pretext of a job. Such despicable behaviour must be condemned in the strongest terms. Justice must be delivered swiftly for the victim, no excuses, no delays!"" Finance minister Bhattacharya condemned ""the alleged misconduct by the governor"", which she called ""unbecoming of any official, especially the head of State"", before demanding ""an immediate and a thorough investigation"".The BJP response was more nuanced. ""This looks like a political conspiracy. But, if there is truth in the complaint, the centre will take adequate action,"" BJP MLA and assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari said.",A Raj Bhavan employee complained of molestation against state governor C V Ananda Bose.

‘Your fund is under attack’: BlackRock fights to repel Saba raid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/your-fund-is-under-attack-blackrock-fights-to-repel-saba-raid/articleshow/109822357.cms,"A few days ago, BlackRock Inc. sent an unusual message to thousands of clients. It contained none of the formulaic language or inscrutable fine print typically packed into these sorts of statements. No, this was a call to arms.“Your fund is under attack,” the headline screamed in bold print.The attacker: Boaz Weinstein , the sharp-elbowed Wall Street money manager who says price distortions in funds run by BlackRock and others are cheating investors out of billions of dollars, and they need to be eliminated.This has turned into something of a crusade for Weinstein. Last month, his hedge fund , Saba Capital Management, launched a frenetic bid to have investors remove BlackRock as manager of six funds overseeing about $10 billion in assets.Which is what triggered the note BlackRock sent to clients. “If Saba were to succeed, it may seek to appoint itself as investment advisor” and fundamentally disrupt the funds’ objectives and strategies, “all to enrich itself.”The ongoing feud has turned the $250 billion closed-end fund industry, a normally sleepy Wall Street backwater, into the scene of one of the most dramatic power struggles in finance — one that’s coming to a head at shareholder meetings next month.Weinstein says BlackRock is not only trapping shareholders in underperforming products, but also failing to meet basic governance standards by stymieing his efforts to elect new directors. BlackRock points to Weinstein’s own track record, where he took over a closed-end fund meant to invest in floating-rate loans and put some of its money into crypto exposure and SPACs.Both sides vow they have the moral high ground.“We need to show there’s a cost to illegally entrenching themselves to protect their management fees while doing terrible things to shareholders,” Weinstein said in an interview, adding that many of BlackRock’s closed-end funds have track record of “horrible performance.”Weinstein’s move — echoing some of the most audacious corporate raids of the 1980s — is the latest escalation in a multiyear campaign targeting closed-end funds trading well below the value of their underlying assets.The 50-year-old hedge fund boss currently has about $6 billion invested in the products, using his stakes in dozens of funds to press money managers to buy back shares near their full market value (known as a tender) or turn their funds into open-ended vehicles, which would produce a similar result.In recent years he’s taken on the likes of Eaton Vance, Franklin Templeton and Voya Financial, convincing managers to tender, winning board seats and even prompting them to resign from their role as fund adviser.Weinstein notes that if Saba were to win the proxy battles , it wouldn’t necessarily mean the hedge fund would assume management of the funds. That would be up to the boards, but Saba has said it would “stand ready” to assist and may offer to do the job.In mid-2021, Saba took over the $600 million Voya Prime Rate Trust, now known as the Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund (ticker BRW). After a pair of tender offers, the fund has returned an annualized 4.1%, more than triple its high-yield bond benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It ranked third of 22 peer funds in 2022, 14th in 2023 and second to last this year through April, according to Morningstar Inc. data, which compares the product to US bank loan closed-end funds.By comparison, the $1.6 billion BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (ticker BIGZ) has lost an annualized 23% over the same period, while the $1.7 billion BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust (ticker ECAT) has gained an annualized 0.8% since its September 2021 inception. BIGZ ranked either first or second in its Morningstar category of only two funds over the period; ECAT ranked sixth in 2022, second in 2023 and eighth this year through April in its group of 11 funds.BlackRock is quick to point out that BIGZ and ECAT returned 19% and 32%, respectively, last year as markets rebounded broadly.Still, the funds continue to trade significantly below their so-called net asset value, or NAV. BIGZ currently trades at a 17% discount, while ECAT trades at a 10% discount, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to an 8.3% discount for Saba’s BRW.BlackRock is warning investors that Saba could radically alter the composition of the funds should it win control, exposing shareholders to greater risk. After Saba took over BRW, it began adding everything from crypto exposure to SPACs to other closed-end funds Weinstein is campaigning against. BlackRock says Saba’s tactics have nothing to do with helping investors other than himself and his hedge fund clients.“Saba’s true goal is a quick payout and, more recently, revenue in the form of management fees,” a BlackRock spokesperson said via email.‘Hot Hand’Last year, Weinstein launched three proxy campaigns for board seats against the money-management giant, failing to win a single one.Instead of backing down, Weinstein is pushing even harder this year. In addition to efforts to terminate BlackRock’s fund management agreements, he’s also trying to shake up the boards of 10 BlackRock funds.Saba has nominated a slate of directors, including a former Deutsche Bank AG derivatives-trading executive and Alexander Vindman, a retired US Army lieutenant colonel who testified against former President Donald Trump during impeachment proceedings.“Saba has been growing assets and has the hot hand, successfully waging multitudes of successful activism campaigns in the closed-end fund space over the recent past,” said Erik Herzfeld, president at Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors. Herzfeld manages investment products that buy closed-end funds. “BlackRock, given their depth and knowledge, has the ability to challenge Saba’s advancement.”For a Bloomberg dashboard on activist campaigns, click hereWeinstein says he’s redoubling his efforts in part because the asset-management giant, he alleges, has undermined the ability of shareholders to get a fair shake at annual meetings.Last year he won a lawsuit against BlackRock — and other fund managers — for adopting so-called control share provisions that can deter proxy attacks.BlackRock is appealing that ruling and now finds itself defending against another lawsuit from Saba. In March, Weinstein’s firm sued BlackRock in federal court in New York, arguing that an “entrenchment bylaw” in ECAT “strips away any realistic prospect” for a shareholder to elect trustees other than the incumbents. Lawyers for BlackRock said in court filings that “every share of ECAT has exactly the same right to vote.”“BlackRock has behaved leaps and bounds worse than all the other managers, and so a tender for shares is not enough,” Weinstein said. “They put themselves in a spot where they need a strong response — to remedy the performance but also as a signal to the industry, that shareholders are not going to stand for this anymore.”Stephen Minar, managing director focused on closed-end funds at BlackRock, said that “Saba uses the veil of governance to disrupt the investment objectives and strategies of closed-end funds by forcing changes that enrich itself at the expense of long-term shareholders.”BlackRock notes that in recent years, it has sought to increase shareholder profits and lower costs. It’s repurchased $1.3 billion of shares in its closed-end funds since 2016, including about $180 million of BIGZ shares, and it has started new funds without load fees that were typically charged in the past.Proxy BattleAs voting gets started ahead of June shareholder meetings, both BlackRock and Saba are actively seeking to corral investors to their cause.BlackRock is sending out white proxy cards to individuals and paying about $1.7 million to advisory firm Georgeson to help solicit votes for the six funds, according to regulatory filings. Saba is sending out gold proxy cards.The hedge fund has launched a website to keep shareholders updated on its campaigns. Splashed across the top is “Fink about it,” a reference to BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink. Saba said it will be hosting a webinar on May 20 to discuss its plans “to hold BlackRock accountable.”“I’m not only fighting for these funds, I’m fighting so that the next 30 funds don’t emulate these shady tactics,” Weinstein said. “I don’t need Larry Fink to apologize to shareholders for what BlackRock did, though they should be embarrassed.”","Hedge fund boss Boaz Weinstein says BlackRock and others are cheating investors out of billions of dollars.
