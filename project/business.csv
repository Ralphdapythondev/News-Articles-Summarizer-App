What are the new TDS Deposit Rules?

New TDS Deposit Rules Explained with Example

Should employees be worried?

New TDS Deposit Rules : The government has eased the regulations surrounding the time frame within which companies or deductors must deposit TDS (deducted from payments made by them) with the government before a prosecution notice is issued. The standard due date for depositing TDS with the government is the 7th of the month following the month in which it is deducted.Employees may be concerned that the relaxation in TDS compliance granted to companies could affect the timely deposit of the tax against their respective PANs.According to an ET report, there have been recent instances of companies, such as SpiceJet and Byju's, not depositing TDS with the government on time, resulting in employees encountering income tax issues.Previously, companies had 60 days from the original due date to deposit the outstanding TDS (tax deducted at source). However, starting from October 1, 2024, the new income tax laws provide companies with additional time to accomplish this.From October 1 onwards, companies will have until the deadline to file the TDS return to deposit TDS with the government. Nevertheless, if the TDS is deposited after the original due date, penal interest would have to be paid in addition.Also Read | New TDS rates from October 1, 2024: What are the revised tax deducted at source rates? Check list of changes for these transactions This effectively grants an extra 20 days to make the TDS deposit, i.e., 60 days from the original due date plus an additional 20 days.The income tax department has introduced a new rule regarding the prosecution notice for companies that fail to deposit the TDS by the due date for filing the TDS return.Previously, the notice would be sent after 60 days from the due date for depositing the TDS. However, under the new TDS laws, the notice will be sent immediately if the company fails to deposit the TDS, along with the penal interest, by the TDS return filing deadline. This change applies only if the TDS amount exceeds Rs 25 lakh.To illustrate this change, consider a scenario where a company deducts tax from an employee's April salary. The last date to deposit the tax deducted in April is May 7, and the last date to file the TDS return for the tax deducted in April, May, and June is July 31. Under the earlier laws, if the company failed to deposit the tax deducted by July 7 (60 days from the due date of May 7), the income tax department would send a notice asking why the company should not be prosecuted.With the new TDS laws, the income tax department will send the prosecution notice if the company fails to deposit the TDS, along with the penal interest, by July 31, the TDS return filing deadline.According to the income tax laws, the tax deductor must deposit the TDS dues on or before the seventh of the subsequent month, with an exception in April. For government employees, the March TDS is deposited on or before April 7, while for others, it is April 30.Also Read | Latest post office small savings schemes interest rates Oct-Dec 2024: Government announces rates for PPF, SSY, SCSS, NSC - check list The recent amendments to the TDS laws provide companies with additional time to deposit the TDS with the government. However, concerns have been raised about the potential negative impact on employees.Many employees do not regularly review their Form 26AS and Annual Information Statement ( AIS ) during the financial year to verify if their employer has deposited the tax deducted from their salary against their PAN.Typically, employees check their Form 26AS and AIS in the following year while filing their income tax returns. When employers fail to deposit the TDS, employees are often surprised when they review their Form 26AS and AIS.Media reports have highlighted instances where employees of Byju's received tax notices from the income tax department regarding unpaid TDS dues. Recently, SpiceJet acknowledged that TDS dues remained unpaid between April 2020 and August 2023.Pranay Bhatia, Partner & Leader, Corporate Tax, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India, was quoted as saying by ET, ""The new TDS laws provide extra time for companies to deposit TDS dues with the government. While this relaxation will help companies, it will not adversely affect the employees' TDS credit. The income tax department can still send the prosecution notice to the companies if they fail to deposit the tax deducted on or before the due date to file TDS return statement.""Naveen Wadhwa, Vice President of Research and Advisory Division, Taxmann, adds, ""The relaxation of TDS laws from October 1, 2024, offers companies extra time to deposit TDS along with the penal interest before the prosecution notice is sent. However, the new TDS laws will not adversely impact employees' TDS credit against their PAN.""Recent reports have highlighted instances where employers have withheld TDS from their employees' salaries but failed to remit the funds to the government. As a result, numerous employees faced difficulties in claiming TDS credit when submitting their income tax returns.According to Wadhwa, ""Section 205 of the Income-tax Act prohibits tax recovery from taxpayers, provided tax is deducted from their salary or any other income but not deposited with the tax department. However, taxpayers must provide proof to the income tax department that tax has been deducted from their salary.""By furnishing evidence of TDS deductions, individuals can ensure they receive the appropriate TDS credit and prevent any additional tax liabilities.","The government has eased the regulations surrounding the time frame within which companies or deductors must deposit TDS (deducted from payments made by them) The standard due date for depositing TDS with the government is the 7th of the month following the month in which it is deducted. From October 1 onwards, companies will have until the deadline to file the TDS return to deposit T DS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113848173,imgsize-50376,width-400,resizemode-4/113848173.jpg"

Ratan Tata passes away: Trusts must pick successor from among trustees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trusts-must-pick-successor-from-among-trustees/articleshow/114100484.cms,"Mr Ratan N. Tata Exclusive Interview with Suhel Seth

Legend Ratan Tata No More; Dies At Mumbai Hospital I Tributes Pour In I Tata Sons

The passing of Ratan Tata has brought attention to succession at Tata Trusts , the largest public charitable foundations in India and the owner of the $165-billion Tata Group. As Tata did not designate a successor, the boards of Trusts will have to select a chairman from among the trustees . Though the Trusts comprises several foundations the two main units are Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust.These two entities collectively hold approximately 52% in Tata Sons, the parent of Tata Group , which has a diverse portfolio ranging from aviation to automobiles.There are 13 trustees in total across the two Trusts, with five individuals serving as common trustees for both. The five common trustees are former defence secretary Vijay Singh, automobile industrialist Venu Srinivasan, Ratan Tata's half brother and Trent chairman Noel Tata , businessman Mehli Mistry and lawyer Darius Khambata. The other trustees include former Citi India CEO Pramit Jhaveri at Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, and Ratan Tata's younger brother Jimmy Tata and Jehangir Hospital CEO Jehangir H C Jehangir at Sir Ratan Tata Trust.The chairman of Tata Trusts is elected through majority consent among the trustees. Vijay Singh and Venu Srinivasan hold the position of vice-chairmen at the Trusts. However, the likelihood of either of them being selected as the chairman is relatively low. Noel Tata, aged 67, has a high likelihood of being named the chairman of Tata Trusts. This appointment would satisfy the Parsi community and ensure that a member of the founding family leads the philanthropic organisation, which distributed $56 million (Rs 470 crore) in FY23.Historically, only Parsis have chaired Tata Trusts, even if some had non-Tata surnames and no direct connection to the founding family. If appointed, Noel would become the 11th chairman of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the sixth chairman of Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Noel has been involved with the Tata Group for over four decades and holds positions on the boards of six key companies, including Trent, Titan, and Tata Steel. He was appointed a trustee of Sir Ratan Tata Trust in 2019 and later joined the board of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust in 2022.He was considered a potential candidate to take over as the chairman of Tata Sons after Tata's tenure. However, the position was ultimately given to Cyrus Mistry, Noel's brother-in-law. After Mistry's controversial exit, the role of Tata Sons chairman was then assumed by N Chandrasekaran, a seasoned executive from TCS. Noel and Ratan Tata were not often spotted in each other's company and preferred to keep their distance. However, in recent times, the half- brothers have bridged the gap between them to a large extent.","Ratan Tata did not designate a successor, the boards of Trusts will have to select a chairman from among the trustees.

Ratan Naval Tata, the Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons , who passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday night was an industry stalwart who was widely respected and admired by India Inc leaders. Infosys founder Narayana Murthy is no exception to that rule. A few years ago, Murthy presented the Life Time Achievement Award to Ratan Tata at the TiEconMumbai Hall of Fame Awards ceremony.What stood out was Murthy’s gesture of touching Ratan Tata’s feet after presenting the award to him.In Indian culture, touching the feet of someone is seen as a sign of respect, and Murthy’s gesture was hailed on social media.Honouring Ratan Tata at the function, Murthy said, ”What can one say about a humanist, an industrialist, a philanthropist and a perfect gentleman? All that I can say is that I feel privileged and honoured to have walked in his footsteps.”Stating that Tata has brought tremendous respect to the word business, Murthy added, “I think all of you entrepreneurs assembled here have to live worthy of belonging to the same club as he is.”Murthy went on to say that those honouring Ratan Tata are honoured themselves. “He (Ratan Tata) has received innumerable honours from countries and institutions all over the world. It's too long a list.

The dealmaker who took India global with a slew of big buys,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/the-dealmaker-who-took-india-global-with-a-slew-of-big-buys/articleshow/114100498.cms,"Tata Nano Launch Event - Part I

MUMBAI: In 1994, just three years into his role as chairman of the Tata Group Ratan Tata spotted an opportunity to acquire Tetley, the renowned British tea company and inventor of the tea bag. This was not only his first attempt at acquiring a global brand — one far larger than Tata Tea itself — but also the first endeavour of its kind by any Indian conglomerate. Yet, despite assembling a team and sending it to London, Tata Tea couldn’t secure the necessary financing, and Tetley was snapped up by a private equity firm.But fate ha other plans. Five years later, Tetley’s new owner put the company back on the market. This time, Tata, having learned from the failed first attempt, returned with a fully financed $432-million bid. In Feb 2000, Tetley finally joined the House of Tata, becoming not only the conglomerate’s but also India’s first and largest overseas acquisition.Tetley was just the beginning for Ratan Tata. Over the course of his chairmanship, he orchestrated more than 60 acquisitions, bringing well-known brands such as Corus, Eight O’Clock, St James Court, Daewoo, British Salt, Tyco, and NatSteel into the Tata fold. Ratan Tata recognised that acquisitions were the only path to propelling the conglomerate onto the global stage.Come 1999, Tata’s passenger car business was struggling, and Tata offered to sell it to Ford. The American automaker declined, stating it would be akin to doing the Indian group a favour if it purchased the business. However, in 2008, the tables turned. Facing bankruptcy, Ford sold its iconic Jaguar-Land Rover brands to Tata Motors for $2.3 billion. Ford chairman Bill Ford later expressed gratitude to Tata for doing them a favour by acquiring JLR. The deal not only saved Ford from financial collapse but also became one of Tata’s most successful overseas acquisitions, generating two-thirds of Tata Motors’ revenue.Tata had long envisioned a significant presence in aviation. In 1995, Tata Sons approached the civil ministry to launch a domestic airline in partnership with Singapore Airlines (SIA), but govt introduced rules prohibiting foreign airlines from holding stakes in Indian carriers. Six years later, Tata Sons made another attempt; this time, partnering with SIA to bid for Air India, an airline established by Tata Group in 1932 and nationalised in 1953. Unfortunately, govt shelved its privatisation plans. However, in 2021, as Air India’s debt escalated, govt decided to sell the airline, allowing Tata Sons to successfully acquire it—a significant homecoming for the brand. Although this acquisition took place after Tata’s retirement, he approved the move as Tata Sons is governed by Tata Trusts, of which he was the chairman.But not every acquisition went smoothly for Ratan Tata. The 2002 purchase of VSNL from govt stirred controversy when authorities objected to the use of the telecom company’s funds to support the group’s other telecom venture, Tata Teleservices. In light of this, Ratan Tata offered to return VSNL to govt and later resigned from his chairmanship, a position he never reclaimed.Similarly, Tata Steel’s acquisition of Corus for $13 billion in 2007, which was the largest cross-border deal in India to date, also faced criticism as an “aspirational mistake,” given that the British unit continues to depend on its Indian parent. Indian Hotels (Taj) faced a setback when its attempt to acquire Orient Express Hotels fell through. Despite acquiring a 10% stake in Orient Express in 2007 and making a $1.2-billion bid in 2012, the deal never materialised due to Orient Express’s reluctance to associate with an Indian brand. Taj persisted for several years, hoping to secure the acquisition, but ultimately abandoned its pursuit.","In 1994, Ratan Tata spotted an opportunity to acquire Tetley, the renowned British tea company and inventor of the tea bag.

Wall Street traders gearing up for key inflation data sent stocks to fresh all-time highs. Treasuries retreated while the dollar notched its longest winning run in more than two years.On the eve of a report expected to show consumer prices continued to moderate, the S&P 500 approached 5,800. The gauge hit its 44th record in 2024, with tech shares once again leading the charge.Apple Inc. climbed 1.7%. Nvidia Corp. halted a five-day rally. Tesla Inc. edged lower ahead of the Robotaxi launch. Alphabet Inc. fell 1.5% on news the US is weighing a Google breakup in a historic big-tech antitrust case.Major technology stocks have undergone volatility in both directions of late, but weakness represents an attractive buying opportunity, according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.“We remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence,” and “against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure,” she said.Markets barely budged after minutes of the latest Federal Reserve gathering, which showed Jerome Powell received some pushback on a half-point rate cut in September, as some officials preferred a smaller reduction.“Today’s Fed minutes were pretty ‘ho-hum,’ which could actually be a good thing for stock investors,” said David Russell at TradeStation. “Policymakers agree inflation is fading and they see potential weakness in job growth. That keeps rate cuts on the table if needed. The bottom line is that Powell might have the market’s back headed into the year end.”The S&P 500 rose 0.7%. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1%.The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced five basis points to 4.06%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4% — up for an eighth straight session. Oil held steady as US crude inventories swelled and traders monitored China’s plans for fiscal policy.US inflation probably moderated at the end of the third quarter, reassuring a Fed that’s shifting more of its policy focus toward shielding the labor market.The consumer price index is seen rising 0.1% in September, its smallest gain in three months. Compared with a year earlier, the CPI probably rose 2.3%, the sixth-straight slowdown and the tamest since early 2021. The gauge excluding the volatile food and energy categories, which provides a better view of underlying inflation, is projected to rise 0.2% from a month earlier and 3.2% from September 2023.“The Fed’s decision to shift its focus from inflation to the labor market means that inflation data, including tomorrow’s CPI, is likely to become less market-moving than it had been,” said Matthew Weller at Forex.com and City Index. “Despite that logical observation, this month’s CPI report may still drive market volatility coming on the back of Friday’s stellar jobs report, a reading that hints at the potential for renewed upside risks to inflation.”A survey conducted by 22V Research shows that 42% of investors expect the market reaction to CPI to be “mixed/negligible,” 32% said “risk-off” and only 25% think “risk-on.”“There is optimism about inflation generally,” said Dennis DeBusschere, founder of 22V. He also noted that the share of investors expecting a recession has fallen while the percentage of those who believe financial conditions need to tighten hit the highest since June.For the bull run in stocks to continue, inflation needs to continue to ebb, the economy needs to make a soft landing and Corporate America’s earnings growth needs to remain strong and broaden, according to Ed Clissold at Ned Davis Research.While Saturday marks the two-year anniversary of the bull-market, a crucial piece of the current rally that’s been missing for much of the past few years — broader breadth — may juice the next leg higher for share gains.Large caps and growth shares have historically outperformed in the third year of a bull market, but they are currently overbought versus small-cap companies and value equities, Clissold noted.Meantime, billionaire investor Bill Gross says the rally that’s helped US stocks almost double in value over the past five years is tapering off, and investors should expect low but positive returns on their investments.He recommends keeping exposure to the stock market at average levels, while focusing portfolios more on defensive stocks with a small position in bonds.“No bear market, but it’s not the same bull market anymore,” Gross, the co-founder and former chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co, wrote.","The S&P 500 approached 5,800 on the eve of a report expected to show consumer prices continued to moderate.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore. In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. The focus has shifted to modernisation of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112317825,imgsize-144990,width-400,resizemode-4/112317825.jpg"

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

MUMBAI: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday warned NBFCs that desire for “growth at any cost” among some players is leading to a “push effect” in retail credit growth , raising concerns about the sustainability of loans.Das made it clear that RBI is closely monitoring these areas and will take appropriate action if necessary. He, however, noted that “selfcorrection by NBFCs” would be the preferred option.The governor said that such growth is likely driven by significant capital investments from local and global investors, coupled with growth-based incentives for the companies’ management.While he acknowledged the overall health of the sector was stable, Das issued a warning to outliers whose growth strategies could pose risks to their own stability as well as the wider financial system.“Driven by significant accretion to their capital from both domestic and overseas sources and sometimes under pressure from their investors, some NBFCs, including mi crofinance institutions and housing finance companies, are chasing excessive returns on their equity,” said Das. He added that while such pursuits are in the domain of the managements and boards of NBFCs, concerns arise when interest rates charged by them become usurious.Das observed that some NBFCs are aggressively pursuing growth without establishing the necessary risk management systems, which should align with the scale and complexity of their portfolios. “An imprudent ‘growth at any cost’ approach will be counterproductive for these NBFCs,” he cautioned, adding, “The high costs and indebtedness resulting from this ‘push effect’ could pose risks to financial stabilityif not addressed in time.”Das advised NBFCs to review their compensation structures, especially variable pay and incentive systems, which in some cases are purely target-driven. “Such practices can create an adverse work culture and lead to poor customer service,” he said.Deputy governor J Swaminathan said that the commentary coming from the June and likely Sept data was that there are some elevated slippages and higher credit costs seen in select segments.",RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday warned NBFCs that desire for “growth at any cost” among some players is leading to a ‘push effect’ in retail credit growth.

The recent uptick in food and metal prices, as seen in the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the World Bank price indices for Sept, if sustained, can add to the upside risks,"" RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said in his monetary policy statement on Wednesday.Retail inflation softened in July and Aug but some food prices , particularly vegetables, surged. Das also said the inflation trajectory is projected to sequentially moderate in the fourth quarter of this year due to good kharif harvest, ample buffer stocks of cereals and a likely good crop in the rabi season.""The adverse impact of these risks cannot be underestimated. It is with a lot of effort that the inflation horse has been brought to the stable, i.e. closer to the target within the tolerance band compared to its heightened levels two years ago,"" said Das.""We have to be very careful about opening the gate as the horse may simply bolt again. We must keep the horse under a tight leash, so that we do not lose control.

For borrowers, this could mean more festive offers on some borrowings even as deposit rates may plateau.The change in stance - first in nearly 30 months - is seen as a step towards the softening of rates. ""With both inflation and growth well balanced, there was no justification to continue with the withdrawal of accommodation. We have achieved what we wanted to achieve. While we have greater confidence that inflation is moderating, considering the significant risks that lie ahead of us, it will be inappropriate to specifically talk in terms of the timing of a rate cut,"" RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said.The decision to pause received a 5-1 majority vote, with all members, including the newly-appointed external members, voting unanimously to change the stance.

""We believe RBI has placed the horse before the cart in its approach.

With a bio that cheekily proclaimed, ""I made it to the 'Gram!"" in Oct 2019 Tata shared a photo of himself in a sharp suit, sporting a gleeful smile that read: ""I don't know about breaking the internet, but I'm thrilled to join you all!"" when he debuted on Instagram, eight years after a more low key Twitter presence.After a long hiatus from public life, he said he was looking forward to ""exchanging stories and creating something special with such a diverse community!""But it wasn't long before Tata truly broke the internet - three months later, he posted a throwback photo from his youth that sent the likes soaring past 1 million. In it, a young Tata, with tousled hair and dreamy eyes, looked effortlessly cool in a white T-shirt.Tata also struck a nostalgic chord and often served as a window into the Tata legacy as well as his personal journey and roots. He also shared messages seeking help for lost, abandoned, and injured dogs.Then there were the more personal moments, like when he shared a photo of himself crouched over a piano, reminiscing about his childhood piano lessons. In an emotional post during the tough times of 2020, Tata called for empathy in the face of online trolling and bullying. ""This year has been full of challenges for everyone,"" he wrote, having observed hurtful exchanges online. He stressed the need for support, especially during crises like Covid, locust attacks, and border tensions: ""We need more sensitivity, kindness, and understanding than what we see today...

Tata Nano Launch Event - Part I

Among the most audacious projects that Ratan Tata attempted, Nano was perhaps one that was closest to his heart. The car, which was conceptualised by Tata in the early 2000s, was aimed at providing middle-class Indians with a safe, and affordable four-wheeler.""What really motivated me, and sparked a desire to produce such a vehicle, was constantly seeing Indian families on scooters, maybe the child sandwiched between the mother and father, riding often on slippery roads,"" Tata said in an Instagram post in May 2022, long after the much-fancied car - which created a stir across the world due to its cheap pricing of Rs 1 lakh ($2,500 then) - had faded away.The Nano was called the 'lakhtakia' car (Rs 1 lakh) in local parlance in the run-up to its launch, and was launched with much fanfare by Tata in March 2009 (it was first unveiled at the 2008 Auto Expo in New Delhi).The car, which initially saw a deluge of bookings, was soon mired in controversies - right from the location of the factory where it had to be produced (the then West Bengal opposition leader Mamata Banerjee's stir saw its manufacturing shift from Singur to Sanand in Gujarat in Oct 2008); to facing sporadic incidents of fire due to mechanical issues; to being billed as unsafe; to be being branded as a 'poor man's car'. The last one saw many middle-class Indians avoid buying the car, which came strapped with a 625cc engine and was rather smaller in size compared to many other entry cars such as the Maruti 800.Later, in a TV interview in 2013 - when the Nano was gradually being written off from the market with very low interest from buyers -- Tata himself admitted that its image of being a poor man's car had acted as a ""stigma"".He admitted that Tata Motors had made a mistake in marketing and positioning of the car. ""It became termed as the cheapest car by the public and, I am sorry to say, by ourselves, not by me, but the company when it was marketing. I think it was unfortunate."" He said that the car should have been marketed more to two-wheeler buyers as an ""affordable"" and safe, all-weather option, but not as ""the cheapest"" vehicle on the road. Such was the downfall of the Nano that Tata Motors did not produce a single unit of the car in 2019.","The Tata Nano was conceptualised by Ratan Tata in the early 2000s.

NEW DELHI: In a landslide victory, the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) has secured 42 seats out of 90 constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir, marking a significant comeback after their previous win in 2015.This election is notable as it is the first in the Union Territory since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 and comes after a decade-long hiatus. Following the results, JKNC chief Farooq Abdullah stated, “People have given their mandate, they have proven that they don't accept the decision that was taken on August 5...Omar Abdullah will be the chief minister.”Omar Abdullah himself won the Budgam constituency by a margin of 36,010 votes and the Ganderbal constituency by 10574 votes. BJP leader G Kishan Reddy commented on the party's performance, stating, “This has been the BJP's best-ever performance since independence.” He further added, “INC tried its best to divide people on religion. They even took Pakistan's name during their campaign, saying they want an LOC trade with Pakistan and even hold talks. Despite all this, we won a good number of votes and seats. This has been the BJP's best-ever performance since independence... Haryana and J&K have become 'Congress mukt'... No party has won a majority in J&K so far... We will hold a meeting with the state representatives and the national leadership on our next step.”Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) celebrated its first victory in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly polls, with party candidate Mehraj Malik winning the Doda Assembly seat, defeating BJP's Gajay Singh Rana.People's Conference president Sajad Gani Lone remarked, “...I am thankful to the people of Handwara. There was a different wave all around but I am thankful to the people for this grand victory...I think there was an undercurrent, NC played its cards right...They also got help with the 3 years of misrule here...We want statehood to be restored and that Delhi stops experimenting...I think they (JKNC) will be able to form the government on its own...Our vote is for Opposition, not to sit with anyone. We have contested against NC, how can we go with them?”","Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) has won the Jammu and Kashmir election.

Judge Amit Mehta could also order Google to provide access to the underlying data it uses to build its search results and artificial intelligence products, it said.The justice department “is considering behavioural and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features,” the agency said.The 32-page document lays out a framework of potential options for the judge to consider as the case moves to the remedy phase. The agency will provide a fuller proposal on remedies next month.The effort is the most significant move to rein in a major tech company over illegal monopolisation since Washington unsuccessfully sought to break up Microsoft two decades ago. The justice department and the US federal trade commission have targeted Big Tech dominance, scrutinising deals and investments and accusing some of the country’s most powerful companies of illegally dominating markets.Google shares fell 1% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday. A breakup of the company “is unlikely at this point despite the antitrust swirls,” said Daniel Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Google will battle this in the courts for years.”Google criticised the justice department’s filing as “radical,” saying it would have “significant unintended consequences for consumers, businesses, and American competitiveness.” The DOJ’s proposals go “well beyond the legal scope of the Court’s decision about Search distribution contracts,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post.","The US justice department is considering asking a federal judge to force Google to sell off parts of its business.

US hints at breakup of Google search dominance in landmark case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-hints-at-breakup-of-google-search-dominance-in-landmark-case/articleshow/114088595.cms,"The US on Tuesday announced that it may request a judge to direct Google to divest some components of its business, such as the Chrome browser and Android operating system in response to unlawful monopoly in the online search market.A judge, in a significant ruling in August, said that the Alphabet 's subsidiary had established an illegal monopoly handling 90% of US internet searches.The measures proposed by the Justice Department significantly change how Americans access information online while taking a toll on Google's revenues and providing more opportunities for its competitors to expand.""Fully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google's control of distribution today, but also ensuring Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow,"" the Justice Department said.The proposed solutions will also prevent Google's past dominance from extending into the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence, according to prosecutors.Additionally, the Justice Department may request the court to prohibit Google from making payments to have its search engine pre-installed or set as the default on new devices.Google has been making annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to companies such as Apple and other device manufacturers to ensure that its search engine remains the default on smartphones and browsers, thereby maintaining its strong market share.The tech giant which intends to appeal the ruling, described the proposals as ""radical"" in a corporate blog post, stating that they ""go far beyond the specific legal issues in this case."" The company asserts that its search engine has gained users due to its quality, highlighting that it faces intense competition from Amazon and other websites, and that users have the option to choose alternative search engines as their default.Meanwhile, in a separate case on Monday, a US judge said that Google must increase competition in its profitable app store, Play, including allowing Android apps to be available from alternative sources.Google is also battling a Justice Department lawsuit that aims to dismantle its online advertising business.The Justice Department stated that it might seek to make Google's indexes, data, and models used for search and AI-assisted search features accessible to competitors as part of its efforts to prevent Google's dominance from expanding into AI.Other potential orders that prosecutors may pursue include preventing Google from entering into agreements that restrict other AI competitors' access to web content and allowing websites to choose not to have their content used by Google to train AI models. Google argued that the AI-related proposals could hinder the industry's growth.""There are enormous risks to the government putting its thumb on the scale of this vital industry — skewing investment, distorting incentives, hobbling emerging business models — all at precisely the moment that we need to encourage investment,"" Google said.","US may ask a judge to direct Google to divest some components of its business, such as the Chrome browser and Android operating system.

"Google Play must allow rival Android app stores, judge rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/google-play-must-allow-rival-android-app-stores-judge-rules/articleshow/114028987.cms,"The judge said that Google can take “reasonable measures” to ensure the security of its platform.

App Store Controls

‘Reasonable Measures’

Epic-Apple Fight

Alphabet Inc must lift restrictions that prevent developers from setting up rival marketplaces and billing systems that compete with its Google Play Store , a judge ruled, upending the search giant’s dominance in the lucrative Android app market and probably denting its revenue.A federal judge in San Francisco on Monday handed a big victory to Epic Games Inc in its long-running challenge to the technology giant’s app store, another antitrust blow to Google following its recent major defeat in one US Justice Department case and while it’s still fighting another.The ruling comes after the maker of the popular video game Fortnite convinced a jury that Google abused its power in the Android app market with its Google Play store policies. The changes the company must now make will almost certainly take a bite out of its sales, with one analyst estimating a “worst case” loss in gross profit of more than $1 billion off sales that totaled $14.66 billion in 2020.Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5%, closing at $162.98 in New York. They had been up 20% this year through the end of last week.“The Epic verdict missed the obvious: Apple and Android clearly compete,” Google said in a blog post. “We will appeal and ask the courts to pause implementing the remedies to maintain a consistent and safe experience for users and developers as the legal process moves forward.”In a case that started in 2020, Epic argued that Google Play rules and fees stifled competition and blocked app marketplaces launched by developers. The judge’s decision is likely to accelerate the weakening of app store controls held by tech giants Google and Apple Inc that have been under fire from regulators and lawmakers around the world.US District Judge James Donato issued an injunction that takes effect Nov. 1 which bars Google for three years from paying developers to exclusively use its app store or prohibit them from telling customers about how to directly download apps. Google also cannot force developers to use its billing features during that time.The company must also let rival app stores have access to its catalog for the next three years in a bid to help them develop.The increased use of third-party billing systems by media and gaming companies in light of Donato’s injunction poses a larger threat to Google than rival app stores, Mandeep Singh, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note.“In a worst case scenario this could be a 20-30% drag on gross app store sales of around $50 billion, mostly subscriptions, which could be a $1-$1.5 billion drag on the company’s gross profit, based on our estimates,” Singh said.Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, an analyst with EMarketer, agreed that Google will take a revenue hit, though she said it will take a while to “fully materialize” because the company’s play store will remain the default choice on Android devices.“Even if Google Play Store is no longer pre-installed as a result of payments to device manufacturers, it has tremendous brand recognition among consumers,” she said.Epic Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney, who has been fighting both Google and Apple for four years to open their stores, hailed Monday’s decision as a victory in a post on X.Donato had warned he would be tough on Google after jurors found in December that the company had engaged in anticompetitive conduct and harmed Epic.“The question at hand is not whether Google violated the antitrust laws by failing to aid rivals, but what measures are necessary to restore fair competition in the face of the barriers found by the jury,” he wrote.“Requiring Google to allow other app stores to be distributed through the Play Store for a discrete period is a modest step to correct the consequence of unlawfully preventing rival stores from reaching users and developers,” Donato said.In its defense, Google contended that its partnerships help phones that run on Android better compete against Apple’s iPhone.The judge said that Google can take “reasonable measures” to ensure the security of its platform, and ordered the parties to recommend three people for a committee to review the technical aspects of those requirements. Developers who find that Google’s security measures are too stringent can challenge them, with the tech giant responsible for proving they are necessary.Donato said he limited the injunction to three years because “the provisions are designed to level the playing field for the entry and growth of rivals, without burdening Google excessively.”Google had told the judge it would take 12 to 16 months to add third-party apps to the Play Store, but Donato set a deadline of eight months.Stanford University law professor Mark Lemley called the judge’s decision “important,” saying it’s particularly significant that Donato ordered Google to make its catalog of apps available to competing stores.“That isn’t something antitrust law would normally require,” he said. “But the judge correctly noted that once you have violated the antitrust laws, courts can order you to do affirmative things to undo the harm you caused, even though you didn’t have the obligation to do those things in the first place.”Epic had mixed success with a similar antitrust challenge to Apple’s app store. A judge in Oakland, California, concluded in 2021 that the App Store didn’t violate federal monopoly laws. But the judge sided with Epic on an unfair competition claim under California law and directed the iPhone maker to let developers steer customers to their websites for online transactions.The Fortnite maker claimed in its suit against Google that the tech company monopolized the Android app distribution market for more than a decade by striking side deals with rivals and using its resources to thwart competition.During trial, Epic presented evidence that Google forged partnerships with phone makers including Samsung Electronics Co. to ensure Google Play was pre-installed on mobile devices. Donato’s ruling would stop Google from using a payment, revenue share or access to Google’s services as conditions in agreements with device makers or wireless carriers in exchange for its Google Play store to be prominently featured on devices.A Google public policy executive said in the company’s blog post that Monday’s ruling will have “unintended consequences.”“As we have already stated, these changes would put consumers’ privacy and security at risk, make it harder for developers to promote their apps, and reduce competition on devices,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company’s vice-president for regulatory affairs, wrote. “Ultimately, while these changes presumably satisfy Epic, they will cause a range of unintended consequences that will harm American consumers, developers and device makers.”Federal antitrust scrutiny is also building. In August, Google lost a trial over claims by the US Justice Department that the company illegally monopolizes online search and advertising markets.The department is expected to detail its proposal Tuesday to alleviate the harm resulting from that misconduct — even as the agency is still sparring with Google in yet another case over the company’s alleged dominance over the technology used to buy and sell online ads. Closing arguments in that fight will be held in November with a decision expected by the end of the year.","Alphabet shares fall as much as 2.5%, closing at $162.98 in New York.

European Union approves tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/european-union-approves-tariffs-on-chinese-electric-vehicles/articleshow/113962628.cms,"The European Union on Friday approved substantial tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, despite strong resistance led by Germany and concerns about triggering a trade war with Beijing. The EU now has the authority to impose tariffs for a period of five years starting from the end of October in addition to the existing 10% duties.According to several European diplomats, ten member states, including France, Italy, and Poland, supported the imposition of the tariffs while five countries, including Germany and Hungary, voted against the measure, while twelve others, such as Spain and Sweden, abstained from voting.France supports the tariffs, arguing that they are necessary to create a level playing field for EU carmakers against their Chinese competitors. However, Germany, known for its robust auto industry and key manufacturers such as BMW, Volkswagen, and Mercedes, which have heavily invested in China, believes that the EU risks harming itself with tariffs and has called for continued negotiations with Beijing.Spain, initially supportive of the tariffs, has also reversed its stance, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez requesting that Brussels reconsider. Hungary has also been vocal in its opposition to the tariffs, with Prime Minister Viktor Orban describing them as ""the next step in the economic cold war.""These additional duties will also be imposed on electric vehicles manufactured in China by foreign companies like Tesla, which faces a 7.8 percent tariff.The EU's primary objective behind this decision is to safeguard its automotive industry, which employs approximately 14 million people across the bloc but lacks the substantial state subsidies provided in China. In comparison, Canada and the United States have recently imposed significantly higher tariffs of 100 percent on Chinese electric car imports.Earlier, the the group provisionally approved the measure in June following an investigation that found China's state aid to auto manufacturers to be unfair.With the decision now in the hands of the European Commission, an EU diplomat stated that the Commission ""can be expected to decide in line with its proposal.""Meanwhile, China has criticized the new tariffs as ""protectionist"" and cautioned that they would lead to a trade war. Beijing has already initiated probes into European brandy, dairy, and pork products imported into the country.Despite China's efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue, talks have not yet led to an agreement that satisfies the EU.The Commission has indicated that the duties could be lifted if China addresses the EU's concerns.Additionally, the trade tensions between China and the EU extend beyond electric cars, with Brussels also launching inquiries into Chinese subsidies for solar panels and wind turbines. The bloc faces a challenging task as it attempts to nurture its clean tech industry and invest in the green transition without triggering a costly trade war with China.","The European Union approved substantial tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China. The EU now has the authority to impose tariffs for a period of five years starting from the end of October in addition to the existing 10% duties. Ten member states, including France, Italy, and Poland, supported the imposition of the tariffs while five countries, including Germany and Hungary, voted against the measure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113963177,imgsize-779441,width-400,resizemode-4/113963177.jpg"
Oil Prices: What's next for oil and gas prices as Middle East tensions heat up?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/whats-next-for-oil-and-gas-prices-as-middle-east-tensions-heat-up/articleshow/113963132.cms,"Oil prices rise as tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, with concerns about potential disruptions in the Middle East. Gas prices see a slight increase but remain lower than last year. Experts argue that ample supply and tepid demand could keep prices stable. Anticipated Israeli actions on Iranian oil facilities add to geopolitical uncertainty.

Here's a look at the current situation and the outlook for oil and gas prices:

What's next for oil prices?

Oil prices climbed this week as tensions in the Middle East escalated. Iran launched missiles at Israel and the Israelis threatened retaliation, raising the possibility of a disruption to the flow of oil from the region. A jump in oil prices automatically spurs fear of a spike in gas prices , but experts see reasons that may not happen.Familiar tensions, different times Oil prices rose than $6 per barrel (5.47 euros) this week and prices at the pump moved higher as well.The average price for a gallon of gas rose 5 cents from last week. Any major escalation of tensions in the Middle East conjures up memories of the oil embargo that followed the start of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, which quadrupled oil prices.However, the global supply of oil has been altered radically since the 1970s, with the U.S. becoming the world's largest oil producer. Months of war between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, two Iranian proxies, did little to boost prices for OPEC and its 12 oil-producing nations. Only the possibility of a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran moved the needle.Gasoline prices are up, but cheaper than last year US gas prices typically rise along with crude because the price of oil makes up half the cost of a gallon of gasoline.The national average for gas has risen to about $3.18 per gallon, according to AAA. But that's still 13 cents less than a month ago and 60 cents less than a year ago. The record national average high of $5 per gallon was reached in June 2022.""Despite the threat of war and a hurricane season that is still percolating, domestic gasoline prices are edging lower,"" AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a statement on Thursday. ""There are now 18 states east of the Rockies with averages below $3 a gallon.""AAA also estimates that approximately 1.2 million of its members live in households with one or more electric vehicles. The organization believes that tepid gas demand and low oil costs will likely keep prices at gas pumps sliding.It's the fundamentals The long-term expectation is for oil prices to move lower, not higher. That's because the balance between supply and demand has tilted toward supply, a dynamic that typically weighs on oil prices.In its most recent update on the energy markets, the International Energy Agency said demand for oil in the first half of this year rose by the smallest amount since 2020. Meanwhile, supplies have continued to increase and the OPEC+ alliance, made up of members of the producers cartel and allied countries including Russia, has said it plans to release more oil into the market starting in December.""Geopolitical tensions have soared of late and yet fundamentals seem to be moving in the opposite direction with Iranian oil exports trending close to the highest level in years,"" Barclays analyst Amarpreet Singh said in a note to clients. ""The jury is out on the primary driver of the geopolitical drift, but it warrants caution against taking a strong view on a sustained disruption.""State of Iran's oil sector The country produces 3.99 million barrels per day, which is 4% of the world total. By comparison, Saudi Arabia produces about 9 million barrels a day.Despite sanctions imposed by the West that have hampered production and export levels, Iran continues to find ways to maintain its oil sector, sometimes using creative methods like blending and re-labeling oil for sale to markets like China. As of the middle of this year, Iran was exporting about 2 million barrels of oil a day, up from 500,000 in 2020 but below the 2.5 million barrels it exported each day in 2018.Export terminals like Kharg Island in the Persian Gulf could be a target for an Israeli strike. They play a key role in shipping crude oil abroad, primarily to Asian countries, including China.Oil prices rose Thursday after President Joe Biden said US and Israeli officials were discussing a possible Israeli strike on Iranian oil facilities. On Friday, Biden said the exact nature of any retaliatory action by Israel was ""under discussion."" But he added, ""I think if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.""Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis with the Oil Price Information Service, believes oil prices are approaching a top, with US crude oil at $74.38 and Brent crude, the international benchmark, at $78.05. ""Perhaps Brent may have a cup of coffee at $80 a barrel or higher,"" he wrote in an email, but the long-term outlook is for lower prices.""As soon as things calm down, oil traders will concentrate on 2025 and 2025 looks very problematic for high prices with supply almost certainly outpacing demand by 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day,"" Kloza said.","Oil prices rise as tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, with concerns about potential disruptions in the Middle East.
