When will Delhi Airport’s revamped Terminal 1 open? Here’s what’s causing the delay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/when-will-delhi-airports-revamped-terminal-1-open-heres-whats-causing-the-delay/articleshow/111421456.cms,"Delhi Airport Terminal 1 Plan

Delhi Airport Terminal 1 update : The commencement of operations at the revamped Terminal 1 of Delhi Airport, the busiest in the country, is expected to be delayed by more than a month. This setback comes after heavy rainfall last Friday caused a roof collapse at the old terminal, resulting in one fatality.Initially, Delhi Airport had planned to begin operations at the new terminal by mid-July.However, permission will now be granted only after a comprehensive examination of the structure is completed, which is likely to take over a month, sources told ET. An official, who requested anonymity, said, ""In the meantime, all flights have been accommodated at terminals 2 and 3.""A spokesperson from Delhi Airport assured that no flights have been delayed or cancelled, and a cross-functional team is actively assessing the situation and collaborating with various stakeholders to prioritize passenger safety and convenience.As the busiest airport in the country, Delhi Airport handles more than 1,100 flights daily. The recently completed Rs 8,000 crore expansion project aims to increase the airport's capacity to approximately 100 million passengers per annum.The expansion project involved integrating the existing structure of Terminal 1, which previously had separate buildings for departure and arrival, into a new terminal that would double its capacity to 40 million passengers per annum.Terminal 2, the smallest terminal at Delhi Airport, was scheduled to reopen once the new terminal became operational. Currently, a team from an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) is investigating the probable cause of Friday's incident, during which a portion of the roof, canopy, and several beams at the terminal collapsed due to heavy rain.Also Read | Flight delayed after boarding? New rule offers big relief to flyers stuck inside aircraft In the meantime, 72 IndiGo flights have been relocated from Terminal 1, with nearly half of them moving to Terminal 2. Although T2 has the capacity to handle around 1,400 passengers per hour, the influx of new flights has congested the terminal, according to airline officials.The officials compared the current situation at the airport to that experienced during winter fog, when the number of passengers to be handled at any given time exceeds the original plan. Prior to Friday's accident, the airport had already initiated the process of shifting flight operations from T1.The Central Industrial Security Force, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, and Directorate General of Civil Aviation officials met with Civil aviation minister Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu on Sunday to address the issue of increased passenger flow.To manage the surge in passengers, additional manpower and X-ray machines have been deployed, and airlines have been requested to reschedule flights to non-peak hours, according to informed sources. Delhi Airport has four peak hour windows: 8-9 am, 1-2 pm, 4-5 pm, and 8-9 pm.Also Read | India prepares for ‘One Airspace’: Unified air traffic control plans set in motion - what it means An airline executive, who wished to remain anonymous, said that some flights might need to be canceled to reduce the load. The executive also mentioned, ""There is a severe impact on on-time performance of airlines as it is taking a long time to process boarding of passengers. Due to limited space in the apron, aircraft are disembarking passengers in T2, then taxi out and park in T3.""Akasa Air, which operates from Terminal 2, has advised passengers to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their scheduled departure to allow extra time for check-in and security checks.","Delhi Airport had planned to begin operations at the new terminal by mid-July.

So, you try a new track. I am convinced that if we find the right partner, then we can only learn and benefit from each other... ""Zellmer did not specify the timelines by when the group will close the local partner talks . Asked whether it will be a partnership where equity will be offered to the new player, he said, ""We are looking for a true partnership... that is (to have a) skin in the game. It's a bit like getting married without a contract. It means (getting access to) engineering competence, sales competence, procurement competence.""He said European cars are often ""over-engineered"" which may not be required in India. ""Often we build cars according to our own expectations, and they tend to be over engineered. And, over-engineering always comes with a price tag. This price tag is something that weakens our competitive position. So, we need to learn, (and) we need to be aware of the sweet spot.""He said India partner will give local connections for sourcing and procurement to make the vehicles competitive. ""Combined with our engineering excellence, it can be a winning combination... It will not be right to say that we are a weak partner who is looking for directions, for somebody to lead us. It has to be on eye level for both, we have to benefit each other, and then it can be a lot more successful than in past.""On incentives for hybrids, he said, ""I can only say that lessons learnt in China, Europe and US suggest just giving options between BEVs (battery electric vehicles) and ICE - take it or leave it - is not the right way.

VinFast, a Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer, has decided to enter the Indian market with locally assembled models, signaling a change from its initial plan of selling only imported EVs in the country. VinFast is widely seen as a rival to Elon Musk ’s Tesla in the EV space.The company's new factory in Tamil Nadu is expected to start operations by March 2025, three months earlier than planned.According to an ET report, the first locally assembled car from VinFast is anticipated to be launched during the 2025 festive season, with prices ranging from Rs 25-30 lakh, positioning them in the premium affordable segment of India's rapidly growing EV market. The models are expected to offer a driving range of 300-500 kilometers.By opting for the completely knocked down (CKD) route, VinFast can avoid high import duties and offer its products at competitive prices in the Indian market. India imposes a 100% import duty on car models with a CIF value exceeding $40,000 and a 70% duty on models with a CIF value below $40,000. In contrast, CKD kits are subject to a 15% duty.VinFast anticipates that local assembly and competitive pricing will enable it to reach a peak capacity of 50,000 units in its first year of operations. The company expects India's nascent electric car market to conclude the current calendar year with 150,000 units, an increase from 90,000 units in 2023. VinFast is expected to reveal its plans for India at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo, which is scheduled to take place between January 17 and 22, 2025.The source was quoted as saying, ""The local assembly of models gives greater confidence to suppliers, dealers, and the buyers. The company will rather use what it saves on duties in brand building and marketing. As the plant is expected to be ready in the first quarter of next calendar year, it makes sense to take the CKD instead of CBU (completely built unit) route.""Although VinFast's Indian venture does not depend on the Indian government's new EV policy announced on March 15, the company eagerly awaits the policy guidelines to determine whether to take advantage of the incentives, according to the person mentioned earlier. The first meeting between EV companies and government officials to discuss the new EV policy occurred on April 19, with a VinFast official present among other industry executives.Also Read | China+1 strategy a success for smartphones?

The policy requires a minimum investment of $500 million and allows the import of up to 8,000 cars per year at a reduced import duty of 15% for models priced at least $35,000. This concession is valid for five years from the date of the government's approval letter.In line with this policy, VinFast has announced its intention to invest over Rs 4,150 crore ($500 million) in the next 5 years to construct a manufacturing facility near Chennai, in Thoothukudi.The factory, spread across 400 acres, will have an annual production capacity of 150,000 units.

Hindenburg claimed it only made $4 million from the operation, which resulted in a $153 billion drop in Adani group's valuation.In a statement, Hindenburg said: ""Sebi has neglected its responsibility, seemingly doing more to protect those perpetrating fraud than to protect the investors being victimised by it.""The thrust of Sebi's notice is that the research firm colluded with its investor partner, misled the public, and used non-public information to manipulate prices and profit from its action. Sebi has alleged that the partner, Kingdon Capital, knew about Hindenburg's research on Adani group before the report was made public and there was a profit-sharing agreement between the two. As per Sebi, Kingdon agreed to share 30% of its net profits from trading securities related to Adani with Hindenburg in exchange for receiving the report two months in advance.In a fresh twist in the Hindenburg saga, the US short seller said that Kotak Mahindra International created the offshore fund structure used by its investor partner Kingdon Capital to short Adani stocks before its report was published in Jan 2023. Kotak Mahindra Bank informed stock exchanges late on Tuesday that Sebi's showcause notice to Hindenburg and Kingdon included a fund managed by Kotak Mahindra International (KMIL).""KMIL was informed by Kingdon that the transactions were made on a principal basis, i.e. for themselves. Kingdon never disclosed that they had any relationship with Hindenburg nor that they were acting on the basis of any price sensitive information. In fact, they had expressly confirmed that any advice from Kingdon to invest would be basis purely public information,"" Kotak Bank's statement said.""Neither the fund nor KMIL were aware that Kingdon entities had any association with Hindenburg. The fund and KMIL had no prior knowledge of the publication of the aforesaid Hindenburg report. We deny any allegation of being aware of such report or acting in collusion in any manner with Kingdon or Hindenburg,"" it said.Earlier in the day, Kotak Bank shares dropped 2.4% after Hindenburg disclosed Sebi's notice and said that a Kotak fund was one of the noticees for setting up the offshore structure. In its exchange communication, Kotak said that the showcause notice dated June 26 was received by KMIL on July 2.In its reply to Sebi's showcause notice, Hindenburg questioned the regulator for not highlighting the name of Kotak, the group that facilitated offshore investors' short-selling in Indian markets.By bringing Kotak into the picture in correspondence with Sebi, Hindenburg has sought to support its claim that the firm played by the rules while short-selling and did not cross a line between using proprietary research based on public information and ""use of advance knowledge of non-public information"" for trading, as the regulator alleged.Hindenburg reply also referred to Kotak group founder, Uday Kotak's chairmanship of 2017 Committee on Corporate Governance to bolster the legitimacy of its actions.""We suspect Sebi's lack of mention of Kotak or any other Kotak board member may be meant to protect yet another powerful Indian businessman from the prospect of scrutiny, a role Sebi seems to embrace"" Hindenburg said.In a statement, a Kotak group spokesperson said, ""KIOF (K India Opportunities Fund - a Sebi-registered FPI regulated by Financial Services Commission of Mauritius), was established in 2013 to enable foreign clients to invest in India. The fund follows due KYC procedures while on-boarding clients and all its investments are made in accordance with all applicable laws. We have cooperated with regulators in relation to our operations and continue to do so.""The statement also denied any knowledge of investors' association with Hindenburg. ""KMIL and KIOF unequivocally state that Hindenburg has never been a client of the firm nor has it ever been an investor in the fund.,"" the spokesperson said.","Sebi has issued a show-cause notice to Hindenburg, asking why it should not act against the short-seller. The notice, dated June 26, was released online by Hindenburg.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July. Like every year, salaried individuals are looking at FM Sitharaman to provide tax relief in the form of reduced tax rates, changed income tax slabs and even higher deductions.One such relief that is sought is to include more non-metro cities in the 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption list.HRA is a common component of employee compensation packages provided by many employers.Employees receiving HRA and paying rent for their accommodation can claim a tax exemption on the allowance under the old income tax regime. The exemption amount depends on whether the employee resides in a metro city or not for tax purposes. However, if an employee receiving HRA does not live in a rented house, the entire allowance becomes fully taxable.According to an ET report quoting Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, the Income-tax Act, 1961, under Section 10(13A), provides tax exemption for HRA. The amount of HRA that can be claimed as tax exempt is the lowest of the following:1. Actual HRA received;2. Actual Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary;3. 50% of basic salary (for metro cities)/40% of basic salary (for non-metro cities).Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report - top 5 points Currently, rented houses in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for a 50% exemption from HRA, while those in other locations fall under the 40% category. It is important to note that this classification was established over three decades ago, according to Viswanathan.As cities have expanded in terms of population and economic growth, it has become necessary to re-evaluate the way we define metro and non-metro cities.Interestingly, the Constitution (seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, also recognizes the National Capital Region (NCR), Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad as metro cities. Despite this, the HRA tax exemption for salaried individuals in these cities remains at 40% due to outdated tax laws.Also Read | Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime Residing outside of metro cities can result in a higher proportion of one's income being paid in taxes. For instance, an individual living in Bengaluru may have to pay a higher average rent compared to someone residing in Kolkata or Chennai, which are classified as metro cities for tax purposes.Those living in rapidly developing non-metro cities, as defined by the Income-tax Act, may pay higher rents due to rapid urbanization. But, they receive lower tax benefits for house rent compared to metro cities. With an increasing number of people relocating to these non-metro cities for employment, it is crucial for the government to reassess the regulations for claiming rent exemptions to alleviate the financial strain on taxpayers, feel experts.",Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107371891,imgsize-720422,width-400,resizemode-4/107371891.jpg"
Jayachandran Ramachandran: Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new coding benchmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/claude-3-5-sonnet-sets-new-coding-benchmarks/articleshow/111329656.cms,"Anthropic’s latest AI model , Claude 3.5 Sonnet , arrived seemingly out of nowhere last week, free to use for everyone, and is now setting new benchmarks in a number of metrics. Most notably, it aced the leader boards in key categories of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena , a benchmark used to measure large language model performance. Specifically, it secured the top position in the ‘Coding Arena’ and ‘Hard Prompts’ categories, beating industry behemoths like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro , all while being a lighter, faster model to run.Jayachandran Ramachandran , senior VP of Artificial Intelligence Labs for C5i, says the LMSYS Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced open benchmarking platform and that users perform various tasks in pair wise comparison of models and provide feedback on which models can satisfactorily provide the best response. “The ranking system is quite transparent, robust, and reliable. In recent times, the top position was occupied by frontier models such as GPT-4 series and Gemini-1.5 series. It is a significant development for Claude 3.5 Sonnet to outsmart other leading frontier models and occupy the top position, especially in coding tasks,” he says.Saurav Swaroop , co-founder & CTO of financing platform Velocity, which recently launched Vani AI , a GenAIled customer calling solution for financial institutions, says that while GPT-4 has been assisting developers with writing code for some time now, it has been prone to errors and hallucinations. “However, Claude can write production level deployable code now. This will boost developer productivity and the time to build software will keep coming down,” he says.With its advanced reasoning skills, it’s great at handling multi-step workflows too, which is essential for complex projects, says Sourabh Kumar, senior manager of experience engineering for Publicis Sapient. “Compared to other industry leaders like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers faster processing speeds and higher accuracy in complex coding and reasoning tasks. For industries such as finance, where accurate data analysis is critical, or retail, where trend prediction can drive success, integrating Claude 3.5 Sonnet can lead to significant efficiency gains and innovation,” he says.Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also offer alternative solutions that coders might not have even considered, says Bebi Negi, senior lead data scientist at the Analytics Centre of Excellence for Happiest Minds Technologies.However, Bebi says coders will still need to check the code created by the model. “While it can create code quickly, it is very important to understand the code and make sure it meets a project’s requirements and standards. Even though benchmarks rate the model at around 90%, the remaining 10% gap underscores the necessity for coders to review the outputs,” she says.Securing the top spot in the Hard Prompts category was also a big deal, says Bebi. “The Hard Prompts category was all about handling complex tasks and instructions. The model did a great job here too, showing it can understand and generate high-quality content, even when the instructions are quite tricky.”","Anthropic’s latest AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is now free to use for everyone.

GenAI: On-device AI is cheaper and faster than cloud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/on-device-ai-is-cheaper-and-faster-than-cloud/articleshow/111329501.cms,"As devices such as smartphones , laptops, tablets and cars become more intelligent and powerful with increased processing capabilities and sensors, the tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on-device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.And while AI may have started off as something very specific to image processing, it has over the past four to five years evolved and exploded, especially with GenAI coming into play, to include a lot more use cases around text processing, voice processing and multimodal use cases, said Rajesh Narayanan, vice president of engineering at Qualcomm .He was speaking on ₹AI on the Edge’ at the first edition of the ‘TechForward’ research seminar series launched by Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIITH). The series seeks to spark regular and deep academia-industry conversations around emerging technologies.Narayanan pointed out that on-device AI has evolved to offer advantages such as personalisation , privacy and security, and with lower energy consumption and costs, and better performance compared to AI on the cloud.“Today, smartphones, smartwatches, devices that are a part of home automation, devices in the car and industrial IoT are equipped with plenty of cameras and sensors and are becoming a lot more powerful with the ability to collect more data. They also have more processing capacities, leading to more context aware user experience that can lead to a much better day-to-day life for all of us,” he said.He said that for all this to become a reality, you need a very powerful AI engine, and the overall solution has to be extremely power efficient.Personalisation is a key selling point for on-device AI as all the data that was earlier being sent to the cloud, potentially compromising privacy and security, can be done on the device. On-device AI also brings down energy consumption significantly compared to running workloads on a much bigger infrastructure like the cloud.Performance too improves as processing on the device itself can enable low latency as opposed to sending the query to the cloud, as with devices like Alexa.Narayanan said on-device AI is also a lot more affordable compared to the cloud. “As we transition from traditional AI to GenAI, the cost per query is actually going up and cloud economics isn’t going to work as compared to doing it on the device,” he said.In his talk on Vision on the AI edge’, Anoop Namboodiri , who heads the Biometrics and Secure Identity Lab and is associated with the Centre for Visual Information Technology at IIITH, said computer vision is playing a key role in pushing AI, and now GenAI.","The tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on- device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.

Service bots get our lingo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/service-bots-get-our-lingo/articleshow/111329125.cms,"Moving to complex functions

Indic language capability

is a little expensive now

The other day I decided to check out an airline’s chatbot to see how it works. I keyed in: “I’m travelling with my 8-year-old son, recommend the best flight without disturbing his sleep”. It asked for my source and destination, which I gave as Chennai and Hyderabad. It asked for the date. I typed ₹Mon’ (for Monday), but it did not recognise what I meant.I typed ₹tom’, it correctly recognised it as tomorrow.The bot responded that there were no flights that “fully meet” my specified criteria and provided a bunch of options. I then asked for the cheapest flight, and non-stop flights. The options it provided were correct – I confirmed that on MakeMyTrip and Google Flights. It automatically filled the passenger list as 1 adult and 1 child for booking. It even clarified the availability of gluten free food for my fictional son.Customer support bots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs. These sophisticated generative AI-based tools are much better than their predecessors, though still far from perfect. Sometimes they ask silly questions even after being explicitly told. They struggle to recognise colloquial words, have woefully poor memory, unlike human agents. But at least you don’t have to listen to hold music for 15 minutes.The leap comes from GenAI ’s ability to understand conversations better, their ability to understand multilingual queries , and support for interfaces like voice and videos. As these systems improve, customer support will become a lot quicker and easier for users, and hugely cheaper for companies, since they won’t have to hire thousands of contact centre staff.Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, director of AI Research at Zoho Corp, says with GenAI, the next goal is to make customer assistant bots do more complex and autonomous functions. He says they could hand over the issue to human agents when it figures it can’t handle it. He says they may even be able to process warranty claims, for instance. “As soon as you reach out, the system will be able to cross-check the database for similar issues/ queries where warranty claims are applicable. A human agent will have to call a supervisor to do the same job,” he says.But these are still some time away. Even for basic customer support services, companies are being careful due to concerns around data privacy, and hallucination. Nobody, after all, wants to get into a situation like Air Canada did earlier this year when its chatbot offered a discount to a customer that it wasn’t supposed to.Chaitanya Chokkareddy, cofounder of Ozonetel, the Hyderabadbased customer experience tech provider, says the focus currently is on automating the most common, repetitive queries. Chatbots, he says, fail in non-common areas of work.He says a lot of work is happening with AI in the back-end like data analysis, summary, intent analysis, and quality control, focusing on efficiency and productivity of human customer agents and improving margins of companies. “We handle about 20 million calls per day which last about 3 to 5 minutes each, and a lot of that data is currently not accessible to managers to make better decisions on their product and services. Demand for back-end services is higher than customer facing applications,” he says.While AI assistants perform relatively well in English, their performance in Indic languages is not great. Ozonetel is building Telugu language tokenisation by working with a non-profit and 1 lakh student interns to build a Telugu database. But Indian languages, he says, cost around 5x to 10x more compared to English because of the complex tokenisation of Indian languages compared to the Roman alphabet. “AI models are charged based on usage and chatbots using Indic scripts have more tokens and hence have higher computational costs. In many cases, the costs are equivalent to a human being and so our customers don’t want to automate,” Chaitanya says.Ankush Sabharwal’s CoRover.ai also has a local language model called BharatGPT. The bot can respond to voice queries in Indian languages, and provide tailored information. It also has video chatbots with pre-generated videos and text-to-video conversion and lip sync, which can be used for purposes like internal training.Ankush says redundant workload should be automated first, and as the adoption increases, more clear use cases will emerge. He says problems like hallucination can be reduced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and use of domain-specific small models.Abhiroop Medhekar, founder & CEO of financing platform Velocity, says they have built text-to-speech and speech-to-text tech for AI-agent voice call automation. They initially used it internally and then started commercial offerings. “Some BFSI applications require an immediate response from customers, but customers frequently don’t respond to mails or WhatsApp reminders. The current robotic IVR calls are not effective either. But these GenAI-based voice calls are interactive and provide better results,” he says.","Chatbots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs.

For boys, the acceptable attire includes half or full shirts and trousers, while girls are permitted to wear any Indian or western outfit.The notice specifies that garments revealing religion or suggesting cultural disparities are prohibited, meaning students must remove items like hijabs, burkas, naqabs, stoles, caps and badges in the common rooms before moving through the campus.""Students shall not wear any dress which reveals religion or shows cultural disparity. Nakab, hijab, burka, stole, cap etc shall be removed by going to the common rooms on the ground floor and then only (students) can move throughout the college campus.""""Torn jeans, T-shirts, revealing dresses, and jerseys are not allowed,"" it stated further.This policy has particularly affected the college’s Muslim students from areas such as Shivaji Nagar, Govandi, and Mankhurd.

He stressed that the college is merely asking students to avoid wearing revealing attire and is not compelling them to adopt specific traditional attire or color.""The notice is not new. We are only asking students to follow the dress code which states not to wear revealing clothes. We are also not asking students to wear sarees or attire of any particular color,"" he said.College principal Vidyagauri Lele reiterated that students are allowed to arrive on campus dressed in hijabs or burkas, but they must change these outfits in the college common room before proceeding with their activities.""Students can come to college wearing a hijab or burka, change it in the college common room, and then do their work,"" Lele stated.This dress code decision came under scrutiny last month when students challenged it in the high court. However, the high court upheld the college's policy on June 26, stating that a dress code is integral to maintaining discipline, which the institution has a right to enforce as part of its administrative functions.The court underlined that this policy applies to all students, regardless of their religion or caste, and dismissed the petition against the ban filed by nine female students.The college's commitment to enforcing these guidelines reflects its stance on ensuring uniformity and discipline on campus, seeking to foster an environment that aligns with its educational ethos.","A college in Mumbai has imposed a dress code banning hijabs, burkas, torn jeans, T-shirts, revealing dresses, and jerseys.

Record-breaking Category 4 storm: Hurricane Beryl wrecks havoc in Caribbean islands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/record-breaking-category-4-storm-hurricane-beryl-wrecks-havoc-in-caribbean-islands/articleshow/111418424.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hurricane Beryl on Monday wrecked havoc in southeastern Caribbean as the strong winds and rains rampaged homes by ripping off doors, windows, and roofs. The category 4 storm, fueled by record warm waters, made landfall on the island of Carriacou as the earliest storm of its strength to form in the Atlantic.According to NBC Radio, one death was reported on the island of Bequia, along with extensive damage to infrastructure and farmland throughout St.Vincent and the Grenadines. Communications remained largely down across the region, with streets from St. Lucia to Grenada strewn with debris scattered by winds up to 150 mph.""Right now, I'm real heartbroken,"" said Vichelle Clark King as she surveyed her damaged shop in the Barbadian capital of Bridgetown that was filled with sand and water.The storm was expected to move south of Jamaica and toward Mexico's Yucatan peninsula by late Thursday as a Category 1 storm. The last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which caused numerous fatalities in Grenada.In Grenada, officials received reports of devastation from Carriacou and surrounding islands, with Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell planning to travel to the affected areas once it was safe. The hospital roof in Grenada was damaged, forcing the evacuation of patients to a lower floor.Forecasters had warned of a life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet in areas where Beryl made landfall, along with heavy rainfall forBarbados and nearby islands, especially in Grenada and the Grenadines.""Beryl is expected to remain an extremely dangerous major hurricane as its moves over the eastern Caribbean,"" the National Hurricane Center told CBS news.Beryl's rapid intensification from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in just 42 hours was a rare occurrence, with only six other instances in Atlantic hurricane history. It also set a record as the earliest Category 4 Atlantic hurricane, surpassing Hurricane Dennis in 2005.The storm's strength was attributed to record warm waters, which were hotter than they would typically be at the peak of hurricane season in September.Thousands of travelers, including Jaswinderpal Parmar of Fresno, California, were stranded in Barbados due to flight cancellations caused by the hurricane.As Beryl moved through the southeast Caribbean, government officials also warned about a separate cluster of thunderstorms following a similar path, with a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression, CBS news reported.Beryl is the second named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts an above-average season, with between 17 and 25 named storms, up to 13 hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes.","One death reported on island of Bequia, along with extensive damage to infrastructure and farmland throughout St.Vincent and the Grenadines.

These flight routes suffer the world’s worst turbulence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/these-flight-routes-suffer-the-worlds-worst-turbulence/articleshow/111428127.cms,"A series of incidents that left scores of airline passengers needing medical attention has shone a spotlight on the problem of severe in-flight turbulence .In recent months, Singapore Airlines Ltd., Qatar Airways and Air Europa flights have all suffered sudden drops in altitude, requiring passengers to need hospital treatment and, in Singapore’s case, leaving one man dead.Singapore Air Flight SQ321 encountered severe turbulence as it entered Thai airspace in late May, triggering an emergency landing in Bangkok. It was en route to Singapore from London.And this week, some 40 passengers were injured when an Air Europa flight hit severe turbulence on its way from Madrid to Montevideo, Uruguay.Severe Turbulence on Singapore Airline Flight | Incident left one person dead and dozens injured. Plane diverted to Bangkok for emergency landingWhile the most turbulent flights of all connect Santiago in Chile to Santa Cruz in Bolivia, there are similarly bumpy rides across the world, according to the turbli database. Flights leaving Tokyo dominate the list of the roughest long-haul services.Strong turbulence is produced when air streams traveling at significantly different speeds come together. This is typically encountered at the boundaries of jet streams, over mountains and in certain cloud storms, according to the turbli website.For instance, turbulence on the Santiago-Santa Cruz route is generated by winds from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean flowing almost perpendicular to the Andes. The equator is also a well-known region for turbulence because of strong upward currents and thunderstorm activity, turbli said. Japan has high levels of mountain- and ocean-induced turbulence.The turbli website produced its rankings by analyzing 150,000 routes using data from UK and US government meteorological agencies.","Singapore Air Flight SQ321 encountered severe turbulence as it entered Thai airspace in late May, triggering an emergency landing in Bangkok.

"Steve Ballmer is richer than Bill Gates, a first for Microsoft billionaires",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/steve-ballmer-is-richer-than-bill-gates-a-first-for-microsoft-billionaires/articleshow/111418189.cms,"Steve Ballmer passed Bill Gates on Monday to become the sixth-richest person in the world, the first time the former chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp. has been wealthier than the company’s co-founder.The move came as Microsoft shares rose to a fresh record, bringing their total gain this year to 21%. The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.More than 90% of Ballmer’s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.Gates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett , Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.Since they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world’s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.Gates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer — one of the company’s earliest employees — replaced him as CEO. Ballmer retired in 2014 and became Microsoft’s largest shareholder that same year. He bought the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion in 2014, an investment that is estimated to be worth $4.6 billion today.","The move came as Microsoft shares rose to a fresh record, bringing their total gain this year to 21%.

"Under pressure on plane safety, Boeing is buying stressed supplier Spirit for $4.7 billion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/under-pressure-on-plane-safety-boeing-is-buying-stressed-supplier-spirit-for-4-7-billion/articleshow/111403727.cms,"Boeing announced plans to acquire key supplier Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion, a move that it says will improve plane quality and safety amid increasing scrutiny by Congress, airlines and the Department of Justice.Boeing previously owned Spirit, and the purchase would reverse a longtime Boeing strategy of outsourcing key work on its passenger planes.That approach has been criticized as problems at Spirit disrupted production and delivery of popular Boeing jetliners including 737s and 787s.""We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly,"" Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said in a statement late Sunday.Concerns about safety came to a head after the Jan. 5 blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 at 16,000 feet (4,876 meters) over Oregon. The Federal Aviation Administration soon after announced increased oversight of Boeing and Spirit, which supplied the fuselage for the plane.No one was seriously injured in the Alaska Airlines door incident, which terrified passengers, but Boeing is under pressure from the US Justice Department to plead guilty to criminal fraud in connection with two deadly plane crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners more than five years ago.Boeing has until the end of the week to accept or reject the offer, which includes the giant aerospace company agreeing to an independent monitor who would oversee its compliance with anti-fraud laws, according to several people who heard federal prosecutors detail a proposed offer Sunday.The Justice Department said in a May court filing that Boeing violated terms of a 2021 settlement allowing the company to avoid prosecution for actions leading up to the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, which killed 346 people.Those crashes were blamed on a faulty sensor in a flight-control system and the investigation is separate from the probe of the more recent Alaska Airlines blowout, which involved Spirit.Boeing spun off Spirit, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, and not related to Spirit Airlines, in 2005. In recent years, quality problems have mounted, including fuselage panels that didn't fit together precisely enough and holes that were improperly drilled.Spirit removed its CEO in October and replaced him with Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who served as acting defense secretary in the Trump administration.Things seemed to be going more smoothly until the Alaska Airlines incident. Investigators said a panel used in place of an extra emergency door had been removed at a Boeing factory to let Spirit workers fix damaged rivets, and bolts that help hold the panel in place were missing after the repair job. It is not clear who removed the bolts and failed to put them back.Spirit said in May that it was laying off about 450 workers at its Wichita plant because of a production slowdown since the January incident. Its total workforce was just over 13,000 people.""Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies' manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems,"" Shanahan said.The acquisition 's equity value of $4.7 billion is $37.25 per share, while the total value of the deal is around $8.3 billion, which includes Spirit's last reported net debt, the aerospace company said.Boeing common stock will be exchanged for Spirit shares according to a variable formula that depends on a weighted average of the share price over a 15-trading-day period ending on the second day before the deal closes, Boeing said.The companies also announced an agreement with Airbus to negotiate the purchase of Spirit assets involved with programs operated by the European aerospace firm. The Airbus agreement is set to commence when Boeing's acquisition of Spirit is completed, the two US companies said.",Boeing announced plans to acquire key supplier Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion. The purchase would reverse a longtime Boeing strategy of outsourcing key work on its passenger planes. The companies also announced an agreement with Airbus to negotiate the purchase of Spirit assets.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111403767,imgsize-738579,width-400,resizemode-4/111403767.jpg"
