When will Sensex hit the 1 lakh mark? Soon! Benchmark index gives returns of 850 times in 45 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/when-will-sensex-hit-the-1-lakh-mark-soon-benchmark-index-gives-returns-of-850-times-in-45-years/articleshow/113690232.cms,"Having recently surpassed the 85,000 mark, the Sensex is now edging closer to the highly anticipated 1 lakh milestone. (AI image)

The Sensex, India's primary stock market index, has delivered remarkable returns of 850 times to investors over the past 45 years, compounding wealth at an impressive CAGR of around 16%. To put it in perspective, an investment of Rs 1 lakh made at the inception of the Sensex in April 1979 would now be worth an astounding Rs 8.5 crore.Having recently surpassed the 85,000 mark, the Sensex is now edging closer to the highly anticipated 1 lakh milestone.According to an ET report, some of the most optimistic bulls on Dalal Street expect this feat to be achieved as early as FY25.However, if the Sensex maintains its historical average CAGR of 16%, the 1 lakh mark is more likely to be reached around December 2025. To hit this magical level, the Sensex needs to rise another 17.5%.While retail flows have been significant, they may not be sufficient to propel the Sensex to 1 lakh. The next leg of the rally in blue chips is expected to be driven by banks and foreign investors .Vaibhav Porwal, co-founder of Dezerv, states, ""The current market levels are a reflection of market fundamentals and liquidity flows. Fundamentally, the market should deliver 12-15% returns per annum and therefore we expect 18-24 months for markets to get to these levels. However, there is a strong buying momentum in the market that is fueled by strong liquidity. In such a scenario, markets can overextend. Which means that we may see the 1 lakh number shortly.""Seshadri Sen of Emkay Global believes that foreign investors, who have largely missed the bus so far, are now willing to overlook elevated valuations and increase their exposure to India. FIIs have invested approximately Rs 92,000 crore in the current calendar year, compared to Rs 1.7 lakh crore (1.2% of Nifty market cap) in CY23, suggesting room for further acceleration.However, there is also a risk of a decline in FII inflow and a shift of funds to other emerging markets due to their relatively cheaper valuations.Despite this, Dipan Mehta, Director of Elixir Equities, remains optimistic, stating, ""I cannot make out a case for even a 5% or 10% type of correction because whenever there is bad news, there is so much money waiting on the sidelines to buy that it quickly absorbs any correction. Despite the flow of IPOs and QIPs and management selling, the money flow is just too strong.""Last month, mutual funds were found to be holding a cash pile of Rs 1.86 lakh crore. Mehta further adds, ""Portfolio managers also have got a lot of cash to invest and then there are retail investors, small ones from all over the country, wanting to invest in equities. So it is like a waterfall of investors and a huge gush of liquidity coming in.""","The Sensex, India's primary stock market index, has delivered remarkable returns of 850 times to investors over the past 45 years.

NEW DELHI: Government is yet to appoint new external members of RBI’s monetary policy committee, which has left forecasters hesitant to make predictions about the next MPC action on Oct 9. However, economists believe that regardless of the committee members, there will be no rate cuts in Oct.The good news for banks is the improved liquidity in the money markets, which has led to the yield on the 10-year govt bond dropping to around 6.75%.Nomura has forecasted that this yield will further decrease to 6.5% by the year end. This has alleviated pressure on deposit rates and subsequently on loan pricing.Tanvee Jain, economist at UBS, expects RBI to begin rate cuts in Dec, depending on India’s growth-inflation dynamics. “Real interest rates have moved higher, as inflation has begun to moderate, raising questions over whether this is holding back a much-needed capex cycle recovery. Given the domestic inflation outlook is improving (likely to be 0.3% lower than RBI’s forecast of 4.5% for FY25) and the global monetary easing cycle has begun, we now expect MPC to lower repo rates by 75bps in this cycle.”Radhika Rao, economist at DBS, said the US Fed’s aggressive 50bps cut in Sept shows a global shift. “The MPC is cognizant that the July-Aug CPI moderation was due to an exceptionally favourable base effect, with stickiness in food inflation offsetting a deeper pullback in the headline print. While Oct’s meet might result in a pause, we expect the accompanying language to accommodate a pivot later in the year.”Global easing has lowered 10-year govt bond yi elds to a two-and-a-half-year low, but RBI is focusing on food prices.Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global, said, “Food prices, especially vegetables, have moved higher after heavy rainfall and flooding that disrupted supply. The impact of higher customs duty on imported edible oils is also reflected in retail prices.” Although many anticipated the government to announce the new MPC members’ names this week, the announcement has been delayed. The upcoming MPC meeting is scheduled between Oct 7 and 9.During the previous meeting, two external members voted for a cut in the repo rate from 6.5% to 6.25%, while the third external member voted to keep the rate unchanged. The three RBI members, including the governor, voted against a rate cut, citing persistent food inflation, potential spillover effects, and the need to ensure durable disinflation amidst steady growth.","Government is yet to appoint new external members of RBI’s monetary policy committee.

NEW DELHI: Government is considering setting up a foreign investment regulatory mechanism for post-investment review and monitoring in the country, according to sources. At present, the consideration is at the discussion level only, they added.“It has been observed that all countries do oversight on the FDI ( foreign direct investment ), which is coming into their country.People suggest that in India also, there should be an oversight mechanism. It’s a kind of oversight on money, which is coming up in the country as FDI,” one of the sources said.It can help ascertain that the FDI coming into the country is beneficial to the economy and originates from legitimate sources.India is a major destination for foreign direct investments given its 1.4 billion market, stable policies, demographic dividend, good investment returns and skilled workforce.Government has taken a series of measures to attract overseas investments like promoting ease of doing business through simplifying procedures and significantly reducing compliance burden for the industry.Government has also eased FDI norms in several sectors, such as space, e-commerce, pharma, civil aviation, contract manufacturing, digital media, coal mining, and defence, besides rolling out the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for 14 sectors like electronics and white goods.The official added that the measures to improve ease of doing business, zero tolerance for corruption and the focused effort on emerging sectors like electronics have helped promote ‘ Make In India ’ and boost domestic and foreign investments in the country.The ‘Make in India’ initiative was launched on Sept 25, 2014, to facilitate investment, foster innovation, build world-class infrastructure, and make the country a hub for manufacturing, design, and innovation.Over the last 10 financial years, FDI inflow has increased by 119%, reaching $667 billion compared to $304 billion in the previous 10 years (2005-14), with over 90% of total FDI received through the automatic route.Foreign direct investment in India jumped 47.8% to $16.2 billion in April-June this fiscal on healthy inflows in services, computer, telecom and pharma sectors, according to government data.Government is also developing industrial townships to boost domestic manufacturing and attract foreign investors by providing world-class infrastructure.India receives maximum investments from countries like Mauritius, Singapore, the US, the Netherlands, the UAE, the Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Japan, the UK, and Germany.Sectors, which attract healthy overseas inflows, include services, computer software and hardware, telecommunication, pharma and chemicals.On a question of whether India needs a dedicated law to deal with national security risks from FDI, Saurav Kumar, partner, IndusLaw, said that a dedicated law to deal with national security risks in foreign investment may strengthen India’s position with respect to international law by providing a clearly defined legal basis for rejecting investments on national security grounds.“This would not only reduce the risk of international challenges but also showcase that India’s actions are transparent, predictable, and aligned with global best practices,” Kumar said.Rudra Kumar Pandey, partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, said it is important that a specific domestic law is introduced which provides clear guidelines on parameters for processing the foreign investment application, aspects relating to a national security risk, the threshold for determining beneficial owner, the appointment of a nodal officer to interact with the applicant, providing of regular update, specific grounds of rejection and other relevant provisions to bring out the transparency in the approval procedure.“The objective for having specific domestic law should be to bring certainty in the processing of the foreign investment application and give the investor confidence to come forward with their application,” Pandey said.","Government is considering setting up a foreign investment regulatory mechanism for post-investment review and monitoring in the country.

Further, 2.27 lakh mobile handsets have been blocked for involvement in cybercrime/financial frauds,"" they said recently.In August, Trai initiated a major crackdown against pesky calls as it asked mobile operators to disconnect the telecom resources of entities that are found misusing bulk connections for making spam calls. It said that such entities will face blacklisting by all operators for up to two years.And from Oct 1, Trai has also mandated that telecom companies check the transmission of SMSes that contain web links that are not whitelisted. The new rule has also been brought in to curb the misuse of SMS headers and content templates, ensuring a more secure and efficient telecom ecosystem.Also, the regulator has mandated telecom operators to ensure that all messages from sender to receiver are traceable from November 1 onwards.Earlier this month, Airtel also launched a network-based, AI-powered spam detection solution that will significantly solve the issue of spam calls and messages. The tool, which comes free of cost, alerts customers in real-time to all suspected spam calls and SMSes.“Spam has become a menace for customers. We have spent the last 12 months to solve this comprehensively… (and) shield our customers from the continuous onslaught of intrusive and unwanted communications,” Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said.Vodafone Idea said it has set up a URL whitelisting platform that will be going live soon. “Vi plays an active role along with TRAI, COAI, and other telecom operators to enforce the Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC) regulations, aiming to significantly reduce spam calls from unregistered telemarketers,” the company said.",Trai and DoT have so far disconnected over one crore mobile connections to check pesky callers and fraudsters.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 adopts multifaceted approach to bolstering manufacturing sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-adopts-multifaceted-approach-to-bolstering-manufacturing-sector/articleshow/112216383.cms,"By Saurabh Agarwal and Mohit Sharma

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

I-T raids on loan agent raise kickback concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/i-t-raids-on-loan-agent-raise-kickback-concerns/articleshow/113797425.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Income tax raids on a direct selling agent (DSA) for loans of NBFCs and private banks in Hyderabad have blown the lid off suspected kickbacks to bank and company executives by the agency and raised calls for a nation-wide check on an industry-wide practice.The loan agent , booking revenue, mainly via commissions, of Rs 1,000 crore annually, was allegedly showing unusually high expenses, which attracted the tax department’s attention.These were shown as non-salary expenses to ensure that the tax liability did not go up. Typically, salaries and incentives to staff make for a substantial chunk of expenditure for loan agents, who earn commissions that can be as high as 2.5% of the loan value in certain cases.Banks and NBFCs rely on a network of loan sales agents to garner business, who are paid a fee or commission. Lenders have been aggressively pushing retail loans , whether it is auto, home or others, triggering concerns even in RBI, whose regulatory moves have helped slow down the pace in recent months. Some of the loans in the retail segment were given without adequate security, raising regulatory discomfort.The search has triggered a red alert and tax authorities suspect that similar payoffs are made in case of credit card acquisition as well as insurers, which faced scrutiny a few years ago. Of ten a part of the commission earned by the loan agents or, say, auto dealers who hawk loans on behalf of banks and finance companies, is shared with customers who demand steep discounts.During a phase of good sales when sellers have an upper hand, customer discounts are relatively lower. At these times, agents earn higher margins and a part of it may have been shared with bank or NBFC executives. Some of the kickbacks may have been passed in cash. The issue is being probed further to ascertain more detail, sources told TOI.","The loan agent was allegedly showing unusually high expenses, which attracted the tax department’s attention.

The report found that around 80 per cent of direct government spending allocated was in China, the European Union and the United States.Government support and incentives for clean energy technologies have reached new highs as policymakers place renewed focus on energy security in the wake of multiple crises in recent years, according to the report.Domestic manufacturing incentives for clean energy are one area of public investment that continues to grow substantially, accounting for almost 10 per cent of total government spending since the beginning of the decade, with low-emissions vehicles, hydrogen and batteries receiving the largest allocations.

, Indian immigrants have founded or co-founded 72 of the 358 unicorns that have emerged in the United States since 2018, making them the most prolific immigrant founders in the unicorn universe. This impressive figure accounts for about 20% of immigrant-founded unicorns in the US, highlighting the unique contributions of Indian-origin entrepreneurs to the American innovation landscape.

to the American innovation landscape. Collectively, these unicorns are valued at over $195 billion and employ approximately 55,000 people, making Indian-Americans a formidable force in the entrepreneurial world.

These aren’t just tech whizzes chasing the next big IPO. They are storytellers, risk-takers, and cross-cultural navigators who have seamlessly blended the hustle of Mumbai’s markets with the ambition of Wall Street.

With valuations soaring beyond $195 billion, Indian-led unicorns have become not only economic powerhouses but symbols of a new kind of American Dream—one that speaks in the languages of code, venture capital, and a diaspora’s insatiable drive for success.

Why it matters

The remarkable rise of Indian-American founders in the unicorn landscape is a testament to their pivotal role in driving US innovation, economic growth, and technological advancement.

Despite representing only 1.5% of the US population, Indian-Americans are vastly overrepresented in high-impact entrepreneurial roles, reshaping industries like enterprise technology, healthcare, fintech, and consumer goods.

Their influence underscores the broader impact of the Indian diaspora on the US economy and society, particularly in sectors that define the future of business and technology.

A new vanguard of leadership

Indian-Americans aren’t just building companies; they’re leading them at unprecedented levels. In 2023, sixteen Fortune 500 companies had CEOs of Indian origin, a testament to the community’s growing corporate clout.

companies had CEOs of Indian origin, a testament to the community’s growing corporate clout. From Satya Nadella at Microsoft to Sundar Pichai at Alphabet, these leaders are redefining what it means to be at the top in America’s biggest companies.

The presence of Indian CEOs in corporate America is not just a statistical quirk—it’s a statement about the kind of leadership the modern business world craves: bold, diverse, and globally minded.

From Bay Area to Bengaluru

The allure of Silicon Valley has always been its promise: come here, bring your ideas, and the sky is the limit. For Indian founders, that promise has been a lifeline—and a launchpad. Companies like Rippling, the workforce management platform, and Innovaccer, a healthcare tech giant, are reshaping their respective industries with the sort of disruptive flair that would make any VC drool.

These founders often carry a hybrid identity, a fusion of Ivy League polish and the entrepreneurial grit honed in India’s teeming cities.

""Approximately 20% of Indian unicorns and many startups have co-founders who have leveraged US higher education into successful ventures,"" the report said.

These entrepreneurs are channeling degrees from institutions like Stanford and MIT into ventures that span everything from artificial intelligence to financial technology. PhonePe and Dream11 are living examples of US-educated founders Turing their dreams into reality in India.

The big picture

Indian-Americans have long been associated with excellence in education, professional success, and a strong presence in high-skilled sectors like technology, medicine, and engineering.

Nearly 78% of Indian-Americans hold at least a bachelor’s degree—more than double the US national average of 36%. This focus on education and achievement has created a pipeline of talent that feeds into leadership roles in some of the most innovative companies in the world. With around 320,000 work visas allocated to Indian professionals in 2022-2023,

Indian-origin individuals represent 73% of high-skilled work visa holders, reflecting their critical role in filling talent gaps across key industries in the US.

This strong educational foundation has translated into entrepreneurial success, particularly in the startup ecosystem. Indian-Americans have founded unicorns that span a wide array of sectors, demonstrating a versatile and innovative spirit.

What’s next

Over the last five years, Indian-Americans have quietly risen as the champions of the unicorns - billion-dollar startups- ecosystem, transforming Silicon Valley boardrooms into global hubs of innovation.The future looks promising for Indian-American entrepreneurs as they continue to expand their influence across the US and global markets.The trend of deepening US-India ties, particularly in the tech sector, will likely fuel further opportunities for collaboration and growth. The success of Indian-origin unicorns sets the stage for even more dynamic interactions between the two countries, as talent, capital, and ideas flow across borders.With both nations increasingly looking to each other as strategic partners, there is immense potential for Indian-American founders to tap into burgeoning markets in areas like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and clean energy. The ongoing expansion of the Indo-US economic corridor is expected to enhance this momentum, fostering an environment where innovation thrives. As US companies invest in India to access its growing customer base and skilled workforce, and Indian companies continue to invest in the US, the entrepreneurial landscape for Indian-Americans will only become more vibrant.","Indian immigrants have founded or co-founded 72 of the 358 unicorns that have emerged in the United States since 2018.

The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved Bristol Myers Squibb ’s new oral medicine, Cobenfy , for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. This approval marks the first new type of schizophrenia medicine in several decades that reduces the mental illness symptoms without the common side effects .“Today’s landmark approval of our first-in-class treatment for schizophrenia marks an important milestone for the community.After more than 30 years, there is now an entirely new pharmacological approach for schizophrenia — one that has the potential to change the treatment paradigm,” said Chris Boerner, board chair and CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb. “As we reenter the field of neuropsychiatry, we are dedicated to changing the conversation around serious mental illness, beginning with today’s approval for schizophrenia.”Bristol Myers Squibb plans to make Cobenfy, a twice-daily pill, available by late October. The drug will cost $1,850 per month, or $22,500 annually, before insurance and rebates.Schizophrenia affects around 2.8 million people in the United States, impacting how they think, feel, and behave. Symptoms of Schizophrenia usually appear in early adulthood and vary greatly among individuals, making the condition hard to diagnose and manage. Current treatments can be effective, but up to 60% of patients find them inadequate or experience intolerable side effects.“For people living with schizophrenia, it's often difficult to find a treatment that works for them. Having a variety of treatment options gives patients and healthcare providers the tools to help manage this serious condition,” said Gordon Lavigne, CEO of the Schizophrenia & Psychosis Action Alliance. “People living with schizophrenia want and deserve more. Today’s approval provides a new option as people with schizophrenia move forward with proper support to rebuild their lives.”","The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved Bristol Myers Squibb ’s new oral medicine, Cobenfy, for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.

Export constraints

Economic appeal

MOSCOW: Russia, the world's leading wheat exporter, is expanding its Baltic Sea ports as it aims to boost agricultural exports by 50% by 2030 while reducing dependence on traditional Black Sea routes , officials and executives said.The country, which exported at least 72 million metric tons of grain in the 2023/24 season, is looking at new markets in Latin America and Africa to diversify from its traditional grain markets in North Africa and the Middle East.It has relied on its Black Sea ports to handle booming agricultural exports for the past decades but the conflict with Ukraine has made the area risky for shipping with both sides regularly striking each other's facilities and infrastructure.""Last year with its record harvest showed that with the pace of loadings for exports, we do not have enough capacity,"" Ksenia Bolomatova, deputy head of state-controlled agricultural conglomerate OZK, which owns several Black Sea terminals, told an industry gathering in Sochi in southern Russia.In the last 18 months, Russia has launched two major ports, Vysotsky and Lugaport, in the Gulf of Finland, not far from St. Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin's hometown.Vysotsky shipped its first grain in April 2023, while Lugaport began operations in June this year and capacity is expected to reach 7 million tons by early 2025, according to its owner Novaport.Dmitry Rylko from the IKAR agricultural consultancy said the two ports will be able to handle up to 15 million tons of agricultural exports, including grain, per year.That would account for a quarter of Russia's 60 million tons of grain exports forecast for the 2024/25 season.Private firm Primorsky UPK is also planning a grain terminal at Primorsky port with capacity of up to 5 million tons.Putin set out a goal to increase agricultural exports by 50% by 2030 as part of a strategy to cement the country's position as an agriculture superpower along with Brazil, the United States and China.Russia has become the world's biggest exporter of wheat, corn, barley, and peas in the last decade, but further growth could be constrained by shipping capacity bottlenecks.Many Russian ports announced plans to boost capacity after record harvests in the last two years. The Baltic Sea terminals are expected to expand at a faster rate.""The expansion of the Baltic Sea terminals' capacity is a question of economic and transport security and sovereignty,"" Novotrans said in an emailed comment.Russian trade flows and shipments have so far seen no major disruptions in the Baltic, where 96% of the coastline belongs to NATO members, including Finland and Sweden.By contrast, disruptions are rising in the Black sea and could reduce global grain supplies, according to a report by the World Bank. Two weeks ago, a Ukrainian vessel carrying grain to Egypt was hit by a missile.In August, Russian local authorities said Ukraine sank a ferry carrying fuel tanks in Port Kavkaz, which is also used for transshipment of grain.Russian exported 62 million tons of grain by sea in the 2023/24 season with 90% of supplies going via the Black Sea, mostly to markets in the Middle East and North Africa. This share is set to fall as Baltic Sea infrastructure grows.Baltic Sea ports loaded 1.5 million tons of grain last season, a three-fold increase from the previous season but still just 2.4% of overall Russian exports, according to Reuters calculations based on publicly available data.""Logistically, the Baltic has many advantages for grains exports,"" said Darya Snitko, vice president for Gazprombank, one of Russia's largest banks and one of the biggest lenders to farmers.She said the ability of Baltic terminals to handle bigger ships should help reduce overall costs.""Supplies from the Baltic Sea beat (economics of) shipments from the Azov-Black Sea area when trading with countries in Africa outside the Mediterranean as well as Asia,"" she added.Vysotsky has been sending grain to Algeria, Brazil, Cuba, Mali, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria and Tunisia, according to data from logistics company Rusagrotrans.",Russia is expanding its Baltic Sea ports as it aims to boost agricultural exports by 50% by 2030.
