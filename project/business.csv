Govt needs to bring out 'White Paper' on freebies by political parties: Ex RBI chief Subbarao,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-needs-to-bring-out-white-paper-on-freebies-by-political-parties-ex-rbi-chief-subbarao/articleshow/109472943.cms,"HYDERABAD: Central Government under the leadership of Prime Minister should come out with a ' White Paper ' to generate a consensus among political parties on the issue of giveaways or freebies, former Reserve Bank Governor D Subbarao has said adding that there has to be a thorough debate on how to impose restraints on political parties in this regard. He also said the public should be made more aware of the cost and benefits of these freebies and that it is the responsibility of the government to educate the population on this.""I think this is ultimately a political issue and there has to be political consensus on this. The leadership has to be taken by the central government and the Prime Minister. I believe they must float a white paper and try to generate a consensus on this. ""Educate people on the pros, and cons of these giveaways or freebies ( and ensure) how we can put a restraint on that and how we can enforce it,"" the former RBI governor told PTI in a recent interaction.Subbarao said that in a poor country like India, it is incumbent on the government to provide some safety nets to the most vulnerable sections and also introspect as to how far they can be stretched, given the fiscal constraints. ""You should ask (if ) it is the best use of this money or we can do something better. So I think we should have a more informed and vigorous debate on freebies and how we can impose some restraint on political parties,"" he opined.On some of the states crossing FRBM limits, he said states and the central government should maintain fiscal discipline and the FRBM targets should be adhered to. To a query, Subbarao said that according to the IMF which has done a study, India needs to grow at the rate of 7.6 per cent consistently till 2047 for it to become a developed nation by 2047.""To maintain a growth rate of 7.6 percent per year for the next 25 years, a few countries have done it, China has done it, but the more difficult point is whether we can do it with all the challenges like climate change, geopolitics, the difficulty of globalisation. It is difficult to say,' Subbarao said. The former RBI chief said a developed nation will have four pillars- rule of law, strong state, democratic accountability and institutions.""We can't say we don't have them, neither can we say we have all of them. So these are the things that we have to nurture and develop,"" he said. Subbarao had earlier said that even after becoming the third largest economy in the world by 2029 as envisaged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India may still be called a poor country and therefore it does not call for a celebration.",Former Reserve Bank Governor D Subbarao said there has to be a thorough debate on how to impose restraints on political parties in this regard. He also said the public should be made more aware of the cost and benefits of these freebies and that it is the responsibility of the government to educate the population.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"
Tihar requested diabetologist after claiming they already have adequate medical facilities: Saurabh Bharadwaj,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tihar-requested-diabetologist-after-claiming-they-already-have-adequate-medical-facilities-saurabh-bharadwaj/articleshow/109474381.cms,"Setback for ED, as Supreme Court grants bail to AAP leader Sanjay Singh

'Not surprised with arrest': Arvind Kejriwal’s wife reads his emotional message from jail

'My name is Arvind Kejriwal, and I am not a terrorist': Sanjay Singh shares Kejriwal's message from jail with wet eyes

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing row, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday presented a letter in which the Director General of Tihar jail requested AIIMS hospital for a diabetologist the previous day, contradicting Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) claims of adequate medical provisions being available inside the jail for Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal .Party spokesperson and Delhi health minister Saurabh Bharadwaj accused the central government of being accomplice in a conspiracy to kill the incumbent CM by denying him adequate medical treatment inside Tihar jail.Taking to his official X handle, Bharadwaj posted a picture of the letter written by DG of Tihar jail to AIIMS and said ""Exposure! There was no diabetes specialist in the jail. After 20 days, a doctor from AIIMS was asked for yesterday. For so many days, Arvind Kejriwal has been saying that take me to a diabetes specialist and give me insulin . Till now the BJP government at the Centre was saying that there are specialists in the jail; what is the need for specialists from outside?""""The DG of Tihar jail yesterday wrote to AIIMS that they need a diabetologist. Today, the BJP government has been exposed in front of everyone. Till yesterday, they were saying that they have all specialists. Everything is available in the jail. There is a hospital, clinic, beds, and insulin. Everything is there and Arvind Kejriwal is lying,"" he said.""For the past 20 days, Arvind Kejriwal has been with them. He is diabetic. He is asking to meet a diabetologist, he is asking for insulin. A normal doctor, I don't know how he is there in jail, on his recommendations all these manipulations are being done and the elected CM of Delhi is being denied insulin,"" he added.Earlier, Bharadwaj had alleged that a conspiracy is being hatched to kill Kejriwal by pushing him towards 'slow death'""Overall, it was a conspiracy to finish Kejriwal so his multiple organ damage and when he comes out of jail after 2-4 months he goes for treatment of kidney, heart and other organs,"" he said.""Arvind Kejriwal has been suffering from diabetes for 20-22 years. He has been on insulin for 12 years. Once a patient goes on insulin, his sugar can be controlled only with insulin,"" he added.Meanwhile, the Tihar Jail administration on Saturday submitted its report regarding Kejriwal's health status to Delhi Lieutenant Governor. According to the report, Delhi CM was on insulin for diabetes control. The report also called it 'incorrect' to say that the chief minister was being denied insulin by jail authorities.Earlier on Friday, Kejriwal's council senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi said that the jailed CM has been denied insulin to control his blood sugar level since his arrest, terming it 'shocking' and 'alarming.'Previously, the Enforcement Directorate had claimed that Kejriwal, despite having type 2 diabetes, was purposefully eating food with high sugar intake like mangoes and sweets everyday to create grounds for a medical bail or shift to a hospital.However, Kejriwal refuted the central agency's claim in the court and asserted that the food he consumed was in conformity with the diet chart prepared by his doctor.Kejriwal was arrested by the ED on March 21 in connection with a money laundering probe relating to alleged irregularities in the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22.

"If Bengaluru stops saying 'yuck' to treated waste water, it'll never go thirsty: Experts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-bengaluru-stops-saying-yuck-to-treated-waste-water-itll-never-go-thirsty-experts/articleshow/109473216.cms,"BENGALURU: Back in 2016, Centre for Ecological Sciences (CES) of Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, figured a way for the IT hub to stay water surplus. On an average, 20.05 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) of water is required every year for domestic purposes, CES's technical report established. Of which about 16.04 TMC, about 80 percent, could be met just by treating sewage water, suggested the report.Add to this, the rain yield, which is about 14.80TMC a year and Bengaluru could easily meet its water needs, the report stated. Cut to 2023. Some apartment owners of Emmanuel Heights in Hosa Road, Sarjapur, proposed setting up a sewage treatment plant in October. Little did they know that it would take them almost six months to convince the others.""They all agreed only after the firm setting up the sewage treatment equipment put it in the agreement that they will buy all the treated water. Many people were adamant that not a drop of the treated water should be used inside the complex. Forget drinking, they did not even want the treated water for watering the plants, because they have the tulsi plant,"" said Gopidas, a software engineer at Amazon who resides at Immanuel Heights.S Vishwanath, Bengaluru's go-to man for water conservancy and director of Biome Environmental Solutions is a long-time advocate of treated wastewater for drinking. According to him, it is now all in the mind, as science has already shown that it is perfectly fine to drink treated wastewater.""People are finding it difficult to wrap their head around drinking what they consider sewage. All things said against it are mostly stemming out of ignorance. Science has already advanced far enough for us to drink treated wastewater without causing any health problems,"" Vishwanath told PTI.Little over 10 days ago, investment whiz Nithin Kamath, founder and CEO of Zerodha and Rainmatter Foundation, propped up Boson White Water, a Bengaluru-based firm that converts wastewater into potable water, stating that wastewater could be the part of the solution for Bengaluru's water shortage crisis , on X. Although some agreed with him, most were revulsed by the idea of drinking water that was once sewage.Replying to Kamath, people started saying, without any scientific backing, that treated water will have heavy metals or hormones and therefore is unfit for consumption. The concern also stemmed from the perception that sewage treatment plants are run in a very bad way.Vikas Brahmavar, one of the founders of the start-up Boson White Water, said they were deluged with calls after their promotional video forwarded by Kamath went viral.""In a day, we got more than 300 calls. We have been doing this for two years now, and at most we get a dozen calls every day,"" said Brahmavar to PTI.But Brahmavar said most of it again were attempts to reiterate that wastewater, treated or not, is smelly and dirty.""In these two years, we have come a long way. But we are yet to convince people to drink wastewater. It will take some more time to break through that psychological barrier. What people are failing to understand is that the moment we started depending on tankers for water supply, we are past the 'water is dirty' curve. Who knows where they get that water from,"" said Brahmavar.Vishwanath said people are also not realising that treated wastewater is already being consumed indirectly.He pointed out to the Lakshmi Sagara lake in Kolar, which is the first of 82 lakes in Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts to be filled with treated wastewater from an STP, as part of Koramangala-Challaghatta (KC) Valley project, in which the government plans to fill 134 lakes at the cost of Rs 1,342 crore.""The project is one of the first in India to formally use secondary treated wastewater at such large volumes to fill the tanks and river ecosystem and provide water for agricultural use,"" said Viswanath.He said his organisation, Biome Environmental Trust, did a study in June 2021 among the locals, mostly farmers, about the impact of the project, and found out that treated water-filled lakes and tanks increased the yields of borewells.""In Lakshmi Sagara, for instance, in three months of the lake being filled with treated wastewater, water level in open wells increased and in six months water level in borewells increased. Now, farmers here are cultivating throughout the year,"" he said.In the Biome report, the farmers that the researchers spoke to had confirmed that contrary to the negative assumptions earlier, which had delayed the project, they found that the effort had rejuvenated the depleted groundwater and that most are finding groundwater at 300 to 400 feet. Earlier it was difficult to find water even at 1,200 feet, they said, adding that they often dug between two to four borewells, due to previous ones failing to yield water.""In India, one estimate suggests that treated wastewater can annually irrigate about 1 to 1.5million hectares of land. I think proper hydrogeology and aquifer mapping studies need to be done to establish the impact on recharge better. ""But, this is the only way forward for us to cut down our dependence on rain. I also think if people start getting comfortable with non-potable uses, potable will follow. It's only a matter of time,"" said Viswanath.",Bengaluru has a water shortage of 20.05 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) per year. About 80 percent of this can be met by treating sewage water. But residents are not keen on drinking water that was once sewage. Some say treated water will have heavy metals or hormones.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109473987,imgsize-14652,width-400,resizemode-4/109473987.jpg"

Maldives' polls today a test of President Mohamed Muizzu's India policy too,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maldives-sunday-polls-a-test-of-muizzus-india-policy-too/articleshow/109464698.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maldives will vote today in the country's 4th multi-party Parliamentary elections that will also put to the test for the first time President Mohamed Muizzu's hostile India policy , especially the decision to throw out Indian military personnel from the Indian Ocean archipelago.The Indian government is hoping that the main opposition and pro-India party - Maldivian Democratic party (MDP) - will win a majority, leading to an effective legislative oversight of executive power.Ahead of the voting, the leader of MDP and former foreign minister, Abdulla Shahid, told TOI his party is optimistic about winning as the Muizzu administration has failed in the past 5 months in both domestic and foreign policies and the Maldivian people are also seeing a regression of democratic values under his watch.Shahid said Muizzu came into office by ""mongering lies and hate"" and all development projects have been halted. ""Intimidation of employees in state owned companies has returned with a vengeance. Thousands of people from the opposition have been threatened with suspension and termination from their jobs. There are calls to restrict delivery of essential services based on political affiliation,"" said Shahid, also a former president of the UN General Assembly.""Waste and corruption is rampant. People are clearly seeing the regression of democratic values and principles under this administration. And we are confident that they will show their response in their vote tomorrow."" he added, while underlining the significance of strong legislative oversight.The supervision of the exercise of executive authority and ensuring it's accountable for the exercise of its powers is an important constituent of the law-making powers of the 93-member People's Majlis. While the MDP is hoping to retain majority, if not repeat its 2019 ""super majority"" of 65 seats that thinned out later because of large-scale defections, the ruling People's National Congress (PNC) alliance is stressing the significance of a majority in People's Majlis for the president's development initiatives. Significantly, Muizzu, whose party had benefited from MDP defections, ratified last week an anti-defection law which was passed by Parliament earlier this month.Often described as a pro-China leader, Muizzu defeated his MDP predecessor Ibrahim Solih last year in a presidential poll seen internationally as a face-off between India and China. His pro-China image has held since then as he jetted off to Beijing in January, becoming the first democratically elected Maldivian president to visit China before travelling to India, and signed a bagful of agreements, including for defence cooperation. This was preceded by his decisions to expel Indian troops, who operated Indian naval choppers for HADR activities, and to walk out of an agreement that allowed the Indian Navy to carry out hydrographic surveys in the Maldivian waters.In his campaign for the Parliamentary polls, Muizzu, who attained office on the back of an India Out campaign, has often tom-tommed his eviction of Indian military staff and made snide remarks about India like accusing his predecessor of taking orders from a ""foreign government"".

APMC constructing a mall and five-star hotel is a scam: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apmc-constructing-a-mall-and-five-star-hotel-is-a-scam-sc/articleshow/109448949.cms,"NEW DELHI: Success in business may be most Gujarati’s alter ego but the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee of Surat took it to the next level by constructing a mall and a five-star hotel on its land, which was acquired by Gujarat govt in the 1960s for the benefit of farmers.A Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and J B Pardiwala castigated Surat APMC for frittering away land meant for welfare of farmers.“This is a scam of the highest proportion. How could the APMC have used the surplus land for a mall and five-star hotel? Which law authorized it to take such a decision?”Appearing for APMC, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said it was APMC’s land and the committee was free to put it to proper use for revenue generation. “How can the Gujarat HC direct the state to take over the land and property of APMC?” The hotel lease holder through senior advocate Nidhesh Gupta said there was no irregularity in the grant of the lease to run the hotel.The bench remained unconvinced and said the HC passed the extreme order considering the level of irregularity in allotment of APMC land for a hotel and a mall. It dismissed the appeal of both the APMC and the leaseholder of the hotel.The HC bench of CJ Sunita Agarwal and Aniruddha Mayee on March 27 had ordered the state to take possession of APMC’s five-star hotel constructed on the market yard’s land. It also ordered a public auction of the property and directed authorities to deposit the amount to the state's market funds.The bench ordered action against erring officials and APMC members responsible for construction of the luxurious hotel, which violated the aims and objectives of the market yard, for which the govt had acquired about 14,000 sq mt land.The HC ordered the director of Agriculture, Marketing and Rural Finance to conduct inspection of ‘Krushi Bazar’ on allegations by a petitioner that shops in the mall were leased for sale of items like jewellery and clothes. It ordered closure of all activities in the mall that were not for the welfare of the farmers.The SC’s view found broader acceptance in the December 2019 report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture.

"Meet Vasuki Indicus, the ‘crocodile’ that was a 50ft snake",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-vasuki-indicus-the-crocodile-that-was-a-50ft-snake/articleshow/109414059.cms,"NEW DELHI/ROORKEE: A fossil found in 2005 from Gujarat’s Kutch and believed till now to be that of a giant crocodile has turned out to be of one of the largest snakes that ever existed on Earth .The discovery of ‘ Vasuki Indicus ’ by scientists of IIT , Roorkee could prove to be a “jackpot” of information of the evolutionary process, continental shift and India’s vital link to origin of many species, especially reptiles, researchers say.According to Sunil Bajpai, chair professor in IIT-Roorkee’s department of earth sciences, this serpent measuring between 11m (36ft) and 15m (49.22ft) could have been even longer than the now extinct Titanoboa, which once lived in Colombia. The closest relatives of ‘Vasuki Indicus’, the study finds, are Titanoboa and python.Researchers said the large size of ‘Vasuki Indicus’, named after the mythical king of serpents usually depicted round the neck of Shiva and in reference to its country of discovery, would have made it a slow-moving, ambush predator akin to an anaconda.The study named, ‘Largest known madtsoiid snake from warm Eocene period of India suggests intercontinental Gondwana dispersal”, was published in ‘Scientific Reports’ on ‘Springer Nature’ platform on Friday.Bajpai and post-doctoral fellow Debajit Datta from IIT-Roorkee said the fossil of this snake recovered from the Panandhro Lignite Mine in Kutch dates back to Middle Eocene period, approximately 47 million years ago. During their exploration, the researchers discovered 27 well-preserved vertebrae that appear to be from a fully grown reptile. Its length makes it the the largest known madtsoiid snake, which thrived during a warm geological interval with average temperatures estimated at 28°C.On the finding which is as much scientific as much accidental, Bajpai said: “The fossil was found in 2005, but since I have been working on different other fossils, it went on the backburner. In 2022, we started re-examining the fossil. Initially, due to its size, I thought it was of a crocodile. But then we realised it was of a snake and it turned out to be the biggest in its family and possibly one of the biggest and similar to Titanoboa.”The scientists claim that comparing its inter-relationship with other Indian and North African madtsoiids, ‘Vasuki’ represents a now-extinct relic lineage that originated in India. Subsequent India-Asia collision led to intercontinental dispersal of this lineage from the subcontinent into North Africa through southern Eurasia. “Though this discovery we have been able to show that we have some of the most remarkable snakes in India as well as other species,” said Bajpai, who along with his fellow reserachers had also discovered the fossil of a plant-eating dinosaur believed to be 167 million years old, in Jaisalmer last year.","'Vasuki Indicus' could prove to be a ‘jackpot’ of information of the evolutionary process, continental shift and India’s vital link to origin of many species, especially reptiles.

INDIA alliance tries to convince TMC for joint manifesto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-alliance-tries-to-convince-tmc-for-joint-manifesto/articleshow/109465647.cms,"TMC objects to caste census in manifesto

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress has thrown a spanner in the works of the INDIA alliance plan to release a joint manifesto for the opposition bloc to convey a sense of purpose and unity going forward in the Lok Sabha elections .Well-placed sources said efforts are on to bring TMC chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee around by impressing upon her the urgency to put out a minimal consensus document laying out the promises of the opposition to the voters as her opposition is proving to be the main stumbling block to its release.Sources said TMC has objected to the inclusion of “caste census” in the joint document, which is in line with its earlier red flag to the flagship policy measure on social justice. However, TMC had in the past come around when the INDIA grouping in one of its meetings succeeded in putting “caste census” in its agenda document, and then also repeated it in the public rallies.For the TMC to again raise an objection to the promise that if voted to power, the opposition will hold a nationwide headcount to determine the population of OBCs as well as other communities, appears to have raised doubts in key opposition quarters behind the intention of the Bengal outfit. Sources said the TMC appears more keen to stall the joint document, and is only using “caste census” as a pretext. Meanwhile, Mamata again on Saturday accused Congress and CPM for being hand in glove with BJP in West Bengal, and said “I had coined the name INDIA, but INDIA doesn’t exist in Bengal, it exists outside the state”.Sources said there is no point in releasing a document without “caste census” because it is a key plank of the Congress manifesto, and there is an unanimity on it in the coalition barring the TMC. Else, the option is to unveil the manifesto without the TMC’s support.The joint document is also likely to have a few key flagship promises made by Congress in its manifesto, on which there is practically an agreement with other constituents of the India bloc ."," Trinamool Congress has thrown a spanner in the works of the INDIA alliance plan to release a joint manifesto for the opposition bloc.

At the time of his arrest, he was taking only Metformin, a basic anti-diabetes oral medication, according to officials referencing the Tihar report.During his medical assessments in Tihar jail, Kejriwal informed doctors that he had been using insulin for the past few years but stopped its usage a few months ago, as stated in the report.""At the time of arrest, he was just taking a basic anti-diabetes oral medicine tablet Metformin... During his medical check-ups in Tihar Jail, CM Kejriwal told Doctors that he was taking insulin till last few years and stopped taking insulin a few months back allegedly by a Telangana Doctor… Also, as per the MLC report available from RML Hospital, Kejriwal was neither advised any insulin nor any requirement of any insulin was indicated,"" the report read.""On 10.04.2024 and 15.04.2024, Kejriwal was reviewed by Medicine Specialist and advised oral anti-diabetic drugs / medicines... it is incorrect to state that Kejriwal was denied insulin at any point of time during his treatment,"" it added.Kejriwal was apprehended on March 21 by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a money-laundering case related to the Delhi government's defunct excise policy.

Louvre exhibition shows how Panchatantra went 'viral',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/louvre-exhibition-shows-how-panchatantra-went-viral/articleshow/109469009.cms,"Louvre Abu Dhabi revisits 3rd century Indian animal folk tales as the source of most

fables

in the Arab world and beyond

(Picture credit: : Ismail Noor/Seeing Things)

Panchatantra ’s cautionary tale of the dog with a bone – the one who mistakes his own image in the water for another dog with a better bone only to learn a hard lesson on how greed robs and corrupts – is etched in gold as part of a 14th century Iraqi manuscript currently on display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi (LAD).Called ‘From Kalila wa Dimna to La Fontaine: Travelling through Fables’, the exhibition explores how Indian fables went ‘viral’ across the ancient world and were translated in many tongues to resonate through the ages.The show hops from India’s very own animal tales compiled in the 3rd century to its Arabic descendant in Kalila wa Dimna, and all the way up to French fabulist Jean de La Fontaine’s ‘Selected Fables’ in the 17th century. Kalila wa Dimna was translated and compiled in the 8th century by one of the greats of Arabic prose, Ibn Al Muqaffa. His translation of the Panchatantra from Middle Persian later led to the Sanskrit text being rendered in Greek, Latin, Persian, Hebrew and Old Spanish among other languages.An 18th century manuscript of the Panchatantra is one of the exhibits.LAD was born in 2017 after an agreement between the governments of Abu Dhabi and France, and envisioned as “the first universal museum of the Arab world”. “We are a storytelling museum; we speak the connected stories of our shared humanity. So, it makes a lot of sense for us to propose an exhibition dedicated to storytelling and fables. It’s a mirror of what we are,” says LAD director Manuel Rabaté.Panchatantra champions principles of good governance, statecraft and lessons in power through anthropomorphic animal characters. So, the two jackals, Karataka and Damanaka – ministers to the lion king Pingalaka in Panchatantra – become Kalila and Dimna in Muqaffa’s Arabic translation. “I feel I have been living with the two jackals for a long time now,” laughs Annie Vernay Nouri, former chief curator at the oriental manuscripts department of Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), which is one of the main collaborators of the exhibition. Nouri did years of research on Kalila wa Dimna and first thought of holding an exhibition on travelling tales almost ten years ago.The exhibition features an 18th century palm-leaf manuscript of the Panchatantra and a 17th century Hitopadesha paper manuscript, both acquired from BnF. There is also a reproduction of an 8th century Indonesian sculpture depicting the Kacchapa-Jataka (The Talkative Turtle) which appeared in the original Panchatantra. The story of the talkative turtle and the two ducks appeared on Indian and Indonesian sculptures before the illustrated Arab manuscripts.The exhibition also highlights how certain stories from Panchatantra were revised to align with prevailing notions of justice. For example, the Indian tale of the Lion and the Bull ends with the death of the bull. But in Kalila wa Dimna, Muqaffa adds a chapter where Dimna, who is responsible for the lion and bull’s fight, is judged and punished for his crime. Dimna’s trial is a perfect example of how anyone who acts badly will be severely punished. In Panchatantra, however, the law of the strongest prevails.“Like Kalila wa Dimna, Panchatantra continues to be read and exists in several other forms – from cartoons to books, movies, theatre and even television shows. No original manuscript of Panchatantra survives but versions written and illustrated in the 17th and 18th century exist. I have seen the illustrated ones at Musée Guimet in their oriental collections department only recently,” says Nouri, saying it was a challenge sourcing the scattered remains of Panchatantra in existing manuscripts for the exhibition.The LAD exhibition also features the Kalila wa Dimna manuscript in Arabic, the earliest known illustrated version produced around 1220 AD. There are over 130 other artworks on display --- from rare manuscripts, paintings, to contemporary works, AI-driven-make-your-own-fable panels and more. They all depict narratives of friendship, loyalty, cunning and morality through the travails of envious cats, clever monkeys, devoted bears, quick-thinking rats and the like.The cross-cultural spread of Kalila wa Dimna is often compared to that of the Bible. When it reached Fontaine – whose pithy tales continue to enrich French school curriculum – he acknowledged Panchatantra’s influence in his work filtered through Kalila wa Dimna. “The crusades had brought the European mind in contact with Indian works (Panchatantra and Hitopadesa) in their Arabic dress. Translations and imitations in the European tongues were speedily multiplied,” wrote La Fontaine’s translator.BnF dates back to the 14th century. It was originally the library of the king of France but became a public library after the French Revolution. BnF hosts a huge collection of eastern manuscripts, from Arabic to Indian to those from the Far East, through a set of donations and acquisitions. “Fontaine, who was inspired by both eastern and western traditions of fables while writing his own, is as important a literary figure as French playwright Moliere. His fables, which schoolchildren learn by heart, promote basic morals and universal, secular values. Teachers ensure these values are well transmitted. Many artists, too, have been inspired by these fables,” says Emmanuel Coquery, director of Museum and Culture and BnF.LAD also plans to have more exhibitions integrating India. “About 10-12% of our guests at LAD are Indians , as tourists and those living and working in the UAE. We have several Indian artworks in our permanent collection. On June 21, we have a big yoga practice under the dome of the museum. I am also pushing my team to launch a club dedicated entirely to the Indian friends of Louvre Abu Dhabi just like American Friends of the Louvre (AFL),” adds Rabaté.‘From Kalila wa Dimna to La Fontaine: Travelling through Fables’ is on view at the Louvre Abu Dhabi till July 21.",The exhibition explores how Indian fables went ‘viral’ across the ancient world and were translated in many tongues. The show hops from India’s very own animal tales compiled in the 3rd century to its Arabic descendant in Kalila wa Dimna.

Leading a monastic life means the Bhandaris would have nothing to do with their property and business, worth over Rs 100 crore.A native of Sabarkantha, Bhavesh Bhandari recently made headlines when he donated food, clothes and cash during the grand procession held as part of the initiation ceremony.

How many Bitcoin halving are left?

The world of cryptocurrency witnessed another significant event as Bitcoin underwent its latest ""halving"" on Friday, effectively halving the mining reward and potentially influencing the currency’s future market dynamics. This pre-programmed adjustment occurs every four years and is critical for managing Bitcoin's supply. Following the event, Bitcoin's price remained relatively stable at approximately $63,907.With the reduction in new Bitcoin production, various implications arise for miners and the overall market, stirring both concerns and expectations among investors and analysts.Here is all you need to knowBitcoin ""halving"" is an automatic adjustment to the reward miners receive for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Initially set to distribute 50 bitcoins per block, this reward halves every 210,000 blocks. The latest halving reduced the reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins per block. This mechanism ensures that the total supply of Bitcoin caps at 21 million, a design to introduce scarcity, akin to precious metals like gold.Miners face a direct impact from halving as their earnings from rewards drop by 50%, which can significantly affect their profitability. Given the high costs associated with mining—such as electricity and hardware—reduced rewards mean that only the most efficient mining operations can sustain profitability. This could lead to increased consolidation in the industry, where only key players survive, potentially increasing the centralization of mining operations.Historically, halving events have preceded substantial increases in Bitcoin’s price. For instance, post-2020 halving, Bitcoin's price surged nearly seven-fold by the following year. However, experts like Adam Morgan McCarthy caution that past performance may not reliably predict future results, and other market conditions also heavily influence prices. Analysts remain divided, with some predicting significant rallies and others cautioning that the effects of halving might already be priced into the market.Beyond its impact on mining and prices, halving is viewed as a measure to preserve Bitcoin's value over time by controlling inflation. This scarcity mechanism is crucial for Bitcoin’s proposition as 'digital gold'. However, the reduced supply can also exacerbate price volatility in response to fluctuating demand.Environmental impact directly related to bitcoin halving remains somewhat uncertain. However, it is a well known fact that crypto mining consumes a significant amount of energy, with operations relying on polluting sources.The profitability pressures could push miners towards cheaper, potentially less environmentally friendly energy sources unless countered by technological advancements and regulatory measures.A recent study conducted by the United Nations University and published in Earth's Future journal revealed that the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining across 76 countries in 2020-2021 was equal to the emissions generated by burning 84 billion pounds of coal or operating 190 natural gas-fired power plants. The study found that coal accounted for the majority of bitcoin's electricity requirements (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).There are expected to be 64 Bitcoin halvings before the 21 million cap is reached sometime around 2140 At that point, halvings will cease and the blockchain will stop issuing new tokens.(With inputs from agencies)","Bitcoin underwent its latest ""halving"" on Friday, effectively halving the mining reward.

Deductions that can be claimed under old tax regime

New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime: Selecting the most tax-efficient income tax regime, either the old or new, can be a challenging decision for many salaried taxpayers. The optimal choice depends on the amount of deductions from gross total income that can be claimed to reduce the taxable income. If the gross total income and the minimum amount of deductions at which the tax liability would be the same under both the new tax regime and the old tax regime were known, the decision would be straightforward.When deductions exceed this minimum threshold, the old tax regime would be more advantageous, while the new tax regime would result in lower taxes if the deductions fall below this level.When determining the tax regime for TDS on salary, taxpayers typically use estimated figures for gross total income and proposed deductions. However, once the financial year concludes and the final income and deduction figures are available, precise calculations must be performed before selecting an income tax regime while filing the income tax return. Taxpayers can change the tax regime chosen by them earlier at the time of filing income tax return, provided they file within the deadline. Also, one very important point to note is that the new income tax regime is now the default tax regime, so if you don’t tell your employer your preferred regime, the tax will be deducted as per the new tax regime.The income tax laws under the new tax regime underwent revisions effective from April 1, 2023, and remain unchanged for the current FY, 2024-25 (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025). The new tax regime offers a basic income exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh for all taxpayers and introduces additional income tax slabs with reduced tax rates.Also Read | Old vs New Income Tax Regime for TDS on salary: Will post-election Budget 2024 impact your choice? Under the new tax regime, salaried individuals are entitled to two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from their salary or pension income, and an employer's contribution to their NPS account, which can be up to 10% of their salary (or 14% of the basic salary for government employees), states an ET report.When comparing the tax regimes, it's crucial to note that the minimum deductions required to equalize the tax outgo in both regimes vary depending on the income level. Individuals with different gross taxable incomes, such as Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, will need to claim different total deductions in the old tax regime to make the tax payable equal in both regimes. If an individual's actual total deduction in the old tax regime falls below this break-even level, the new tax regime becomes more advantageous.To illustrate this point, ET considers the example of two individuals, A and B, with gross taxable incomes of Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, respectively. Both can claim a deduction of Rs 2.5 lakh in a financial year, which includes a standard deduction of Rs 50,000.The above table shows that for Mr A with gross taxable income of Rs 8 lakh, the final tax amount payable is lower in the old tax regime if the total deduction of Rs 2.5 lakh is claimed.However, despite the same deduction amount, Mr B with a gross taxable income of Rs 12 lakh will find the tax outgo lower in the new tax regime. The old tax regime will be favourable for a person with taxable income of Rs 12 lakh only if more deductions are claimed.Under the old tax regime, individuals can avail various deductions from their gross total income and claim tax exemptions. Both salaried and non-salaried individuals can claim deductions of up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C by making specified investments and expenditures. These include investing in Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), ELSS mutual fund, repayment of principal of home loan and payment of children's tuition fees.Also Read | New versus Old regime: Does opting for the old income tax regime for TDS on salary make ITR processing, refunds easier? In addition to Section 80C, individuals can claim an extra deduction of Rs 50,000 for investments made in the National Pension System (NPS) according to specified rules, bringing the total deduction to Rs 2 lakh. Deductions can also be claimed for health insurance premium payments, with the amount varying based on the individual's age and whether the policy covers their parents.Furthermore, individuals can claim a deduction of Rs 2 lakh for interest paid on a home loan during the financial year, while interest paid on an education loan is eligible for deduction under Section 80E without any monetary limit. Savings account interest is eligible for deduction under Section 80TTA, and senior citizens can claim a deduction of Rs 50,000 under Section 80TTB for interest earned from various deposits, including savings accounts and fixed deposits.","The income tax laws under the new tax regime underwent revisions effective from April 1, 2023. salaried individuals are entitled to two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from their salary or pension income, and an employer's contribution to their NPS account, which can be up to 10% of their salary.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109474362,imgsize-22570,width-400,resizemode-4/109474362.jpg"
"Climate Change Blamed for Dubai Floods, Not Cloud Seeding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/climate-change-blamed-for-dubai-floods-not-cloud-seeding/articleshow/109408915.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: Many wondered whether it was cloud seeding - a weather modification technique to induce rains - that led to flooding of Dubai, but scientists involved in such projects in India categorically dismissed any link, and meteorologists and climatologists rather blamed climate change for the record precipitation in arid West Asia.Since parched UAE periodically conducts cloud seeding to increase level of its dwindling groundwater, extreme rainfall between Monday night and Tuesday evening raised questions on the artificial rain mechanism.The country received a record 255 mm of rain in less than 24 hours, flooding Dubai.Though it rained heavily in neighbouring Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well, Dubai in UAE faced the maximum impact.IIT Kanpur professor Sachchida Nand Tripathi, who is closely involved with the cloud seeding project in India said, there was no connection between cloud seeding and the floods in Dubai. “Seeding is tried at an early stage of storm development. In this case when the system progressed from the Gulf of Oman it was already an intensified storm. It is highly unlikely and unsafe to seed such systems. Seeding can at max contribute to 25% enhancement in rainfall. In this case the total rainfall was 25 cm. So even without seeding 20 cm of rainfall would have happened,” Tripathi toldEven distinguished climate scientist and former secretary in the ministry of earth science (MoES), Madhavan Rajeevan, dismissed the possibility of any link, saying cloud seeding cannot trigger such heavy rainfall and floods.Asked about likely reasons, he said, “This is absolutely a clear signal of climate change. It was a huge thunderstorm caused by a synoptic system which was moving across the Gulf region. With global warming there is now a tendency that if it rains, it rains very heavily. We should expect this kind of events more frequently in any part of the world and at any time.”Former chief of India Meteorological Department (IMD), K J Ramesh, too believed that cloud seeding was not the primary cause for the downpour. “Western disturbance-triggered extreme rainfall event development is the primary cause of the floods in the region,""he said.On its link with climate change, Ramesh said, “It is well known that any rain bearing system will become stronger under changing climate - global warming regime as warming enables atmospheric clouds to hold extra moisture and grow bigger and bigger leading to enhanced intensity of rain bearing systems.”Elaborating on the weather phenomena, he said, “Southward extension of passing westerly wave trough, supported by additional moisture feed from Arabian Sea, basically caused extreme weather events, causing unprecedented quantum of rainfall over not only UAE but also over Oman, north Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar.""Prior to this, a similar westerly wave gave heavy rainfall spells for two days over Afghanistan, leading to floods, thunderstorms and lightning over Pakistan”.On the UAE’s cloud seeding project, Ramesh said the country through its Rainfall Enhancing Experiment, launched in 2002, has been trying to carry out aircraft based cloud seeding as and when rain bearing weather systems develop over the surrounding regions. “Through such efforts, the cloud seeding team was able to enhance the quantum of rainfall up to 15% over and above the rainfall otherwise occurring any way naturally.”","The country received a record 255 mm of rain in less than 24 hours, flooding Dubai.

Indian-origin men involved in Canada's largest-ever gold and money heist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indian-origin-men-involved-in-canadas-largest-ever-gold-and-money-heist/articleshow/109415390.cms,"It was a brazen theft: thousands of gold bars and millions of dollars in bank notes stolen a year ago from Toronto's international airport.Canadian and US authorities said on Wednesday six people, including two Indian-origin men , have been arrested and three more are being sought in connection with what they called the largest gold heist in Canadian history - a cargo of over C$22 million ($16 million) in gold and currency.The arrests were announced after a long-year investigation under Project 24K. The suspects, including two Air Canada employees, forged an airway bill to steal a cargo arriving from Switzerland of C$20 million-worth 6,600 gold bars weighing 400 kg and C$2.5 million in foreign currency, police officials said. The gold was melted down and used to purchase illegal firearms. ""This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,"" said Nishan Duraiappah, chief of Peel police, responsible for law enforcement at Toronto airport .The gold theft appeared to be remarkably simple. The gold and cash arrived at the Toronto airport in a special container aboard an Air Canada flight from Switzerland on April 17, 2023, and it was moved to one of the airline's warehouses. The container held gold bars that were destined for a Toronto-based bank and bank notes bound for a currency exchange. About two hours later, a truck driven by a man who was arrested in Pennsylvania pulled up at the warehouse. The man carried a waybill - a document usually issued by a carrier with details about a shipment - that gave him access to the warehouse. It was actually a duplicate of a waybill, printed on an Air Canada printer, for a shipment of seafood that had been picked up a day earlier. The container with the gold bars and bank notes was loaded into the truck. Video recordings showed the truck travelling down Canada's busiest highway before eventually disappearing from sight in a rural area west of the city.Peel police officers were called early the next morning after an armoured truck of Brinks, an American cash handling company, arrived with the actual waybill for the shipment of gold and bank notes. Canada police said Wednesday that they believe the gold bars, which had serial numbers, were all melted down and that they had seized smelting pots. The only gold recovered, police said, was six bracelets made out of C$89,000 worth of gold.Air Canada employee Parmpal Sidhu, 54, from Brampton, Ontario, jewellery store owner Ali Raza, 37, from Toronto, Amit Jalota, 40, an Oakville, Ontario resident, Ammad Chaudhary, 43, from Georgetown, Ontario and Prasath Paramalingam, 35, from Brampton are among those that have been arrested. According to a PTI report, Sidhu and Jalota are of Indian origin. Police are searching for former Air Canada manager Simran Preet Panesar, 31, from Brampton as well as Archit Grover, 36, from Brampton and Arsalan Chaudhary, 42, from Ontario.Peel detective sergeant Mike Mavity said the truck driver that allegedly picked up the gold, Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old from Brampton, is currently in custody in the US. Sixty-five illegal firearms were found in his possession, two of which had been modified to have fully automatic capabilities.They were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada.

Trump's Save America Group spends big on legal fees; falls behind Biden at fundraising,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-group-spends-big-on-legal-fees-biden-leads-at-fundraising/articleshow/109473387.cms,"with input from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Donald Trump's political campaign group, disclosed spending 3.6 million US dollars on lawyer fees in February. Trump, currently facing four criminal trials, is aggressively campaigning to challenge Biden in the upcoming presidential election on November 5. The Save America group , which handles Trump's legal expenses and reported the expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, relies heavily on contributions from small donors .Although Save America managed to cover its expenses through a 5 million US dollar refund from a super PAC linked to Trump's campaign, it has now retrieved over $52 million out of the $60 million previously allocated to the PAC. This retrieval reportedly has significantly reduced the amount of funds available for television advertisements supporting Trump's campaign.Trump's legal battles include charges related to falsifying business records to conceal payments to a porn star, attempting to overturn his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election, mishandling classified documents post-presidency, and appealing a substantial civil fraud judgment. Moreover, financial challenges are looming over Trump's political operations, as shown in recent disclosures to the Federal Election Commission.Despite raising $15 million in March, Trump's campaign continues to trail Biden in fundraising, with Biden's campaign amassing over $43 million and holding $85 million in reserves, compared to Trump's $45 million.While campaign contributions are crucial for activities such as advertisements, staffing, and rallies, they do not solely determine the election outcome.Trump, who was outpaced by Hillary Clinton in fundraising during the 2016 election, still emerged victorious. Despite a decline in contributions from small donors, Trump has intensified efforts to attract major donors in recent weeks, aiding the Republican Party in raising over $20 million in March.MAGA Inc, the super PAC supporting Trump, closed March with $33 million in reserves, while Future Forward, the primary Democratic super PAC backing Biden, reported over $41 million in funds.","Donald Trump's political campaign group, disclosed spending 3.6 million US dollars on lawyer fees in February.

Will there be a 'superbloom' this year in California?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-there-be-a-superbloom-this-year-in-california/articleshow/109473197.cms,"NEW DELHI: The vast deserts of Southern California , the dramatic bluffs of the Bay Area, and even the areas near Los Angeles International Airport are starting to be covered in carpets of yellow, orange, and gold flowers However, the question remains: do these blooms qualify as a "" superbloom ""? The term lacks a single definition, and this year's blooms have not been as vibrant or abundant as those that blanketed parts of California last spring following drought-busting rains, despite the state receiving ample winter rains this year as well.After particularly wet winters, bursts of color may appear in the spring, attracting throngs of visitors to California and other parts of the Southwest to witness the flowering fields and capture photographs. Scientists do not agree on a single definition of a superbloom. In California and Arizona, there are areas of desert that can quickly transform into dense fields of wildflowers , as seeds lie dormant in the soil and then germinate and blossom at around the same time.According to Naomi Fraga , director of conservation programs at the California Botanic Garden , this year's blooms do not qualify as a superbloom due to the lack of huge diversity in the flowers that have blossomed in places like California's Death Valley. The wildflower display this year, while still beautiful, is not as large or dense as in past years. Evan Meyer, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Theodore Payne Foundation, believes that whether this year's blooms constitute a superbloom is ""really in the eye of the beholder.""April is typically the peak month for spring wildflowers, but in high-elevation places, they can continue to blossom later into the spring. Superblooms generally refer to low-elevation desert regions, and the timing is more geographic than seasonal. When temperatures rise in the desert, the flowers can quickly dry out. The effects of climate change on wildflowers could play out over decades or even centuries, as seeds stay dormant in the soil for long periods of time. Southern California's unusual heavy rain last summer and higher than average winter temperatures have contributed to an unusual bloom this year.","After particularly wet winters, bursts of color may appear in the spring.

Artificial Intelligence has a measurement problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/artificial-intelligence-has-a-measurement-problem/articleshow/109468730.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: There's a problem with leading artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude: We don't really know how smart they are. That's because, unlike companies that make cars or drugs or baby formula, AI companies aren't required to submit their products for testing before releasing them to the public.Users are left to rely on the claims of AI companies, which often use vague, fuzzy phrases like ""improved capabilities"" to describe how their models differ from one version to the next.Models are updated so frequently that a chatbot that struggles with a task one day might mysteriously excel at it the next. Shoddy measurement also creates a safety risk. Without better tests for AI models , it's hard to know which capabilities are improving faster than expected, or which products might pose real threats of harm.In this year's AI Index - a big annual report put out by Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence - the authors describe poor measurement as one of the biggest challenges facing AI researchers. ""The lack of standardized evaluation makes it extremely challenging to systematically compare the limitations and risks of various AI models,"" said editor-in-chief, Nestor Maslej.For years, the most popular method for measuring AI was the Turing Test - an exercise proposed in 1950 by mathematician Alan Turing, which tests whether a computer program can fool a person into mistaking its responses for a human's. But today's AI systems can pass the Turing Test with flying colors, and researchers have had to come up with harder evaluations.One of the most common tests given to AI models today - the SAT for chatbots, essentially - is a test known as Massive Multitask Language Understanding, or MMLU.The MMLU, which was released in 2020, consists of a collection of roughly 16,000 multiple-choice questions covering dozens of academic subjects, ranging from abstract algebra to law and medicine. It's supposed to be a kind of general intelligence test - the more a chatbot answers correctly, the smarter it is.It has become the gold standard for AI companies competing for dominance. (When Google released its most advanced AI model, Gemini Ultra , earlier this year, it boasted that it had scored 90% on the MMLU - the highest score ever recorded.)Dan Hendrycks, an AI safety researcher who helped develop the MMLU while in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, said that while he thought MMLU ""probably has another year or two of shelf life,"" it will soon need to be replaced by different, harder tests. AI systems are getting too smart for the tests we have now, and it's getting more difficult to design new ones.There are dozens of other tests out there - with names including TruthfulQA and HellaSwag - that are meant to capture other facets of AI performance. But these tests are capable of measuring only a narrow slice of an AI system's power. And none of them are designed to answer the more subjective questions many users have, such as: Is this chatbot fun to talk to? Is it better for automating routine office work, or creative brainstorming? How strict are its safety guardrails?There is a problem known as ""data contamination,"" when the questions and answers for benchmark tests are included in an AI model's training data, essentially allowing it to cheat. And there is no independent testing or auditing process for these models, meaning that AI companies are essentially grading their own homework. In short, AI measurement is a mess - a tangle of sloppy tests, apples-to-oranges comparisons and self-serving hype that has left users, regulators and AI developers themselves grasping in the dark.""Despite the appearance of science, most developers really judge models based on vibes or instinct,"" said Nathan Benaich, an AI investor with Air Street Capital. ""That might be fine for the moment, but as these models grow in power and social relevance, it won't suffice."" The solution here is likely a combination of public and private efforts.Governments can, and should, come up with robust testing programs that measure both the raw capabilities and the safety risks of AI models, and they should fund grants and research projects aimed at coming up with new, high-quality evaluations.In its executive order on AI last year, the White House directed several federal agencies, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to create and oversee new ways of evaluating AI systems."," AI companies aren't required to submit their products for testing before releasing them to the public.

""Musk cannot bring suit on an agreement that he cannot even plead into existence,"" according to the filing in state court in San Francisco.In his complaint, Musk quoted OpenAI's certificate of incorporation, in which the non-profit pledged to make its product available to the public. But the pledge was not open-ended, OpenAI's lawyers said in their filing. ""In its certificate of incorporation, OpenAI expressed its intention to 'seek to open source technology for the public benefit when applicable,' thus recognizing from the outset that its mission required 'an ongoing conversation about what work should be open-sourced and what shouldn't.""Musk also faulted OpenAI for entering into a multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft, its principal funder. ""But Musk identifies no provision of the alleged 'Founding Agreement' that bars licensing of OpenAI's technology or precludes a third party from occupying a board observer seat,"" OpenAI's lawyers wrote.Musk couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Leaked report on corruption allegation against President Muizzu stirs controversy in Maldives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/leaked-report-on-corruption-allegation-against-president-muizzu-stirs-controversy-in-maldives/articleshow/109377801.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Maldives, opposition parties are calling for an investigation and possible impeachment of President Mohamed Muizzu in response to a leaked report dating back to 2018 alleging corruption.The parliamentary elections for the Majlis are scheduled for Sunday, ahead of which, the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and President Muizzu 's People's National Congress (PNC) have engaged in trading barbs and accusations against each other.The political turmoil began when an anonymous individual using the handle 'Hassan Kurusee' shared leaked intelligence reports on social media, which included documents from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Maldives Monetary Authority and the Maldives Police Service. These reports purportedly linked President Muizzu to financial misconduct, citing irregularities in money transfers to his personal bank account and suggesting possible involvement with politically exposed individuals, embezzlement, structured transactions, and the use of corporate entities to conceal fund origins.The allegations sparked a firestorm of reactions on social media, with demands from the MDP and People's National Front (PNF) for an official investigation into the matter. Former vice president Dr Mohamed Jameel Ahmed went a step further, calling for President Muizzu's impeachment based on the leaked intelligence reports. Jameel emphasized the importance of accountability in governance and urged President Muizzu to cooperate with independent investigations into the allegations, including those related to the Ras Male' development project and alleged excessive spending on public relations.President Muizzu responded to the corruption allegations on Tuesday, asserting that the opposition's attempts to implicate him were baseless and driven by desperation. He denied any wrongdoing and accused the opposition of leaking the reports to tarnish his reputation.""The same allegations had been made during his campaigns for mayor and President,"" he said adding, the response would also be the same as before.""While you attempt to pin something on me like this, you couldn't do it before and you can't do it now. There's nothing you can show against me no matter how far you take this,"" President said to Adhadhu.com.Despite calls from the opposition for government agencies to investigate the allegations, no official response has been issued regarding the authenticity of the leaked reports.","The political turmoil began when an anonymous individual using the handle 'Hassan Kurusee' shared leaked intelligence reports on social media.

Kenvue was not immediately available for comment, but said this week it was conducting its own assessment and working with health authorities to determine a course of action.Since Nigeria's recall, five other African countries have also pulled the product from shelves - Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa, where the drug was made.South Africa’s regulator has also recalled another batch of the syrup, which is used to treat coughs, hay fever and other allergic reactions in children.Diethylene glycol is toxic to humans when consumed and can result in acute kidney failure, although there have been no reports of harm in the latest incident.In the 2022 cases, the contamination in the syrups came from the raw materials used by manufacturers in India and Indonesia.The WHO said it was collaborating with both the manufacturer and regulatory authority in South Africa to investigate this for the Benylin paediatric syrup, and had information on the source of the raw ingredients used. It did not disclose the source.According to WHO, Kenvue said it tested the raw ingredients used in the syrup before manufacture, and ""no issues of concern were noted"".The agency said the possibility that the syrup was counterfeit was also ""under consideration as part of investigations"".","Nigeria's regulator recalled a batch of Benylin syrup last Wednesday.

Among them, 2.8 million are on long-term sick leave, while 206,000 are temporarily unwell.A report from last year highlighted that a significant portion of individuals on long-term sick leave were awaiting medical treatment, with the prospect of reducing waiting times to pre-2015 levels potentially reintegrating 25,000 individuals into the workforce. Over 50% of long-term sick individuals cited issues like depression, anxiety, or nervousness, often alongside their primary health condition.Sunak's office pointed out a tendency among healthcare professionals to issue prolonged sick notes instead of actively supporting individuals in returning to work, leading many to transition to long-term sickness benefits. ""We don't just need to change the sick note, we need to change the sick note culture , so the default becomes what work you can do – not what you can't,"" he said.Sunak proposed a potential shift in the assessment responsibility from general practitioners to healthcare workers tasked with providing objective evaluations of an individual's work capacity and the customized support needed for their reintegration.",British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is considering tightening the rules around long-term sick leave.
