"US president Joe Biden hikes tariffs on Chinese EVs, solar cells, steel, aluminum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-president-joe-biden-hikes-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-solar-cells-steel-aluminum-adding-to-tensions-with-beijing/articleshow/110114790.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration announced plans to slap new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells , steel, aluminum and medical equipment - an election-year move that's likely to increase friction between the world's two largest economies.The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China.The tariffs are unlikely to have much of an inflationary impact because of how they're structured. Administration officials said they think the tariffs won't escalate tensions with China, yet they expect that China will explore ways to respond to the new taxes on their products. It's uncertain what the long-term impact on prices could be if the tariffs contribute to a wider trade dispute.The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminum and more. There are currently very few EVs from China in the US, but officials worry that low-priced models made possible by Chinese government subsidies could soon start flooding the US market.Chinese firms can sell EVs for as little as $12,000. Their solar cell plants and steel and aluminum mills have enough capacity to meet much of the world's demand, with Chinese officials arguing that their production keeps prices low and would aid a transition to the green economy.Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, said the tariffs will raise the cost of select Chinese goods and help thwart Beijing's efforts to dominate the market for emerging technologies in ways that pose risks to US national security and economic stability.""China is simply too big to play by its own rules,"" Brainard told reporters on a Monday call previewing the announcement.Administration officials have stressed that the decision on tariffs was made independently of November's presidential election. But Brainard noted in her remarks that the tariffs would help workers in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two of the battleground states that will decide who wins the election.Under the findings of a four-year review on trade with China, the tax rate on imported Chinese EVs is to rise to 102.5% this year, up from total levels of 27.5%. The review was undertaken under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the government to retaliate against trade practices deemed unfair or in violation of global standards.Under the 301 guidelines, the tariff rate is to double to 50% on solar cell imports this year. Tariffs on certain Chinese steel and aluminum products will climb to 25% this year. Computer chip tariffs will double to 50% by 2025.For lithium-ion EV batteries, tariffs will rise from 7.5% to 25% in 2024. But for non-EV batteries of the same type, the tariff increase will be implemented in 2026. There are also higher tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes, critical minerals and medical products.The new tariffs, at least initially, are largely symbolic since they will apply to only about $18 billion in imports. A new analysis by Oxford Economics estimates that the tariffs - which would be implemented over time - will have a barely noticeable impact on inflation by pushing up inflation by just 0.01%.Still, Chinese officials voiced their frustration with the move.Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu rejected US claims that Beijing has encouraged excess factory capacity in order to dominate global trade in these goods. He also said that more expensive EVs and solar panels will make it more difficult to transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.""Despite its professed willingness to strengthen cooperation with China on climate change, the US has been hyping up the so-called 'overcapacity' in China's new energy sector and vowing to impose additional tariff hikes on Chinese electrical vehicles and solar products,"" Liu said. ""This is self-defeating.""The Chinese economy has been slowed by the collapse of the country's real estate market and past pandemic lockdowns, prompting Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to jumpstart growth by ramping up production of EVs and other products, making more than the Chinese market can absorb.This strategy further exacerbates tensions with a US government that claims it's determined to strengthen its own manufacturing to compete with China, yet avoid a larger conflict.""China's factory-led recovery and weak consumption growth, which are translating into excess capacity and an aggressive search for foreign markets, in tandem with the looming US election season add up to a perfect recipe for escalating US trade fractions with China,'' said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.China's production of EVs and other green products are ""coming to be seen by the US as a zero-sum game in which China plays the spoiler that could hamper a US manufacturing revival,'' Prasad said.The Europeans are worried, too. The EU launched an investigation last fall into Chinese subsidies and could impose an import tax on Chinese EVs.After Xi's visit to France last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that government-subsidized Chinese EVs and steel ""are flooding the European market. ... The world cannot absorb China's surplus production. Therefore, I have encouraged the Chinese government to address these structural overcapacities.''The Biden administration views China with subsidies of its own manufacturing as trying to globally control the EV and clean energy sectors, whereas it says its own industrial support is geared toward ensuring domestic supplies to help meet US demand.""We do not seek to have global domination of manufacturing in these sectors, but we believe because these are strategic industries and for the sake of resilience of our supply chains, that we want to make sure that we have healthy and active firms,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters Monday.The tensions go far beyond a trade dispute to deeper questions about who leads the world economy as a seemingly indispensable nation. China's policies could make the world more dependent on its factories, possibly giving it greater leverage in geopolitics. At the same time, the United States says it's seeking for countries to operate by the same standards so that competition can be fair.For it's part, China maintains that the tariffs are in violation of the global trade rules that the United States originally helped establish through the World Trade Organization.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Friday that the new tariffs compounded the problems caused by tariffs that the Trump administration had previously put on Chinese goods, which Biden has kept.""Instead of ending those wrong practices, the US continues to politicize trade issues, abuse the so-called review process of Section 301 tariffs and plan tariff hikes,"" he said. ""This will just double the US's fault.""Those questions are at the heart of November's presidential election, with a bitterly divided electorate seemingly united by the idea of getting tough with China. Biden and Trump have overlapping but different strategies.Biden sees targeted tariffs as needed to defend key industries and workers, while Trump has threatened broad 10% tariffs against all imports from rivals and allies alike.Biden has staked his presidential legacy on the US pulling ahead of China with its own government investments in factories to make EVs, computer chips and other advanced technologies.""So far, we've created $866 billion in private-sector investment nationwide - almost a trillion dollars - historic amounts in such a short time,"" Biden said last week in Wisconsin. "" And that's literally creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.""Trump tells his supporters that America is falling further behind China by not betting on oil to keep powering the economy, despite its climate change risks. The former president may believe that tariffs can change Chinese behavior, but he believes that the US will be reliant on China for EV components and solar cells.""Joe Biden's economic plan is to make China rich and America poor,"" he said at a rally earlier this month in Wisconsin.","The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminum and more. Administration officials said they think the tariffs won't escalate tensions with China, yet they expect that China will explore ways to respond to the new taxes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110114790,imgsize-118186,width-400,resizemode-4/110114790.jpg"

A group led by Blackstone , the biggest private equity fund globally, together with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ( ADIA ) and GIC of Singapore, made a non-binding offer recently to purchase a majority stake in Haldiram Snacks Food Pvt Ltd (HSFPL), the joint packaged snacks and foods business of the Agarwal family's Delhi and Nagpur branches, according to informed sources.Haldiram, at 87 years old, stands as India's foremost snack and convenience foods enterprise.According to an ET report, Blackstone and its partners are eager to acquire 74-76% of the company, valuing the business at $8-8.5 billion (Rs 66,400-70,500 crore). ADIA and GIC are both limited partners or sponsors of Blackstone's global funds. Should the deal materialize, it would mark the most significant private equity buyout in India to date.When asked for comment, Haldiram CEO KK Chutani told ET, ""The company has no comments to offer.""Last year in May, Chutani, previously the chief executive of Dabur International, was brought in as Haldiram's CEO, marking the first time a professional has taken the helm.The completion of any transaction hinges on the successful merger currently underway between the Nagpur and Delhi factions, as part of a plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). This merger is anticipated to conclude within the next three to four months.The Haldiram family has undergone a significant restructuring, with the Nagpur and Delhi factions splitting their FMCG (packaged foods) and restaurant businesses into separate entities.The newly formed Haldiram Snacks Food Pvt Ltd (HSFPL) is the result of a merger between Haldiram Foods International Pvt Ltd (HFIPL), led by the Nagpur faction, and Haldiram Snacks Pvt Ltd (HSPL), led by the Delhi family.The Delhi side of the family, represented by Manohar Agarwal and Madhu Sudan Agarwal, will hold a 55% stake in HSFPL, while the Nagpur faction, led by Kamalkumar Shivkisan Agrawal, will own the remaining 45%. The eastern faction of the Haldiram empire is not involved in this merger.The snack food business of Haldiram's encompasses the production and distribution of a wide range of products, including snacks, namkeen, sweets, ready to eat and pre-mixed food, cookies, non-carbonated ready-to-drink beverages and pasta.

Additionally, Haldiram's has acquired smaller brands such as Babaji Namkeen, Akash Namkeen, and Atop Foods.The restaurant business, valued at Rs 1,800 crore, is not included in the merger transaction.Haldiram's has a rich history, dating back to 1937 when Ganga Bishan Aggarwal started the business as a family-run sweets and namkeen shop in Bikaner, Rajasthan. While Haldiram's is a dominant player in the snacks market, it faces competition from other notable brands such as PepsiCo's Lays and Kurkure, Balaji Snacks, Prataap Snacks' Yellow Diamond, Bikanervala, the recently listed Bikaji Foods, and ITC Foods' Bingo franchise.","Haldiram, at 87 years old, stands as India's foremost snack and convenience foods enterprise.

Consumer protection body just passed the buck on misleading Patanjali ads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/consumer-protection-body-just-passed-the-buck-on-misleading-patanjali-ads/articleshow/110086399.cms,"Established to “promote, protect and enforce the rights of consumers”, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has merely been forwarding complaints it received against misleading and illegal ads of Patanjali to the Ayush ministry . In the last hearing on May 7, the Supreme Court also questioned the CCPA about complaints it received which were “only forwarded to the concerned states” and asked if they were ever acted upon.The CCPA issued new guidelines on misleading ads in June 2022 and was expected to crack the whip on such ads, but it appears to have done little about the complaints against Patanjali’s misleading ads. Though the Consumer Protection Act 2019 allows the authority to impose a penalty of up to Rs 10 lakh on manufacturers, advertisers and endorsers for any misleading advertisements and Rs 50 lakh for any subsequent contravention, the CCPA did nothing about Patanjali repeatedly violating the law by continuing to issue misleading ads.In his complaint to the CCPA, Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist, attached the letters of the Ayush ministry and the state licensing authority of Uttarakhand which stated that the ads violated the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, 1954 and the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and Rules 945. “I am filing a complaint with you against the repeated contravention of various Acts by Divya Pharmacy (Patanjali), Haridwar,” stated the complaint. All illegal advertisements are misleading advertisements and hence, Patanjali’s ads were misleading ads, pointed out the complainant. After several reminders, CCPA issued a notice to Patanjali for the misleading ads in September 2022. However, by December the authority changed its stance, as revealed by file notings obtained through RTI.The file noting stated: “Section 18(2) of the Consumer Protection Act 2019 provides as under: “Where after preliminary enquiry, the central authority is of the opinion that the matter is to be dealt with by a regulator established under any other law for the time being in force, it may refer such matter to the concerned regulatory along with its report. Thus it is not necessary under CPA 2019 for CCPA to take action in every alleged instance of false or misleading advertisements; CCPA may forward the matter to other relevant regulator.” With this, the complaint was forwarded to the Ayush ministry.Every time Patanjali issued a misleading ad, a complaint was filed with the CCPA, which promptly forwarded it to Ayush ministry. “As a consumer, who did not get justice from Ayush ministry or the state licensing authority after complaining to them in February 2022, I had turned to the CCPA in July seeking justice, believing their claims that they protected consumers’ rights. But CCPA behaved like a post office, merely forwarding my complaints. I approached them also because the penalty under the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) 2019 is tougher than under the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act. By forwarding my complaints seeking action under CPA 2019 to the SLA for action under DMR Act 1954, the CCPA was inadvertently helping the advertisers and delaying acting against them,” stated Dr Babu.","The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has merely been forwarding complaints it received against misleading and illegal ads of Patanjali to the Ayush ministry. In the last hearing on May 7, the Supreme Court also questioned the CCPA about complaints which were “only forwarded to the concerned states” and asked if they were ever acted upon.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110086437,imgsize-47124,width-400,resizemode-4/110086437.jpg"
N Chandrasekaran to chair Tata Electronics as Tata group focuses on semiconductor business with $14 billion investments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/n-chandrasekaran-to-chair-tata-electronics-as-tata-group-focuses-on-semiconductor-business-with-14-billion-investments/articleshow/110079154.cms,"Tata Group's Strategic Move

Tata Electronics means business on semiconductors: N Chandrasekaran , the chairman of Tata Sons , is set to take on an additional role as the chairman of Tata Electronics. This move comes at a crucial time when Tata Electronics has allocated approximately $14 billion for investments to make a significant entry into the semiconductor industry .Chandrasekaran will succeed Banmali Agrawala, who has held the position for several years and has recently transitioned into an advisory role within the Tata group, according to an ET report.The change in leadership will take effect once the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained.As Chandrasekaran already chairs several key Tata group companies, his appointment as chairman of Tata Electronics underscores the importance of the semiconductor business to the conglomerate.Chandrasekaran played a pivotal role in persuading Randhir Thakur, a former veteran of Intel Foundry Services, to join Tata Electronics as CEO & MD in 2023. Additionally, in January, Srinivas Satya, previously the country president of the semiconductor products group at Applied Materials, joined Tata Electronics as the chief supply chain officer and president of the components business.Industry experts believe that these strategic appointments, combined with Chandrasekaran's unwavering focus, have positioned Tata Electronics at the forefront of India's electronics manufacturing landscape. To further strengthen its capabilities, Tata Electronics has recruited 50-60 top-level expatriates in recent months, leveraging their extensive knowledge in semiconductor technology, strategic planning, and design.An executive close to the company stated, ""The board of Tata Electronics now has the management width and heft to scale up the business. It is now wooing top tier global clients and may surpass growth expectations. The challenge earlier was talent and technology, and the company is chasing both aggressively to drive growth.""Also Read | ‘GenAI impact to be unimaginable’: TCS chairman N Chandrasekaran makes important observation Neil Shah, vice president of Counterpoint Research, has emphasized the need for a strategic and bold approach as Tata Electronics ventures into this new territory. He said, ""Since this is a completely greenfield territory for Tata, Tata Electronics will need a more strategic, measured and bold approach moving towards the 'One Tata' vision laid out by Chandrasekaran."" Shah further highlighted the immense potential in the electronics industry, from semiconductor fabrication to finished goods, and the importance of Chandrasekaran's involvement in ensuring a strong pipeline.Established in 2020, Tata Electronics is the sole Indian vendor assembling iPhone enclosures for Apple. The company is expanding its operations by ramping up its existing facility in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, and acquiring Wistron's facility in Karnataka. Reports also indicate that Tata Electronics is considering taking over Pegatron's facility in Tamil Nadu to further increase its capacity.Also Read | Apple iPhone exports from India nearly double in April to $1.1 billion; may hit Rs 1 lakh crore mark in FY25 The global pandemic has caused significant supply chain disruptions, which, coupled with recent geopolitical shifts, has created new opportunities for Indian companies like the Tata group.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107449351,imgsize-22516,width-400,resizemode-4/107449351.jpg"
Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

This multimodal approach makes interaction much more natural and intuitive,” she says.The new model’s availability through ChatGPT will also democratise access to these AI advancements, says Bhavesh Goswami, founder and CEO of CloudThat. “Especially for developers who can leverage enhanced APIs to fully harness GPT-4o’s capabilities.”Aditya Garg, head of solutions consulting at Genesys India, says this leap in AI capabilities represents a big change for some industries – like call centres. He says the integration of models like GPT-4o into cloudbased contact centre solutions will drive significant efficiency gains through automation and reduce the need for human intervention in routine tasks.Deepak Visweswaraiah, VP of platform engineering at Pegasystems India, says the exponential growth in compute power and the abundance of data have fuelled the progress of AI models, while Aakash Bist, who leads GenAI R&D at Pure Storage, says the quality of data, data utilisation techniques, and refined feedback mechanisms have also contributed to progress in AI functionalities.","GPT-4o will be free for all users and will be rolled out in the next few weeks.

Transcribing, summarising patient records

When Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella visited India recently, we got the opportunity to shadow him across Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, as he interacted with startups and enterprises that are creating and using cutting-edge AI solutions. We got to see a variety of work, most of them targetted at making the lives of ordinary people, particularly the most disadvantaged, better.One of our most memorable moments was his interaction with Baby Rajaram Bokale.Baby’s a Pune resident, working at a masala-making unit and an active member of the local self-help banking group. “AI aapki aabhari hain (AI is grateful to you),” Nadella said, as Baby’s eyes lit up. When she’s not making masalas, Baby uses the Karya app on her smartphone to speak sentences in Marathi that the app records. She also annotates (adds notes) images, audios, and videos, explaining what’s contained in them.She’s creating data that AI systems can be trained on. Most of the digital data in the world is in English. If someone wants to create a ChatGPT-like app in Marathi, they’ll need lots more digital Marathi data than exists today.Karya engages 35,000 workers like Baby, offering $5 an hour, 20 times the minimum wage. Manu Chopra, co-founder of Karya, said the work done leads to creation of datasets, and the workers even make royalties every time those datasets are resold.“This is deeply personal to me because I grew up in a Delhi basti. And research has shown time and again, the easiest way to move people out of poverty is to give them jobs. Today, our communities use smartphones for media, messaging and for entertainment. But what if that same smartphone could bring them highquality, complex digital jobs? What if we could connect India’s 230 million poor people to the global AI ecosystem? And that’s what we’ve done,” said the 27-year-old.“Fantastic,” said Nadella, and then turned around again to Baby and asked how Karya had changed things for her. And she said laughing, “I could never confidently go to an ATM before. I was scared. Now, thanks to this app that gave us financial literacy too, I know how to use an ATM, and I don’t disclose my UPI PIN to anybody.”Sarvam AI was another of the showcases. Using data like the ones Baby creates, Sarvam builds GenAI models for Indian languages and contexts, which can then be used to create voice-based content. “Think of it like content companions. You can take all the content that is out there in education and build this once and then deliver it to all children. We are making it conversational and low latency,” said cofounder Pratyush Kumar. Sarvam, which uses Microsoft’s cloud and AI infrastructure to train, host, and scale its LLMs, has started with Hindi and is working to expand to other Indian languages.Another similar initiative, called Jugalbandi, was presented by Smita Gupta, lawyer with nonprofit Agami, which works to improve systems of law and justice, and Samee Segal, principal research SDE at Microsoft Research. Jugalbandi is an opensource platform that integrates the capabilities of ChatGPT with Indian language translation models, such as Bhashini. The department of justice, under the law ministry, has incorporated Jugal bandi’s solution into its operations, empowering citizens by making legal information more accessible and comprehensible.Srikanth Nadhamuni’s Open Healthcare Network, which is establishing connected ICUs in remote locations of the country under a project called 10BedICU, uses AI in multiple fascinating ways. GenAI is used to record and automatically transcribe doctor-patient interactions and convert these conversations directly into structured electronic medical records (EMRs). “Doctors and nurses used to say, ‘You are making typists out of us.’ But this tech now enhances accuracy of medical documentation and minimises the time healthcare providers have to spend on summarisation and data entry, allowing them to focus on patient care,” said Nadhamuni. The app is enabled for several Indian languages.Another GenAI tool automates the summarisation of patient records, which enables faster discharge. Yet another GenAI vision tool is used to integrate data from older hospitals’ multipara-monitors.Nadella asked Nadhamuni if theirs was an open-source model, to which the latter replied that it was, and over 400 volunteers had contributed to the projects. “GitHub Copilot (GenAI coding tool) was a game-changer for us. Over the last six months, we have been able to increase our speed by three times,” he said.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella visited India to meet startups and enterprises that are creating and using cutting-edge AI solutions.

India solution in global products

A small farmer from a remote village walks into the nearest town’s health clinic. He breathes into a tube connected to a Vionix analyser. This device compares the farmer’s breath with hundreds of millions of other samples from around the world. An AI model, running on the cloud, identifies patterns of disease manifestations in the spectral signatures of the breath sample and instantly provides results on the farmer’s smartphone.It also offers advice on treating the condition using Ayurveda, locally sourced herbs, or Western medicine.This is a beautiful flywheel of early disease detection that even the poor will be able to afford – which would not have been possible without recent advances in AI. With technologies such as these that our company is developing, any new outbreak of Covid variants or new diseases that the AI algorithms are trained on can be retroactively analysed across the world.Helping people spot health problems faster is just one aspect of how AI can improve healthcare. India, like the rest of the world, faces immense challenges in delivering high-quality care to its population. Transportation remains a major obstacle; patients often travel for days to reach a hospital. Once there, they might need to stay nearby for days as they undergo a series of tests. Another challenge is the distribution of critical medical supplies – such as blood, vaccines, or drugs – to remote locations. Additionally, there is a significant shortage of trained medical professionals who struggle to keep up with the latest developments in their fields.AI has the potential to address all these challenges. HD Steth, developed by an Indian company HD Medical, combines AI and integrated ECG to provide immediate cardiac insights at the point of care and directly uploads the visualisations and diagnostics to a smartphone. This stethoscope, which eliminates the need for expensive echocardiograms typically administered by highly trained technicians, is easy to use even outside traditional healthcare settings. HD Steth is approved for sale by the US FDA and has been endorsed by prominent institutions such as the University of California, San Francisco.Drone systems using AI to navigate autonomously are already delivering vital medical supplies in Africa. In India, dozens of drone startups are competing in this delivery market, with AI systems increasingly capable of manoeuvring through complex urban environments an d delivering fragile items accurately.For patients in serious accidents, particularly those with head injuries, time is critical. Another Indian company, Qure.ai , has developed a system using AI to automatically triage patient conditions from head and neck CT scans. This allows medical teams to prioritise treatment and surgery much more quickly and accurately. Qure’s technology is also integrated into imaging systems from global companies like Philips and GE Healthcare and includes tools for diagnosing conditions in chest X-rays, such as a screening tool for tuberculosis – a resurgent and increasingly drug-resistant disease.In almost every field where there is data and a big problem to solve, AI can be transformative. Its ability to process and analyse large datasets far exceeds human capabilities, leading to breakthroughs in fields as diverse as medical diagnostics, environmental science, finance, transportation, and public safety.Vivek Wadhwa is the CEO and Alex Salkever heads marketing at Vionix Biosciences.

How IT companies are pressing staff to return to office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-it-companies-are-pressing-staff-to-return-to-office/articleshow/110130775.cms,"BENGALURU: Some IT companies wield the stick, while others offer carrots.Tech companies are employing different strategies to encourage their workforce to return to the office. The unprecedented flexibility that employees enjoyed during the pandemic is now being scaled back as companies reassert their expectations and exert control over the work environment.Employees find themselves in a challenging position, with no option but to comply with these directives or potentially face repercussions for non-compliance.Earlier this year, Cognizant's CEO, Ravi Kumar, announced the development of a new app that will enable managers to create a roster based on requirements, in addition to the existing FlexiSeat app for booking seats across its facilities. This application will allow the company to monitor work-from-office compliance . In a memo, Kumar had stated, ""Our collective goal is to ensure that we are in the office with a purpose."" He also mentioned that employees are expected to come to office three times a week or as defined by their leader. In fact, Cognizant has embarked on the NextGen programme aimed at simplifying its operating model and consolidating and realigning office space to reflect the post-pandemic hybrid work environment. An email sent to Cognizant on the new app rollout didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press.TCS has implemented a policy that links the amount of variable pay employees receive each quarter to their presence in office. Employees who work from office less than 60% of the time will not receive any variable pay, while those with an office attendance between 60-75% will receive 50% of the variable pay. Employees who come to office 75-85% of the time will be eligible for 75% of the variable pay, and only those with an office compliance level above 85% will receive full variable pay for the quarter.Dell Technologies plans to use electronic badge swipes, VPN, and a colour-coding system to track employee presence. The four colours used are blue (consistent on-site presence), green (regular on-site presence), yellow (some on-site presence), and red (limited on-site presence). Tech chronicler The Register was the first to report the development. Dell has a significant presence in India but does not disclose the exact number of employees in the country.In contrast, Wipro has taken a milder approach. In a recent letter to employees, its chief human resources officer Saurabh Govil stated that local-level councils have been set up to ""enhance associate participation, engagement, collaboration, and networking"". Govil informed employees that there would be more in-office activities to encourage people to work from Wipro campuses across India.Infosys's employee experience platform, InfyMe, allows employees from select business units to apply for work-from-home for 11 days in a month.

Maharashtra has detected 91 Omicron KP.2 cases, with Pune reporting 51 and Thane 20. The variant emerged globally in January and became dominant by March-April. Dr Karyakarte highlighted low hospitalization rates, with KP.2 being part of the FLiRT variants.

FLiRT, the new COVID variants are circulating fast: All about symptoms, severity

FLiRT variants, KP.2 & KP.1.1, dominate US infections with Omicron symptoms. KP.2's reproduction number surpasses JN.1. WHO monitors the variants' impact on vaccine immunity and advises close observation for major virus changes.

93 riots case: SC tells state to implement directions

Supreme Court directs Maharashtra to address 1992 Mumbai riots cases, compensate missing victims' families, implement police reforms, and comply with Justice B N Srikrishna Commission recommendations by July 19, including tracing 168 missing people.

MUMBAI: The state has identified 91 cases of the new Covid-19 Omicron subvariant KP.2 that has outpaced the previously circulating JN.1 variant and is now driving cases in many countries. Pune reported 51 cases and Thane 20 cases of KP.2, first detected globally in Jan. Currently, KP.2 is the dominant variant in the US. Maharashtra identified KP.2 cases in January.By March and April, it became the dominant strain in the region. However, there hasn’t been any proportionate increase in hospitalisations or serious cases, said Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, state’s genome sequencing coordinator. KP.2 descended from JN.1, which was the predominant Covid strain by the end of 2023. In March, the state witnessed a slight surge in cases, averaging around 250 detections, which is likely attributable to the spread of the KP.2 variant.Besides Pune and Thane, seven cases each were identified in Amravati and Aurangabad. Solapur had two cases while Ahmednagar, Nashik, Latur and Sanglione each of the KP.2 variant. None was from Mumbai.The recently identified group of variants, collectively known as FLiRT, primarily consists of the KP.1.1 and KP.2 strains. The nomenclature of these strains is derived from the specific mutations they possess, with one strain containing mutations represented by the letters ""F"" and ""L"", while the other strain features mutations denoted by the letters ""R"" and ""T"".","Maharashtra has detected 91 Omicron KP.2 cases, with Pune reporting 51 and Thane 20.

AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is an as-yet-unbuilt technology that can do anything the brain can do.Sutskever, 38, added that he was starting a new project, but did not elaborate.A key OpenAI researcher, Jakub Pachocki, will replace Sutskever as chief scientist at the company, which is valued at more than $80 billion, according to a recent fundraising deal.On Monday, OpenAI unveiled a new version of its ChatGPT chatbot that can receive and respond to voice commands, images and videos, joining tech giants including Google and Apple in a race toward a new kind of talking digital assistant.Founded in 2015 by Altman, Elon Musk and several young researchers, including Sutskever, OpenAI has long been at the forefront of AI research. Sutskever's involvement provided the company with instant credibility. As a graduate student at the University of Toronto, he had been part of an AI breakthrough involving neural networks -- the technology that has driven the field's progress over the past decade.In late 2022, OpenAI wowed the world with the release of ChatGPT, an online chatbot that could answer questions, write poetry, generate computer code and chat a lot like people. The tech industry quickly embraced what is called generative artificial intelligence -- technologies that can generate text, images and other media on their own.The result of more than a decade of research inside companies like OpenAI and Google, generative AI is poised to remake everything from email programs to internet search engines and digital assistants.Altman became a spokesperson for the shift toward generative AI, testifying before Congress and meeting with lawmakers, regulators and investors around the world. In November, OpenAI's board of directors unexpectedly ousted him, saying he could no longer be trusted with the company's plan to eventually create artificial general intelligence.The OpenAI board had six people: three founders and three independent members. Sutskever voted with the three outsiders to remove Altman as CEO and chair of the board, saying -- without providing specifics -- that Altman had not been ""consistently candid in his communications.""Greg Brockman, OpenAI's chief operating officer and another co-founder, resigned from the company in protest. So did Pachocki.Days later, as hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Sutskever said he regretted his decision to remove Altman and effectively stepped down from the board, leaving three independent members in opposition to Altman.Altman returned as CEO after he and the board agreed to replace two members with Bret Taylor, a former Salesforce executive, and Lawrence Summers, a former U.S. Treasury secretary. Altman regained his board seat several months later, as the board expanded to seven people.Last year, Sutskever helped create a Super Alignment team inside OpenAI to explore ways of ensuring that future versions of the technology would not do harm. Like others in the field, he had grown increasingly concerned that AI could become dangerous and perhaps even destroy humanity.Jan Leike, who ran the Super Alignment team alongside Sutskever, has also resigned from OpenAI. His role will be taken by John Schulman , another company co-founder.In the weeks leading up to Altman's ouster, Pachocki, who helped oversee the creation of GPT-4, the technology at the heart of ChatGPT, was promoted to director of research at the company. After occupying a position below Sutskever, he was elevated to a position alongside him, two people familiar with the moves said.After Altman was reinstated, Sutskever did not return to work. Altman indicated that he was hoping to negotiate his return, but ultimately that was not possible.Pachocki has effectively served as chief scientist since November. After Sutskever recruited him and others to join OpenAI, he was among the key researchers on several of the company's most important projects, including, most notably, GPT-4.""I am grateful to Ilya,"" Pachocki said in an interview. ""We have different and in many ways complementary styles of leadership.""Altman said he talked with Sutskever on Tuesday. ""He has pushed us -- and will continue to push us -- to, as he says, feel the AGI,"" Altman said.","Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and chief scientist at OpenAI, is leaving the company. He joined three other board members to force out Sam Altman, the company's high-profile CEO. Altman returned to OpenAI just five days after he was ousted, reasserting his control. The company is valued at more than $80 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110130795,imgsize-953075,width-400,resizemode-4/110130795.jpg"
Fed's Powell downplays potential for a rate hike despite higher price pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/feds-powell-downplays-potential-for-a-rate-hike-despite-higher-price-pressures/articleshow/110125324.cms,"WASHINGTON: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the central bank is unlikely to raise its key interest rate in response to signs of stubborn inflation and underscored his view that price increases would soon start to cool again.Yet Powell, during a panel discussion in Amsterdam, said his confidence that inflation will ease ""is not as high as it was"" because price increases have been persistently hot in the first three months of this year.Powell stressed that the Fed's preferred approach was to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak rather than increase it.""I don't think that it's likely, based on the data that we have, that the next move that we make would be a rate hike ,"" Powell said. ""I think it's more likely that we'll be at a place where we hold the policy rate where it is.""Financial markets and economists have been hoping for signs that one or two Fed rate cuts might be coming this year, given that inflation is down sharply from its high in 2022. But with price pressures still elevated, Powell and other Fed officials have signaled that no rate cut is likely anytime soon.Powell spoke hours after a report on U.S. producer prices showed that wholesale inflation picked up in April. On Wednesday, the government will issue the latest monthly report on consumer inflation, which is expected to show that price growth cooled a bit last month.In his remarks Tuesday, Powell downplayed the wholesale price report, which also showed that some costs cooled last month, including for airfares, hospital visits and car insurance.""I wouldn't call it hot,"" he said of the wholesale inflation data. ""I would call it sort of mixed.""Economists are divided over whether the high inflation figures this year reflect a re-acceleration in price growth or are largely echoes of pandemic distortions. Auto insurance, for example, has soared 22% from a year ago, but that surge may reflect factors specific to the auto industry: New car prices jumped during the pandemic, and insurance companies are now seeking to offset the higher repair and replacement costs by raising their premiums.Other economists point to consistent consumer spending on restaurant meals, travel and entertainment, categories where in some cases price increases have also been elevated, possibly reflecting strong demand.Powell said that upcoming inflation reports will reveal whether such factors are keeping inflation high or whether inflation will soon fall back to the Fed's 2% target, as he said he expects. Inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in the summer of 2022, is forecast to slow to 3.4% in Wednesday's latest report.The Fed chair noted that rising rents are one key factor keeping inflation high. He called that ""a bit of a puzzle"" because measures of new apartment leases show new rents barely increasing. Such weaker data has apparently yet to flow into the government's measures, which cover all rents, including for tenants who renew their leases. Though rents are still growing faster for tenants who renew leases, Powell said the government's measures should eventually show rent growth easing.The Fed chair also acknowledged that the economy ""is different this time"" because so many Americans refinanced their mortgages at very low rates before the Fed began raising borrowing costs in March 2022. Many large businesses also locked in low rates at that time.""It may be,"" he said, that the Fed's rate policy ""is hitting the economy not quite as strongly as it would have if those two things were not the case.""Last week, Fed officials underscored that they were prepared to leave their key interest rate at 5.3%, the highest level in 23 years, as long as needed quell inflation.","Jerome Powell says the Fed's preferred approach is to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak.

NEAR Protocol (NEAR) recently experienced a significant price uptrend as Nethermind announced that the NEAR Fast Finality Layer went live on Holesky. It was developed in collaboration between both projects, and this could enhance the overall demand and utility of the crypto. Binance Coin (BNB) also saw a notable upswing as Binance completed the integration of the dYdX Mainnet and enabled deposits.Ripple Labs and the SEC also made significant progress in their legal battle, as the SEC filed its final reply. In the meantime, the first parallelised confidential computing network was announced for Solana (SOL). Despite their success, traders are moving towards KangaMoon (KANG) as it is up 400% and could soon see a major surge in value. To understand why these are among the top altcoins , let’s explore them individually.Here, we will take a much deeper look into the price performance of each one of these altcoins to determine which one can provide the most substantial gains.KangaMoon (KANG) is a rising star in the current Bitcoin frenzy and has gathered over 20,000 users due to its impressive presale performance and unique ecosystem. Having surpassed $6.5 million raised, the project is now on track to reach $8 million by the end of May, as KangaMoon boasts features from the Play-to-Earn (P2E) space alongside Social-Fi elements.The project introduces a dedicated game in which KANG serves as the in-game currency and facilitates purchases and character upgrades. This utility distinguishes KangaMoon from the plethora of altcoins that are driven exclusively by hype. Another differentiator for KangaMoon is in its strategic distribution of free KANG tokens, which are given to the most active users on social media platforms such as X (Twitter), incentivising community engagement.Through this approach, the project has sparked a surge in users actively following and sharing social media content. Currently, the project is at the Bonus Stage of the presale, priced at $0.025, which also reflects a significant 400% increase from its initial valuation of $0.005 and putting it as one of the top altcoins in 2024. This could just be the beginning, however, as experts predict a 100x price increase following its listing on Tier-1 exchanges in Q2 2024.NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is moving in an upward direction, fueled by the overall market sentiment and bullishness following its most recent announcement. Specifically, the NEAR Fast Finality Layer went live on Holesky , which was developed by the foundation in collaboration with Nethermind. This can increase the usage of the NEAR Protocol crypto and possibly drive demand further, positioning it as one of the best altcoins to invest in.The NEAR Protocol price’s RSI and MACD data both showcase major bullishness, and the future for its price is optimistic. According to the NEAR Protocol price prediction, the crypto can end Q4 of 2024 at $10.10.Binance Coin (BNB) is now dominant on the charts as well, following the most recent expansion of its exchange. Based on the latest announcement, the dYdX mainnet got integrated on top of the Binance exchange , and deposits are now open. This can drive further demand for the Binance Coin crypto, positioning it as one of the best altcoins to invest in.The Binance Coin price chart is bullish, and according to the recent metrics, it's forming an upward pattern that can result in a dominant position. According to the Binance Coin price prediction, it can climb as far as $856.44 in 2024.Solana (SOL) recently displayed major bullishness after Archium was announced for the network. This marks a monumental milestone as it is the first parallelised confidential computing network , and could lead to increased Solana crypto demand.Moreover, the Solana price is showcasing bullish on-chart metrics and could soon experience massive gains as more traders diversify with this crypto and bulls enter the market. According to the Solana price prediction, it can end in 2024 at a maximum price of $178.33.Ripple (XPR) has recently been in the spotlight after Ripple Lands, SEC making significant progress in their legal battle. In a recent response, the SEC challenged Ripple’s insistence that the blockchain startup acted without recklessness and there should be no uncertainty about the legal status of the Ripple crypto. This marked the final reply in the lawsuit’s remedies stage.Following this news, the Ripple price went in a bullish direction and began climbing the charts. According to the Ripple price prediction, by the end of Q4, 2024, the crypto can reach $1.08.NEAR Protocol is bullish on the charts and Binance Coin is expanding with integrations that can result in better utility, also contributing towards a value increase. Solana and Ripple also showcased solid metrics and could see substantial gains, yet, KangaMoon has the most significant growth potential and is seen as the most compelling investment opportunity within the altcoin landscape.The project has distinguished itself from the crowd by focusing on utility and offering a compelling proposition for traders seeking high-growth potential. With a strong presale performance and solid potential for future development, it is poised to capitalise on the booming P2E market.Discover the exciting opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) presale today!","KangaMoon (KANG) set to become a behemoth in the Altcoin space.

Saudi Arabia concerns stall China-Arab free trade talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/saudi-arabia-concerns-stall-china-arab-free-trade-talks/articleshow/110117791.cms,"DUBAI: Negotiations between China and an Arab bloc for a free trade agreement have stalled over concerns by Saudi Arabia that cheap Chinese imports could undermine its ambitions to transform the kingdom into an industrial powerhouse, sources say.Saudi Arabia has backed renewed efforts over the past two years for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the Arab bloc which includes the kingdom, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, among others, to finally seal a long sought deal with China.But five sources briefed on the negotiations said the sides were at an impasse over Saudi reservations with a list of goods put forward by Beijing to be exempt from Gulf import duties.Saudi Arabia is worried that a wave of lower cost Chinese versions of products that it hopes to manufacture domestically would be damaging to its industrial agenda, the sources said.Saud Arabia's government communication office, the GCC Secretariat and China's commerce ministry did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the trade negotiations.The kingdom, the world's biggest oil exporter, has a nascent manufacturing industry that the government hopes will one day make everything from computer chips to tires as part of a wider economic transformation plan to create a vibrant private sector.Saudi Arabia is spending trillions of dollars developing its economy under that program, known as Vision 2030, driven by the country's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .Prince Mohammed wants Saudi Arabia to not only lessen its dependence on oil rents by creating a strong private sector but also to transform the kingdom into a major global business hub.The industrial part of that transformation plan faces challenges even without competing with lower cost Chinese goods. That includes finding skilled workers among its citzens in a country where about 60% of the 32 million population are Saudi nationals.To build its own manufacturing industry, Saudi Arabia is partnering with foreign firms, including from China, to develop local capabilities and manufacturing lines in the kingdom.The sources said a China-Gulf trade deal was not off the table but that the Saudis and the Chinese would likely have to settle on some sort of compromise to see the deal finalised.Gulf officials last October spoke of reaching a deal soon. China's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Chen Weiqing was quoted by local media in January as saying that although progress had been made, there were difficult issues that needed to be resolved.China and the GCC, which also includes Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain, started trade talks almost 20 years ago. But the loose political and economic Arab bloc has finalised very few deals. It signed a free trade agreement with South Korea in December.China is a massive buyer of Gulf energy and in 2023 bilateral trade between China and the Gulf stood at $286.9 billion, according to Chinese customs data, with Saudi Arabia accounting for nearly 40% of trade between the Gulf and China.China and the Gulf states have deepened economic cooperation in recent years, to the concern of the United States, which has long been the core security partner of the Gulf Arab states.US officials have increasingly sought to drive a wedge between the Gulf states and China, including issuing ultimatums to pick between American and Chinese technology.","Negotiations between China and an Arab bloc for a free trade agreement have stalled.
