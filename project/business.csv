"Gold outperforms Nifty with 13.37% returns in first half of 2024; MCX gold contract gains Rs 8,400 per 10 grams",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-outperforms-nifty-with-13-37-returns-in-first-half-of-2024-gains-rs-8400-per-10-grams/articleshow/111473432.cms,"Gold H1 Performance In Last 5 Years

Gold vs Nifty returns: Gold has surpassed the performance of the Nifty index in the initial six months of 2024, generating returns of 13.37% in comparison to the 10.5% yield of the 50-stock index. The MCX gold contract has increased by approximately Rs 8,400 per 10 grams when measured in rupee terms, while the Sensex has risen by 2,279 points as of June 30, 2024.The July gold futures reached an all-time high of Rs 74,777 and are currently trading near Rs 71,800, according to an ET report.The gains in gold prices have been attributed to various factors, including tensions in the Middle East, increased demand from China, and expectations of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.A comparison of the performance of gold and the Nifty index during the first half of the year over the past five years (2019-2023) shows that gold has had positive returns on four occasions, with the highest returns of 13.71% in 2020 and the lowest of 0.59% in 2022. However, in 2021, gold experienced negative returns of 3.63%.The Nifty index, on the other hand, has delivered positive returns in three out of the five years, specifically in the first half of 2019, 2021, and 2023. In 2022, the Nifty saw its highest returns of over 12% within the 5-year period. However, in 2020, the Nifty experienced a 15% decline due to the Covid-19 lockdowns in March, and in the first half of 2022, it lost 9%.Aamar Deo Singh, Senior Vice President-Equity, Commodity & Currency at Angel One, told ET that the first half of the year was an exciting and volatile period for the Nifty, yet rewarding for patient and disciplined investors who seized opportunities.The market was influenced by various factors, including the Lok Sabha election results falling short of expectations, mixed global cues, positive domestic macroeconomic indicators, escalating tensions in the Middle East, and diminishing hopes of multiple rate cuts by the US Federal Bank in 2024.""Major heavyweights such as Reliance Industrie (RIL), Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel, M&M, Maruti Suzuki & SBI, added to the rally while at the same time, across sectors, the momentum was witnessed. The participation by domestic market participants including the mutual funds and the retail, has been nothing short of spectacular, with their positive impact being largely felt despite the gyrations of the FPIs, with the Indian stock market adding almost $1 trillion in market cap over the past 6 months,"" Deo said.Also Read | RBI’s overseas gold reserves drop to 6-year low! Share of gold held at home goes up to 53% Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President-Research at Religare Broking, described the Nifty's performance as exceptionally strong and surpassing expectations. He believes that the stage is set for a positive trajectory in the second half of the year. Mishra attributed this growth to the overall economic resilience and investor confidence in the Indian markets, driven by favorable economic indicators, robust corporate earnings expectations, and supportive global market conditions.Prithviraj Kothari, Managing Director of RiddiSiddhi Bullions Limited (RSBL) and IBJA National Chief, commented on the recent performance of gold, stating that the precious metal is currently consolidating around Rs 71,000-72,000 after a significant rally of 18% between February and April, during which it gained Rs 12,000 per 10 grams and reached record highs.Kothari believes that the current price stability of gold can be attributed to a lack of sufficient triggers, indicating that all positive factors have already been accounted for. He also points out that some negative triggers have emerged, such as the Federal Reserve's stance shifting from dovish to hawkish. The anticipated interest rate cuts have been postponed from March to June and now to September, with their implementation dependent on the inflation situation.Also Read | Why did RBI bring 100 tonnes of gold reserves back to India? RBI governor Shaktikanta Das explains The Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates has shifted dramatically since the beginning of the year. Instead of the anticipated six rate cuts, experts are now looking at a single 25 bps rate cut, with some members of the FOMC even suggesting the possibility of another rate hike if inflation persists or stagnates for an extended period. Furthermore, the Dollar Index (DXY), which moves inversely to gold prices, is hovering above 105 against a basket of six major currencies.Kothari predicts that gold will reach Rs 70,000 in the next 1-2 months due to weak fundamentals and technical factors. However, he maintains a positive medium to long-term outlook, with the precious metal potentially reaching new record highs in the last quarter of 2024.""The strategy is to buy on the dips around Rs 70,000 for the target of Rs 75,000 and Rs 77,000 by the end of the year."", RiddiSiddhi Bullions analyst said.","Gold has surpassed the performance of the Nifty index in the initial six months of 2024.

Differently abled need a fairer treatment under the new tax regime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/differently-abled-need-a-fairer-treatment-under-the-new-tax-regime/articleshow/111519091.cms,"Deduction limit under section 80U

Is denial of this deduction under the new regime fair?

Since its introduction from the financial year 2020-21, the new ‘simplified’ tax regime has seen a few amendments. Under the new regime, while concessional slab rates are available to income up to Rs. 15 lakh, various exemptions be it for HRA, LTA have to be foregone. A majority of deductions available under Chapter VI-A, say for investments in a PPF (section 80C) are also not available.Even the deduction otherwise available to the differently abled under section 80U is denied.Under section 80U of the Income-tax (I-T) Act (applicable only under the old tax regime) some monetary respite is available to individuals with disabilities , depending on the degree of their disability, by offering a deduction against their total income.·For disability between 40-80% the maximum deduction allowed is Rs. 75,000·In cases of severe disability (80% or more) the deduction limit increases to Rs. 1.25 lakhA range of disabilities (set conditions are prescribed) are covered by this section, which include blindness, visual impairment, deformities arising owing to leprosy, locomotion disability, mental retardation, mental illness and multiple disabilities (combination of two or more disabilities in these specified categories). For a claim under this section a medical certificate from a recognized medical authority, specifying the nature and percentage of disability is required.The question that is being asked is whether denial of a deduction under section 80U under the new regime is fair?The Bombay Chartered Accountants Society (BCAS), a voluntary organization of chartered accountants, in its pre-budget memorandum states: Many disabled individuals need to purchase assistive devices or employ the services of an attendant or assistant to help them in their daily living activities and in their work.For example, blind individuals need to purchase screen reading software to work on computers, employ readers for reading hard-copy documents etc.The government has introduced the new tax regime and has given indications that it is the preferred tax regime. Unfortunately, by denying deductions under section 80U, the new tax regime has greatly disadvantaged the disabled taxpayers. In fact, even the amount of deduction available, which was set more than ten years ago, needs to be revised upwards, states BCAS.Vishesh Sangoi, partner at DPS & Co, a firm of chartered accountants points out that the Memorandum to the Finance Bill, 2016, which had revised the deduction limit had pointed out its necessity. “The government had clearly acknowledged the fact that the medical costs have been increasing and the needs of disabled people need to be given special emphasis. By taking away these deductions under the new tax regime, an ordinary person and a person with disability stand on the same footing as far as income tax is concerned,” said Sangoi.He adds, “Deduction u/s 80U, which is aimed at providing financial relief to individuals with disabilities, is fundamentally different from investment-based tax breaks. Unlike deductions under sections 80C or 80D, which incentivize savings and insurance investments, section 80U offers a flat deduction directly addressing the additional costs incurred due to disability. This essential support is not available under the new tax regime with its lower rates, making it crucial to understand that such deductions serve distinct purposes and should not be compared. The choice between tax regimes must consider the unique benefits that deductions like Section 80U provide, beyond mere tax savings. Inclusion of these deductions would not only provide equitable tax relief to taxpayers but also uphold the principles of fairness and inclusivity in our tax system.”Keeping in view the ground realities, BCAS has also suggested that an additional allowance of at least Rs. 50,000 in the nature of ‘care-giver allowance’ or ‘assistive devices allowance’ should be allowed to disabled individuals.","Under section 80U of the Income-tax (I-T) Act, some monetary respite is available to individuals with disabilities. For disability between 40-80% the maximum deduction allowed is Rs. 75,000. In cases of severe disability (80% or more) the deduction limit increases to Rs. 1.25 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111519150,imgsize-848614,width-400,resizemode-4/111519150.jpg"

In the labour market, to strike a balance between employee security and flexibility through labour laws, formalisation of employment, and compliance measures.

Continue providing impetus to the private sector by promoting the ease of doing business through reduction of regulatory bottlenecks and bureaucratic hurdles by simplifying regulations, expediting permits and approvals, and promoting digitalisation.

Boost financial markets by promoting innovation and competition, address concerns related to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), and improve corporate governance guidelines.

Hasten infrastructure development through increased Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and strategic investments, with special emphasis being placed on sectors such as transportation, energy, water supply and digital infrastructure to ensure comprehensive development.

Place emphasis on agricultural reforms such as contact farming, investment in agri-infrastructure, crop diversification and easy incorporation into the value-chain - thereby enhancing productivity, diversifying potential income streams and increasing access to the market.

Simplify and make efficient the tax regime to increase investments, enhance compliance, and broaden the tax base - through reduced corporate tax rates and decreased tax exemptions.

Address climate-related matters and enhance sustainability, encourage adoption of green technologies and renewable sources of energy, along with incentivising clean practices across sectors.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July. Like every year, salaried individuals are looking at FM Sitharaman to provide tax relief in the form of reduced tax rates, changed income tax slabs and even higher deductions.One such relief that is sought is to include more non-metro cities in the 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption list.HRA is a common component of employee compensation packages provided by many employers.Employees receiving HRA and paying rent for their accommodation can claim a tax exemption on the allowance under the old income tax regime. The exemption amount depends on whether the employee resides in a metro city or not for tax purposes. However, if an employee receiving HRA does not live in a rented house, the entire allowance becomes fully taxable.According to an ET report quoting Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, the Income-tax Act, 1961, under Section 10(13A), provides tax exemption for HRA. The amount of HRA that can be claimed as tax exempt is the lowest of the following:1. Actual HRA received;2. Actual Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary;3. 50% of basic salary (for metro cities)/40% of basic salary (for non-metro cities).Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report - top 5 points Currently, rented houses in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for a 50% exemption from HRA, while those in other locations fall under the 40% category. It is important to note that this classification was established over three decades ago, according to Viswanathan.As cities have expanded in terms of population and economic growth, it has become necessary to re-evaluate the way we define metro and non-metro cities.Interestingly, the Constitution (seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, also recognizes the National Capital Region (NCR), Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad as metro cities. Despite this, the HRA tax exemption for salaried individuals in these cities remains at 40% due to outdated tax laws.Also Read | Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime Residing outside of metro cities can result in a higher proportion of one's income being paid in taxes. For instance, an individual living in Bengaluru may have to pay a higher average rent compared to someone residing in Kolkata or Chennai, which are classified as metro cities for tax purposes.Those living in rapidly developing non-metro cities, as defined by the Income-tax Act, may pay higher rents due to rapid urbanization. But, they receive lower tax benefits for house rent compared to metro cities. With an increasing number of people relocating to these non-metro cities for employment, it is crucial for the government to reassess the regulations for claiming rent exemptions to alleviate the financial strain on taxpayers, feel experts.",Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

Claude 3.5: A basic guide to writing code using Claude 3.5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/a-basic-guide-to-writing-code-using-claude-3-5/articleshow/111502364.cms,"Snip from TOI e-paper

How to start

Master prompts

We asked software developers how they would use an AI assistant like Claude 3.5 Sonnet for a coding project . A frequently cited starting tip is to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts. Software development , especially at the enterprise level, is a complex orchestra of parts that need to come together, so whatever your coding task is for the day, you can always get help from an AI assistant, as long as you have a specific task in mind.Shauvik Mazumdar, senior director of front-end engineering at Ascendion, says he has been amazed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s capabilities in generating websites, apps, and even games. “With the recent addition of ‘ artifacts ,’ it allows us to view and interact with the results in real time too.”He says if Artifacts is not enabled, you should do that by going to the left sidebar, clicking on your name, and navigating to ₹Feature Preview’, where you have the enabling feature.The next step, Shauvik says, is to get back to the chat window and type a prompt to get your project started.If you’ve been tasked with creating a login page for a business, you could create a prompt like this:Design a login page (plain html). The login form needs to have a username and password as the first step. It also needs a ₹forgot password’ feature. Further on successful login, it should show Multifactor authentication. Use Material stylesheet and do basic validation. To test the system, you can use user name and default password like admin, admin and OTP as 1111. On successful login a message should be shown.“Claude will generate the code and an HTML version of the login page side-by-side.You can quickly test the output and instruct Claude to refine it. For plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript, Claude typically provides a demo. It can also generate Angular or React code, though not a live demo as of now,” says Shauvik.Once you have your code, test it, starting with small, isolated tests, before integrating it into larger systems, says Arun Prakash Agrawal, professor & head of the department of computer science & applications at Sharda School of Engineering and Technology in Greater Noida.Maintaining a comprehensive documentation of the code and decisions made during the project, Arun says, will aid in debugging and future maintenance.Mastering the art of writing prompts might be the most crucial skill to gain to make your coding journey more productive. This is the method by which a developer communicates with AI systems, and so being clear and concise is crucial.“Developers need to be specific, and provide proper context to a problem statement. Breaking down tasks, giving examples of similar codes, and asking for code comments will help the prompt responses to be more aligned with the desired outcome. A basic prompt can be refined through proper feedback,” says Deepak Visweswaraiah, VP of platform engineering, and site MD at Pegasystems, India.Vijay Navaluri, co-founder at Supervity, says structuring interactions as multi-turn conversations is also beneficial for complex tasks, as it allows the model to build on previous responses and maintain context.","Claude 3.5 Sonnet can generate websites, apps, and even games.

Evolutionary AI: Evolutionary AI is a powerful answer to complex problems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/evolutionary-ai-is-a-powerful-answer-to-complex-problems/articleshow/111501685.cms,"Real-world use cases

Last week on our webinar, we had three experts – Risto Miikkulainen, Babak Hodjat, and Amir Banifatemi — in the field of what’s called evolutionary AI who painted a vivid picture of the innovative technology and its potential to reshape decision making across industries.Miikkulainen, VP of AI research at Cognizant and professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, and a pioneer in the field of evolutionary AI, explains that evolutionary AI takes its cues from biology, much like neural networks .However, unlike most machine learning techniques that rely on supervised learning with clearly defined targets, evolutionary AI thrives in scenarios with weaker feedback. It can navigate complex problem spaces without predetermined answers.While traditional AI might excel at recognising patterns – like identifying a dog in an image – Miikkulainen says stopping at just prediction is akin to “leaving money on the table”. Instead, evolutionary AI goes a step further: it doesn’t just predict, it suggests actions. By simulating a population of potential solutions and allowing them to “evolve” towards better outcomes, evolutionary AI can uncover novel strategies that even human experts might overlook.As Hodjat, CTO of AI at Cognizant, puts it, evolutionary AI is more aligned with the way we go about making decisions. In the real world, decisions often involve balancing multiple, sometimes conflicting objectives. Evolutionary AI excels here, says Hodjat, offering a range of strategies that balance various outcomes, allowing decision-makers to choose the most suitable approach.“Look at the pandemic, you want to reduce the number of cases, but at the same time you don’t want to have a major economic impact on people’s livelihoods. Evolutionary AI is very good at coming up with strategies that give us a balance of multiple outcomes and lets us then choose which balance of outcomes is more interesting to us.”Hodjat describes a two-step process: first, using AI to create “predictors” that forecast outcomes based on different decisions. Then, evolutionary algorithms search the vast space of possible strategies to find optimal solutions. This approach, he argues, mirrors human decision making processes, allowing for scenario testing and collaborative refinement between AI and human experts.Banifatemi, technology and innovation strategist for AI Commons, a nonprofit that seeks to bring the benefits of AI to everyone, high lights evolutionary AI’s creative potential. Unlike traditional AI that derives solutions from existing knowledge, evolutionary algorithms, he says, can create entirely new solutions. This creativity, coupled with the ability to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously, makes evolutionary AI a powerful tool for tackling complex, multifaceted problems.Banifatemi also points out a crucial advantage: transparency. While many AI models operate as “black boxes,” the solutions generated by evolutionary AI are often more explainable. This transparency is vital in fields where understanding the reasoning behind a decision is as important as the decision itself.Miikkulainen describes an agricultural experiment where evolutionary AI discovered that basil thrives under 24-hour light – a counterintuitive finding that challenged biologists’ assumptions. The experiment involved planting about 300 basil plants and providing them with different amounts of light, water, nutrients, temperature, etc. “Most of them were recipes that the biologists came up with – the usual suspects. But we also had some exploratory examples. And so, we now had 300 points about how the plant grows under different conditions. And then we built a predictive model . We could then come up with crazy recipes and ask the model what would happen in different scenarios. It so happened that we had initially set up a limitation of six hours of darkness. But then we said, let’s open it up to try other solutions. And to the biologists’ big surprise, the model found basil thrives when lights were on 24 hours. This is the kind of solution that will be difficult for humans to discover because they have all kinds of assumptions and evolutionary AI does not,” Miikkulainen says.Banifatemi says evolutionary AI is also showing a lot of promise in pharmaceutical research, particularly for rare diseases where traditional approaches fall short. “For rare diseases, from a pharmaceutical perspective, a number of drug candidates need to be identified. And while the cost of drug research is huge, the market is not that large. With evolutionary AI you can find a cluster of potential molecules for a given set of constraints: like for toxicity, or for a particular genetic background. This accelerates drug research,” he says.The story of evolutionary AI is still unfolding. As researchers and companies like Cognizant continue to invest in and develop this technology, more innovative applications will emerge – and some could come from Cognizant’s India offices. “Cognizant has a very strong presence in India and we have colleagues in India that are well versed in using evolutionary AI,” says Hodjat."," evolutionary AI takes its cues from biology, much like neural networks.

Industry needs to boost capital investments to capitalise on growth opportunities: Anand Mahindra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/industry-needs-to-boost-capital-investments-to-capitalise-on-growth-opportunities-anand-mahindra/articleshow/111465064.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian companies need to enhance capital investment in order to take advantage of the growth opportunities available in India and abroad, according to Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra .Addressing shareholders in the company's annual report for 2023-24, the leading industrialist noted that the interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-Covid era has seen India's position strengthen.India's emerging role as one of the vital nodes in future-proofed supply chains across industries opens the door for growth within the country and expansion beyond, he stated.""How can we, in private industry , ensure that we ride this upsurging tide? ..In the spirit of 'ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country', I would argue that the most important thing industry can do at this critical juncture is to increase private investment ,"" Mahindra said.Private capital investment is the key to capitalising on this opportunity as it is a key driver of growth, jobs, and demand, he stated.After the economic reforms of the 1990s, private investment rose from around 10 per cent to around 27 per cent of GDP, however, from 2011-12 onwards, private investment as a percentage of GDP has been falling to a worrisome level, Mahindra stated.""We need to remedy that situation,"" he added.Mahindra noted that the problem is not one of resources—rather, it is one of mindset.Particularly after Covid, Indian companies have become increasingly risk averse, sticking to the tried and true rather than blazing new trails, he said.""To some extent, this is understandable. But when opportunity beckons, when private industry can make a significant difference, it is time to set aside our fear of failure and take a leap of faith and self-belief,"" he noted.It is undoubtedly a good time to be an Indian company, Mahindra said.""The interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-COVID era has seen India's position strengthen. A new multi-polar manufacturing world is emerging, as nations and companies rush to reconfigure their supply chains to be more resilient and diversified. India has emerged as a key beneficiary,"" he added.For private industry, particularly manufacturing, this confluence of factors translates into an excellent chance to be a serious player in this new, multi-polar world, Mahindra stated.He noted that India has been heavily investing in infrastructure and logistics and the country has become the cheapest manufacturing destination in the world.""Externally too, conditions are working in our favour. It's time to seize the day,"" he stated.Elaborating on the Mahindra Group, he said, ""On the back of this rising tide, we are stepping up our investments. We have already announced an investment of Rs 37,000 crore across our auto, farm and services businesses (excluding Tech Mahindra) in FY25, FY26 and FY27.""These investments will, to a large extent, go towards building capacity, with a pipeline of 26 new models/facelifts in the next 5 years, he said.The valuation of the company's growth gems increased over fourfold in the last four years, Mahindra said.The contribution of services businesses (Mahindra Finance, Tech Mahindra and growth gems) to M&M's net cash generation was almost Rs 7,000 crore over the FY22-FY24 period, he said.Mahindra & Mahindra MD and CEO Anish Shah said the company recognises the fact that private capital investment plays a crucial role in maximising the opportunities in India.""By outlining a capex plan of Rs 37,000 crore for the next three years, we remain committed to our proven strategy of prudent capital allocation,"" he stated.The Mahindra Group draws confidence from the cash generation across businesses, low debt levels, and a robust balance sheet, he added.",The interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-Covid era has seen India's position strengthen.

Jayachandran Ramachandran: Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new coding benchmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/claude-3-5-sonnet-sets-new-coding-benchmarks/articleshow/111329656.cms,"Anthropic’s latest AI model , Claude 3.5 Sonnet , arrived seemingly out of nowhere last week, free to use for everyone, and is now setting new benchmarks in a number of metrics. Most notably, it aced the leader boards in key categories of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena , a benchmark used to measure large language model performance. Specifically, it secured the top position in the ‘Coding Arena’ and ‘Hard Prompts’ categories, beating industry behemoths like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro , all while being a lighter, faster model to run.Jayachandran Ramachandran , senior VP of Artificial Intelligence Labs for C5i, says the LMSYS Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced open benchmarking platform and that users perform various tasks in pair wise comparison of models and provide feedback on which models can satisfactorily provide the best response. “The ranking system is quite transparent, robust, and reliable. In recent times, the top position was occupied by frontier models such as GPT-4 series and Gemini-1.5 series. It is a significant development for Claude 3.5 Sonnet to outsmart other leading frontier models and occupy the top position, especially in coding tasks,” he says.Saurav Swaroop , co-founder & CTO of financing platform Velocity, which recently launched Vani AI , a GenAIled customer calling solution for financial institutions, says that while GPT-4 has been assisting developers with writing code for some time now, it has been prone to errors and hallucinations. “However, Claude can write production level deployable code now. This will boost developer productivity and the time to build software will keep coming down,” he says.With its advanced reasoning skills, it’s great at handling multi-step workflows too, which is essential for complex projects, says Sourabh Kumar, senior manager of experience engineering for Publicis Sapient. “Compared to other industry leaders like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers faster processing speeds and higher accuracy in complex coding and reasoning tasks. For industries such as finance, where accurate data analysis is critical, or retail, where trend prediction can drive success, integrating Claude 3.5 Sonnet can lead to significant efficiency gains and innovation,” he says.Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also offer alternative solutions that coders might not have even considered, says Bebi Negi, senior lead data scientist at the Analytics Centre of Excellence for Happiest Minds Technologies.However, Bebi says coders will still need to check the code created by the model. “While it can create code quickly, it is very important to understand the code and make sure it meets a project’s requirements and standards. Even though benchmarks rate the model at around 90%, the remaining 10% gap underscores the necessity for coders to review the outputs,” she says.Securing the top spot in the Hard Prompts category was also a big deal, says Bebi. “The Hard Prompts category was all about handling complex tasks and instructions. The model did a great job here too, showing it can understand and generate high-quality content, even when the instructions are quite tricky.”","Anthropic’s latest AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is now free to use for everyone.

GenAI: On-device AI is cheaper and faster than cloud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/on-device-ai-is-cheaper-and-faster-than-cloud/articleshow/111329501.cms,"As devices such as smartphones , laptops, tablets and cars become more intelligent and powerful with increased processing capabilities and sensors, the tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on-device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.And while AI may have started off as something very specific to image processing, it has over the past four to five years evolved and exploded, especially with GenAI coming into play, to include a lot more use cases around text processing, voice processing and multimodal use cases, said Rajesh Narayanan, vice president of engineering at Qualcomm .He was speaking on ₹AI on the Edge’ at the first edition of the ‘TechForward’ research seminar series launched by Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIITH). The series seeks to spark regular and deep academia-industry conversations around emerging technologies.Narayanan pointed out that on-device AI has evolved to offer advantages such as personalisation , privacy and security, and with lower energy consumption and costs, and better performance compared to AI on the cloud.“Today, smartphones, smartwatches, devices that are a part of home automation, devices in the car and industrial IoT are equipped with plenty of cameras and sensors and are becoming a lot more powerful with the ability to collect more data. They also have more processing capacities, leading to more context aware user experience that can lead to a much better day-to-day life for all of us,” he said.He said that for all this to become a reality, you need a very powerful AI engine, and the overall solution has to be extremely power efficient.Personalisation is a key selling point for on-device AI as all the data that was earlier being sent to the cloud, potentially compromising privacy and security, can be done on the device. On-device AI also brings down energy consumption significantly compared to running workloads on a much bigger infrastructure like the cloud.Performance too improves as processing on the device itself can enable low latency as opposed to sending the query to the cloud, as with devices like Alexa.Narayanan said on-device AI is also a lot more affordable compared to the cloud. “As we transition from traditional AI to GenAI, the cost per query is actually going up and cloud economics isn’t going to work as compared to doing it on the device,” he said.In his talk on Vision on the AI edge’, Anoop Namboodiri , who heads the Biometrics and Secure Identity Lab and is associated with the Centre for Visual Information Technology at IIITH, said computer vision is playing a key role in pushing AI, and now GenAI.","The tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on- device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.

Service bots get our lingo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/service-bots-get-our-lingo/articleshow/111329125.cms,"Moving to complex functions

Indic language capability

is a little expensive now

The other day I decided to check out an airline’s chatbot to see how it works. I keyed in: “I’m travelling with my 8-year-old son, recommend the best flight without disturbing his sleep”. It asked for my source and destination, which I gave as Chennai and Hyderabad. It asked for the date. I typed ₹Mon’ (for Monday), but it did not recognise what I meant.I typed ₹tom’, it correctly recognised it as tomorrow.The bot responded that there were no flights that “fully meet” my specified criteria and provided a bunch of options. I then asked for the cheapest flight, and non-stop flights. The options it provided were correct – I confirmed that on MakeMyTrip and Google Flights. It automatically filled the passenger list as 1 adult and 1 child for booking. It even clarified the availability of gluten free food for my fictional son.Customer support bots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs. These sophisticated generative AI-based tools are much better than their predecessors, though still far from perfect. Sometimes they ask silly questions even after being explicitly told. They struggle to recognise colloquial words, have woefully poor memory, unlike human agents. But at least you don’t have to listen to hold music for 15 minutes.The leap comes from GenAI ’s ability to understand conversations better, their ability to understand multilingual queries , and support for interfaces like voice and videos. As these systems improve, customer support will become a lot quicker and easier for users, and hugely cheaper for companies, since they won’t have to hire thousands of contact centre staff.Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, director of AI Research at Zoho Corp, says with GenAI, the next goal is to make customer assistant bots do more complex and autonomous functions. He says they could hand over the issue to human agents when it figures it can’t handle it. He says they may even be able to process warranty claims, for instance. “As soon as you reach out, the system will be able to cross-check the database for similar issues/ queries where warranty claims are applicable. A human agent will have to call a supervisor to do the same job,” he says.But these are still some time away. Even for basic customer support services, companies are being careful due to concerns around data privacy, and hallucination. Nobody, after all, wants to get into a situation like Air Canada did earlier this year when its chatbot offered a discount to a customer that it wasn’t supposed to.Chaitanya Chokkareddy, cofounder of Ozonetel, the Hyderabadbased customer experience tech provider, says the focus currently is on automating the most common, repetitive queries. Chatbots, he says, fail in non-common areas of work.He says a lot of work is happening with AI in the back-end like data analysis, summary, intent analysis, and quality control, focusing on efficiency and productivity of human customer agents and improving margins of companies. “We handle about 20 million calls per day which last about 3 to 5 minutes each, and a lot of that data is currently not accessible to managers to make better decisions on their product and services. Demand for back-end services is higher than customer facing applications,” he says.While AI assistants perform relatively well in English, their performance in Indic languages is not great. Ozonetel is building Telugu language tokenisation by working with a non-profit and 1 lakh student interns to build a Telugu database. But Indian languages, he says, cost around 5x to 10x more compared to English because of the complex tokenisation of Indian languages compared to the Roman alphabet. “AI models are charged based on usage and chatbots using Indic scripts have more tokens and hence have higher computational costs. In many cases, the costs are equivalent to a human being and so our customers don’t want to automate,” Chaitanya says.Ankush Sabharwal’s CoRover.ai also has a local language model called BharatGPT. The bot can respond to voice queries in Indian languages, and provide tailored information. It also has video chatbots with pre-generated videos and text-to-video conversion and lip sync, which can be used for purposes like internal training.Ankush says redundant workload should be automated first, and as the adoption increases, more clear use cases will emerge. He says problems like hallucination can be reduced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and use of domain-specific small models.Abhiroop Medhekar, founder & CEO of financing platform Velocity, says they have built text-to-speech and speech-to-text tech for AI-agent voice call automation. They initially used it internally and then started commercial offerings. “Some BFSI applications require an immediate response from customers, but customers frequently don’t respond to mails or WhatsApp reminders. The current robotic IVR calls are not effective either. But these GenAI-based voice calls are interactive and provide better results,” he says.","Chatbots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs.

However, Russia's ongoing conflict with Ukraine has raised hopes for more concerted efforts in this direction. Germany, for instance, is currently considering partnering with Carlyle, a private equity firm, to jointly acquire a majority stake in Thyssenkrupp's submarines and frigates division.The alliance between Rheinmetall and Leonardo aligns with the broader objective of both groups to create pan-European consortia for the development of new combat systems.Cingolani stated, ""The target is to create a machine that is cutting-edge for the future. A machine that is cross-domain and interoperable, talking, in the future, to satellites, helicopters and aircraft.""On Wednesday, the companies announced that they have agreed to form a joint venture to produce tanks and other land defence systems, reported Reuters.The first goal of the 50-50 enterprise, which will be headquartered in Italy, will be to develop the Italian Main Battle Tank and Armoured Infantry Combat System for the Italian Army, they said in a joint statement.",Germany's Rheinmetall and Italy's Leonardo have formed a joint venture to consolidate the European defence vehicle sector.

"EU imposes duties on China-built EVs, leaving four months for talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-imposes-duties-on-china-built-evs-leaving-four-months-for-talks/articleshow/111484993.cms,"BRUSSELS: The European Union will impose tariffs of up to 37.6% from Friday on imports of electric vehicles made in China, EU officials said on Thursday, ratcheting up trade tension with Beijing.There is however a four-month window during which the tariffs are only provisional and intensive talks are expected to continue between the two sides.The European Commission 's provisional duties of between 17.4% and 37.6% without backdating are designed to prevent what its president Ursula von der Leyen has said is a threatened flood of cheap EVs built state subsidies.The rates are almost exactly the same as those announced by the Commission on June 12. The executive made slight adjustments after companies identified minor calculation errors in the initial disclosure.Beijing said then it would take ""all necessary measures"" to safeguard China's interests.These could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.The EU anti-subsidy investigation has nearly four more months to run.At the end of it, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, could propose ""definite duties"", typically applying for five years, on which EU members would vote.China's commerce ministry said on Thursday both sides have so far held several rounds of technical talks over tariffs on the issue.""There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,"" He Yadong, a ministry spokesperson, said.BYD will face duties of 17.4%, Geely 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%, the EU said on Thursday. These are on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports.Companies deemed by the EU to have cooperated with the anti-subsidy investigation, including western carmakers Tesla and BMW, will be subject to 20.8% tariffs and those that did not cooperate a rate of 37.6%.The Commission has estimated Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8% from below 1% in 2019 and could reach 15% in 2025. It says prices are typically 20% below those of EU-made models.European policymakers are keen to avoid a repeat of what happened with solar panels a decade ago, when the EU took only limited action to curb Chinese imports and many European manufacturers collapsed. The EU launched its anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs last October.The Chinese Passenger Car Association has said the tariffs will have only a modest impact on the majority of Chinese firms.The rates are far lower than the 100% tariff Washington plans to apply to Chinese EV imports from August.",The European Commission's provisional duties of between 17.4% and 37.6% without backdating are designed to prevent what its president Ursula von der Leyen has said is a threatened flood of cheap EVs built state subsidies.

It was en route to Singapore from London.And this week, some 40 passengers were injured when an Air Europa flight hit severe turbulence on its way from Madrid to Montevideo, Uruguay.Severe Turbulence on Singapore Airline Flight | Incident left one person dead and dozens injured. Plane diverted to Bangkok for emergency landingWhile the most turbulent flights of all connect Santiago in Chile to Santa Cruz in Bolivia, there are similarly bumpy rides across the world, according to the turbli database. Flights leaving Tokyo dominate the list of the roughest long-haul services.Strong turbulence is produced when air streams traveling at significantly different speeds come together. This is typically encountered at the boundaries of jet streams, over mountains and in certain cloud storms, according to the turbli website.For instance, turbulence on the Santiago-Santa Cruz route is generated by winds from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean flowing almost perpendicular to the Andes. The equator is also a well-known region for turbulence because of strong upward currents and thunderstorm activity, turbli said. Japan has high levels of mountain- and ocean-induced turbulence.The turbli website produced its rankings by analyzing 150,000 routes using data from UK and US government meteorological agencies.","Singapore Air Flight SQ321 encountered severe turbulence as it entered Thai airspace in late May, triggering an emergency landing in Bangkok.

The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.More than 90% of Ballmer’s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.Gates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett , Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.Since they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world’s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.Gates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer — one of the company’s earliest employees — replaced him as CEO. Ballmer retired in 2014 and became Microsoft’s largest shareholder that same year.

"Under pressure on plane safety, Boeing is buying stressed supplier Spirit for $4.7 billion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/under-pressure-on-plane-safety-boeing-is-buying-stressed-supplier-spirit-for-4-7-billion/articleshow/111403727.cms,"Boeing announced plans to acquire key supplier Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion, a move that it says will improve plane quality and safety amid increasing scrutiny by Congress, airlines and the Department of Justice.Boeing previously owned Spirit, and the purchase would reverse a longtime Boeing strategy of outsourcing key work on its passenger planes.That approach has been criticized as problems at Spirit disrupted production and delivery of popular Boeing jetliners including 737s and 787s.""We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly,"" Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said in a statement late Sunday.Concerns about safety came to a head after the Jan. 5 blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 at 16,000 feet (4,876 meters) over Oregon. The Federal Aviation Administration soon after announced increased oversight of Boeing and Spirit, which supplied the fuselage for the plane.No one was seriously injured in the Alaska Airlines door incident, which terrified passengers, but Boeing is under pressure from the US Justice Department to plead guilty to criminal fraud in connection with two deadly plane crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners more than five years ago.Boeing has until the end of the week to accept or reject the offer, which includes the giant aerospace company agreeing to an independent monitor who would oversee its compliance with anti-fraud laws, according to several people who heard federal prosecutors detail a proposed offer Sunday.The Justice Department said in a May court filing that Boeing violated terms of a 2021 settlement allowing the company to avoid prosecution for actions leading up to the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, which killed 346 people.Those crashes were blamed on a faulty sensor in a flight-control system and the investigation is separate from the probe of the more recent Alaska Airlines blowout, which involved Spirit.Boeing spun off Spirit, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, and not related to Spirit Airlines, in 2005. In recent years, quality problems have mounted, including fuselage panels that didn't fit together precisely enough and holes that were improperly drilled.Spirit removed its CEO in October and replaced him with Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who served as acting defense secretary in the Trump administration.Things seemed to be going more smoothly until the Alaska Airlines incident. Investigators said a panel used in place of an extra emergency door had been removed at a Boeing factory to let Spirit workers fix damaged rivets, and bolts that help hold the panel in place were missing after the repair job. It is not clear who removed the bolts and failed to put them back.Spirit said in May that it was laying off about 450 workers at its Wichita plant because of a production slowdown since the January incident. Its total workforce was just over 13,000 people.""Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies' manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems,"" Shanahan said.The acquisition 's equity value of $4.7 billion is $37.25 per share, while the total value of the deal is around $8.3 billion, which includes Spirit's last reported net debt, the aerospace company said.Boeing common stock will be exchanged for Spirit shares according to a variable formula that depends on a weighted average of the share price over a 15-trading-day period ending on the second day before the deal closes, Boeing said.The companies also announced an agreement with Airbus to negotiate the purchase of Spirit assets involved with programs operated by the European aerospace firm. The Airbus agreement is set to commence when Boeing's acquisition of Spirit is completed, the two US companies said.",Boeing announced plans to acquire key supplier Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion.
