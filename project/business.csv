Hyundai IPO Analysis

Hyundai IPO details

Hyundai IPO : Hyundai Motor India (HMI), the second-largest passenger vehicle (PV) manufacturer in the country, is set to raise a substantial amount of capital through an offer for sale (OFS). The promoter, Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) of South Korea, will reduce its stake from 100% to 82.5% post the OFS. To comply with regulatory requirements, HMC will need to further dilute its stake to 75% or lower in the future, which may impact HMI's stock price.HMI operates in a highly competitive market, and both Hyundai and its larger rival, Maruti, have experienced a gradual erosion of their volume market shares over the past five years.Moreover, the IPO price does not provide significant valuation comfort compared to Maruti, which boasts nearly three times higher PV market share, two-and-a-half times higher sales volume, and similar profitability.However, Hyundai has planned several new model launches in the coming quarters, spanning both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicle (EV) platforms. The company's capacity expansion plans also bode well for future growth.Considering these factors, risk-taking investors may find the IPO attractive, while risk-averse investors might prefer to observe the stock price trend post-IPO, says an ET analysis.Established in 1996, HMI is a full-range manufacturer of PVs, including hatchbacks, sedans, and SUVs across various powertrains. The company operates a fully functional plant in Chennai with a capacity of 8,24,000 units and is currently setting up another plant in Talegaon, Maharashtra.Also Read | Hyundai Motor India IPO, India’s largest IPO, set to open on October 15: From price band to listing - top 10 things to know Once fully operational, the total capacity will reach 10,74,000 units over the next three to four years. In FY24, HMI's PV sales grew by 8% year-on-year to 7,77,876 units, with ICE and CNG powertrains contributing 89.2% and 10.6%, respectively, while EVs accounted for 0.2%. The company's market share in hatchbacks, sedans, and SUVs stood at 12.3%, 20%, and 18.4%, respectively, in FY24.HMI's revenue grew by 21.4% annually between FY22 and FY24, reaching Rs 69,829 crore, while net profit increased by 44.5% to Rs 6,060 crore. The company's EBITDA margin improved from 11.6% to 13.1% during the same period, matching that of its peer, Maruti.The intense competition in the market has led to a gradual decline in HMI's PV market share, from 17.6% in FY20 to 14.6% in FY24. This may compel the company to offer higher customer discounts in the future to maintain market share, potentially impacting profitability.HMI's IPO price translates to an FY24 price-earnings (P/E) multiple of up to 26.7, while its closest peer, Maruti, trades at a P/E of 29.8.","Hyundai Motor India (HMI), the second-largest passenger vehicle (PV) manufacturer in the country, is set to raise a substantial amount of capital through an offer for sale (OFS) The promoter, Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) of South Korea, will reduce its stake from 100% to 82.5% post the OFS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114213965,imgsize-77498,width-400,resizemode-4/114213965.jpg"

Ratan Tata No More: India Loses 'Rare Gem' | PM Modi, Ambani, Adani Lead Tributes

NEW DELHI: The Tata Group today boasts a staggering revenue of $165 billion, but back in 1991, when Ratan Tata took the helm, the picture was far less impressive — just $4 billion in annual turnover.Inheriting a fragmented and bureaucratic empire, Ratan Tata didn’t just add zeros to the top line through innovations, new business ventures, and international expansions, but also transformed how the group operated.By 2012, when he hung up his boots, the group had smashed through the $100 billion barrier, becoming the first Indian conglomerate to reach such heights.While he joined the group in 1962 as an assistant in Tata Industries, he stepped into the chairman’s shoes only in March 1991, when the conglomerate was dominated by an old guard, operating its divisions as semi-autonomous kingdoms, rooted in his predecessor JRD Tata’s culture of decentralisation. He removed the satraps one by one, centralising power in Bombay House, the group’s HQ.His leadership coincided with India’s economic liberalisation in the early nineties, a moment he seized amid both opportunities and threats, including the rise of competitive markets following the demise of the licence raj.To adapt, Tata made bold decisions, selling off underperforming sectors like cement, textiles, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, while doubling down on existing businesses like software and steel, and entering new sectors like telecommunications, passenger cars, insurance, finance, retail, and aviation.His collaborative approach led to partnerships with international giants like Cummins, AIA, and Starbucks, enabling the group to manufacture automotive engines, sell insurance, and offer coffee from Kargil to Kochi. Acquisitions like Jaguar Land Rover, Tetley, and Corus not only fortified the group’s portfolio but also propelled it to international prominence, with over 60% of its revenues coming from operations across more than 100 countries by the end of his tenure.Central to Ratan Tata’s success strategy was his overhaul of corporate governance. He ensured that all businesses derived their strength from Tata Sons, the holding company. The company increased stakes in key units to over 26%, shielding them from hostile takeovers, such as the 2001 threat faced by Voltas from Lok Prakashan. He mandated that all group companies pay royalties to Tata Sons for using the Tata name, culminating in a new three-dimensional, blue-coloured logo that amplified brand value from $300 million in 1998 to a staggering $11 billion by 2012.In 2004, he took Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) public, raising $1.17 billion in India’s largest and Asia’s second-largest IPO at the time. In fact, TCS was the only major company from the group he took public. The capital raised through the IPO allowed for further acquisitions and increased stakes in Tata companies, fortifying the group’s financial foundation.However, Ratan Tata’s journey with the group was not without its challenges. In the late nineties, Tata Consumer Products found itself ensnared in a crisis when ULFA militants targeted its tea gardens for funding, throwing the company into turmoil. Additionally, the launch of the Indica car in 1998 resulted in a staggering Rs 500-crore loss for Tata Motors in FY2000, leading to shareholder discontent and Ratan Tata’s offer to resign from the chairmanship.Nevertheless, his commitment to innovation led to the launch of the Nano in 2005, touted as the world’s cheapest car, although that too ran into trouble, encountering political opposition and violent protests over land seizures in Singur, West Bengal.The group also encountered a major financial scandal in 2001, with a ₹500 crore fraud uncovered at Tata Finance. Ratan Tata stepped in, assuring investors that their money would be repaid, ultimately resulting in the merger of Tata Finance into Tata Motors in 2005.But perhaps the most harrowing moment of his career came on November 26, 2008, when the terrorist attack on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel unfolded before his eyes. The assault not only inflicted tragic losses but also struck at the heart of a flagship property that was a significant contributor to Indian Hotels’ revenues.Ratan Tata retired in December 2012 but returned briefly as chair from October 2016 to February 2017 to address leadership challenges within the group. As the Tata Group continues to flourish under the guidance of his successors, Ratan Tata’s legacy is firmly etched in the annals of Indian business history. His foresight, determination, and resilience have not only transformed the Tata Group but have also left an indelible mark on the Indian economy","Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons, passed away on Wednesday at the age of 86 in a Mumbai hospital.

World Bank says 26 poorest countries in worst financial shape since 2006,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/world-bank-says-26-poorest-nations-in-worst-financial-shape-since-2006/articleshow/114203979.cms,"The World Bank building is pictured in Washington, April 5, 2021.

WASHINGTON: The world's 26 poorest countries , home to 40% of the most poverty-stricken people, are more in debt than at any time since 2006 and increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters and other shocks, a new World Bank report showed on Sunday.The report finds that these economies are poorer today on average than they were on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic, even as the rest of the world has largely recovered from Covid and resumed its growth trajectory.Released a week before World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings get underway in Washington, the report confirms a major setback to efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and underscores the World Bank's efforts this year to raise $100 billion to replenish its financing fund for the world's poorest countries, the International Development Association (IDA).The 26 poorest economies studied, which have annual per-capita incomes of less than $1,145, are increasingly reliant on IDA grants and near-zero interest rate loans as market financing has largely dried up, the World Bank said. Their average debt-to-GDP ratio of 72% is at an 18-year high and half of the group are either in debt distress or at high risk of it.Most of the countries in the study are in sub-Saharan Africa, from Ethiopia to Chad and Congo, but the list also includes Afghanistan and Yemen.Two thirds of the 26 poorest countries are either in armed conflicts or have difficulty maintaining order because of institutional and social fragility, which inhibit foreign investment, and nearly all export commodities, exposing them to frequent boom-and-bust cycles, the report said.""At a time when much of the world simply backed away from the poorest countries, IDA has been their lifeline,"" World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill said in a statement. ""Over the past five years, it has poured most of its financial resources into the 26 low-income economies, keeping them afloat through the historic setbacks they suffered.""IDA normally is replenished every three years with contributions from World Bank shareholding countries. It raised a record $93 billion in 2021 and World Bank President Ajay Banga is aiming to exceed that with more than $100 billion in pledges by Dec. 6.Natural disasters have also taken a greater toll on these countries over the past decade. Between 2011 and 2023, natural disasters were associated with average annual losses of 2% of GDP, five times the average among lower-middle-income countries, pointing to the need for much higher investment, the World Bank said.The report also recommended that these economies, which have large informal sectors operating outside their tax systems, do more to help themselves. This includes improving tax collections by simplifying taxpayer registration and tax administration and improving the efficiency of public spending.",The world's 26 poorest countries are more in debt than at any time since 2006.

Hyundai IPO: What should investors expect?

Hyundai IPO GMP : Investors considering Hyundai Motor India's record-breaking initial public offering (IPO) should be prepared to hold the stock for at least a year to achieve substantial returns.Analysts anticipate a modest listing for the country's second-largest car manufacturer, with grey market trends suggesting a moderate opening.According to an ET report, as of Monday evening, the grey market premium or GMP for Hyundai shares was Rs 30, or 1.5% above the upper end of the issue price band of Rs 1,865 to Rs 1,960.On October 4, the GMP for Hyundai shares was Rs 370.GMP refers to the additional price investors are willing to pay for shares in the unofficial market before they are officially listed, over and above the IPO price.The Rs 27,870 crore Hyundai IPO is set to open on Tuesday and close on Thursday.Krishna Appala, senior research analyst at Capitalmind Research, told ET, ""The grey market premium has declined in recent weeks due to heightened market volatility and dampening demand.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month. There are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024. The tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112186146,imgsize-55630,width-400,resizemode-4/112186146.jpg"

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

The governor's caution comes at a time when the payment landscape is dominated by two players - Google Pay and Wal Mart-owned PhonePe.

Shanghai stocks gain after stimulus briefing as Asian markets rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shanghai-stocks-gain-after-stimulus-briefing-as-asian-markets-rally/articleshow/114212559.cms,"Key figures around 0710 GMT

Shanghai stocks rose Monday as traders digested a pledge by China's finance minister to provide more help for the country's struggling economy, while most other Asian markets tracked another record day on Wall Street.While a much-anticipated briefing on Saturday failed to deliver a hoped-for overall figure on stimulus, Lan Fo'an did set out plans to boost the beleaguered property sector , ramp up borrowing and work to get banks lending more.Lan said the government would issue special bonds and that it had $325 billion in funds raised that it could deploy in the next three months to achieve its goals.The announcement came at the end of a volatile week for traders who were left disappointed by a news conference on Tuesday that lacked any new support and barely any detail on a raft of measures unveiled in late September.The news out of Beijing came a day before data showed Chinese inflation slowed more than expected in September, highlighting the uphill task leaders have in getting the world's number two economy back on track.Authorities have come under increasing pressure this year to deploy a ""bazooka"" stimulus as a crisis in the real estate sector shows no signs of easing and consumption remains torpid.Traders elsewhere in Asia also welcomed another record for the Dow and S&P 500 in New York, cheered by healthy earnings from banking titan JPMorgan Chase, which said the US economy would likely avoid tipping into recession.""Significant measures for resolving local government debt and supporting the struggling property sector were mentioned,"" said analysts at HSBC Global Research in a note.""These are much needed for sustainable growth. We expect more details and the crucial fiscal number to be unveiled later this month at the State Council and/or the NPC Standing Committee meeting.""Investors are now eyeing the release of key Chinese data later in the week, including on retail sales, trade and economic growth.IG markets analyst Tony Sycamore added: ""While the full effects of the recent economic measures may not be immediately evident in the upcoming data releases, these figures will provide more insight into how China's economy is faring and whether additional actions may be necessary.""Shanghai climbed more than one percent but Hong Kong returned from a three-day weekend to fall.The markets whipsawed last week, having rocketed more than 20 percent in reaction to the raft of support pledges last month that had a particular emphasis on helping the battered property sector.Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's Analytics, said Saturday's announcement ""ticked most of the right boxes, but it lacked detail on the scale and scope of new spending"", adding that ""we expect more supports to be announced through the remainder of the year"".Among other markets, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Manila, Mumbai and Jakarta rose, but Wellington edged lower.London was down at the open, while Paris and Frankfurt were up ahead of a European Central Bank meeting this week where it is expected to lower interest rates as inflation ebbs and concerns over sluggish economic growth mount.Oil prices dropped more than one percent as concerns about the outlook for China's economy offset worries about a Middle East-wide conflict after Israel's defence minister pledged his country would strike Iran in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month.Shanghai - Composite: UP 2.1 percent at 3,284.32 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 0.5 percent at 21,141.25London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.1 percent at 8,247.75Tokyo - Nikkei 225: Closed for a holidayEuro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0925 from $1.0941 on FridayPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.3064 from $1.3068Dollar/yen: UP at 149.22 yen from 149.09 yenEuro/pound: DOWN at 83.62 pence from 83.70 penceWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 1.3 percent at $74.56 per barrelBrent North Sea Crude: DOWN 1.3 percent at $78.05 per barrelNew York - Dow: UP 1.0 percent at 42,863.86 points (close)",Shanghai stocks rise as traders digested pledge by China's finance minister to provide more help for the country's struggling economy.

"Indigenous tourism to contribute $67 billion to global economy by 2034, says WTTC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/indigenous-tourism-to-contribute-67-billion-to-global-economy-by-2034-says-wttc/articleshow/114174975.cms,"PERTH: Indigenous tourism is projected to contribute $67 billion to the global economy by 2034, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council ( WTTC ). 'Supporting Global Indigenous Tourism,' a report released by the world tourism body at its recent Global Summit at Perth in Western Australia showcases the role of indigenous tourism in driving economic growth, particularly in remote regions, and its vital contribution for cultural preservation and community empowerment .Speaking at the summit, Julia Simpson, WTTC president and CEO said, ""Indigenous tourism is not only about showcasing rich cultural traditions; it is about empowering communities, creating sustainable jobs, and ensuring that Indigenous people are in control of their own stories and economic futures.""""This report demonstrates the immense potential of indigenous tourism to drive economic growth, particularly in remote regions, while preserving invaluable cultural heritage. As global demand for authentic experiences continues to rise, it is crucial that we support indigenous businesses and ensure they have access to the resources and funding needed to thrive,"" Simpson said.The indigenous tourism also plays a crucial role in preserving cultural heritage, languages, and traditional practices, said the report released at the three-day 24th WTTC Global Summit which saw a gathering of industry leaders, government officials, and delegates from across the globe.During the gathering, WTTC launched 'Together in Travel', a unique initiative aimed at providing support and resources to small and medium enterprises within the global travel and tourism sector.The platform is designed to provide SMEs with the tools and resources they need to accelerate their business growth and ensure their voices are heard on a global scale.Another report released by WTTC revealed that business travel is set to surpass pre-pandemic levels this year, faster than previously predicted, to reach $1.5 trillion.The rise of remote working during the pandemic had a disproportionate effect on corporate travel, compared to leisure travel, with virtual platforms replacing face-to-face meetings, the report said.ForwardKeys, a leading travel intelligence firm and WTTC's knowledge partner, said the global tourism industry is roaring back to life in 2024, with international arrivals up by 16 per cent compared to 2023 figures.This resurgence is largely fuelled by the Asia Pacific region, which is finally hitting its stride after a delayed post-pandemic reopening, the firm said.Another report by WTTC reveals that Oceania's travel and tourism sector could inject an additional $112 billion to the region's economy by 2034, bringing the total contribution to a record-breaking $336 billion.The report, 'Unlocking Opportunities for Travel & Tourism Growth in Oceania.' outlines the transformative potential of the region's sector if strategic investments are made. It says Oceania, which includes Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, could become a global leader in sustainable travel.The WTTC announced Nguyen Thao Van from VinUniversity, Vietnam, as the winner of the inaugural Investors' Nest.In partnership with the Sustainable Hospitality Challenge, this event showcased visionary solutions from brightest student minds, showcasing next generation solutions poised to transform the future of hospitality.The latest Environmental and Social Research released by WTTC, and created in partnership with the Ministry of Tourism of Saudi Arabia, reveals that in 2023 travel and tourism accounted for 6.7 per cent of all emissions globally, down from 7.8 per cent in 2019, when the sector was at its peak.The research points out that the sector's economic contribution is growing faster than its environmental impact.The summit also featured insights from former US Secretary of State John Kerry and Robert Irwin, one of Australia's foremost conservationists, reflecting on pressing global environmental challenges and the role of tourism in addressing them.The global tourism body also announced that the 25th WTTC Global Summit would be held in Rome next year.","Indigenous tourism is projected to contribute $67 billion to the global economy by 2034, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.
