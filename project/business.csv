And my own belief is that as a democracy, if we can provide a hassle free environment for entrepreneurs, if we can create policies that make their progress faster and easier.

RBI approves record Rs 2.1L cr dividend to govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bonds-rally-as-rbi-pays-record-dividend-to-govt/articleshow/110342782.cms,"Bonds rally as RBI pays record dividend to govt

MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) on Wednesday declared a record dividend of Rs 2.1 lakh crore to govt, more than double what was expected by the money markets.The dividend is more than the Rs 1.02 lakh crore that govt had budgeted as dividends from all financial institutions and will reduce its need to borrow from the market.This is the second year in a row that the central bank has paid a dividend which is sharply higher than the amount that govt had budgeted.The likelihood of a lower govt borrowing pushed down yields on the 10-year govt bonds to below 7%. Experts said the surplus transfer to govt will help it reduce the fiscal deficit and make funds available for capital spending.RBI's decision to pay govt reord Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend - which will infuse substantial liquidity in to the banking system - led to a smart rally in the bond market on Wednesday. As a result, the benchmark yield on the 10-year paper fell below the psychologically important 7% mark after about a year.At close of trade, the 10-year bonds maturing in 2034 closed at a yield of 6.99% while the one maturing in 2033 (the outgoing 10-year benchmark bonds) closed at 7.04%. Both the bonds saw yields fall by 6 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point), RBI data showed.Bond dealers, however, said for further rally in sovereign bonds they would want to know how and where the govt will use the huge pay-in from the central bank. In case the govt cuts its total market borrowing for the current fiscal which could lead to a rally in gilts.Currently, the banking system is facing Rs 1-lakh-crore deficit, which is keeping yields at an elevated level. After the election, if govt starts spending, which will infuse liquidity into the system that could help soften yields in the market, said a bond dealer. A fresh rally in bonds could also start if the ruling BJP-led govt comes back to power with a comfortable majority. Any unusual election result could lead to some selloff in the bond market, the dealer said.A section of the market players feels that govt should continue to cut its short-term borrowings (which are bonds of less than 5-year maturity). Such a policy could soften rates at the shorter end of the curve. And since corporates mostly borrow at the shorter end of the yield curve, a softer rate could also help corporates through lower interest outgo.","RBI's decision to pay govt reord Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend - which will infuse substantial liquidity in to the banking system - led to a smart rally in the bond market on Wednesday.

Reliance’s new venture Tira bets on AI tools to push into sizzling Indian beauty market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliances-new-venture-tira-bets-on-ai-tools-to-push-into-sizzling-indian-beauty-market/articleshow/110347671.cms,"Race to enter

Reliance’s Playbook

Reliance Industries Ltd.’s new venture, Tira , is leaning on artificial intelligence tools that can suggest perfumes or cosmetics to woo customers in the burgeoning but competitive Indian beauty sector.Tira, which was launched by billionaire Mukesh Ambani ’s conglomerate in April last year, also uses electronic vending machines in its stores to dispense free samples of skincare products , according to Tejas Kapadia, head of marketing of the year-old startup that has 12 stores across India and a website.“Customers love that and they keep coming back for that,” Kapadia said in Tira’s first interview since its launch. The idea is to give a “plethora of experiences” using “some form of AI ,” he added.One such interactive in-store experience is a “fragrance finder,” which gives perfume options after letting consumers smell a set of “cubes” with different notes of fragrances.Its “skin analyzer” infers the features of a customer by clicking a photo and recommends products that would suit them best. Its stores offer a free engraving service for buyers to personalize their purchases by etching names on perfumes bottles or make-up boxes. The website also provides makeup and skincare lessons.Tira is Reliance’s lead horse in the race for the world’s fastest growing major beauty market. The conglomerate’s retail business, helmed by Ambani’s daughter Isha, has also taken over the local operations of skincare brand Kiko Milano and LVMH Group’s luxury beauty retailer Sephora in the past one year. Tira is competing with brands like Tata Group’s Palette and current market leader, Nykaa.The local beauty segment is expected to grow at 10% between 2022 and 2027, according to a September report by RedSeer Strategy Consultants and PeakXV, beating China’s 7% and the US’ 5% forecast growth rates.That’s why international brands are also rushing into India. In 2023, Japan’s Shiseido-owned NARS Cosmetic signed a distribution partnership with Shoppers Stop Ltd. and Selena Gomez launched her brand Rare Beauty on Sephora India. This year, Rihanna brought her cosmetics line Fenty Beauty to India for the first time on Nykaa.Customer browses beauty products at Tira beauty store in Mumbai. Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg“It is a great time to be in the beauty and personal care sector,” said Abhishek Malhotra, a Mumbai-based partner at McKinsey & Company. “People have more disposable income, increased awareness and higher aspirations.”Reliance, led by Asia’s richest person, has been diversifying beyond its oil refining roots for years and entering consumer-facing and technology-led businesses. The almost $32 billion Indian beauty and personal care segment is the latest addition to its expanding portfolio that includes mega refineries, a wireless services provider, a streaming platform and Hamleys toy stores.Tira, which offers brands from American Smashbox and Estee Lauder to Korea’s Sulwhasoo and homegrown newbie Re’equil, is marketed as “slightly premium,” according to Kapadia, who didn’t clarify if Tira will offer heavy discounts to gain market share. Cut-throat pricing that drives out rivals has been Reliance’s playbook across multiple sectors in the past.Reliance, in its December-quarter earnings release, said that Tira delivered a “strong performance across various operating metrics including sales productivity, average bill value,” without sharing revenue or growth numbers.Kapadia says Tire will need to keep innovating to build a significant market share.“What we’ve done so far is bring in these great tech aspects. Obviously some other players are also now picking up on them,” Kapadia said. “So we need to continue pushing the boundary.”","Reliance Industries Ltd.’s new venture, Tira, is leaning on artificial intelligence tools that can suggest perfumes or cosmetics.

'Debit card decline fine unreasonable',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/debit-card-decline-fine-unreasonable/articleshow/110342804.cms,"MUMBAI: There is a considerable variation in service charges imposed by banks on transactions, which are neither 'reasonable' nor 'reflecting the costs' as prescribed by RBI, according to a study.The most painful charges for underprivileged customers are the debit card decline charges many banks impose. Customers attempting to withdraw cash or pay using their debit cards, when their balance falls short are subjected to a penalty.This penalty is imposed even though a declined transaction does not result in any transaction cost for the bank.According to the study, this decline charge is unreasonable because the bank does not pay any fee to either a third-party bank whose ATM is used or the network provider NPCI. This is because unlike cash withdrawal or balance enquiry transactions, neither banks nor NPCI charge fees to the card issuing bank.The study has been authored by Ashish Das, an IIT Bombay professor, whose earlier studies had resulted in RBI reworking ATM charges and also forced banks to refund fees for withdrawals using UPI.","The most painful charges for underprivileged customers are the debit card decline charges many banks impose.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

High-speed traders pile into big short on volatility in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/high-speed-traders-pile-into-big-short-on-volatility-in-india/articleshow/110347876.cms,"In a market that’s captured the attention of global finance for allegedly making $1 billion for Jane Street Group , many trading firms are employing a relatively simple strategy: short volatility.The trade , or variations of it, revolves around a bet that Indian stock indices will move within relatively small ranges, according to five participants familiar with the strategy, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.Significant amounts of capital are deployed to scale the derivatives bets in the world’s largest market by number of options contracts traded, the people said.While the high-speed traders sell options, long-only funds and retail investors buy contracts to make speculative bets or protect themselves against sudden market drops and are often on the other side of the trade, the people said.There is no indication that Jane Street’s billion-dollar strategy, which it has been ordered to detail to a US District Judge by May 23, employed any of these trades. An external spokesperson for Jane Street declined to comment.The wager has been lucrative so far as India’s rising wealth and a shift by global asset managers away from China has steadily lifted the South Asian nation’s equities. The country’s stock benchmark has moved 2% or more in only nine out of the previous 500 trading sessions, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Still, the strategies can be risky, leaving firms open to massive losses in the event of sudden, large moves.India’s options market entered the spotlight last month after Jane Street filed a lawsuit against two former employees alleging they took a secret strategy involving Indian options to their new jobs at Millennium Management, sparking interest in how they might have amassed the profits. Risky bets around the derivatives also led to a pair of traders in Hong Kong exiting Societe Generale SA, people familiar with the matter have said.While none of the trading firms have disclosed their strategies, Optiver, Citadel Securities LLC, IMC Trading BV and Jump Trading have all been expanding in India, alongside a bevy of hedge funds and other players.A common strategy has been to sell puts and calls, either at the same strike or at different strikes. In both cases, the sellers of these so-called straddles and strangles bet that the premium they pocket more than offsets any loss from a move in the index.Aside from shorting volatility, trading firms also profit from continuously offering to buy and sell on a range of options, hoping to profit on the spread between bid and ask, one of the people said.“Shorting volatility, writing puts, writing calls is their mainstay,” said Abhilash Pagaria, a quant strategist at Nuvama Wealth Management, which handles trades for some high-frequency firms.Retail investors make up about 35% of index option trades in India, with the market regulator estimating that 90% of active retail traders lose money on derivatives.Volatility in Indian equities has been subdued over the past year, compared to US and Hong Kong stocks, but traders are bracing for potential swings around parliamentary election results due in early June.Large spikes in volatility are bad news for algorithmic traders, who generally trade derivatives of India’s benchmark Nifty 50 or Nifty Bank Index, said Amit Kumar Gupta, founder of New Delhi-based money manager Fintrekk. “Gap ups and gap downs can kill high-frequency traders,” he said.",Jane Street Group allegedly made $1 billion in Indian options trades. Trading firms are employing a relatively simple strategy: short volatility. The wager has been lucrative so far as India’s rising wealth and a shift by global asset managers away from China has steadily lifted the South Asian nation's equities.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110347948,imgsize-69818,width-400,resizemode-4/110347948.jpg"

Father's tricks

Political slugfest

What the FIRs say

NEW DELHI: Two young software engineers died on Sunday after a Porsche Taycan car, driven by a prominent builder’s 17-year-old son, hit their motorcycle from behind at around 2.30am in Pune. The car was being driven at 160kmph at the time of the crash. The cops identified the deceased as Aneesh Awadhia (24) and Ashwini Koshta (24), both computer science engineering graduates who hailed from Madhya Pradesh, and studied at an engineering college in Pune before taking up jobs with a software company.The crash, the deaths, the swift release of the accused, the arrest of his father, the action against the pubs and the subsequent political slugfest look like a chain reaction that has gripped the nation.The teenage driver was arrested by the police, but within 15 hours, he was granted bail by Pune's Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), which also rejected the police's request for his trial as an adult. The bail conditions set by the JJB, which included writing a 300-word essay on accidents, painting traffic awareness boards, working with a traffic constable, and attending counseling, sparked outrage among the public. Even Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis expressed shock at the bail conditions, calling them ""shocking and surprising"" and suggesting that the order needs to be reviewed.“We feel JJB’s order ended up raising many questions. The board took a lenient view of the matter. The order needs to be reviewed,” he said after meeting top Pune police officers at the commissioner’s office.Before the accident, the teen along with his friends drank alcohol at two pubs in the city - Cosie and Blak Mariott. He spent Rs 48,000 in 90 minutes at Cosie which the teen and his friends visited at 10.40pm on Saturday evening. They left for the second pub, Blak Mariott, at 12.10am after Cosie stopped serving them.""The teenager had visited pubs and consumed alcohol before driving his car. We have ample CCTV footage of the boy and his group consuming alcohol. The blood sample reports are still awaited,"" a city police official said. The owner and two staffers of the two Mundhwa pubs were arrested on Tuesday for serving liquor to minors. The police arrested Sachin Katkar (35) and Naman Bhutada, manager and owner, respectively, of the Cosie pub, and Sandeep Sangle (35), assistant restaurant manager of Blak Marriott pub. They were sent to judicial custody till May 24 by a special court.According to cops, the trio’s custodial interrogation was essential to establish their individual roles as they had allowed minors into the pubs and served them liquor. Despite not being a member of the pubs, the teenager was allowed inside without verifying his age.The police need to investigate if the teenager used another customer’s membership card to enter the pub, and also have to check the official record of customers visiting the pub. The prosecution also sought time to recover the liquor bill and identify the person who paid the bill. Pune collector Suhas Diwase later in the day ordered the indefinite closure of the two pubs.The father of the teenage driver, a prominent builder, was detained by the Pune crime branch team along with his driver and an associate from separate locations in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.The father is facing charges of giving his son his high-end car to drive despite knowing that the latter did not have a driving licence nor was he trained to drive the car and that his son consumed alcohol. The builder was detained from a lodge in Sambhajinagar, while his driver and associate were picked from a hotel.The builder attempted to outsmart the cops after fleeing the city. He sent one of his vehicles towards Mumbai and another to Goa. He borrowed a vehicle from an associate but it had a GPS fitted in it.Raut seeks removal of police chief: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut on Tuesday demanded removal of the Pune police commissioner in connection with the case.Raut told reporters that the police gave a false report in connection with the accident and wondered whom the Pune CP was trying to save. “The Pune CP should be sacked. Whom has he helped in this case? Two innocent persons lost their lives. The boy can be seen drinking in pub.” Without elaborating he claimed, “This is a corrupt police system and a corrupt MLA.”Maha LoP seeks judicial probe: Maharashtra’s leader of opposition Vijay Wadettiwar demanded on Tuesday a judicial inquiry into the Pune accident . In a post on ‘X’, the Bramhapuri MLA raised doubts about the effectiveness of Pune police’s investigation and highlighted disparities between CCTV footage and the police report.Rahul - Why special treatment to brat?: Rahul Gandhi has questioned why “preferential treatment” was meted out to a wealthy 17-year-old drunken boy. “When a teen from a rich family consumes alcohol and kills two people with his Porsche, he is told to pen an ‘essay’. Why are bus, truck autorickshaw drivers or cabbies not asked to write such essays (after accidents),” asked Gandhi.Fadnavis defends Pune Police: “An officer of the rank of assistant commissioner of police is conducting an inquiry into these allegations. If any sort of preferential treatment has been given, we will dismiss all the staff at the police station.”The Pune police are now trying to build a strong case against the accused, seeking a review of the JJB's bail order and requesting that the teenager be considered an adult due to the heinous nature of the crime. The police have presented evidence such as CCTV footage and photographs showing the teenager driving at high speed after consuming alcohol at two pubs. They have also invoked section 185 of the Motor Vehicle Act against the 17-year-old driver for driving under the influence of alcohol.The police have also registered a second FIR against his father, the two pub owners and three staffers for offences under sections 77 (penalty for giving intoxicating liquor or narcotic drug or psychotropic substances to a child) and 75 (punishment for cruelty to child) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and under sections 3 (necessity for driving licence), 5 (responsibility of owners of motor vehicles for contravention of sections 3 and 4) and 199-A (offences by juveniles) of the Motor Vehicles Act.","Two software engineers died on Sunday after a Porsche Taycan car, driven by a prominent builder’s 17-year-old son, hit their motorcycle from behind.

Money laundering case: What Delhi high court judge said while denying bail to Manish Sisodia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/money-laundering-case-manish-sisodia-denied-bail-what-delhi-hc-judge-said-in-prima-facie-observations/articleshow/110319255.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi high court dismissed Manish Sisodia ’s bail pleas on Tuesday, saying the prosecution has made out a “prima facie case” of money laundering against the former deputy CM in the excise policy case. It can’t be ruled out that Sisodia, if released on bail, may influence witnesses and tamper with evidence as he is “an influential person in the power corridors of Delhi govt”, the court added.Dismissing the AAP leader’s bail petition in cases lodged by ED and CBI in connection with the alleged liquor scam, Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma said, “The case at hand is a grave misuse of power and breach of public trust by the applicant who was serving as deputy chief minister of Delhi at the relevant point.”The court pointed out that the material collected during investigation showed that Sisodia “subverted” the process of making the policy by “fabricating” public feedback to suit his “predetermined goal”.HC said rather than genuinely take the opinion of com mon citizens of Delhi on the new excise policy, pre-drafted emails containing specific suggestions aligning with his own interest were sent to the feedback email address.In a related development, a city court extended Sisodia’s judicial custody till May 31 in a money laundering case .Pre-drafted e-mails with specific suggestions on the new excise policy were sent to the designated feedback email address of the excise department “under the guise of public feedback or opinion by individuals who were instructed to do so by the applicant Manish Sisodia himself”, the high court noted on Tuesday, while dismissing the former deputy CM's bail pleas.Justice Sharma termed it a “deceptive act that was a calculated move to create an illusion that the excise policy was formed after careful consideration of feedback received from the public...but in reality, the feedback was manufactured to justify the applicant’s decision to formulate excise policy in defiance of the expert committee report”.The court said the alleged corruption in this case “originated from Sisodia’s desire” to create a liberal policy that would benefit select individuals in return for a substantial amount as advance kickbacks. “Excise policy decision was based on falsified inputs compromising the integrity of the decision making process. Public’s voice was rendered mute,” it underlined.While a copy of the order is yet to be uploaded, Justice Sharma read out a few portions of the verdict and noted that Sisodia’s plea doesn’t pass the “triple test” for bail under prevention of corruption act or the conditions required for release under the stringent PMLA.The court highlighted that Sisodia had failed to produce his two mobile phones which he had been using at the time, claiming they were damaged or not traceable. “Hence the possibility of tampering with evidence on his release on bail can’t be ruled out,” the court said, adding that since he was deputy CM and held 18 portfolios, it shows “he was a very powerful person”. HC added that several govt officials have testified against Sisodia who may influence these witnesses if released on bail.On claims of delay in trial by Sisodia’s legal team, the court said there has been no delay on the part of the prosecution to supply documents to the accused and, similarly, there has been no delay on the part of the trial court. “No fault can be found with ED or CBI as there is a voluminous record of investigation,” HC said but recorded the “insist ence” of the accused, including Sisodia, to physically examine voluminous documents as one of the reasons for delay.HC said it can independently apply its mind to the facts of the case and decide the bail application, and that the argument of the senior counsel for Sisodia that this court cannot go beyond the observations made by Supreme Court, while earlier denying bail to the AAP leader, is meritless. It, however, directed that Sisodia can continue to meet, in custody, his ailing wife every week on the same terms and conditions as provided by the trial court.","Delhi high court dismissed Manish Sisodia’s bail pleas on Tuesday.

Hard, soft blocks

For one Citigroup Inc trader in London, the morning of May 2, 2022 went from bad to worse.It was a public holiday in the UK, so it should have been a quiet day in the markets. A little before 9am, the staffer on Citigroup’s Delta One trading desk began putting together a trade that would hedge the bank’s exposure to the MSCI World Index .A tool that employees usually used for such a transaction wasn’t available that morning, so the trader had to manually build the basket of stocks.That’s where things started to go wrong.In Citigroup’s systems, traders have the option of either entering the notional value of a trade they want to make or entering the quantity of index units they want to trade. On that day in May, the trader meant to create a basket of equities valued at $58 million, but accidentally entered that 58 million into the quantity field instead, creating a mammoth $444 billion basket containing 349 stocks from 13 different countries.The Wall Street giant’s systems immediately fired off hundreds of warnings, ultimately blocking some — but not all — of the trade from going through. Still, about $1.4 billion worth of equities began to be sold across European exchanges.Markets immediately started going haywire. Within minutes, the trader realized the mistake and canceled the order. But the damage was done: The blunder had sparked a five-minute selloff in European stocks, wreaking havoc in bourses stretching from France to Norway.Two years on, UK regulators on Wednesday revealed the result of their long-running probe into Citigroup’s actions that day as they saddled the bank with £61.6 million ($78 million) in penalties for the mistake. Their findings offer the first window into how a fat-finger glitch — along with a bevy of risk management lapses — turned into a flash crash that at one point wiped €300 billion ($325 billion) off European stocks.It’s the latest blow for Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser, who has spent years trying to shore up the lending giant’s underlying risk management systems.“These failings led to over a billion pounds of erroneous orders being executed and risked creating a disorderly market,” Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority , said in a statement. “We expect firms to look at their own controls and ensure that they are appropriate given the speed and complexity of financial markets.”Just before the trader began putting together the errant transaction, a separate team at Citigroup was figuring out how to handle its responsibilities for the day.The bank’s algorithmic service desk, which normally oversees the real-time monitoring of internal executions, had decided to transfer those responsibilities to the electronic execution desk because it had staff out on scheduled leave that day.When the trader first input the erroneous trade, he was met with a wall of 711 warning messages. He quickly overrode the ones he could and the order was placed at 8:56am.Some previous cases of erroneous trades:Trades began being executed across exchanges in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, sparking a sudden drop in European indexes. Inside Citigroup, executives were puzzled by the dip and consulted newswires to try to figure out what was behind it.By 9:10am, the trader had canceled the order, saddling Citigroup with a $48 million loss.The electronic execution desk had been receiving hundreds of alerts about the erroneous trade but failed to escalate any of them. A separate team known as the e-trading risk and controls team also escalated the incident to the electronic execution desk but not until 9:31am.“The immediate cause of the trading error was a manual input error by the trader,” the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulatory Authority said Wednesday in its findings. “The error was then not identified by either of the firm’s risk functions dedicated to real-time monitoring of the firm’s trades, but by the trader some 15 minutes after the trade was entered into the firm’s systems.”Citigroup’s systems had two lines of defense against these kinds of errant trades: Soft blocks and hard blocks.The bank sets a series of thresholds for each type of block. If a trade triggers one of these, a pop-up appears. Soft blocks can be overridden, but not hard blocks.Citigroup had increased some of these thresholds to account for the periods of heightened volatility during the pandemic. But two years on, it hadn’t reset those limits.Still, it was these hard blocks that stopped some of the trade from going through. But the UK regulators on Wednesday noted that in the US, Citigroup had rules in place since 2013 that would have stopped all of the trade from going through.“We are pleased to resolve this matter from more than two years ago, which arose from an individual error that was identified and corrected within minutes,” Citigroup said in a statement. “We immediately took steps to strengthen our systems and controls, and remain committed to ensuring full regulatory compliance.”The penalties come as a blow to Citigroup’s equities trading unit, led by Fater Belbachir. The division has spent years trying to climb the ranks of stock trading, but it remains far behind rivals like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. or JPMorgan Chase & Co.When regulators were formulating how big of a penalty to assess on Citigroup for the failures, they said that they considered that the trading desks within the bank’s Delta One division that used the order management system at the heart of the blunder had generated roughly $612 million in the nine years leading up to the errant trade, or an average of about $68 million a year.That would mean that between the fines and the trading losses from the day, the erroneous trade cost those desks nearly two years of revenue.","A Citigroup trader accidentally entered $444 billion into the quantity field instead of the notional value.

What is clear-air turbulence: The invisible danger in the skies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-is-clear-air-turbulence-the-invisible-danger-in-the-skies/articleshow/110323912.cms,"Turbulence continues to be a major cause of accidents and injuries despite a steady improvement in aviation accident rates.

What is flight turbulence

and why does it happen?

Flight turbulence is the irregular motion of air that can cause an aircraft to move unpredictably. It happens due to various factors, including storms, cold and warm fronts, jet streams, and the movement of air around mountains. Clear-air turbulence, caused by wind shear, is particularly dangerous as it occurs without visual warning.

How does turbulence impact flights and passenger safety?

Turbulence can cause the aircraft to suddenly drop or rise, potentially leading to injuries if passengers are not secured with seatbelts. Severe turbulence, like the kind encountered by the Singapore Airlines flight, can result in significant safety hazards, causing injuries and, in rare cases, fatalities.

Why is clear-air turbulence (CAT) considered the most dangerous?

CAT is especially dangerous because it is virtually undetectable with current technology, meaning it can strike without warning. This unpredictability makes it crucial for passengers to keep their seatbelts fastened at all times during a flight.

How do airlines manage and mitigate the risks of turbulence?

Airlines follow strict protocols to manage turbulence. Pilots use weather radar displays to avoid turbulent areas and turn on the seatbelt sign to instruct passengers and crew to stay seated. Flight attendants also suspend cabin service during severe turbulence and ensure passengers are securely fastened.

Is turbulence becoming more common due to climate change?

Yes, according to experts, climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of turbulence. Changes in temperature across the jet stream between cold poles and warm tropics are increasing wind shear, which in turn generates more turbulence.

Buckle up. That is the message from flight attendants and pilots following the severe turbulence encountered by a Singapore Airlines flight on Tuesday that resulted in the death of one and injured dozens of others. The London-to-Singapore flight hit heavy turbulence over the Indian Ocean, causing the plane to descend 6,000 feet in about three minutes before making an emergency landing in Bangkok.Experts suspect the turbulence involved was clear-air turbulence (CAT), which is virtually undetectable and considered the most dangerous type.Clear-air turbulence (CAT) occurs without warning, often at the boundaries of jet streams, over mountains, or during certain cloud storms. This incident highlights the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during flights, as CAT instances are on the rise due to climate change. Safety experts emphasize that keeping seatbelts fastened can significantly reduce the risk of injuries during sudden turbulence. Airlines have protocols to manage turbulence, but the unpredictability of CAT makes it crucial for passengers to remain vigilant and buckled up.Here is all you need to know about air turbulence and what to do in such cases:(With inputs from agencies)","Turbulence can cause the aircraft to suddenly drop or rise, potentially leading to injuries if passengers are not secured with seatbelts.
