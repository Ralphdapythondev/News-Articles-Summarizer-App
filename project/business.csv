Check penalties, consequences for late filing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2023-24-what-happens-if-i-file-income-tax-return-after-deadline-check-penalties-consequences-for-late-filing/articleshow/112105116.cms,"What is the penalty for belated ITR filing?

Who is required to pay the penalty?

Income Exceeds Basic Exemption Limit: Taxpayers whose income exceeds the basic exemption limit will be penalised for late filing. The limit varies by tax regime: Rs 3 lakh under the new tax regime, irrespective of age, and different limits under the old tax regime based on age.

Section 139(1) Conditions: Even if income is below the exemption limit, taxpayers must file an ITR if they meet specific conditions in Section 139(1). These include:

Spending Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel. Paying Rs 1 lakh or more in electricity bills. Depositing Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts.

Holding Foreign Assets: Residents with foreign assets or income must file an ITR, even if their income is below the exemption limit. Late filing fees apply in these cases.

Exceptions to Penalties

How is a belated ITR filed?

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24 : For individual taxpayers whose accounts do not need auditing, the last date to file income tax returns (ITRs) for FY 2023–24 (AY 2024–25) is July 31, 2024. Missing this deadline means filing a belated ITR , which comes with penalties and interest.Under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000.For small taxpayers with a taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh, the penalty is restricted to Rs 1,000, according to an ET report. The important thing to note is that this penalty applies even if the belated ITR shows zero tax payable. Additionally, penal interest on the pending tax payable must be paid when filing a belated ITR.Certain taxpayers are required to pay penalties if they miss the ITR filing deadline and they fulfil the following conditions:Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites Individuals might need to submit an income tax return to receive a refund.

This means the gross taxable income is considered before any eligible deductions are accounted for.The process for filing a belated ITR is the same as filing on time, with the key difference being the selection of Section 139(4) instead of 139(1) on the ITR form.","Filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000 under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Boost for security forces!

Boost for security forces on India-China border! The Border Roads Organisation ( BRO ), in collaboration with the Central Public Works Department ( CPWD ) and the National Projects Construction Corporation , has commenced the third phase of the strategic India, China Border Roads ( ICBR ) project.This initiative aims to enhance the road network in eastern Ladakh, facilitating faster movement of security forces along the Line of Actual Control.While some key roads under Phase II of ICBR are still under construction, most of the phase has been completed, providing all-weather roads for improved connectivity, according to an ET report.India and China share a 3,488 km border spanning across Ladakh, Arunachal, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim. Following the 2020 standoff with the Chinese army at Galwan in eastern Ladakh, the Union government has accelerated the pace of road construction and identified new roads under the third phase of ICBR.According to official data, India has achieved a formation cutting rate of 470 km roads per year from 2017-20, a significant increase from the 230 km per year maintained in the previous decade until 2017. Under ICBR phases I and II, 73 roads were identified as strategic, with 61 of them assigned to BRO. In eastern Ladakh, five new roads have been identified under phase 3, to be constructed by BRO and CPWD. In many cases, single or double-lane roads have been upgraded to four lanes.Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiated the first blast for the Shinku La tunnel, which is expected to provide all-weather connectivity from Manali to Leh. The 4.1-kilometre tunnel is anticipated to facilitate the movement of armed forces and equipment.The Union Budget 2024 recently allocated Rs 6,500 crore to BRO for 2024-25, a 30% increase compared to the allocation for 2023-24.

Min balance fines fetch PSBs Rs 8.5k crore in 5 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/min-balance-fines-fetch-psbs-rs-8-5k-crore-in-5-years/articleshow/112151710.cms,"MUMBAI: Public sector banks have collected Rs 8,495 crore over five years from depositors who did not have enough money in their savings accounts by way of fines for not maintaining minimum balance. This works out to an average of Rs 1,699 crore a year and is more than what govt has budgeted for incentivising account-to-account payments.Responding to a parliamentary query, state minister for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said RBI rules allowed banks to fix penal charges for non-maintenance of minimum balance, according to their board-approved policy, while ensuring that penal charges should be a fixed percentage levied on the difference between the actual balance and the minimum balance as agreed.He added that the charges were not applied on basic savings bank deposit accounts (Jan Dhan accounts).The data shared by the finance ministry shows that the amount collected as penalty for failing to meet minimum balance has progressively risen from Rs 1,738 crore in FY20 to Rs 2,331 crore in FY24 (see graphic). This is despite SBI, the largest bank, discontinuing minimum balance charges after FY20. SBI had stopped charging a penalty for minimum balances after an RTI query showed that a major chunk of the bank's (at that time depressed) profits came from this penalty.With SBI dropping out of minimum charges, the highest collection of fines was made by Punjab National Bank, which collected Rs 1,538 crore in the last five years. Indian Bank, Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank collected Rs 1,466 crore, Rs 1,251 crore and Rs 1,158 crore, respectively.In the Budget, govt has set aside Rs 1,441 crore to incentivise banks to continue providing account-to-account transfers using UPI payments and RuPay debit cards free of charge. In the previous Budget, govt had set aside Rs 2,485 crore as incentive for digital payments.For banks, the other incentive in providing digital payments is that money remains in the banking system for longer and reduces cash burden. Historically, Indian banks have not charged for providing services. The difference between the interest paid on deposits and loans was used to cover the expenses. However, following liberalisation, private banks imposed fixed charges for not maintaining minimum balance. This practice was adopted by most banks after computerisation.","Public sector banks have collected Rs 8,495 crore over five years from depositors who did not have enough money in their savings accounts.

Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal rules out change in FDI policy for China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/goyal-rules-out-change-in-fdi-policy-for-china/articleshow/112151689.cms,"NEW DELHI: Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday ruled out an immediate rethink of India's stance on Chinese investment, while slamming UPA 's economic policies , which had made the country dependent on imports and investments from the neighbouring country.Amid demands from industry for a review of the visa regime for Chinese professionals, the Economic Survey, released a day before the budget, stirred a debate by suggesting that govt could have a more liberal foreign direct investment dispensation for Chinese companies as it would help lower the trade deficit , apart from helping India integrate with the global value chain.""As far as the chief economic advisor is concerned, they bring an independent, autonomous report. It is their thought, the govt of India at present has not changed its stand,"" Goyal said in Lok Sabha. In 2020, the govt made it mandatory for FDI from countries that shared a land border to seek mandatory approval, a move that was targeted at China, although Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, and Afghanistan are also India's neighbours. ""The investment that comes from China is checked, wherever we do not feel it is appropriate, it is stopped,"" the minister said.Dismissing allegations by Congress' Gaurav Gogoi of India becoming more dependent on China, he blamed UPA's policies. ""Under Congress, imports increased from $4 billion to $40-45 billion, which is more than 10 times. In our term, the increase is only 2-2.5 times. We took steps to make India self-reliant... We do not know what that MoU with China was; trade deficit went up by 30 times under the UPA,"" he said.China is India's largest trade partner, with volumes of exports and imports pegged at over $118 billion last year. Trade deficit with China too is the highest at $85 billion.Addressing a post-budget meeting organised by CII, he said govt had taken a bold decision by refusing to sign RCEP trade deal, for which negotiations had been started by UPA. ""We would have been a nation of salesmen hawking Chinese goods,"" he said.He said Modi govt seeks to protect national interest in trade deals and cited investment commitments in EFTA treaty and tax benefits for Indian IT companies under the pact with Australia. ""I want you to move faster on FTAs and quality control orders,"" he said as he sought industry support, while announcing the intent to sign more trade deals.Goyal asked industry for a list of processes and policies that were hobbling it, promising to change the rules at the Centre while pushing for changes in BJP-ruled states. Earlier, addressing a press conference on Tuesday morning, Goyal accused UPA of turning India into a ""Fragile Five"" economy and said there had been steady growth and development during the Modi govt's 10 years and was among top five economies now."," Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal ruled out an immediate rethink of India's stance on Chinese investment.

Banks to follow home loan growth story for MSMEs

Banks were tasked to use the digital footprint of small businesses for loan decisions, including salary payments, electricity bills, and GST details, to enhance lending in this sector. The move, part of the government's plan to boost financing for small businesses, mirrors methods used in home loans, aiming to provide a new credit rating mechanism.

MUMBAI: RBI has asked banks to consider the borrower’s intent before classifying them as wilful defaulters. Additionally, banks must have an identifying committee, which includes a whole-time director, to classify a borrower as a defaulter.RBI on Tuesday announced its new master direction for the treatment of wilful defaulters. The new circular follows observations by various courts that banks must provide reasoned orders before labelling a loan defaulter with the wilful tag.“The identification of the wilful default should be made keeping in view the track record of the borrowers and should not be decided on the basis of isolated transactions/ incidents,” RBI said in its circular. “The default to be categorised as wilful must be intentional, deliberate, calculated and meeting the conditions set out,” the circular added.The 2015 circular outlined different situations that could lead to a loan being categorised as a wilful default, including cases where the borrower used the money for purposes other than what it was originally intended for. This caused confusion at times, especially when a loan was provided for a specific project but some of the funds were used for related investments that were not part of the main project.In terms of the guidelines, to identify and classify a borrower as a wilful defaulter , the process begins with an identification committee examining the evidence of wilful default. If satisfied, the committee issues a show cause notice to the relevant parties, calling for their submissions."," Bombay High Court dismissed pleas for default bail by five accused in Elgar Parishad case from June 2018.

India could be our biggest market in 5-10 years; India-UK FTA will allow price reduction: Glenmorangies Caspar MacRae

India could become Glenmorangie's largest market within a decade, driven by a booming whiskey market growing at 40% annually. The India-UK free trade agreement could lower tariffs, making premium brands more affordable. Indian single malts are thriving, and lower tariffs may encourage investment in high-end whiskeys, positioning India as a top market for premium spirits.

State taxes on minerals may hike power tariff, skew market reforms

The Supreme Court's decision allowing states to tax minerals could raise power tariffs, increasing costs for coal producers who will pass these onto energy generation firms. This could lead to higher electricity prices for consumers. If applied retrospectively, the new taxes might seriously affect coal companies' competitiveness amid already high taxes and levies.

NEW DELHI: India could within a decade become the biggest market for Scotland’s Glenmorangie, the world’s fourth biggest single malt maker. While Indian single malts are doing exceedingly well, the impending India-UK free trade agreement (FTA) is expected to bring down tariffs making premium brands more affordable, Caspar MacRae, The Glenmorangie Company president & CEO told TOI.“We are about 6.5 lakh cases a year brand. Our top three markets are the US, UK and India. Single malt market in India is growing at 40% annually and we are growing in strong double digits. With a middle class of 90 crore people, India could be our top market by volume in the next 5-10 years. It’s a realistic expectation as India has an appetite for really high quality spirits,” MacRae said.“Our interest and passion of working with the Indian team and for the Indian consumer isn’t dependent on FTA. At present, there’s a 150% tariff on Scotch whiskey coming into India. So automatically, the price of every bottle coming here more than doubles before it can go into the distribution channels. If that FTA is in place, it’ll mean that all aspects of the consumer experience can be improved (and) there is opportunity to reduce price as well. Having better choice and more accessible price points would benefit consumers and allow us to compete on a more level footing in the market,” he said.Indian single malts have been doing exceedingly well. Does he feel threatened by their emergence? “Overall, it’s really good we are seeing single malt categories around the world. Rampur, Indri, Amrut are building a vibrant and viable Indian single malt scene. What we are seeing here now happened 30 years ago in Japan, Australia and emerging in America,” MacRae said, adding “the strengths of the more the merrier approach outweigh the disadvantages of increased competition.”Lower tariffs will also enable Indians to treat high end whiskeys and wine as an investment class. “It’s hard for us to invest with (high) tariff levels. Lower tariffs will enable us to do that and also give us an opportunity for us to offer more. Whiskey is the most collectible and valuable spirits category in the world.”","India could become Glenmorangie's largest market within a decade, driven by a booming whiskey market growing at 40% annually.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement.

Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

This section permits you to contribute up to 10% of your basic pay to NPS tax-free. Previously, only government employees were eligible for the 14% deduction, but now this benefit has been extended to the private sector as well.“It is proposed to increase the amount of deduction allowed to an employer in respect of his contribution to a pension scheme referred to in section 80CCD, from the extent of 10% to the extent of 14% of the salary of the employee.

Budget 2024 : India's Economic Survey for 2024 revealed the country's infrastructure leap. FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20 with concerted efforts to boost physical connectivity, electricity, water and sanitation, urban development, strategic and digital infrastructure. It also marked emphasis on resource mobilisation from new sources and data aggregation and management for tracking projects and optimal allocation of scarce resources.While capital allocation for major infrastructure sub-sectors like roads, railways, etc. continues as already announced by the government during the interim Budget, the current final Budget heralds a transformative vision for the eastern states with the ‘Purvodaya’ plan, targeting holistic growth with announcements of new roads, power plant, airports, colleges and sports infrastructure.For the shipping sector, the government has announced ownership, leasing and flagging reforms which should improve the share of the Indian shipping industry and generate more employment.Capital projects in the sector uplifts the society at large and generates employment. Brownfield redevelopment of cities and houses for the poor will fuel demand in the sector thereby generating employment and economic growth. Additionally, the government has announced an employment incentive scheme for first time employers to further fillip jobs creation and youth empowerment.From a tax standpoint, the government recognised the potential of cruise tourism in India and in order to give a fillip to this employment generating industry, a simplified tax regime where 20 percent of revenues will be deemed as income from such business will be considered for the purpose of income-tax.India has recognised the need to have a robust MRO ecosystem for the airline and boat & ship sector in view of increased demand. From Customs perspective, the period for export of goods which are imported for repairs and requirement to re-import goods which are exported for repairs under warranty has been extended.The government recognises the need for participation from the private sector in this critical sector including investments from foreign investors. Deletion of angel tax provision is a welcome move which will propel raising of funds in the sector.Second round of VSV gives opportunity to minimise litigation with focus on ease of doing business.On an overall basis, this year’s Budget lays down a framework to propel growth and generate employment with higher involvement of the private sector in upskilling India and some relaxation for individual taxpayers."," FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20.

Finance ministry plugs under-reporting of income by overseas taxpayers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/finance-ministry-plugs-under-reporting-of-income-by-overseas-taxpayers/articleshow/111997579.cms,"MUMBAI: The finance ministry was quick to notice that some taxpayers were not including taxes withheld outside India for the purpose of calculating their total income. This, in turn, led to under reporting of income. These individuals offered the overseas income net of tax and at the same time claimed a foreign tax credit (FTC) for taxes withheld overseas against their India tax liability.In short - they got a double advantage.The Budget proposes to amend section 198 of the I-T Act to include income taxes paid outside India for the purpose of computing the income of the taxpayer who is liable to tax in India. This proposal will be effective financial year 2024-25.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said, ""The amendment is more clarificatory in nature. This was always the correct position. As explained in the explanatory memorandum. It appears that some taxpayers (including companies) were not doing so and hence this amendment was introduced making it abundantly clear.""She gives an illustration. An Indian employee of an Indian subsidiary of a German company was granted shares under the global Esop plan. He was eligible to receive dividend of 100 euros on such shares. According to German law, 10 euros was withheld and the balance was transferred to the employee's Indian bank account.""The correct tax position was always to offer the entire 100 euros as income and claim 10 euros as a double tax relief (credit against Indian tax liability on such 100 euros),"" KPMG India's Sirwalla added.Ameya Kunte, founder, Globeview Advisors, points out a few decisions where overseas tax was not held part of the total income assessable to tax in India - these now stand overturned.""The MP high court in the case of Yawar Rashid had held that the tax deducted at source outside India from foreign dividends and interest income was not part of the total income and thus not assessable in the hands of the taxpayer. This HC decision was also relied upon by the Bangalore bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in the case of Sunil Shinde. The proposed amendment makes it clear tax deducted at source outside India, will be part of income. The taxpayer can claim a foreign tax credit against the Indian taxes due on the overseas income.""",The Budget proposes to amend section 198 of the I-T Act to include income taxes paid outside India for the purpose of computing the income of the taxpayer who is liable to tax in India.

The opposition offensive against the Budget seeks to paint the governing party as beholden to its demanding allies TDP and JDU from Andhra and Bihar at the cost of others. The tactic clearly seeks to put BJP on the defensive on major turfs where it will be fighting elections soon - Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, or in states where BJP is seeking expansion of its political footprint, like TN, Kerala, Telangana.Rahul Gandhi Wednesday briefed 20 party MPs chosen to participate in the LS discussion. Sources said Rahul specifically told the members to focus on what their respective states have not got in the Budget, rather than speaking about what others have got. The party decided to accommodate maximum states through MPs in its allocated four hours discussion time. The choice of Haryana veteran Kumari Selja as the lead speaker and then Praniti Shinde of Maharashtra was to showcase the election states. Also, the focus of opposition's criticism is on unemployment, farmers, price rise - issues which are politically sensitive, as also how govt has ""picked"" various announcements from Congress election manifesto.The aggression against ""discrimination"" is going to be incessant during the ongoing Parliament session.

Budget 2024: Big Relief To Indian Taxpayers | Changes In New Regime Slabs | Nirmala Sitharaman

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure, despite the indexation benefit being withdrawn for property, and asserted that govt decided on the new structure after undertaking an elaborate exercise.“This perception that you will be at a disadvantage is not realistic, it’s absolutely not correct… In almost every case people have a lower tax burden under this system.The small or the medium people who are going into the market or property investments are going to benefit from it,” she told TOI in an interview.On Tuesday, she had announced a reduction in long term capital gains tax on property and gold from 20% to 12.5%, while withdrawing the benefit to adjust it for inflation. This came with the provision that indexation benefit will be available for properties bought up to 2001.The FM said the amendments have been proposed with the intent to simplify the tax regime and bring all asset classes at par.Sitharaman said the Union Budget presented on Tuesday was a continuation of the interim budget and insisted that the measures announced for Andhra Pradesh were part of the commitments given at the time of bifurcation of the state . “In Bihar’s case can anyone deny the devastation that happens because of Kosi flooding?” she said.She also said that the skilling plan through internship was voluntary for companies and she had received suggestions for such a scheme from various industry bodies. “We're not forcing anybody, we've had a lot of discussion with CII and Ficci and they thought it is possible to do it. It will actually help because they will have industry-ready people, who can be employed.”She hit out at the Opposition, saying, “This brazen method of building a false narrative, repeating it and restating it with the hope that it will stick has been tried in the Lok Sabha elections. They are trying it even now.”Along with the calculations released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes under different scenarios, tax authorities said, “Nominal real estate returns are generally in the region of 12-16% per annum, much higher than inflation. The indexation for inflation in in the region of 4-5%, depending on the period of holding. Therefore, substantial tax savings are expected for a vast majority of taxpayers.”The statement further said that the new regime is beneficial for five-year old properties under the new regime which have seen an appreciation of 1.7 times or more. Similarly, for 10 years, if the value rises 2.4 times the new mechanism is seen to be beneficial. Ditto for property purchased in 2009-10 with appreciation of 4.9 times or more, the tax department said.“It's only where returns are low (less than about 9-11% per annum) that the earlier tax rate is beneficial, but such low returns in real estate are unrealistic and rare (less than 10% of cases),” it said.Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra told TOI that benefits of reinvesting the capital gains in a new property and parking the funds in tax-exempt 54EC bonds issued by REC are intact.Asked about the revenue impact, he said that the Centre may end up losing revenue as most taxpayers are likely to gain from the decision.“Simplification of any tax structure has benefits of ease of compliance, including computation filing, maintenance of records. This also removes the differential rates for various asset classes,” CBDT said.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure.

Sebi eyes 6x contract value hike to curb F&O speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-eyes-6x-contract-value-hike-to-curb-fo-speculation/articleshow/112151630.cms,"MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday proposed at least seven important measures - including a six-fold hike in minimum value of contracts to Rs 30 lakh - aimed at curbing speculative trading in index derivatives trading . For about a year now, govt functionaries and the market regulator have been warning about excessive speculation in the futures & options (F&O) segment of the market that could hurt even the economy.Within hours after Sebi chief said that a consultation paper was on its way to address the growing concerns about excessive rise in F&O volumes, Sebi released the paper on Tuesday. This is the first definitive move by Sebi to curb the excesses in the space.In the consultation paper Sebi proposed that it intends to increase the minimum size of index options contracts to Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh in the first phase. This could, after six months, go up to Rs 30 lakh, from Rs 5 lakh now. This is aimed at curbing traders who come to the F&O space with a very small amount of funds.It also proposed that an exchange would be allowed to launch options contracts which expire every week on only one index. At present an exchange can launch weekly options on multiple indices, expiring on various trading days of the week.Sebi is also proposing to limit the total number of contracts that all the clients of a large broker can take on the day of expiry of F&O contracts. In India, usually monthly contracts expire on the last Thursday of the month while weekly contracts expire on a pre-specified day of the week.The consultation paper also proposed that brokers should collect options premium from their clients on an upfront basis. Currently brokers often allow their clients to leverage their trades using their (brokers') own money on an intra-day basis. Sebi is proposing to curb this practice.The regulator is also proposing to limit the number of strike prices on the expiry day. Sebi data showed that on expiry day several trades take place at prices at which the buyers mostly lose money while most sellers make money. Such prices are called out of the money strike prices. This trend indicates extreme forms of speculation and hence the Sebi proposal to limit the number of strike prices, market players said.Last week the Budget proposed to sharply hike securities transaction tax (STT) on derivatives trading. In the run up to the Budget, over the last few months, the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and chief economic advisor to the country V Anantha Nageswaran, on different occasions had warned about the excesses observed in the F&O trading space."," markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday proposed at least seven important measures aimed at curbing speculative trading in index derivatives trading.

""This has been one of the key reasons that scuttled the plan,"" a source said. ""For Apple, any deal of the Tata group, its key manufacturing ally, with Vivo would have meant a partnership with a competitor. This perhaps led to the talks breaking down between Tatas and Vivo,"" the source said, adding that a ""re-think looks highly unlikely 'as of now'.""A questionnaire sent to Apple and Vivo didn't elicit any response. A spokesperson for the Tata group said, ""We are denying this development.""Chinese companies have been looking at inducting local partners in their operations here by selling controlling stakes, a decision that helps them get easier access to funding, which has increasingly become difficult after the govt's heightened scrutiny on investments emanating from countries that share land border with India. Also, having a credible local partner in their business helps them emerge as trusted partners in the govt's Make in India initiative, which many feel insulates them from regulatory actions and helps them get easier access to visas.China's SAIC group, the owner of MG Motor, recently decided to sell majority control to Sajjan Jindal's JSW group, while Sunil Vachani-led Dixon Electronics also struck a deal to buy 56% stake in Ismartu India (a subsidiary of Chinese Transsion Technology, which has brands, such as iTel, Infinix, and Tecno).The Tata group has been expanding aggressively in the electronics space. Its takeover of Apple's manufacturing partner Taiwanese Wistron's factories was a big win for the company as it was able to break into US electronics giant's key supplier ecosystem.With the Apple contract, Tata group not only got a chance to make iPhones meant for sale in India, but also got an opportunity to make for global markets. It gained scale with one of the world's most lucrative smartphone seller. The partnership also gave it credibility in ecosystem of global electronics manufacturers, dominated by likes of Taiwanese Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron.",Tata group's bid to acquire a majority stake in Chinese smartphone giant Vivo's India business may have stalled after objections by Apple.

McDonald's sales decline for first time in more than three years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mcdonalds-sales-decline-for-first-time-in-more-than-three-years/articleshow/112124967.cms,"McDonald's global sales declined by 1% in the second quarter against a 0.5% rise, the first time in 13 quarters primarily due to consumers seeking more affordable options due to persistent inflation , particularly among lower-income households. Its overall revenue rose 1%.This has forced fast food giants McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Taco Bell to come up with value meals to increase customer traffic.However, despite the setback, McDonald's shares rose nearly 4% following the announcement of the successful $5 meal deal launched in June, which the company plans to extend beyond August in collaboration with its franchisees.The fast food chain said that remains committed to its 2024 forecast of an operating margin in the mid-to-high 40% range and plans to be more selective with price increases to maintain profitability.""Even though things (traffic) are soft now, they should be getting better in the back half of the year ... with better value on the menu,"" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.CEO Chris Kempczinski said that consumers have become more deal-oriented and discriminating, with consumer sentiment remaining low in most major markets.""The biggest hit for McDonald's is the low-income consumer has really cut back on visits and that is more than offsetting the typical trade down McD normally sees in tougher economic times,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.US comparable sales fell 0.7% in the quarter ended June 30 against the 10.3% increase a year ago. International markets, which account for nearly half of McDonald's 2023 revenue, witnessed a 1.1% decline, primarily due to weakness in France. The company's business segment, where restaurants are operated by local partners, saw a 1.3% decrease in sales compared to a 14% jump a year earlier, attributed to a slower-than-expected recovery in China and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.Despite the challenges, McDonald's is maintaining its capital expenditure budget of up to $2.7 billion, with more than half allocated to new restaurant openings in the US and international markets.

A new meme coin has taken the centre stage. The Meme Games ($MGMES), touted as the Olympics meme coin, has ignited the latest crypto frenzy. The $MGMES token presale saw over $250K flow in on the opening few days.What’s driving this meme coin sensation, and how high can it pump? Here is an analysis.The 2024 Summer Olympics is about to begin in Paris later this month.But the Olympics fever has hit the crypto market a little early. The Meme Games will see five iconic meme coins – Dogecoin, Pepe, Dogwifhat, Brett, and Turbo – race for the finish line. Investors can pick a meme coin of their choice and earn rewards if their meme athlete grabs gold.To spark engagement, each meme coin represents a country. They bring with them amusing stories of passion and rivalry.With top meme coins competing for victory, hilarious posts are flooding in on social media. Meme coin communities are loudly rooting for their favourites. The decibel will scale up over the next few days.However, community fervour has nothing to do with The Meme Games outcomes. Blockchain determines the race winner purely at random in each game. Investors multiply their presale purchase with a twenty five percent bonus if they pick the right guy.Since the beginning, meme coins have dived deep into popular culture.Keeping up with the latest trends, they spur conversations and share the spotlight. Over the years, meme coins have proven to be one of the biggest online forces.For example, the Dogecoin community sponsored the Jamaican bobsled team to attend the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014.Dogecoin was still in its early days. But that didn’t stop the community from coming together for a bigger cause. It gave a glimpse of the massive strength of meme coin communities.The Meme Games is the latest example of the trend.The grand welcome of the Meme Games presale reveals its viral potential. The rapidly growing community makes it further evident, exploding to over 13.5K followers on X. It was launched only a few days back.$MGMES is not just a favourite among degens. Top crypto analysts and influencers are optimistic about the coin. 99Bitcoins is one of the first to come forward with a promising outlook.The popular crypto education platform introduces $MGMES as the next potential 100X meme coin to its 705,000 followers. According to 99Bitcoins, the Meme Games is comparable to Pepe and Brett.The presale has a defined timeline. It ends on 8 September, with the conclusion of the Paralympics. The Meme Games brilliantly unlocks the Olympics craze for daring meme coin investors. So it wouldn’t be surprising to see it go on a wild bull run on its initial exchange listings.The DEX listings begin on September 10.Prior to that, investors can grab the token for heavily discounted presale prices, beginning at $0.009. With each new stage of the presale, the price undergoes a small hike.To grab the token for the best prices, investors should act early. Early presale participation is rewarded with higher staking APYs. For a better perspective, the opening staking APY was above 4000%. It is slipping under 3000% as the presale traffic grows.The Meme Games white paper takes a more detailed look at the staking mechanism and how it works.Here is an overview of how the Meme Games works.To enter the Meme Games, investors should hold $MGMES tokens. They are the tickets to glory.Judging by the presale momentum and the exploding community, $MGMES is on the path to a billion-dollar market cap. If investors wait until then to buy the token, it will be weighed down by a hefty price tag.That explains the presale rush. The short presale window gives heavy discounts to early backers.Investors can enter the presale using an Ethereum-compatible wallet like Metamask, Best Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet. In addition to ETH, USDT, and BNB, the presale supports purchases using fiat currencies.Once the presale purchase is done, investors can pick their favourite meme character to compete in a “169-metre dash.”This is the golden opportunity to multiply the presale investment with a twenty five percent bonus. Doge, Pepe, Brett, Turbo, and Dogwifhat represent different countries.They have their unique traits and strengths, but an equal chance of winning. That is one out of five, or twenty percent.Being powered by blockchain, the winner selection is fair and purely random. External factors can’t influence the results. The $MGMES smart contract has completed an extensive audit by SolidProof.The presale has no minimum purchase limits.No matter how low the budget is, investors can join the riveting Meme Games through the presale. Each presale purchase gives them a chance to pick a meme athlete and win a twenty five percent token multiplier.Taking advantage of the unlimited entries, investors can join the presale as often as possible. It maximises the chances of winning.Staking offers a thrilling opportunity to put the tokens to work right from the beginning. It is active from the presale stage. Whether investors get lucky and unlock the token multiplier or not, staking will continue to accumulate rewards.Staked tokens have a brief seven-day lock-up window. The mechanism prevents early sell-offs to strengthen the price trajectory. Toward the end of the lock-up window, the tokens can potentially go multifold up the charts.With the meme coin market rebounding, $MGMES tokens are predicted to explode on their release. Potential interest rate cuts in September will encourage more investors to dive into the market for quick gains.The $MGMES staking APYs are dynamically structured to favour early investors. They are eligible for lower presale prices as well.","The Meme Games ($MGMES), touted as the Olympics meme coin, has ignited the latest crypto frenzy.

International Business Machines Corp reported a jump in bookings for its artificial intelligence business as customers work to implement the latest technology.

Ford Motor Co posted second-quarter profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates, saying quality problems with new vehicles led to a surge in warranty costs.

Bank of America Corp said its board authorized another $25 billion stock repurchase program.

Whirlpool Corp, the owner of Maytag, lowered its full-year earnings forecast, as consumers continued to shy away from big-ticket appliance purchases amid a weakening housing market.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc’s limited-time offers and speedy service helped it beat expectations in the second quarter, but executives warned the burrito chain will face pressures to profitability.

ServiceNow Inc. reported better-than-expected sales and bookings in the second quarter, signaling strong customer demand for its broad suite of software tools.

Wall Street got a reality check after a disappointing start of the megacap earnings season fueled concern the artificial-intelligence frenzy that has powered the bull market might be overblown.A selloff in big tech sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since December 2022, ending the best stretch without a 2% drop since the start of the global financial crisis.Losses were more pronounced in the Nasdaq 100, which tumbled over 3.5%. Alphabet Inc. slid 5% after sinking more resources into its drive to outmatch rivals in AI, with spending higher than analysts expected. Tesla Inc.’s profit miss and the Robotaxi delay spurred a 12% stock plunge.“Investors are finally waking up to all that AI spend and realizing it is much more of an expense right now rather than a revenue generator,” said Peter Boockvar at The Boock Report.Wednesday’s session was another lesson in the “concentration risk” bears see as latent in a market whose upside has owed disproportionately to a narrow cohort of massive gainers. For a fourth straight session — and the 10th time in 11 days — the performance of smaller companies exceeded larger ones, evidence investor tastes have shifted from the megacap tech names that have come to dominate benchmark indexes.The Treasury curve steepened on bets the Federal Reserve is close to cutting rates. Former New York Fed President William Dudley called for lower borrowing costs — preferably at next week’s gathering. For many analysts, such a move would be worrisome as it would indicate officials rushing to avoid a recession.The loonie fell as the Bank of Canada cut rates, focused on “downside risks.” The yen hit the highest since May amid an unwind in carry trades.To Steve Clayton at Hargreaves Lansdown, this could be the year markets start talking about the “So-So Seven,” noting that results from Tesla and Alphabet are not enough to maintain their momentum.“The market is not impressed with the start of earnings season for the mega tech stocks,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. “There was a lot resting on these results and we don’t think that they give clear answers to questions about the effectiveness and profit potential for AI right now.”After driving the rally in stocks for most of 2024, big tech slammed into a wall. Traders rotated from megacaps to lagging parts of the market, spurred by bets on Fed rate cuts and concern AI still needs to pay off.“Tech’s problem isn’t just that earnings are less than perfect, but the group is still caught up in the violent rotation trade that kicked off with the June CPI,” said Vital Knowledge’s Adam Crisafulli. “Many assumed the anti-tech rotation would be ephemeral and the fact it’s proving durable is compounding anxiety toward the group and spurring additional selling pressure.”The drubbing in these stocks has seen some of the air come out of valuations. While that’s something that could argue in favor of dip buying, the earnings season is just getting started. Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Meta Platforms Inc are all due toTo Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers, the equity correction is far from over. “Yesterday we wrote that a 10% to 15% correction was in the cards this quarter, historically the worst period of the year,” Torres said. “This quarter, the valuation concerns are paired with front-loaded gains, irrational exuberance, a high bar for earnings estimates and a presidential election.”In fact, the second-quarter US earnings season is off to a weaker start than usual.Among S&P 500 companies that reported results, profits beat analyst estimates by the smallest margin since the end of 2022 — while sales surprises were the worst in at least two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“We are still looking for volatility to increase moving through the second half of 2024 - with the potential for a 10% to 15% correction in benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100,” said Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “Our work does not point to secular/structural downturn at this time, but rather a pause in the reflationary expansion cycle that began a few years ago.”Just as earnings roll in, a key technical indicator in the US stock market sat close to historic extremes — a crucial gauge that has foretold past selloffs.Known as the “the 200-DMA” — an abbreviation of 200-day moving average — the gauge measures how the S&P 500 is performing against that longer-term measure. At one point last week, the benchmark was trading as much as 15% above it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.While the gap has since narrowed — to 9% through Wednesday’s close — that kind of gulf above 12% still preceded declines for the index in 2011, 2018 and 2021. Although that does not necessarily mean the market is about to tank, it is a warning sign for investors concerned about lofty tech valuations and concentration risk.","A selloff in big tech sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since December 2022.
