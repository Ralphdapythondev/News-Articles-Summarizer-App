"Unified Pension Scheme vs OPS vs NPS: How is UPS different from National Pension Scheme, Old Pension Scheme?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/unified-pension-scheme-vs-ops-vs-nps-how-is-ups-different-from-national-pension-scheme-old-pension-scheme/articleshow/112796028.cms,"UPS vs OPS vs NPS

:

Unified Pension Scheme (UPS): Top Features

Under the UPS, employees with a minimum qualifying service of 25 years will receive an assured pension of 50% of the average basic pay drawn over the last 12 months prior to superannuation.

For service periods between 10 and 25 years, the pension will be proportional.

In the event of an employee's demise, their family will receive an assured pension of 60% of the employee's pension immediately before their demise.

The scheme also includes an assured minimum pension of Rs 10,000 per month upon superannuation after a minimum of 10 years of service.

The UPS will apply inflation indexation to the assured pension, assured family pension, and assured minimum pension.

Dearness Relief will be based on the All India Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (AICPI-IW), similar to service employees.

Additionally, employees will receive a lump sum payment at superannuation, calculated as 1/10th of monthly emoluments (pay + DA) for every completed six months of service. This lump sum payment is separate from gratuity and does not impact the assured pension amount.

Employees choosing the UPS will not incur any extra financial burden. Their contribution will stay at 10 percent, while the government's contribution will rise from 14 percent to 18.5 percent.

National Pension Scheme (NPS): Top Features

Under NPS, central government employees contribute 10% of their basic salary, while the government contributes 14%, according to an ET report.

The pension amount in NPS is not fixed as it is linked to market movements, whereas UPS provides an assured pension of 50% of the salary for those who joined the service after January 1, 2004.

Family pension under NPS depends on the accumulated corpus in the pension fund and the chosen annuity plan at retirement.

NPS has been implemented for all government employees, except those in the armed forces, who joined the central government on or after January 1, 2004. It is also available for private-sector employees. Most state/Union Territory governments have also notified NPS for their new employees.

Old Pension Scheme (OPS): Top Features

The Old Pension Scheme (OPS) provided retired government employees with a monthly pension equal to 50 percent of their last drawn salary. This amount was subject to increase in line with the hike in the Dearness Allowance (DA) rates. Upon retirement, employees were also entitled to receive a gratuity payment, with a maximum limit of Rs 20 lakh.

Under the OPS, if a retired employee passed away, their family would continue to receive pension benefits. Another notable aspect of the OPS was that no deductions were made from an employee's salary towards pension contributions, which is in contrast to the NPS.

The Modi government has introduced a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for central government employees who joined the service after January 1, 2004. This scheme, which will be implemented from April 1, 2025, guarantees a pension equal to 50% of the basic salary. The decision to introduce UPS comes in response to several non-BJP states reverting to the DA-linked Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and employee organizations in other states demanding the same.Employees have the option to choose between UPS and NPS.So how does UPS compare to NPS? And how does it compare to the OPS? We take a look:NPS and the newly proposed UPS differ in terms of government contributions, pension amounts, and family pension provisions.Recently, several states in India, including Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Punjab, have made the decision to revert to the Old Pension Scheme, moving away from the NPS.","The Modi government has introduced a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme.

SEBI bans Anil Ambani & 24 other entities from securities market for 5 years; imposes Rs 25 crore penalty on Ambani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-bans-anil-ambani-24-other-entities-from-securities-market-for-5-years-imposes-rs-25-crore-penalty-on-ambani/articleshow/112730559.cms,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) has taken action against Anil Ambani and 24 other entities, including former key officials of Reliance Home Finance ( RHFL ), for their involvement in the diversion of funds from the company. Ambani has been barred from the securities market for five years and fined Rs 25 crore, according to a PTI report.Additionally, he is prohibited from holding any position as a director or Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) in any listed company or intermediary registered with Sebi during this period, the report said.RHFL has also been barred from the securities market for six months and fined Rs 6 lakh. Sebi's extensive investigation revealed that Anil Ambani, aided by RHFL's key managerial personnel, had devised a fraudulent scheme to siphon off funds from the company by disguising them as loans to entities associated with him.According to the PTI report quoting Sebi’s order, despite clear directives from the Board of Directors to cease such lending practices and regular reviews of corporate loans, the company's management disregarded these orders, indicating a significant failure of governance influenced by certain key managerial personnel under Ambani's influence.Sebi noted that given the circumstances, RHFL itself should not be held equally responsible as the individuals involved in the fraud. The remaining entities were found to have played the role of either recipients of illegally obtained loans or conduits to facilitate the illegal diversion of funds from RHFL.In its final order, Sebi stated, ""existence of a fraudulent scheme, orchestrated by Noticee No. 2 (Anil Ambani) and administered by the KMPs of RHFL, to siphon off funds from the public listed company (RHFL) by structuring them as 'loans' to credit unworthy conduit borrowers, and in turn, to onward borrowers, all of whom have been found to be 'promoter linked entities' i.e. entities associated/ linked with Noticee 2 (Anil Ambani)"".Anil Ambani, in his capacity as ""chairperson of the ADA group"" and through his substantial indirect shareholding in RHFL's holding company, orchestrated a fraudulent scheme, the Sebi order said.Sebi's order highlighted the company management and promoter's reckless approach in sanctioning substantial loans to entities with minimal assets, cash flow, net worth, or revenue.The suspicious nature of these ""loans"" is further amplified by the fact that many of the borrowers had close ties to RHFL's promoters. Ultimately, most of these borrowers defaulted on their loan repayments, causing RHFL to fail in meeting its own debt obligations. This led to the company's resolution under the RBI Framework, leaving public shareholders in a precarious situation.RHFL's share price plunged from around Rs 59.60 in March 2018 to a mere Rs 0.75 by March 2020, as the magnitude of the fraud became apparent and the company's resources were depleted. Currently, over 9 lakh shareholders remain invested in RHFL, facing substantial losses.Sebi has restrained 24 entities, including former key officials of RHFL – Amit Bapna, Ravindra Sudhalkar, and Pinkesh R Shah – and imposed fines on them for their involvement in the case. Ambani, Bapna, Sudhalkar, and Shah have been fined Rs 25 crore, Rs 27 crore, Rs 26 crore, and Rs 21 crore, respectively.Furthermore, the remaining entities, including Reliance Unicorn Enterprises, Reliance Exchange next Lt, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd, Reliance Cleangen Ltd, Reliance Business Broadcast News Holdings Ltd, and Reliance Big Entertainment Private Ltd, have each been fined Rs 25 crore for either receiving the illegally obtained loans or facilitating the illegal diversion of funds from RHFL.In February 2022, Sebi had issued an interim order restraining Reliance Home Finance Ltd, Anil Ambani, and three other individuals (Amit Bapna, Ravindra Sudhakar, and Pinkesh R Shah) from the securities market until further notice for allegedly siphoning off funds from the company.(With inputs from PTI)","Anil Ambani has been barred from the securities market for five years and fined Rs 25 crore.

The current Banking Regulation Act permits single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit, items left in the custody of a bank, or a locker hired from a bank.In the event of the nominator's death, the nominee can access the deposit, articles, or locker.According to an ET report, the new Bill suggests allowing up to four nominees for these purposes.

Check List Nomination is a crucial aspect of opening lockers and savings accounts in India. The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) says, ""Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules 1985 permits banks to pay dues to nominees in the event of death of depositor(s) without asking for succession certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. This simplifies settlement. Of course, as Trustee the nominee is accountable to legal heirs.The IBA further clarifies that the nomination facility is available for bank deposits, safe deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. A single deposit account, whether held individually or jointly, can have only one nominee. However, a jointly held locker can have two nominees. In the case of a minor's account, a person legally empowered to operate the account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.The State Bank of India emphasizes the importance of availing the benefits of nomination facility and survivorship clause for locker-hirers. In the unfortunate event of the death of one of the joint locker-hirers, the contents of the locker do not automatically transfer to the surviving joint locker-hirer or nominee(s) unless there is a survivorship clause or nomination in place.When renting a locker, the bank charges a nominal annual rent based on the size of the locker and the location of the branch. The rent should be paid in advance for the financial year. The bank provides a copy of the signed Locker Agreement to the locker-hirer, outlining their rights and responsibilities.","The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four.

Source: ET quoting Paisabazaar for interest rates data as on August 14, 2024.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens.

Sovereign Gold Bonds: How investors can buy SGBs from the stock market; step-by-step guide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/sovereign-gold-bonds-how-investors-can-buy-sgbs-from-the-stock-market-step-by-step-guide/articleshow/112830983.cms,"How to buy Sovereign Gold Bonds from stock market

To purchase SGBs through the stock market, follow these steps:

Buying SGBs from the stock market: The government introduced Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) in 2015 as a safer alternative to physically holding gold. SGBs eliminate the risks and costs associated with storing physical gold while guaranteeing investors the market value of gold at maturity and monthly interest payments. The bonds are held in the RBI's records or in demat form, mitigating the risk of scrip loss and other related issues.Investors can purchase Sovereign Gold Bonds from the primary market during the government-announced subscription periods or from the secondary market through the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) and the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ).According to an ET report, if you fail to apply for SGBs during the primary issuance, you can still invest in them through the stock exchanges in the secondary market. The price of SGBs in the secondary market is determined by supply and demand, similar to other securities. Typically, SGBs trade at a discount to the spot price of gold, the ET report said.Step 1: Identify the discounted or high-yielding SGB on NSE or BSE.Step 2: Locate the SGB scrip code in your demat account and place a buy order.Step 3: The bonds will be credited to your demat account within one working day (T+1) of the transaction.Also Read | Sovereign Gold Bonds: RBI announces early redemptions for some SGBs - should investors redeem? The tax treatment for exiting a gold bond investment varies depending on the method chosen. According to the report, the tax treatment differs if you exit your gold bond investment earlier.There are two popular ways to exit a gold bond investment; the first is via the early redemption window at the end of 5 years, and the second is to sell your bonds in the secondary market. In both cases, capital gains will be taxable according to the usual definition of short-term and long-term capital gains. If it is the former, the rate applicable will be at its peak. If it is the latter, then the investor can choose between a flat tax rate of 10% or 20% after considering indexation.The NSE website provides important information about Sovereign Gold Bonds through frequently asked questions section. SGBs can be traded on stock exchanges from a date notified by the RBI, but only bonds held in de-mat form with depositories are eligible for trading. Additionally, bonds can be sold and transferred according to the provisions of the Government Securities Act, 2006, with partial transfers also being possible.Also Read | Top 5 Bank FDs: Which banks offer the best fixed deposit rates? Check List Investors can place bids for SGBs through either Depository Mode or Physical Mode. In Depository Mode, the RBI credits the Gold Bonds to the client's demat account, while in Physical Mode, the RBI issues a physical Gold Bond Certificate to the clients. Bids can be cancelled until the last date of the issue period.Although the term of an SGB is eight years, some investors who purchased SGBs earlier may not be able to hold the bonds for the entire tenure. In such cases, these individuals can use exchanges to sell their assets, similar to how stocks are traded.","The government introduced Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) in 2015.

FM also said that compensation cess on luxury and sin goods are also going to be discussed. While cess was to end in 2022, the requirement of states to meet their spending requirements led to the GST Council agreeing to extend it up to March 2026 to repay the borrowings.

The request from NSE to Sebi follows a hearing in a court case in Delhi during which Sebi told the court that there were no new requests from NSE for an IPO.Once the NOC from Sebi is in place, the bourse will prepare the draft prospectus, file the same with Sebi and once the regulatory nod is received after scrutiny, the bourse will launch its IPO, sources said.NSE's latest move is expected to expedite the process of listing of the country's biggest stock exchange which has been hanging for over eight years due to various reasons. These included investigations relating to NSE's preferential treatment to some entities in its F&O trading servers, cases related to Chitra Ramkrishna, its former MD, and other exchange officials.In 2016, NSE had filed a draft prospectus with Sebi for its IPO. Around the same time, it emerged that the then MD Ramkrishna, along with some other officials, were involved in illegal activities.

How PM Jan Dhan accounts fast-tracked financial inclusion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-pm-jan-dhan-accounts-fast-tracked-financial-inclusion/articleshow/112850628.cms,"(The writer is chief economic advisor in the finance ministry)

When we aspire for certain things and work hard towards securing them, we feel happy only briefly at our success. Then, there is a mental reset. What has been achieved becomes the benchmark. What is still elusive becomes the next quest or cause for restlessness. This is true of most humans. We adopt a similar approach with respect to public policies.We clamour for certain policies or actions to be taken. When govt addresses a long-standing problem, the bar is raised even higher. There is inadequate acknowledgement of the achievement and contemplation of the counterfactual - the persistence of the inferior status quo. The PM Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), which celebrates its tenth anniversary, is one such case.For long, we lamented the financial exclusion of crores of Indians. In 2014, the then-new NDA govt took on the challenging task of bringing crores of Indians into the formal financial system . It turned out to be a spectacular success. As of Aug 14, 2024, there were over 53.1 crore beneficiaries with total deposits of over Rs 2.3 lakh crore. Nearly thirty crore beneficiaries are women.In a research paper titled, 'The design of digital financial infrastructure: lessons from India', researchers at the Bank for International Settlements stated, ""Given the low levels of both financial inclusion and formal identification in 2008, the magnitude of the challenges facing India a little more than a decade ago was immense. Based on the bank account data and the relationship with GDP per capita discussed above, one rough estimate is that it would have taken 47 years to achieve 80% of adults with a bank account had India solely relied on traditional growth processes.""Another research ('Banking the Unbanked: What do 280 Million New Bank Accounts Reveal About Financial Access ?', Sept 2023) shows that PMJDY accounts helped safeguard financial savings as there was greater usage of PMJDY accounts in regions prone to thefts. It also led to a decline in borrowing from informal sources who normally charge high rates of interest.In a world where instant judgment is more the norm than the exception, commentators pointed out that the PMJDY accounts were mostly zero-balance accounts. These accounts have a combined deposit balance of over Rs 2.3 lakh crore. The usefulness of these accounts proved to be inestimable during Covid. The Union govt transferred benefits directly to these accounts. In the three financial years (FY20 to FY22), approximately Rs 8.1 lakh crore were directly transferred to beneficiaries' bank accounts. Together with the evolution of digital payment infrastructure, this facilitated no-touch payments during the peak time of the pandemic.Emerging research ('Does open banking expand credit access?', Aug 2024) shows that PMJDY facilitated open banking - customer-permitted data sharing to any financial institution. More specifically, regions with more PMJDY accounts have increased credit growth led by fintech, and the effects were stronger in regions with cheap and better internet connectivity. 'Account aggregation' is a manifestation of open banking. It is enabling the public to access more financial products and services.Behaviourally, PMJDY has empowered women with their own accounts and money in the accounts. This financial independence is hard to quantify, but it is significant. Women in India generally have a higher savings proclivity, and over time, this could result in enhanced financial security for families and boost the national savings rate. Further, it can boost female entrepreneurship. Female participation has been quite encouraging in the wave of entrepreneurship through Startup India, a govt initiative to promote startups, and Stand-Up India, a scheme to promote entrepreneurship among women and SC/ST communities.We return to the challenge of contemplating the counterfactual. In the light of the evidence of benefits that PMJDY has conferred on the accountholders, it is not hard to visualise the counterfactual. India's development accomplishments in the last decade would have been substantially lower but for the visionary decision to launch PMJDY and its successful execution in a short period.","PM Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) celebrates its tenth anniversary.

Why it’s time to explore bold & path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-its-time-to-explore-bold-path-breaking-alternatives-that-put-indian-railways-on-a-smooth-track/articleshow/112317406.cms,"By Ashutosh Bhandari

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business. The industry welcomes the much- needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government.PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest.

He also said that India's fiscal prudence has become an example for the world to see.Modi spoke of the government's initiatives to transform the manufacturing sector of the economy with steps like 'Make in India', Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, liberalisation of FDI norms, setting up of multi-modal logistics hubs.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the first Union Budget of the newly elected NDA government on July 23, 2024.","PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

TIMES VIEW The worsening of the sex ratio at birth for a third straight year is a cause of alarm. The fact that the latest dip is sharper than in the last couple of years underlines that authorities are not doing enough to reverse the shameful situation. This must change and soon.

Why continuing fall in Delhi's sex ratio is cause for concern

NEW DELHI: The sex ratio at birth recorded a decline for the third successive year in Delhi with 922 females being born in 2023 per 1000 males against 929 in 2022. Delhi govt officials said the fall was marginal but health experts sounded an alarm, saying there was a possibility that the number of pre-natal sex determination tests was going up in the Capital and that the authorities must crack down.The continued decline in sex ratio at birth was revealed in the 'Annual Report on Registration of Births and Deaths in Delhi-2023', released recently by Delhi govt's directorate of economics and statistics. The birth rate in the city has improved from 14.24 per thousand in 2022 to 14.66 in 2023 with the death rate also increasing marginally, from 6.07 to 6.16.The figure had witnessed distinct improvement in the past few years. The data available from the civil registration system revealed that 822 female births per 1000 males were recorded in 2005, but in 2008, it had improved dramatically to 1004 females per 1000 males. This was ""unprecedented"" and could have happened due to implementation of Delhi govt's Ladli scheme .In 2015, the sex ratio at birth was recorded at 898 which increased to 933 in 2020 but has been on a decline since then. While it was recorded at 932 in 2021, it fell to 929 in 2022 and 922 in 2023.Former director of hospital administration in MCD, Dr Arun Yadav, said the trend had raised concerns. ""In an ideal world, the sex ratio should improve, especially in a city like Delhi. If it is decreasing, govt needs to check whether sex determination tests are being conducted and female foeticide is still being practiced,"" he said. ""It should be ensured that Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, which aims at preventing sex selection before or after conception, and to regulate the prenatal diagnostic techniques, is being strictly implemented.""Gynaecologist Nancy Nagpal, who was earlier working with a Delhi govt hospital, agreed that a section of people still preferred a male child. ""I have seen many affluent families going abroad to get sex determination done. If the sex ratio at birth is falling in the national capital, one can only imagine the scenario in rural areas,"" said Nagpal.Delhi started monitoring of the sex ratio in institutional births on a monthly basis in 2004. The data is collected from 100 major hospitals. It accounted for 71.7% of the total registered births in 2023 in Delhi. This helps to review the sex ratio at the highest level in the shortest possible time without waiting for the yearly indicators.According to the report, the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births was recorded at 23.61 during 2023 as against 23.82 during 2022 while the maternal mortality rate per 1000 live births was 0.45 in 2023 against 0.49 in 2022. The total number of births registered during 2023 was 3,15,087 as against 3,00,350 during 2022, with the average number of births per day in Delhi at 863 in 2023 as against 823 in 2022. The percentage of births at govt hospitals was 64.56. Of the total births, 13.79% births were rural and 86.21% urban according to the place of residence of the mother.Only in a negligible 0.01% cases, the delivery occurred with the help of relatives or others. In 99.68% of cases, a doctor, nurse or a trained midwife was present, and in 0.3% of cases, an untrained midwife or traditional birth attendant was available.According to the report, 42.95% of children were born to women aged 25-29 years followed by 24.71% in the 30-34 age group. The average number of deaths per day in Delhi worked out to 363 in 2023 as against 351 during 2022. Out of 1,32,391 deaths registered in 2023, infant deaths were recorded at 7,439.The report said 39.3% of deaths occurred in the 65 years and above age group, followed by 17.4% in the 55-64 age group, 14.1% in the 45-54 age group and the remaining 29.2% among people aged below 45.The reason behind most deaths - 17.3% - during 2023 was recorded as septicaemia; 10.6% due to shock; 4.73% due to diseases of the liver; 4.65% due to diseases of pulmonary circulation and other forms of heart diseases; and 4.63% due to hypertension.""The higher number of deaths due to septicaemia shows that the condition of govt hospitals needs to be improved. We should also see that antibiotics are not misused. The antibiotic policy of govt should be enforced strictly,"" said Yadav.","The sex ratio at birth recorded a decline for the third successive year in Delhi.

"Chinese hackers breach US, India internet firms, Lumen says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/volt-typhoon-chinese-hackers-breach-us-india-internet-firms-lumen/articleshow/112852885.cms,"The state-sponsored Chinese hacking campaign known as Volt Typhoon is exploiting a bug in a California-based startup to hack American and Indian internet companies, according to security researchers.Volt Typhoon has breached four US firms, including internet service providers, and another in India through a vulnerability in a Versa Networks server product, according to Lumen Technologies Inc ’s unit Black Lotus Labs.Their assessment, much of which was published in a blog post on Tuesday, found with “moderate confidence” that Volt Typhoon was behind the breaches of unpatched Versa systems and said exploitation was likely ongoing.Versa, which makes software that manages network configurations and has attracted investment from Blackrock Inc. and Sequoia Capital, announced the bug last week and offered a patch and other mitigations.The revelation will add to concerns over the susceptibility of US critical infrastructure to cyberattacks. The US this year accused Volt Typhoon of infiltrating networks that operate critical US services, including some of the country’s water facilities, power grid and communications sectors, in order to cause disruptions during a future crisis, such as an invasion of Taiwan.Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an email, “ ‘Volt Typhoon’ is actually a ransomware cyber criminal group who calls itself the ‘Dark Power’ and is not sponsored by any state or region.”He added that China sees signs that the US intelligence community has secretly collaborated with cybersecurity companies to falsely accuse China of supporting cyberattacks against the US as part of an effort to boost congressional budgets and government contracts. Bloomberg couldn’t verify those claims.Lumen shared its findings with Versa in late June, according to Lumen and supporting documentation shared with Bloomberg.Versa, which is based in Santa Clara, California, said it issued an emergency patch for the bug at the end of June, but only began flagging the issue widely to customers in July once it was notified by one that claimed to have been breached. Versa said that customer, which it didn’t identify, didn’t follow previously published guidelines on how to protect its systems via firewall rules and other measures.Dan Maier, Versa’s chief marketing officer, said in an email Monday that those 2015 guidelines include advising customers to close off internet access to a specific port, which the customer had failed to follow. Since last year, he said, Versa has now taken measures of its own to make the system “secure by default,” meaning customers will no longer be exposed to that risk even if they haven’t followed company guidelines.The bug carries a “high” severity rating, according to the National Vulnerability Database. On Friday, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, ordered federal agencies to patch Versa products or stop using them by Sept. 13.The vulnerability has been exploited in at least one known instance by a sophisticated hacking group, Versa said in a blog post on Monday. The company didn’t identify the group, and on Friday, Versa told Bloomberg it didn’t know the identity.Microsoft Corp named and unveiled the Volt Typhoon campaign in May 2023. Since its discovery, US officials have urged companies and utilities to improve their logging to help search for and eradicate the hackers, who use vulnerabilities to get into systems and then can remain undetected for long stretches of time.The Chinese government has dismissed US accusations, saying the hacking attacks attributed to Volt Typhoon are the work of cyber criminals.CISA Director Jen Easterly told Congress in January about the malicious cyber activity, warning the US has discovered only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to victims and that China’s aim is to be able to plunge the US into “societal panic.”US agencies, including CISA, the National Security Agency and the FBI, said in February that Volt Typhoon activity dates back at least five years and has targeted communications, energy, transportation systems, water and wastewater systems.Lumen first identified the malicious code in June, according to Lumen researcher Michael Horka. A malware sample uploaded from Singapore on June 7 bore the hallmarks of Volt Typhoon, he said in an interview.Horka, a former FBI cyber investigator who joined Lumen in 2023 after working on Volt Typhoon cases for the federal government, said the code was a web shell that allowed hackers to gain access to a customer’s network via legitimate credentials and then behave as if they were bona fide users.","Volt Typhoon has breached four US firms, including internet service providers, and another in India through a vulnerability in a Versa Networks server product.

Canada to slap 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/canada-to-slap-100-tariff-on-chinese-electric-vehicles/articleshow/112822988.cms,"What the Canadian PM said

China responds with 'strong dissatisfaction'

Response to 'extraordinary threat'

Prime Minister of Canada , Justin Trudeau on Monday announced a 100 per cent tariff on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles, joining the United States and European Union in imposing higher duties.The decision was taken in response to what Canada identified as an effort by Chinese companies to generate a global oversupply.""Actors like China have chosen to give themselves an unfair advantage in the global marketplace,"" Trudeau said at a cabinet meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia.Ottawa is also set to place a 25 per cent tariff on imported steel and aluminum from China, Trudeau said. The levies come after a 30-day public consultation on Chinese electric vehicles and related products.""I think we all know that China is not playing by the same rules,"" Trudeau said.""What is important about this is we're doing it in alignment and in parallel with other economies around the world,"" he said.Ottawa seeks to position Canada as a critical part of the global electric vehicle supply chain and has been under pressure domestically to act against China. To bolster its manufacturing heartland, Canada has signed deals worth billions of dollars with European automakers in all parts of the chain.The 100 per cent tariff on Chinese vehicles was met with ""strong dissatisfaction"" by Beijing's embassy.""This move is typical trade protectionism and politically motivated decision,"" a spokesperson said in a statement on the embassy's website. ""It will damage trade and economic cooperation between China and Canada, hurt the interests of Canadian consumers and enterprises (and) slow down the green transition process of Canada.""Both the US and EU in recent months imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs of 100 per cent and 38 per cent , respectively. At a news conference in Halifax on Canada's Atlantic coast, Trudeau said Chinese electric vehicle overproduction and hefty state subsidies for its auto sector ""requires us to take action.""""Unless we want to get in a race to the bottom, we have to stand up, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. The government called the tariffs a response to ""this extraordinary threat.""Beijing has threatened wide-ranging retaliation to the duties imposed by Brussels, something that could hit Germany particularly hard.Germany — for which China is a key market — abstained in a July vote by EU member states on imposing the provisional tariffs on the Chinese vehicles. German carmakers — which made a third of their sales last year in China — are particularly concerned about any blowback.Berlin is seeking a consensus that would see the preliminary tariff measures reversed.","Canadian PM Justin Trudeau announces a 100 per cent tariff on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles.

Uber hit by record $324 million fine for data transfers to US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uber-hit-by-record-324-million-fine-for-data-transfers-to-us/articleshow/112813270.cms,"Uber Technologies Inc . was hit by a record €290 million ($324 million) fine by the Dutch privacy watchdog for failing to abide by European protection standards when it shipped swathes of sensitive data about its drivers to the US.The Dutch Data Protection Authority said Uber was collecting information of drivers from Europe, such as taxi licenses, location data, and in some cases criminal and medical data, and retaining them on servers in the US.The fine is the highest penalty ever issued by the Dutch watchdog against any company, a spokesperson said by email. It’s also the biggest fine Uber received globally.The ride-hailing service sent the sensitive data to its US headquarters for over two years without using data transfer tools aimed at protecting privacy, which meant the data were “insufficiently protected,” the watchdog said on Monday. Uber has ended the violation last year, the agency said.The fine is “completely unjustified,” said Caspar Nixon, a spokesperson for Uber, in response to emailed questions. Uber’s data transfer process was compliant with European laws and the company will appeal against the decision, Nixon said.Uber didn’t meet the requirements of European laws to “ensure the level of protection to the data with regard to transfers to the US. That is very serious,” Aleid Wolfsen, the Dutch data protection authority’s chairman, said in a statement.The Dutch data protection authority began its investigation on Uber after more than 170 French drivers complained to a French human rights interest group. The probe was handled by the Dutch agency as Uber’s European headquarters is in the Netherlands.This is the third penalty by the Dutch data protection authority on Uber. It was previously fined for not providing sufficient transparency about how long it retained data from European drivers and to which countries outside Europe this data was forwarded. In 2018, it was penalized for not informing the Dutch watchdog about a data breach in time.The fines by European privacy watchdogs can amount to a maximum of 4% of the worldwide annual revenue of a business.","Uber sent sensitive data to its US headquarters for over two years without using data transfer tools aimed at protecting privacy.

"Ignore your boss! In Australia, employees now have 'right to disconnect' from emails, calls after work hours",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ignore-your-boss-in-australia-employees-now-have-right-to-disconnect-from-emails-calls-after-work-hours/articleshow/112795621.cms,"Australian employees can now ignore their boss reaching out after work hours! A new "" right to disconnect "" law has been introduced in Australia, aiming to protect employees from the intrusion of work-related emails, texts, and calls into their personal lives. The law, which came into effect on Monday, ensures that employees cannot be penalized for not responding to work-related communications outside of their designated work hours, except in reasonable circumstances.The law does allow for exceptions in cases of emergencies and jobs with irregular hours, where employers can still contact their workers.However, employees can refuse to respond if it is reasonable to do so.The Fair Work Commission (FWC), Australia's industrial umpire, will determine the reasonableness of a refusal, considering factors such as the employee's role, personal circumstances, and why the contact was made. The FWC has the authority to issue cease and desist orders and impose fines of up to A$19,000 for an employee or A$94,000 for a company.The introduction of digital technology has blurred the lines between work and personal life, with many employees experiencing a constant encroachment of work-related communications into their off-hours.""Before we had digital technology there was no encroachment, people would go home at the end of a shift and there would be no contact until they returned the following day,"" John Hopkins , an associate professor at Swinburne University of Technology was quoted as saying by Reuters.The Australia Institute estimates that Australians worked an average of 281 hours of unpaid overtime in 2023, valued at A$130 billion ($88 billion).Australia joins a growing list of countries, primarily in Europe and Latin America, that have implemented similar laws. France, a pioneer in this area, introduced the rules in 2017 and has already enforced them, fining pest control firm Rentokil Initial 60,000 euros ($66,700) for requiring an employee to always have his phone on.Rachel Abdelnour, who works in advertising, believes that these laws are crucial, stating, ""I think it's actually really important that we have laws like this. We spend so much of our time connected to our phones, connected to our emails all day, and I think that it's really hard to switch off as it is.""","Australian employees can now ignore their boss reaching out after work hours.

Chairman Jerome Powell said the time has come for the Federal Reserve to cut its key policy rate, affirming expectations that officials will begin lowering borrowing costs next month and making clear his intention to prevent further cooling in the labor market.“The time has come for policy to adjust,” Powell said Friday in the text of a speech at the Kansas City’s Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.“The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.”The Fed chief also acknowledged recent progress on inflation, which has resumed moderating in recent months after stalling earlier in the year: “My confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%,” he said, referring to the central bank’s inflation target.Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve during the Jackson Hole economic symposium in 2019.Treasury yields fell and the S&P 500 index of US stocks rose while the dollar declined.Swaps traders held steady in their pricing for the total rate cuts they foresee through the end of 2024, at about 98 basis points. Odds also remained steady for a quarter-point cut in September.While the remarks provided some clarity for financial markets in the near term, they offered few clues as to how the Fed might proceed after its September gathering.Still, the speech confirmed the Fed is on the cusp of a key turning point in its two-year battle against inflation. For most of that time, the labor market proved surprisingly sturdy, giving officials room to focus doggedly on lowering inflation toward the central bank’s 2% target.The Fed has held its benchmark rate in a range of 5.25%-5.5% — its highest level in more than two decades — for the last year in support of that goal, propping up borrowing costs across the economy.Yet just as inflation has neared its target, cracks have appeared on the employment front, prompting several Fed officials to worry that high rates now pose a threat to the economy’s continued strength. Warning signals included a disappointing July jobs report that rattled financial markets.“We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.” Powell said, adding that the slowdown in the labor market was “unmistakable.”After being late to raise rates in response to an inflation surge during the Covid-19 pandemic, Powell’s remarks underscore how Fed officials are hoping to avoid another policy error now that price growth is easing. Their success or failure will determine whether there’s a so-called soft landing, the rare feat of smothering a burst of inflation without tipping the economy into recession.“Our objective has been to restore price stability while maintaining a strong labor market, avoiding the sharp increases in unemployment that characterized earlier disinflationary episodes when inflation expectations were less well anchored,” Powell said. “While the task is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome.”At their last gathering in July, the “vast majority” of Fed officials felt it would likely be appropriate to cut rates in September if economic data continued to come in as expected.While inflation remains above the Fed’s goal, it has retreated markedly from its recent peak of 7.1% in 2022. The central bank’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 2.5% in June from a year earlier.Powell’s comments will likely be well-received by Americans contending with high interest rates attached to mortgages, autos, credit cards and other borrowing. Investors are widely anticipating a quarter-point cut when when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets Sept. 17-18.Questions remain about the Fed’s path forward and Powell provided no additional clarity.Investors are weighing whether another negative jobs report would compel the Fed to cut rates by a larger-than-usual 50 basis points in September. Another key matter is how policymakers might proceed with the pace and size of rate cuts in subsequent months.Powell said policymakers “will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability.”","Jerome Powell said the time has come for the Federal Reserve to cut its key policy rate.
