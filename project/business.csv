Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Enterprises to acquire 24.5% stake worth $4 billion in Britain's biggest broadband & mobile company BT Group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sunil-mittal-led-bharti-enterprises-to-acquire-24-5-in-britains-biggest-broadband-and-mobile-company-bt/articleshow/112459841.cms,"Sunil Bharti Mittal-led Bharti Enterprises announced on Monday its intention to purchase a 24.5% stake in BT Group , the largest broadband and mobile provider in Britain. Bharti Enterprises said that it would acquire a stake worth about 3.2 billion pounds ($4 billion). The acquisition will involve buying out the shares held by Altice UK , the investment vehicle of telecoms entrepreneur Patrick Drahi , who is currently BT's largest shareholder.Drahi initially invested in BT in 2021, but Altice group has been under increasing pressure to divest assets to reduce its debts, which have reached up to $60 billion, a sum that allowed him to expand his media-to-telecoms empire during a period of low interest rates.Bharti outlined its acquisition strategy, stating that it will first acquire a 9.99% stake and then seek to purchase the remaining 14.51% after obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. This includes voluntarily applying for clearance under the UK National Security and Investment Act.Over the past six months, BT's shares have experienced a 24% increase as the company begins to reap the benefits of its long-term investment plan to develop the country's fibre network. In June of this year, Mexican magnate Carlos Slim acquired a 3.2% stake in BT, providing a boost to Allison Kirkby, who assumed the role of BT's chief executive in February.""This scale of investment from Bharti Global is a great vote of confidence in the future of BT Group and our strategy,"" Kirkby said in a statement following the investment announcement.Bharti, for its part, emphasized that the deal also reflects confidence in Britain and its stable business and policy environment. This statement could be interpreted as a reference to the country's new Labour government, which took office last month following five years of instability under the Conservative party.""Its (BT's) focus on strengthening its networks, driving consumer growth, and optimising every aspect of its business makes it well-placed to consolidate its position as a leading global telecoms company,"" said Sunil Bharti Mittal , Chair of Bharti Enterprises, in the statement.","Bharti Enterprises said that it would acquire a stake worth about 3.2 billion pounds ($4 billion) Bharti outlined its acquisition strategy, stating that it will first acquire a 9.99% stake and then seek to purchase the remaining 14.51% after obtaining regulatory approvals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112460109,imgsize-43076,width-400,resizemode-4/112460109.jpg"
"In role reversal, Bharti acquire 24.5% of iconic BT in $4 billion deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/in-role-reversal-bharti-acquire-24-5-of-iconic-bt-in-4-billion-deal/articleshow/112476582.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Global , the international investment arm of Bharti Enterprises, on Monday announced the acquisition of a 24.5% stake in iconic BT Group plc from Altice UK, which will make it the largest shareholder in the company that once owned 21% in Bharti Airtel.Bharti has already acquired 9.9% in the UK’s top fixed and mobile communications provider through a market deal.Based on BT’s current market value, the entire transaction — which is subject to regulatory approvals, including security clearance — is estimated around $4 billion.The deal adds to the list of marquee British companies and brands acquired by Indian entities, including Jaguar Land Rover, Corus and Tetley by Tata, apart from BSA by Mahindra Group and Hamleys by Reliance Brands.“BT to my mind has a much brighter future ahead and they need to be following their strategy, if I may say, even more boldly… We are not in this for making a buck or looking at stock markets up or down. We are long-term telecom investors,” Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said during a call, adding that the investment offered synergies. Flanked by his son Shravin, Bharti Global MD, he pitched it as a strategic deal which was in line with strengthening India-UK ties and offered opportunities on AI, 5G RD and core engineering.Once the transaction is completed, Bharti will own more stake than Deutsche Telekom’s 12%. The deal follows Mexican magnate Carlos Slim’s 3.2% acquisition in BT two months ago.Despite slower growth opportunities, it marks Bharti’s big foray into a developed country market with the group having so far focused on Africa, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Seychelles in addition to the home market. “Growth in Europe and the UK is bound to be much... So, growth is very small, 1-2% a year... But the revenue is pretty large, $25 billion of current revenues, and $10 billion in EBITDA... can we create more efficiency, can the free cash flows increase over a period of time...,” he said.Mittal said that his group zeroed in on BT from other options that were on the table and indicated that it may opt for more acquisitions in future.“We got this opportunity to buy a very important block of shares. It is very difficult to buy such stock in the market. It takes a long time and there are uncertainties of pricing... here was a block with a willing seller who moved in to make this offer and we quickly decided to take the same,” he said.Mittal said that the stability in the Indian business in recent months, which came after some large investments and intense competition, had given the group “the courage to look at the opportunity” and the Indian operations will not be impacted in any way by the investment. BT and British authorities welcomed the transaction as did Indian authorities.“…the wheel has come full circle since 1997 when British Telecom acquired a 21% stake in Bharti Airtel. This acquisition is testimony to the growing strength of India as we march towards Viksit Bharat under the inspirational leadership of PM Modi ji. We thank UK Prime Minister @Keir_Starmer and Foreign Secretary @DavidLammy for their continued support in strengthening business ties between the two countries,” commerce & industry minister tweeted.In the past, stake acquisition in companies such as BT has attracted security concerns in the UK and Goyal’s tweet suggested that the British govt may be on board.By Mittal’s own admission, the transaction marks a departure from his usual style of being “an operator”. Instead, his group is not seeking a board seat, at least for the moment. “We see this as a positive step for BT. We have a long and good working relationship with Bharti. So, we are looking forward to work together with Bharti on the board of directors for the sake of BT shareholders and customers,” Deutsche Telekom CEO Timotheus Höttges said.","Bharti has already acquired 9.9% in the UK’s top fixed and mobile communications provider through a market deal.

"Sensex shrugs off Hindenburg charge, Adani stocks dip",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-shrugs-off-hindenburg-charge-adani-stocks-dip/articleshow/112476309.cms,"MUMBAI: In volatile trades on Monday, the sensex closed a marginal 57-point lower at 79,649 points as investors on Dalal Street mostly discounted US short-seller Hindenburg Research 's report that alleged conflict of interest on part of Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch while investigating alleged wrongdoings by Adani Group.While the latest Hindenburg report didn't have much impact on the broader market , stock prices of some of Adani Group companies witnessed selling on Monday.However, the selling was not as sharp as during Jan-Feb 2023, after the publication of Hindenburg's first report that had alleged serious corporate malfeasance against Adani Group, which the it has denied.After Hindenburg released its report on Saturday, there was apprehension among investors that the market may react negatively to the report, just like it had done when the first report was published in Jan 2023. However, as some market veterans had reasoned that Hindenburg's second report had no surprise element and hence unlikely to impact investor sentiment, the markets, after a negative start in the new week, recovered quickly.According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services, the market's initial trajectory ""was eclipsed"" by the controversy generated by Hindenburg's report on Sebi chairperson. ""However, the market tried to ignore these noises, taking positive cues from global markets. Moreover, the domestic market is anticipating ease in CPI inflation (came in at a multi-month low after markets closed), which is going to be further supported by a good monsoon.""Nair said that there are some upside risks to the market, ""given firm oil prices and volatility in food inflation"". Market players don't see any negative fallout from the Hindenburg report.On Monday, foreign funds were big sellers with a net outflow figure of Rs 4,681 crore, BSE data showed. However, domestic funds were aggressive buyers and recorded a net inflow of Rs 4,478 crore.On Monday, Adani Wilmar was the worst hit and closed 4.1% down, while flagship Adani Enterprises ended 1.1% lower.","The sensex closed a marginal 57-point lower at 79,649 points on Monday.

Sundram Fasteners's chairman's daughter to trim holding co stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sundram-fastenerss-chairmans-daughter-to-trim-holding-co-stake/articleshow/112480414.cms,"MUMBAI: Sundram Fasteners 's chairman Suresh Krishna's eldest daughter, Preethi Krishna , is planning to sell a part of her stake in the holding company of the auto components maker. The move by US-based Preethi (59), a fourth-gen member of the storied TV Sundram Iyengar clan, is being seen as a step towards exiting the family business.Preethi's share will be bought by her father, mother Usha Krishna, and two sisters - Arathi Krishna and Arundathi Krishna - consolidating their interests in the holding company: TVS Sundram Fasteners .To finance the transaction, the four will sell Sundram Fasteners shares worth Rs 400 crore to institutional investors like West Asian funds.Once the share-purchase transaction is concluded, Preethi's stake in the holding company will fall to 14-15% from 20%. Suresh, Usha, Arathi and Arundathi too currently own 20% each in the holding company, which in turn holds 48% of Sundram Fasteners, which has a market value of Rs 28,000 crore.Sources said the four family members through TVS Sundram Fasteners will sell 1.5% stake of Sundram Fasteners via a block deal to foreign investors for Rs 400 crore. The share-sale is to finance another transaction between them and Preethi at TVS Sundram Fasteners, they added. The quartet will buy a part of Preethi's stake in the holding company as she wants to reduce her interest in the unit.Though Preethi is a director of Sundram Fasteners, she doesn't play an active role in the operations of the Chennai-based company as compared to her two sisters. Arathi (55) is the MD of Sundram Fasteners while Arundathi (50) is the joint MD.Preethi is settled in the US and her 20% stake in TVS Sundram Fasteners is held through a trust, which is controlled by her husband, Ram Sundaram, a former Goldman Sachs honcho. Emails sent to Ram Sundaram and Suresh Krishna didn't elicit any reply.At one point in time, Sundram Fasteners was part of the undivided TVS Group. Now the south-based conglomerate's diverse units are run by different family members as part of the business separation agreement between them. For instance, Suresh's first cousin Venu Srinivasan controls TVS Motor and Sundaram Clayton.In a common holding company, which in turn holds a listed entity, the exit of a particular family member becomes tricky as it cannot happen without the consent of all the other shareholders of the holding company. This imposes liquidity concerns for the seller-shareholder, said a lawyer. However, the upside is that the entire shareholding is consolidated in the holding company and therefore, voting rights with respect to the listed entity can be exercised by one common shareholder i.e. the holding company, he said.","The move by US-based Preethi (59), a fourth-gen member of the storied TV Sundram Iyengar clan, is being seen as a step towards exiting the family business.Preethi's share will be bought by her father, mother Usha Krishna, and two sisters - Arathi Krishna and Arundathi Krishna - consolidating their interests in the holding company.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112480419,imgsize-1275307,width-400,resizemode-4/112480419.jpg"

Why invest in such funds?

How do Indians invest?

What are the fees like?

The tax implications?

Can an investor influence fund's decision-making?

On Aug 10, US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report that said Sebi chairman Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval had investments in offshore investment funds which were used by Vinod Adani, brother of billionaire Gautam Adani, to invest in Adani Group's stocks. Here's an explainer on offshore funds , their structure and tax implications :An offshore fund is like a mutual fund that collects money from people and invests the same abroad.Most Indians invest in offshore funds that are based in Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Cyprus, which offer huge advantages. Some funds are also based in finance hubs like Singapore and Mauritius.These funds offer better returns than traditional investments, and diversification across asset classes and geographies. Tax havens also provide a high level of secrecy of investments and investors.There are specialised fund houses and wealth managers who help rich Indians invest in such funds. There is no minimum investment amount but usually, each person needs to invest at least $100,000 in these funds. A resident Indian can invest up to $250,000 per person per annum through RBI's liberalised remittance scheme route. An NRI can invest money from abroad without any limit.Most offshore funds charge fees in the 2-20 or similar models. This has two parts. The initial charge is 2% of the value of the assets on an annual basis. Then comes the 20% carry. Here, say the fund says it would generate an annual return of 10%. Anything above that 10% rate of return, 20% of that would be charged by the offshore fund, while the balance would remain with the investor. While the 2% annual fee is an industry standard, the 20% carry could vary depending upon the asset class, the investment region, among other factors.It depends upon the tax status of the investor. Also, on how the returns - capital gains and/or dividend - are taxed in the hands of the investor at his place of residence.In most pooled funds, in which there is a large number of investors, such influence is not allowed. However, such influence could be used in offshore funds that are investment holding companies in which there's only one investor who could be an individual, an institution or a family office.","Most Indians invest in offshore funds that are based in Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Cyprus.

Retail inflation falls to near 5-year low of 3.5% in July,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/retail-inflation-falls-to-near-5-year-low-of-3-5-in-july/articleshow/112476213.cms,"NEW DELHI: Retail inflation softened to a near 5-year low in July , led by a moderation in vegetables, fruits and spices and the impact of a statistical high-base effect, bringing much-needed relief from the stubborn price pressures witnessed in the past few months and triggered hopes of a cut in interest rates in the second half of the fiscal year.Separate data showed industrial output growth, as measured by Index of Industrial Production (IIP), moderated to a five-month low of 4.2% in June from the seven-month high of 6.2% as manufacturing sector slowed, while mining recorded a double digit expansion during the month.The retail inflation data, which was released by the National Statistical office (NSO) on Monday, brought some cheer as price pressures appeared to have eased. Retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), slowed to a 59-month low of 3.5% , lower than the 5.1% in June and below the 7.4% recorded in July last year. Rural inflation was at 4.1%, while urban was at nearly 3%. The food price index was at 5.4%, lower than the 9.4% in June.The food and beverages inflation moderated to a 13-month low of 5.1% after remaining above the 7% mark for the past eight months. The key driver of the easing was vegetable inflation, which softened to 6.8% in July from 30% in June, but month-on-month vegetable prices rose.""Aided by pick-up in rainfall since early-July 2024, the cumulative sowing of kharif crops exceeded the year-ago level by 1.4% as on Aug 12, 2024. The IMD's expectations of above normal rainfall during Aug-Sept, amidst the likely development of La Nina conditions at end-Aug 2024, augurs well for kharif crops, although we remain watchful of the episodes of heavy rainfall and flooding across some states that could harm the standing crops and impact perishable prices during this period,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA.She said that with all of the 22 essential commodities reporting an easing in their year-on-year inflation rates till Aug 10, as per the department of consumer affairs data relative to July 2024, the food and beverages inflation print should ease further in the ongoing month, dampening the headline retail inflation to 3.4% in Aug 2024.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

"CEO pay in IT zooms... at times over 1,000 times median salary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ceo-pay-in-it-zooms-at-times-over-1000-times-median-salary/articleshow/112480169.cms,"BENGALURU: The disparity between CEO and employee compensation in the IT industry continues to expand. Data from the past five years for select large companies shows that only IBM has seen a narrowing of the gap between CEO pay and the median employee remuneration . Accenture, Infosys, Wipro, and HCL have experienced a widening of this gap, reflecting the sharp increase in CEO compensation and particularly the value of their stock grants.The issue has received little attention from shareholders in India.Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy has previously indicated that a fair CEO remuneration would be about 25 to 40 times that of the lowest level employee. But in his own company now, CEO Salil Parekh's compensation is nearly 700 times that of the median remuneration in the company (compared to that of the lowest level employee, it would be significantly more). And that figure has risen sharply since 2019.Wipro has witnessed a substantial increase in the remuneration of the CEO compared to that of its employees. Former Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte's compensation was $20 million, which meant his salary was 1,702 times more than that of the median remuneration of Rs 9.8 lakh in the 2023-24 financial year.Within a single year, the ratio between HCL CEO C Vijayakumar compensation and the median employee remuneration widened to 707 in 2023-24, from 253:1.Accenture chief executive officer Julie Sweet's compensation in the 2023 fiscal was $31.5 million, 633 times that of the median salary of an Accenture employee, which was $49,842. This median salary was actually lower than the $50,512 in the 2019 fiscal. A report by executive intelligence platform Equilar finds that the median S& (largest listed companies in the US) employee earned $81,467 in 2023, a 5.2% increase from 2022. Due to CEO pay increasing at a higher rate than the median employee, the CEO pay ratio increased from 185 in 2022 to 196 in 2023.The report also noted that stock awards accounted for approximately 70% of total CEO compensation in 2023. The median value of stock awards increased by 10.7% to $9.4 million in 2023, significantly contributing to the overall rise in total compensation.In India, disclosure of pay ratios was mandated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) in 2014. However, the regulations do not specify a computation methodology, allowing companies to use their own discretion in arriving at these numbers. Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services, says that over the past 10-15 years, these IT services firms have become large global companies. ""Hence talent at senior levels becomes benchmarked to global levels, thus ensuring compensation is also benchmarked to global levels and growing at a rate greater than the rate at which the company grows. However, since the number of entry level employees has increased significantly, the compensation at entry levels has not increased. This is the main reason why the pay ratio will keep increasing. Shareholders are more interested in CEO compensation being largely variable and linked to performance metrics.""Subramanian also noted that the Occupy Wall Street movement in the US in 2008 saw the demand for disclosure of pay ratios. ""In the US, labour unions and other organisations use this data for corrective bargaining. In India these numbers have not found significance or usefulness anywhere.""Phil Fersht, chief executive officer of IT research and advisory HfS Research, says that leadership in IT services firms is increasingly becoming a critical differentiating factor, particularly at the CEO level and the CEO's direct reports.","Only IBM has seen a narrowing of the gap between CEO pay and the median employee remuneration.

Family suspects insider hand

KOLKATA: Investigators on Sunday found the strongest evidence yet against Sanjay Roy , the prime accused in the rape and murder of a 31-yearold postgraduate trainee doc at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital : traces of blood and skin found under the victim’s nails are a perfect match with Roy’s, and correspond to the injuries he suffered.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday had directed the police to ensure a fast-track trial, calling it a “despicable crime”.Kolkata Police sources said they tried their best to speed up the probe after that.The victim — even half-asleep — had desperately tried to fight back, and it was this fight that gave investigators the proof they needed, said a senior cop. “She had tried to resist, and caused deep injury marks and scratches on the hands of the accused. In a medical examination, the scratch injuries on Roy’s body matched the skin and blood samples collected from the nails of the victim. We expect to get the final forensic report soon,” he told TOI.The postmortem report has said the death was due to smothering and throttling. There are aberration marks and bruise marks on the victim’s face, on the eyes till the neck. The report mentions that the accused “got certain advantage as the victim was in deep sleep at the time of the attack.” The report, however, said that the judicial inquest was wrong in suggesting a collarbone and pelvis fracture.Police commissioner Vineet Goyal said the police had “nothing to hide”. Meeting the agitating students on the RG Kar Medical College Hospital campus, he said: “We have handed over the postmortem report to the victim’s family, and have apprised them of the probe.”The police claimed that the only motive, for the prime accused, appeared to be lust, or sexual gratification. “There is no evidence of the victim and the accused knowing each other,” an officer said, but added that that line was still being probed. The cops also said that a male doctor, who was a close friend of the victim, had also given his statement, as are several other doctors and colleagues whom she was close to.Interestingly, the cops said they learnt that the victim had a tiff with a civic volunteer some months back, but no one seems to be sure if that was Roy. At least one woman doctor, however, told the probe team that she — not the victim —had an argument with Roy.The Special Investigation Team (SIT) is set to meet the three-member forensic team which conducted the postmortem with some specific queries on Monday. The SIT wants to know — based on the evidence collected — whether the injuries on the victim’s body could have been caused by Roy alone, or whether he had been working with an accomplice.This question is also troubling the victim’s friends and family. “We had asked the (additional) police commissioner on whether there was someone else. We have been told that police are investigating that aspect as well,” the victim’s father told reporters after meeting the additional CP at their home. “We suspect an insider’s role,” he added.Commissioner Goyal also requested students to volunteer information “if you think anyone is involved”, promising to look into all such claims. He also asked them to be wary of several rumours that were doing the rounds.","Sanjay Roy is the prime accused in the rape and murder of a 31-year-old postgraduate trainee doc at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

DHAKA: A letter allegedly from former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina is circulating among her Awami League supporters, suggesting that her ouster from 15 years in office was the result of pressure from the US regarding the strategically important St Martin’s Island .The letter, which has gained traction despite the absence of official confirmation, attributes her removal to her refusal to cede control of the island in the Bay of Bengal to Washington.The island’s importance is linked to the US’s interest in countering China’s influence in the Indian Ocean .“I could have remained in power if I had left St Martin’s and the Bay of Bengal to America. Please do not be used,” the letter says. The message echoed the ousted prime minister’s long-standing stand against foreign intervention in Bangladesh ’s sovereignty, according to a party activist currently abroad.St Martin’s Island, known locally as “Narikel Zinzira”, which translates to “Coconut Island”, is in the northeastern part of Bay of Bengal, about 9km south of the tip of the Cox’s Bazar-Teknaf peninsula. With an area of just 3sqkm, the coral reef island is home to about 3,800 residents, most of whom are fishermen.There have been allegations circulating that Hasina’s rival and ex-PM Khaleda Zia had sought to “sell” the strategically important island to the US in exchange for American support in regaining office in Bangladesh. However, US authorities have denied these claims, maintaining that it respects the sovereignty of Bangladesh and has no intention of acquiring the island or intervening in the country’s internal political matters. Last year, Hasina had asserted her commitment to Bangladesh’s sovereignty, saying, “I don't want to return to power by leasing out St Martin’s Island”, during a press conference following her visits to Switzerland and Qatar.The letter suggests that Hasina’s departure was motivated by her desire to avoid further bloodshed. “Don’t get disappointed. I will return soon,” she is quoted as saying. Hasina, currently in India, is also said to have addressed accusations that she had insulted students. “I never called you Razakars (ruthless mercenaries from the Bangladesh independence war). My words have been distorted,” the letter says Hasina’s alleged claims are similar to Pakistan’s ex-PM Imran Khan’s allegations that US pressure played a role in his ouster. US has denied it.",Letter allegedly from former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina is circulating among her Awami League supporters.

"F1 spikes demand for travel to Singapore, Abu Dhabi, says travel company",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/f1-spikes-demand-for-travel-to-singapore-abu-dhabi-says-travel-company/articleshow/112475266.cms,"MUMBAI: While the Olympics has wrapped up, sports tourism involving outbound travel from India has only got going with enthusiasts already booking the next round of trips to Singapore and Abu Dhabi for the Formula 1 Grand Prix races to be held in September and December respectively. Airfares to these countries for travel around the time of these races have gone up, said a travel search aggregator.The F1 races are scheduled to be held in Singapore from Sept 20 to 22 and in Abu Dhabi from Dec 6 to 8.“The excitement is palpable, with a surge in searches for these high-octane destinations. Our data reveals a staggering 189% increase in flight bookings for Singapore for the date of September 18 September compared to September 17, suggesting Indian fans are eager to soak up the pre-race atmosphere in Singapore,” said Skyscanner. The Singapore Grand Prix, to be held in the evening of Sunday Sept 22 takes place over 62 laps of the 4.94 km Marina Bay Street Circuit.For Abu Dhabi, the action heats up on December 2, with flight bookings jumping 188% compared to the previous day, it added. “It seems many Indian fans are keen to arrive early and gear up for the festivities. Interestingly, there is another spike of 167% in volume of flight bookings for the outbound date of December 07 compared to the previous day, indicating that some fans might be timing their visit to catch the heart-pounding climax of the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix,” it added.TOI looked at fares on Skyscanner for travel on Sept 22, the day of the race. From Mumbai, the cheapest one-way ticket on non-stop flight was priced at Rs 12172 for a Vistara flight that landed at 9.15 am. But from Delhi, no tickets were available on flights that landed in the morning or early afternoon in time to catch the race which begins at 5.30 pm. For travel a day earlier, on Saturday, Sept 21, the cheapest one-way fare was a Vistara fare on a flight which departs at 11.45 pm and lands in Singapore at 8.15 am (all local times).Giving tips to bag cheap fares, Skyscanner said: “To maximize your savings, you could also consider mixing and matching the airlines and airports you choose to fly with to and from, to seriously cut costs. Remember, flights don’t always need to be booked as round-trip - embrace flexibility and strategic planning, to keep your budget grounded. This can help you save on flights and get the most bang for your travel buck.”","The F1 races are scheduled to be held in Singapore from Sept 20 to 22 and in Abu Dhabi from Dec 6 to 8.

Nathan Anderson: Who is Nathan Anderson? Financial sleuth behind Hindenburg research,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/who-is-nathan-anderson-financial-sleuth-behind-hindenburg-research/articleshow/112423390.cms,"Nathan Anderson is the founder of Hindenburg Research, a New York-based forensic financial research firm that specialises in exposing corporate fraud and malpractices. Founded in 2017, Hindenburg Research has gained prominence for its detailed reports on publicly traded companies, often leading to significant declines in their stock prices .Hindenburg Research’s methodology uses fundamental analysis to aid their investment decision-making .They investigate companies that have accounting irregularities, bad actors in management or key service provider roles, undisclosed related-party transactions, illegal/unethical business or financial reporting practices, and undisclosed regulatory, product, or financial issues.The firm is named after the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, symbolizing Anderson’s mission to expose financial “disasters” before they can harm investors.One of Anderson’s most notable reports targeted Nikola Corporation , an electric vehicle startup , in September 2020. Hindenburg accused Nikola of deceiving investors about its technology and capabilities. The report led to a sharp decline in Nikola’s stock value and investigations by federal authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Anderson’s work has drawn both praise and criticism. While many investors and market observers commend his efforts to bring transparency to the financial markets, critics argue that Hindenburg’s short-selling strategy, where the firm profits from a company’s stock price decline following a negative report, raises ethical concerns.Companies targeted by Hindenburg have sometimes responded with legal action, accusing the firm of defamation and market manipulation.Despite the controversies, Anderson continues to be a key figure in financial investigations. His reports have sparked regulatory scrutiny and prompted companies to improve their transparency and corporate governance. Through Hindenburg Research, Anderson has significantly influenced how corporate fraud is identified and addressed in the financial markets.Last year, Hindenburg published a report on the Adani group alleging that the group was involved in stock manipulation and accounting fraud, leading to a massive plunge in Adani’s stock value and triggering regulatory scrutiny across multiple jurisdictions.Meanwhile, Hindenburg on Saturday posted on social media platform X that, ‘Something big soon India’, which has again raised speculations in the Indian market.","Nathan Anderson is the founder of Hindenburg Research, a New York-based forensic financial research firm that specialises in exposing corporate fraud and malpractices.

Hotels and airlines, such as Air France, also reported a decline in bookings.Additionally, the Banque de France acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding its forecast, stating that the positive effect from the Games is countered by the negative impact of the unclear political situation following the inconclusive parliamentary elections in June and July.","French economy is expected to boost from the Olympic and Paralympic Games, according to the French central bank Banque de France.

"Colin Huang, Temu owner’s billionaire founder, becomes China’s richest person",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/colin-huang-temu-owners-billionaire-founder-becomes-chinas-richest-person/articleshow/112391434.cms,"Math Prodigy

Temu Time

Punishing Hours

After several moderately successful ventures in gaming and e-commerce, Colin Huang got sick and retired. At one point, the young entrepreneur stayed home for a year thinking about his next move.The former Google engineer eventually started Pinduoduo , an e-commerce platform known for selling dirt-cheap products with massive promotions, in 2015. He quickly ascended the ranks of the world’s richest people, with his net worth peaking at $71.5 billion in early 2021.Like many so-called Covid billionaires, his fortune collapsed just as fast as it was made, tumbling 87% in the span of about a year.Huang’s decline was especially stark as the slowing global pandemic coincided with China’s abrupt crackdown on the country’s private sector.Then something surprising happened: Huang’s PDD Holdings Inc staged a comeback. Not as big as before, but steady, with its expansion outside of China under the Temu brand name helping counteract a persistently weak domestic economy.As a result, Huang, now 44, has become China’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. With a $48.6 billion fortune, he displaces Zhong Shanshan, the country’s bottled-water king who has held the top spot since April 2021.Huang’s remarkable ascent has been fueled by China’s changing shopping habits after the nation’s real estate crisis morphed into a prolonged slowdown. He’s also the first tech tycoon to top the wealth rankings in more than three years, after government pressure on private businesses ensnared rivals like Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Along the way, Huang has also drawn protests from suppliers for driving down prices and set a punishing work schedule for his own employees.“Ma and Jeff Bezos have been corporate leaders in their moments, but the times have changed and Huang is seeing great success with a different, less visible approach,” said Brock Silvers, managing director at private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital.Representatives for PDD didn’t respond to requests for comment.Unlike Ma, the English teacher-turned-founder of Alibaba, Huang represents a new generation of Chinese tech entrepreneurs who started their careers with global opportunities.At 12, his prodigious math talent earned him a place at the elite Hangzhou Foreign Languages School, where he was classmates with the children of China’s political and social elite. After graduating with a computer science degree from Zhejiang University, he left China in 2002 to pursue a master’s degree at the University of Wisconsin.Two years after graduating, he moved back to help set up Google China. He founded his first company in 2007, then sold it in 2010 to start a new one that helped companies market themselves on websites like Alibaba’s Taobao or JD.com. When an ear infection led him to retire in 2013, he hatched the idea for Pinduoduo.PDD “is not about letting people in Shanghai feel like they are living a Parisian life, but making sure that people in Anhui have kitchen paper and fresh fruits,” Huang said in 2018 interview with Caijing magazine. “The goal is not to be cheap, but to make users feel like they got a good deal.”Huang has mainly stayed out of the limelight after he stepped down as PDD’s chief executive in 2020 and left the board as chairman in 2021, as Beijing began cracking down on China’s tech giants. (He said he was pursuing personal interests researching food and life sciences, according to a shareholder letter.)It was around that time that PDD — and his net worth — started to tumble.But Temu, PDD’s offering outside of China, bolstered the company’s top line and underpinned its rebound. It surged to the top of US app stores upon launching in September 2022, targeting inflation-weary Americans with cheap, unbranded products shipped directly from China. PDD reported about 248 billion yuan ($35 billion) in revenue last year, a 90% jump from 2022.“In this economic environment, obviously people are looking for great value for their money, people are looking for low prices,” said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData Retail. “So this is a time to shine for value retailers like Temu.”All that, along with China dropping its Covid-Zero policy in December 2022, has driven a surge in PDD’s valuation. In November, the company surpassed Alibaba for the first time to become China’s second-largest internet firm and the two rivals have been neck-and-neck since.Still, the breakneck growth has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad. Even after a probe into working conditions following the death of an employee in 2021, PDD continues to demand that employees work from 11am to 11pm, six days a week, plus overtime. It’s a variation of the industry’s “996” culture which companies like ByteDance Ltd. and Alibaba steered away from after Beijing’s regulatory scrutiny.Temu’s ultra-cheap offerings also led to growing frustration among some merchants and third-party sellers, who feel the e-commerce giant is increasingly squeezing them for revenue. Things came to a head in a series of public rallies this summer, when, in one case, hundreds of small suppliers yelled slogans outside a Temu office outpost in Guangzhou to protest against what they called unfair penalties the company is levying.Elsewhere, US small businesses have also noted Temu’s rapid growth. The company currently takes advantage of a trade loophole that allows for duty-free shipments up to $800 into the US, by sending small packages from its warehouse in China to individual Americans. Lobbyists are pushing for the threshold to be lowered to $10.Still, PDD has engaged in aggressive promotion campaigns, including spending millions on a 30-second Super Bowl advertisement for Temu. It also has catchy banners on its Temu website, including, among others: “Shop Like a Billionaire.”“Temu at the moment is all about growth,” Saunders said. “Attract people to the site, get them shopping. Then if they become more addicted, maybe then they start to be more tolerant if we push prices up a little bit. So I think for Temu it’s in a land grab era.”","Colin Huang, 44, has become China’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Saudi Aramco quarterly profit dips as output stays low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/saudi-aramco-quarterly-profit-dips-as-output-stays-low/articleshow/112316710.cms,"Steady dividend

Cash cow

RIYADH: Saudi oil giant Aramco on Tuesday reported net profit of $29.07 billion in the second quarter, a slight drop from the same period last year as output remained subdued.The decrease of 3.4 percent ""mainly reflects the impact of lower crude oil volumes sold and weakening refining margins"", the company said in a statement posted to the Saudi stock exchange.Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, is currently producing roughly nine million barrels per day (bpd), well below its capacity of 12 million bpd.Production averaged 8.8 million bpd in June, Riyadh-based firm Jadwa Investment said last week.The relatively low figure reflects cuts dating back to October 2022, when the OPEC+ bloc of oil producers that Riyadh co-leads with Moscow announced it would reduce output by two million bpd to boost prices.In April 2023, several OPEC+ members announced they would further slash production by more than one million bpd, and in June 2023, Riyadh announced an additional voluntary cut of one million bpd.""Output will remain at similar levels until at least October"", at which point an OPEC+ agreement announced in June 2024 will allow ""for gradual monthly increases"", Jadwa said.Aramco is the jewel of the Saudi economy and the main source of revenue for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to set the Gulf kingdom up for a prosperous post-oil future.The firm's profits help allow Saudi Arabia to finance flagship projects including NEOM, the futuristic mega-city being built in the desert, a giant airport in Riyadh and major tourism and leisure developments.The IMF said in April that, at current production levels, Saudi Arabia's fiscal break-even oil price would be $96.2 per barrel in 2024.Brent, the international benchmark, was trading at $76.43 per barrel on Tuesday after Monday's global stock market rout fuelled by US recession fears.Yet Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser told reporters that Aramco was still ""positive about the outlook for global oil demand"", pointing to ""strong"" demand from China.""The market in my view is overreacting and the fundamentals do not support the drop in prices that we are witnessing today,"" Nasser said.""I think the market is reading too much into the short-term responses to the news coming from the US with regards to the number of jobs.""The government's stake in Aramco, one of the world's biggest companies by market capitalisation, is around 81.5 percent.Aramco's initial public offering in 2019, the biggest flotation in history, raised $29.4 billion, and a secondary offering this year of nearly 1.7 billion shares fetched $12.35 billion.Aramco announced last year it would start paying a performance-based dividend in addition to its base dividend.In May, the firm announced base dividend payouts for the first quarter totalling $20.3 billion and a performance-linked dividend distribution of $10.8 billion to be paid in the second quarter.Those payments will be extended for another quarter and Aramco ""expects to declare industry-leading dividends of $124.2 billion in 2024"", Tuesday's statement said.""We have delivered market-leading performance once again, with strong earnings and cash flows in the first half of the year,"" Nasser said.""Leveraging those strong earnings, we continued to deliver a base dividend that is sustainable and progressive.""Aramco reported record profits in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices soaring, allowing Saudi Arabia to record its first budget surplus in nearly a decade.But the cash cow saw its profits drop by a quarter last year because of lower oil prices and production cuts, and profits in the first quarter of this year were down 14.5 percent.In January, Aramco said it had been instructed to abandon a plan to increase production capacity to 13 million barrels per day, up from its current level of 12 million bpd.Analysts said the surprise announcement could reflect a lack of confidence in demand, although Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said it was motivated by the transition to cleaner fuels.Saudi Arabia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060, a statement that has drawn intense scepticism from environmental activists.Aramco has vowed to achieve ""operational net-zero"" carbon emissions by 2050, which does not include the emissions from customers burning its products.Nasser told reporters on Tuesday that oil and gas demand ""will not peak any time soon given the vital role that hydrocarbons continue to play in the global economy"".","Saudi oil giant Aramco on Tuesday reported net profit of $29.07 billion in the second quarter.
