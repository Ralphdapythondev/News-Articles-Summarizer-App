During the meeting, conducted in Hindi, Mittal conveyed to the PM: ""I will fight in the marketplace, but I can't fight the government.""In response, Modi assured Mittal that the government would not favor either side and would act in the best interest of the country. He encouraged Mittal to compete in the marketplace, emphasizing that the government would remain impartial. Mittal expressed his gratitude and considered this meeting as a crucial turning point for Airtel.Also Read | Explained: How RBI managed to give the highest ever Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend payout to government ""He told me that this government will not tilt towards either side. Whatever is good for the country will be done. You fight in the marketplace. I don't have a view on that. But from the side of the government, you can be sure that the government will not take sides,"" Mittal said. ""And that was enough for me. I got up and thanked him... This was the turning point (for Airtel),” Mittal was quoted as saying.During the interview with the financial daily after Airtel surpassed the $100 billion market cap milestone on May 27, Mittal shared his recollection of a meeting with Modi. The company had overcome numerous challenges in its nearly three-decade history to reach this point.Also Read | 'On June 4, markets will...': PM Modi's big prediction for Sensex on Lok Sabha election results day Mittal expressed that the meeting with Modi provided him with an indescribable energy and inspiration. ""Sometimes you need an inspiration. I do that to my troops. I needed that from someone. There was a very strong special message (from the PM): Fight in the market. Here was a man telling me-who has himself fought against a lot of odds-that you do your work and be very reassured that this government is going to only do things that are good for the nation,"" he said.This encounter led Mittal to view the regulations, which he had previously considered unfavorable to Airtel , from a broader perspective. He realized that lower tariffs might have been advantageous for the government politically and could have helped democratize data services. The reassurance that there was no hidden agenda allowed him to see things differently.Airtel's market cap has grown by more than $80 billion in the past five years, from around $19 billion in 2019, which was less than the total investment in the business up to that point.Also Read | Relief for mobile users!

He sees Airtel's $100 billion market cap as a testament to India's current state, not just his company's success.He highlighted the influx of money, capital, and investments into the country, along with the rising stock market and massive valuations, as indicators of a stable, solid, and functional economy under a strong leader.",Bharti Airtel founder Sunil Bharti Mittal met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2018.

Adani Green risks missing targets: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-green-risks-missing-targets-report/articleshow/110577789.cms,"NEW DELHI: The renewable energy unit of billionaire Gautam Adani 's empire is at risk of missing key growth targets unless it resorts to a share issue to consolidate its finances, according to a report by London-based Snowcap Research .Adani Green Energy is falling short of its stated return targets, Snowcap said in a 51-page report on Thursday. The lower returns, coupled with rising debt-financing costs, mean the firm may not have sufficient funding to meet its 2030 renewable energy goal.The company ""can meet just 50% of its 50GW target funding requirement by 2030 without raising equity, despite claiming this target is 'fully funded',"" Snowcap said. It added that Adani Green isn't meeting a target announced in 2021 of returning 17% on capital through 2025. Based on Snowcap's analysis, Adani Green more likely delivered an 11-12% return on capital on projects completed over the past three years - in line with the company's peers - at a 9.5% cost of debt.A representative for Adani Green said the company ""categorically rejects"" the analysis published by Snowcap. ""The report is baseless, factually inaccurate, and contains analytical errors and false allegations, all intended to negatively impact"" the company's share price, the representative said, adding that the management stands by its public disclosures.Adani Green's shares fell over 2.2% after the report was published but erased some of those losses soon after.

Snowcap's criticism comes more than a year after the Adani Group was jolted by allegations brought by short-seller Hindenburg Research. The US-based firm's accusations of corruption and market manipulation initially wiped more than $150 billion off the Adani Group's market value. Adani has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and those stock losses have largely been recouped.Snowcap says it holds no positions in or against Adani Green, which is roughly 56% owned by units controlled by Adani.","Adani Green Energy is falling short of its stated return targets, Snowcap says.

""This (Jan-March quarter) was our eighth consecutive quarter of a positive ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) and we also have a cash balance of about Rs 1,000 crore,"" Agarwal said in a post on X, adding that the numbers are provisional. Ebitda is a metric of operational profitability.

Oyo is among a batch of late-stage startups that have been working towards reducing cash burn, building in operational efficiencies and achieving profitability. A global tech downturn and reset in startup valuations nudged companies to set their finances in order and chase prudent growth. Investors have been maintaining a cautious stance and only cutting cheques for companies which have at least been able to demonstrate a path to profitability.

Oyo recently withdrew its draft IPO papers for the second time and is negotiating with investors for a fundraise at a lower valuation. The fresh funding could be at a 70% drop from its peak valuation of $10 billion, TOI reported last week. Insiders claim that Oyo plans to refile IPO papers after refinancing its $450-million loan.

'Chinese astronauts set new record for spacewalk'

Chinese astronauts on the Tiangong space station completed a record-breaking spacewalk to enhance defenses against space debris, marking a milestone for China's manned space program.

NEW DELHI: After paving the way for joint ventures , such as, JSW-MG Motor India, govt is willing to give green light to Chinese companies to dilute their stakes in Indian ventures .While the decision will still be on “case-by-case” basis, with security concerns being paramount, it could also lead to Xiaomi and some of the other well-known Chinese entities expanding their presence in India, sources indicated.Since 2020, soon after the Covid-19 outbreak, govt has imposed checks on FDI from countries with land border with India — a move meant to check inflows from China — with tension at the Ladakh border resulting in even tighter scrutiny.Unlike earlier, when Chinese companies could come through the automatic route, all investments from across the border are now vetted by govt. As a result, Chinese auto makers, like EV giant BYD, have been denied permission to expand their capital base. In fact, BYD had also proposed a joint venture with Megha Engineering, now of electoral bonds fame, but the plan was rejected by the home ministry.In four years since the change in rules, govt has received around 450 applications from Chinese companies, of which 180 have been rejected. 70-odd got the nod, including some entities, which were seen to be crucial to ensure production of iPhones, for instance. Currently, around 200 proposals are pending with govt.Some of the Chinese companies, which are headquartered in other countries have, however, managed to beat the checks.Several experts have argued that govt needs to review the curbs, given that some of the Chinese entities are large players and have access to technology that can be used to manufacture in India. A dilution through the joint venture route, instead of earlier solo show by the Chinese companies may open the doors for expansion in several cases.Govt officials have argued that Chinese products and investments are subject to scrutiny not just in India but several other parts of the world. Because of import restrictions, several companies are now locating plants in geographies close to the market.As a result, during the Jan- March quarter, outbound FDI from China soared to an eight-year high of $33.5 billion, 13% higher than last year and the highest first quarter number since 2016, Bloomberg data showed.","After paving the way for joint ventures, such as, JSW-MG Motor India, govt is willing to give green light to Chinese companies to dilute their stakes in Indian ventures.

These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

In view of this, the committee recommends that Dr Kale be sent on forced leave,” states the order.In a separate order, the state govt suspended Taware and Halnor under the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules 1979. Till their suspension is in force, they are barred from medical practice and investing in any business. Ghatkamble, a Class IV employee, was also suspended on grounds of violating service rules.Mushrif told reporters in Mumbai that he recommended Taware's reinstatement as medical superintendent based on a letter from MLA Tingre. He said the dean should have informed him that the doctor hadn't been absolved of previous allegations against him.""A minister is not God to know everything. I was out of the country between May 11 and 24, and I got to know about the accident (and swapping of the underage driver's blood sample with someone else's) on my return,"" he said. Tingre could not be contacted for comment despite repeated attempts by TOI.At a presser earlier in the day, the hospital dean had been asked about Taware's reinstatement as medical superintendent last month despite a pending probe against him in the 2022 kidney racket case. Kale immediately pointed to minister Mushrif's remarks on the MLA's letter.“Dr Ajay Taware be reinstated as the medical superintendent because he is a professor, and the superintendent at the time was not a professor. As per NMC norms, he (Dr Taware) should be made the superintendent,” Kale said, quoting Mushrif's remarks. The dean said he signed an executive order reinstating Taware as medical superintendent based solely on the minister's recommendation in writing.On whether he informed Mushrif about Taware being investigated in the kidney racket, Kale said the govt already knew about the allegations against him.""I got to know about the arrests only after my superintendent called me on May 27 morning and through the media.

This significant launch, coupled with the recently introduced guidelines for the implementation of the Indian Space Policy 2023 by IN-SPACe and the new FDI regulations, will undoubtedly bolster global confidence in India's private space industry and its growing capabilities.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the AgnikulCosmos team for their achievement on social media platform 'X.'

Saudi Arabia set to launch $10 billion Aramco offer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/saudi-arabia-set-to-launch-10-billion-aramco-offer/articleshow/110553504.cms,"Economic Transformation

Saudi IPO Boom

Saudi Arabia is preparing to formally launch a secondary offering of shares in oil giant Aramco as soon as Sunday, a deal that could raise more than $10 billion and rank among the largest of its kind in recent years.The government plans to run a book-building process to take orders until next Thursday, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The deal has attracted informal interest from investors across the Mideast and Europe totaling over $10 billion, they said.The offering will likely be priced at a further discount of as much as 10% to the trading price, though that could narrow based on investor demand, some of the people said. That’s in line with secondary sales in Saudi Telecom Co. and Tadawul Group Holding, which operates the kingdom’s stock exchange.No final decisions have been made on the offering period. Terms of the deal, including its size, could still change, the people said. Aramco didn’t immediately respond to requests to comment.The offering is set to come days after Aramco’s stock dropped to the lowest level in over a year. The deal opening will coincide with an OPEC+ gathering on Sunday to discuss oil output policy, with most market-watchers expecting the group to maintain supply curbs. That would keep Saudi Arabia’s production near the lowest level in about three yearsThe kingdom is lining up a slate of banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc for the deal, Bloomberg News has previously reported. Local firms including Saudi National Bank are likely to be involved, people familiar with the matter said, while Moelis & Co. has been acting as a financial adviser to help pick underwriters.The follow-on offer would come almost five years after Saudi Arabia raised about $30 billion in Aramco’s IPO, which was the world’s largest ever stock sale.Some of the Wall Street banks likely to be involved in the secondary offering also worked on that listing, when they were paid just over $100 million. In comparison, banks including Goldman and JPMorgan split about $60 million from helping Peloton Interactive Inc. raise $1.2 billion in 2019.Low fees are common in the Middle East. For bankers, the share sale is a trade-off between working for less and the prospect of winning more business in the largest Gulf economy that’s in the middle of a multitrillion-dollar overhaul.Proceeds from the share sale will help fund big initiatives tied to that economic transformation. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans include a push into artificial intelligence, sports, tourism as well as projects such as the $1.5 trillion development of Neom.The deal comes at a crucial time for the kingdom, which holds an 82% stake in the $1.9 trillion firm. Crude oil prices are below the levels the government needs to balance its budget and Saudi Arabia has lagged behind its target of attracting more than $100 billion a year in foreign direct investment.The government needs oil near $100 a barrel to pay for its spending plans, according to the International Monetary Fund. But global oil benchmark Brent, currently at about $85, is forecast to be near $79 in 2025 and $75 the following year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Aramco’s oil production is also restricted by OPEC+ policy as the group’s de-facto leader Saudi Arabia tries to revive the market and boost prices. The company already has large unused output capacity, and earlier this year was ordered by the government to halt a further expansion of its capability.Against that backdrop, and amid questions about climate change and the future of fossil fuels, the offer will test global investors’ appetite. Aramco’s IPO had relied mostly on local investors, who’d faced pressure from the government to back the deal after most foreign money managers balked at valuations.While the company’s massive dividend payouts may now be a draw, its shares are expensive with price-to-earnings ratios almost 50% higher than Exxon Mobil Corp. and double Shell Plc’s.Any deal will also coincide with a resurgence in the Saudi market for new share sales — investors have plowed in a combined $176 billion in orders for four deals in recent weeks. That’s higher than the orders for Aramco’s 2019 IPO and is weighing on the kingdom’s stock market.The Tadawul All Share Index is trailing its emerging-market peers for the first time since the pandemic and has fallen almost 8% from its March peak — partly because of investors who’re holding on to cash to invest in the offerings.","Saudi Arabia is preparing to formally launch a secondary offering of shares in oil giant Aramco as soon as Sunday.

Boeing reaches deadline for reporting how it will fix aircraft safety and quality problems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-reaches-deadline-for-reporting-how-it-will-fix-aircraft-safety-and-quality-problems/articleshow/110551657.cms,"Boeing is due to tell federal regulators Thursday how it plans to fix the safety and quality problems that have plagued its aircraft-manufacturing work in recent years.The Federal Aviation Administration required the company to produce a turnaround plan after one of its jetliners suffered a blowout of a fuselage panel during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.Nobody was hurt during the midair incident. Accident investigators determined that bolts that helped secure the panel to the frame of the Boeing 737 Max 9 were missing before the piece blew off. The mishhas further battered Boeing's reputation and led to multiple civil and criminal investigations.Whistleblowers have accused the company of taking shortcuts that endanger passengers, a claim that Boeing disputes. A panel convened by the FAA found shortcomings in the aircraft maker's safety culture.In late February, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to improve quality and ease the agency's safety concerns. Whitaker described the plan as the beginning, not the end, of a process to improve Boeing.""It's going to be a long road to get Boeing back to where they need to be, making safe airplanes,"" he told ABC News last week.The FAA limited Boeing production of the 737 Max, its best-selling plane, although analysts believe the number the company is making has fallen even lower than the FAA cap.Boeing's recent problems could expose it to criminal prosecution related to the deadly crashes of two Max jetliners in 2018 and 2019. The Justice Department said two weeks ago that Boeing violated terms of a 2021 settlement that allowed it to avoid prosecution for fraud. The charge was based on the company allegedly deceiving regulators about a flight-control system that was implicated in the crashes.Most of the recent problems have been related to the Max, however Boeing and key supplier Spirit AeroSystems have also struggled with manufacturing flaws on a larger plane, the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing has suffered setbacks on other programs including its Starliner space capsule, a military refueling tanker, and new Air Force One presidential jets.Boeing officials have vowed to regain the trust of regulators and the flying public. Boeing has fallen behind rival Airbus, and production setbacks have hurt the company's ability to generate cash.The company says it is reducing ""traveled work"" - assembly tasks that are done out of their proper chronological order - and keeping closer tabs on Spirit AeroSystems.","The Federal Aviation Administration required the company to produce a turnaround plan after one of its jetliners suffered a blowout of a fuselage panel during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.

Why this US billionaire is planning a trip to Titanic despite submersible tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-this-us-billionaire-is-planning-a-trip-to-titanic-despite-submersible-tragedy/articleshow/110541580.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a bold and ambitious move, Ohio billionaire Larry Connor is planning a return expedition to the Titanic wreck, despite the tragic implosion of the Titan submersible last year. Connor, a real estate investor worth an estimated $2 billion, is partnering with Patrick Lahey, co-founder and CEO of Triton Submarines, to develop a new, state-of-the-art submersible for this daring mission.A spokesman for Connor confirmed to FOX Business that the duo aims to build the new submersible and embark on their expedition in the summer of 2026. Connor's determination to pursue this venture was solidified shortly after the Titan submersible disaster, which resulted in the loss of five passengers. In a call to Lahey just days after the incident, Connor expressed his desire to ""demonstrate to the world that you guys can do that,"" showcasing their capability to reach the depths of the Titanic safely.The planned vessel, named the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer, is a two-person submersible designed to dive to depths of 4,000 meters. Triton Submarines describes it as a ""high-performance, flexible platform designed specifically for professional applications."" The submersible is equipped with unique ""Gull Wings"" that raise its propulsion system away from the seabed, ensuring delicate marine life remains undisturbed during the descent.Connor shared his vision for the mission in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, saying, ""I want to show people that while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way."" His comments reflect a broader ambition to inspire confidence in deep-sea exploration and to highlight the potential benefits and wonders of underwater adventures.The Titan submersible tragedy that took place last June is still fresh in memory. The submersible suffered a catastrophic implosion just one hour and 45 minutes into its descent towards the Titanic, leading to the loss of all five passengers on board. The victims included UK billionaire Hamish Harding, OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, father-son pair Shahzada and Suleman Dawood, and French mariner Paul-Henry Nargeolet. This incident underscored the inherent risks associated with deep-sea exploration.Despite these risks, Connor and Lahey are committed to proving the feasibility and safety of constructing and operating a cutting-edge deep-sea exploration submarine. Their mission aims to validate that such ventures can be conducted safely and successfully, potentially setting new standards for underwater exploration and research.The Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer represents a significant technological advancement in submersible design and capabilities. If successful, this mission could pave the way for future explorations, expanding our understanding of the ocean's depths and the historical treasures it holds, such as the Titanic.","Ohio billionaire Larry Connor is planning a return expedition to the Titanic wreck, despite the tragic implosion of the Titan submersible last year.

This move comes after a court rejected the pay deal, and the upcoming vote is viewed as a test of Musk's leadership amidst concerns about his divided attention and controversial remarks affecting Tesla's reputation and sales.Tesla's board maintains that the compensation is essential to ensure Musk prioritises the company over his other ventures. The company is making a concerted effort to garner support for the pay package, which was originally approved in 2018 but later struck down by a judge who found that the directors involved in the negotiation appeared to be influenced by Musk.""Don't delay, vote today!"" Tesla said on Tuesday.The factory tour, led by Musk and other Tesla executives, will showcase the production lines for Cybertrucks and Model Ys in Texas on June 12, the day before the annual shareholders' meeting. Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, sees this as a ""last-ditch effort to try to charm retail investors.""Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, has advised Tesla shareholders to vote against the pay package, citing Musk's ""slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects.""Kristin Hull, founder of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, also voted against the package, emphasizing that Musk's focus is not solely on Tesla. ""His focus is clearly not just on Tesla,"" Hull said.Musk is also involved in various other ventures, including SpaceX, Twitter, and the recently launched AI company xAI.He owns around 13% of Tesla and has threatened to develop AI products outside the company if he doesn't achieve 25% voting power, which would require some of the stock options in the compensation deal.Building AI projects outside Tesla could negatively impact the company's valuation, which heavily relies on its AI capabilities in self-driving technology. Musk himself has said that without full self-driving, Tesla would be ""worth basically zero.""","Elon Musk is offering factory tours to 15 Tesla shareholders next month.
