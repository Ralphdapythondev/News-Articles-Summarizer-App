Maldives' polls today a test of President Mohamed Muizzu's India policy too,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maldives-sunday-polls-a-test-of-muizzus-india-policy-too/articleshow/109464698.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maldives will vote today in the country's 4th multi-party Parliamentary elections that will also put to the test for the first time President Mohamed Muizzu's hostile India policy , especially the decision to throw out Indian military personnel from the Indian Ocean archipelago.The Indian government is hoping that the main opposition and pro-India party - Maldivian Democratic party (MDP) - will win a majority, leading to an effective legislative oversight of executive power.Ahead of the voting, the leader of MDP and former foreign minister, Abdulla Shahid, told TOI his party is optimistic about winning as the Muizzu administration has failed in the past 5 months in both domestic and foreign policies and the Maldivian people are also seeing a regression of democratic values under his watch.Shahid said Muizzu came into office by ""mongering lies and hate"" and all development projects have been halted. ""Intimidation of employees in state owned companies has returned with a vengeance. Thousands of people from the opposition have been threatened with suspension and termination from their jobs. There are calls to restrict delivery of essential services based on political affiliation,"" said Shahid, also a former president of the UN General Assembly.""Waste and corruption is rampant. People are clearly seeing the regression of democratic values and principles under this administration. And we are confident that they will show their response in their vote tomorrow."" he added, while underlining the significance of strong legislative oversight.The supervision of the exercise of executive authority and ensuring it's accountable for the exercise of its powers is an important constituent of the law-making powers of the 93-member People's Majlis. While the MDP is hoping to retain majority, if not repeat its 2019 ""super majority"" of 65 seats that thinned out later because of large-scale defections, the ruling People's National Congress (PNC) alliance is stressing the significance of a majority in People's Majlis for the president's development initiatives. Significantly, Muizzu, whose party had benefited from MDP defections, ratified last week an anti-defection law which was passed by Parliament earlier this month.Often described as a pro-China leader, Muizzu defeated his MDP predecessor Ibrahim Solih last year in a presidential poll seen internationally as a face-off between India and China. His pro-China image has held since then as he jetted off to Beijing in January, becoming the first democratically elected Maldivian president to visit China before travelling to India, and signed a bagful of agreements, including for defence cooperation. This was preceded by his decisions to expel Indian troops, who operated Indian naval choppers for HADR activities, and to walk out of an agreement that allowed the Indian Navy to carry out hydrographic surveys in the Maldivian waters.In his campaign for the Parliamentary polls, Muizzu, who attained office on the back of an India Out campaign, has often tom-tommed his eviction of Indian military staff and made snide remarks about India like accusing his predecessor of taking orders from a ""foreign government"". A poor showing will likely be seen by many at least in India as a vote against his departure from what had come to be known as the Maldives' India First policy .",The Indian government is hoping that the main opposition and pro-India party - Maldivian Democratic party (MDP) - will win a majority.

APMC constructing a mall and five-star hotel is a scam: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apmc-constructing-a-mall-and-five-star-hotel-is-a-scam-sc/articleshow/109448949.cms,"NEW DELHI: Success in business may be most Gujarati’s alter ego but the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee of Surat took it to the next level by constructing a mall and a five-star hotel on its land, which was acquired by Gujarat govt in the 1960s for the benefit of farmers.A Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and J B Pardiwala castigated Surat APMC for frittering away land meant for welfare of farmers.“This is a scam of the highest proportion. How could the APMC have used the surplus land for a mall and five-star hotel? Which law authorized it to take such a decision?”Appearing for APMC, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said it was APMC’s land and the committee was free to put it to proper use for revenue generation. “How can the Gujarat HC direct the state to take over the land and property of APMC?” The hotel lease holder through senior advocate Nidhesh Gupta said there was no irregularity in the grant of the lease to run the hotel.The bench remained unconvinced and said the HC passed the extreme order considering the level of irregularity in allotment of APMC land for a hotel and a mall. It dismissed the appeal of both the APMC and the leaseholder of the hotel.The HC bench of CJ Sunita Agarwal and Aniruddha Mayee on March 27 had ordered the state to take possession of APMC’s five-star hotel constructed on the market yard’s land. It also ordered a public auction of the property and directed authorities to deposit the amount to the state's market funds.The bench ordered action against erring officials and APMC members responsible for construction of the luxurious hotel, which violated the aims and objectives of the market yard, for which the govt had acquired about 14,000 sq mt land.The HC ordered the director of Agriculture, Marketing and Rural Finance to conduct inspection of ‘Krushi Bazar’ on allegations by a petitioner that shops in the mall were leased for sale of items like jewellery and clothes. It ordered closure of all activities in the mall that were not for the welfare of the farmers.The SC’s view found broader acceptance in the December 2019 report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture. The Committee had severely criticized the way APMCs across India, except UP and Punjab, were managed and how they were acting in detriment to the benefit of farmers. It had recommended radical reform in APMC Act in the country.","A Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and J B Pardiwala castigated Surat APMC for frittering away land meant for welfare of farmers. “This is a scam of the highest proportion.

"Meet Vasuki Indicus, the ‘crocodile’ that was a 50ft snake",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-vasuki-indicus-the-crocodile-that-was-a-50ft-snake/articleshow/109414059.cms,"NEW DELHI/ROORKEE: A fossil found in 2005 from Gujarat’s Kutch and believed till now to be that of a giant crocodile has turned out to be of one of the largest snakes that ever existed on Earth .The discovery of ‘ Vasuki Indicus ’ by scientists of IIT , Roorkee could prove to be a “jackpot” of information of the evolutionary process, continental shift and India’s vital link to origin of many species, especially reptiles, researchers say.According to Sunil Bajpai, chair professor in IIT-Roorkee’s department of earth sciences, this serpent measuring between 11m (36ft) and 15m (49.22ft) could have been even longer than the now extinct Titanoboa, which once lived in Colombia. The closest relatives of ‘Vasuki Indicus’, the study finds, are Titanoboa and python.Researchers said the large size of ‘Vasuki Indicus’, named after the mythical king of serpents usually depicted round the neck of Shiva and in reference to its country of discovery, would have made it a slow-moving, ambush predator akin to an anaconda.The study named, ‘Largest known madtsoiid snake from warm Eocene period of India suggests intercontinental Gondwana dispersal”, was published in ‘Scientific Reports’ on ‘Springer Nature’ platform on Friday.Bajpai and post-doctoral fellow Debajit Datta from IIT-Roorkee said the fossil of this snake recovered from the Panandhro Lignite Mine in Kutch dates back to Middle Eocene period, approximately 47 million years ago. During their exploration, the researchers discovered 27 well-preserved vertebrae that appear to be from a fully grown reptile. Its length makes it the the largest known madtsoiid snake, which thrived during a warm geological interval with average temperatures estimated at 28°C.On the finding which is as much scientific as much accidental, Bajpai said: “The fossil was found in 2005, but since I have been working on different other fossils, it went on the backburner. In 2022, we started re-examining the fossil. Initially, due to its size, I thought it was of a crocodile. But then we realised it was of a snake and it turned out to be the biggest in its family and possibly one of the biggest and similar to Titanoboa.”The scientists claim that comparing its inter-relationship with other Indian and North African madtsoiids, ‘Vasuki’ represents a now-extinct relic lineage that originated in India. Subsequent India-Asia collision led to intercontinental dispersal of this lineage from the subcontinent into North Africa through southern Eurasia. “Though this discovery we have been able to show that we have some of the most remarkable snakes in India as well as other species,” said Bajpai, who along with his fellow reserachers had also discovered the fossil of a plant-eating dinosaur believed to be 167 million years old, in Jaisalmer last year.","'Vasuki Indicus' could prove to be a ‘jackpot’ of information of the evolutionary process, continental shift and India’s vital link to origin of many species, especially reptiles.

Additionally, Kejriwal is permitted to consume only 20 ml of oil per day in his meals.Furthermore, the Tihar administration mentioned that, according to a government circular, no referral can be made to any private hospital, despite Kejriwal's request for videoconferencing with his doctor.","Tihar jail submitted Delhi CM's health report to LG V K Saxena.

Three Jain couples to follow their kids into monkhood tomorrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-jain-couples-to-follow-their-kids-into-monkhood-tomorrow/articleshow/109465398.cms,"AHMEDABAD: Following their children's footsteps, three Jain couples will embrace monkhood at Sabarmati Riverfront on Monday. Bhavesh and Jinal Bhandari from Ahmedabad, Jaswant and Dipika Shah from Surat, and Sanjay and Beena Sadadiya from Mumbai are among 35 people who will take diksha under the guidance of Acharya Yogtilaksuri .Two years ago, the Bhandaris' children - daughter Vishwa (19) and son Bhavya (16) - renounced the material world to walk on the path of dharma.The happiness their children experienced after diksha inspired the couple to take the plunge. Leading a monastic life means the Bhandaris would have nothing to do with their property and business, worth over Rs 100 crore.A native of Sabarkantha, Bhavesh Bhandari recently made headlines when he donated food, clothes and cash during the grand procession held as part of the initiation ceremony. Dressed in finery, he and his wife rode an elephant covering the length of Himmatnagar city.""I started with the auto finance business and later ventured into real estate and automobile dealerships. I have about 20 bighas of land in Ahmedabad. My children first donned the white garments and sowed the seed of an austere life in my mind. When I discussed it with my wife, she said she too wanted to give up the life of comfort and luxury,"" said Bhavesh.""We have enjoyed everything that money could buy us. But money can only take you thus far. With my children choosing their paths, all that was left for me to do was accumulate more wealth and nothing else,"" Bhavesh added.Jaswant and Dipika Shah, residents of Mumbai's Bhayandar, will leave their property behind for their daughter. Their twin sons Arth & Ansh had taken diksha seven and two years ago, respectively. Jaswant's brother Girish had taken diksha 17 years ago. ""We want to follow in our sons' footsteps on path of asceticism,"" Jaswant said.The Sadadiyas are the last to be taking diksha in their family. ""Our entire family is now on the path of salvation. It will be a new experience, but I believe we will know what true happiness is,"" said Sanjay, a textile businessman.According to Jain acharyas , renunciation isn't just about shaving one's head and wearing white clothes. A person wanting to become a monk follows same routine each day, eats the same kind of food, walks barefoot and sleeps on ground. Monday's event will be one of the biggest diksha ceremonies to be held in recent times, according to community members.","Three Jain couples will embrace monkhood at Sabarmati Riverfront on Monday.

How many Bitcoin halving are left?

The world of cryptocurrency witnessed another significant event as Bitcoin underwent its latest ""halving"" on Friday, effectively halving the mining reward and potentially influencing the currency’s future market dynamics. This pre-programmed adjustment occurs every four years and is critical for managing Bitcoin's supply. Following the event, Bitcoin's price remained relatively stable at approximately $63,907.With the reduction in new Bitcoin production, various implications arise for miners and the overall market, stirring both concerns and expectations among investors and analysts.Here is all you need to knowBitcoin ""halving"" is an automatic adjustment to the reward miners receive for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Initially set to distribute 50 bitcoins per block, this reward halves every 210,000 blocks. The latest halving reduced the reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins per block. This mechanism ensures that the total supply of Bitcoin caps at 21 million, a design to introduce scarcity, akin to precious metals like gold.Miners face a direct impact from halving as their earnings from rewards drop by 50%, which can significantly affect their profitability. Given the high costs associated with mining—such as electricity and hardware—reduced rewards mean that only the most efficient mining operations can sustain profitability. This could lead to increased consolidation in the industry, where only key players survive, potentially increasing the centralization of mining operations.Historically, halving events have preceded substantial increases in Bitcoin’s price. For instance, post-2020 halving, Bitcoin's price surged nearly seven-fold by the following year. However, experts like Adam Morgan McCarthy caution that past performance may not reliably predict future results, and other market conditions also heavily influence prices. Analysts remain divided, with some predicting significant rallies and others cautioning that the effects of halving might already be priced into the market.Beyond its impact on mining and prices, halving is viewed as a measure to preserve Bitcoin's value over time by controlling inflation. This scarcity mechanism is crucial for Bitcoin’s proposition as 'digital gold'. However, the reduced supply can also exacerbate price volatility in response to fluctuating demand.Environmental impact directly related to bitcoin halving remains somewhat uncertain. However, it is a well known fact that crypto mining consumes a significant amount of energy, with operations relying on polluting sources.The profitability pressures could push miners towards cheaper, potentially less environmentally friendly energy sources unless countered by technological advancements and regulatory measures.A recent study conducted by the United Nations University and published in Earth's Future journal revealed that the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining across 76 countries in 2020-2021 was equal to the emissions generated by burning 84 billion pounds of coal or operating 190 natural gas-fired power plants. The study found that coal accounted for the majority of bitcoin's electricity requirements (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).There are expected to be 64 Bitcoin halvings before the 21 million cap is reached sometime around 2140 At that point, halvings will cease and the blockchain will stop issuing new tokens.(With inputs from agencies)","Bitcoin underwent its latest ""halving"" on Friday, effectively halving the mining reward.

"Trump cancels rally because of weather, proving the difficulty of balancing a trial and campaign",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-cancels-rally-because-of-weather-proving-the-difficulty-of-balancing-a-trial-and-campaign/articleshow/109469080.cms,"WILMINGTON, NC: Donald Trump had to cancel his first planned rally since the start of his criminal hush money trial because of a storm Saturday evening in North Carolina , an added complication that highlights the difficulty the former president faces in juggling his legal troubles with his rematch against President Joe Biden.Trump called into the rally site near the Wilmington airport less than an hour before he was scheduled to take the stage and apologized to a few thousand supporters who had gathered throughout the afternoon under initially sunny skies that later darkened with storm clouds.Speaking from his private plane, Trump cited lightning and the incoming storm in explaining that he would not be landing. He pledged to reschedule a ""bigger and better"" event at the same location ""as quick as possible.""The planned rally in the critical battleground of North Carolina was to cap a week in which Trump spent four days in a Manhattan courtroom sitting silent during jury selection while Biden was able to hold multiple campaign events in Pennsylvania, another key state in the November election.The cancellation denied Trump a fresh chance to amplify claims that his multiple pending indictments are an establishment conspiracy to take him down - and, by extension, squelch the voters who first elected him eight years ago.Now, instead of commanding attention on his own terms at one of his signature mass rallies, his next public appearance is almost certainly going to be Monday, back at the defendant's table for opening arguments in the first felony trial ever for an American president. And his campaign is left to decide when he next can be Trump the candidate instead of Trump the defendant.""I'm devastated that this could happen but we want to keep everybody safe,"" Trump said.The assembled voters expressed frustrations with the turn of events but made clear they understood. Many of them had spent hours ahead of the rally holding prime seats, patronizing food trucks and perusing a row of tents selling Trump memorabilia, including T-shirts featuring the former president's mug shot taken in Atlanta after his indictment on charges that he led a criminal conspiracy to overturn Biden's 2020 victory.""I've been with Donald Trump and I'm still with Donald Trump, but I'm disappointed he didn't show up,"" said Cheryl Lynn Johnson, who drove about two hours from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to attend what would have been her fourth Trump rally. ""I'm mad at Mother Nature, but I stand behind Trump.""Indeed, the audience was primed to validate Trump's strategy to use his mandated court time to his advantage by folding the proceedings into the same populist, anti-establishment arguments that first fueled his rise eight years ago.""It's political persecution, and if it were anybody else he wouldn't have to be dealing with it,"" said Christian Armstrong, a 28-year-old firefighter who lives in Wilmington and was attending his first Trump rally.LeeAnn Coleman, a 42-year-old who is in a family restaurant business, said, ""It's ludicrous that he's having to do this at all,"" rather than spend time focusing on ""all the problems he wants to fix.""Those arguments could have come from Trump himself.""They want to keep me off the campaign trail,"" the candidate-turned-defendant insisted earlier this week in Harlem, where he visited a neighborhood convenience store and addressed a throng of media outside after spending the day at his own jury selection. Rather than pursue violent criminals, he alleged, ""They go after Trump.""It is not clear when Trump's next campaign appearance will be. His New York trial could last more than a month, severely curtailing his freedom to see voters, fundraise and make calls, and additional court proceedings could follow later in the year. Trump aides have promised weekend rallies and events on Wednesdays, the one weekday that Trump's hush money trial is expected to be in recess. The former president's campaign also has promised additional weeknight appearances around New York, like his trip to Harlem.But there is no accounting for weather . The closest Trump came to assigning responsibility for the cancellation was to mention ""weather officials,"" but he did not question the decision during his brief remarks.Even with the cancellation, Trump's choice of venue underscored the importance of North Carolina as a presidential battleground. Trump won here by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Saturday would have been the second time in as many months that Trump visited the state. Biden has traveled to North Carolina twice this year; Vice President Kamala Harris has been four times.""The presidential race is going to run through North Carolina,"" said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, in a recent interview.North Carolina is one of seven states that both the Trump and Biden campaigns have said they will dedicate significant campaign resources to winning. Trump has insisted he will widen the map, even into his native New York, which is heavily Democratic. Most Republicans, though, agree that Trump will have a difficult path to an Electoral College majority if Biden were to win North Carolina's 16 electoral votes. Trump tacitly acknowledged North Carolina's status by tapping then-state Republican Chairman Michael Whatley to lead his effective takeover of the Republican National Committee.Biden's campaign has hired statewide North Carolina leadership and field organizers for offices across the state. That's on top of state party staff that began an organizing program last year ahead of municipal races and looking to this year's statewide contests, which include an open governor's race. Cooper is legally barred from seeking a third term.""We needed to build energy on the ground early,"" said state Democratic Chairwoman Anderson Clayton, noting that the last Democratic presidential nominee to win North Carolina - Barack Obama in 2008 - had organized the state in a hotly contested primary campaign that ramped up the previous year.Matt Mercer, spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, countered that Republicans have had veteran staffers on the ground since 2020, and now have a ticket with Trump and Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, that excites the GOP base. Trump has endorsed Robinson, the state's first Black lieutenant governor, calling him ""Martin Luther King on steroids.""Robinson was set to be on stage with Trump in Wilmington.Ahead of the scheduled rally, Democrats hammered the pairing for their opposition to abortion rights, calling them too extreme for North Carolina.Cooper predicted Biden's record - low unemployment, rising wages, stabilized inflation, infrastructure and green energy investments - and his support for abortion rights will resonate with a geographically and demographically diverse state.""Joe Biden did more in his first two years than most presidents hope to do in two terms,"" Cooper argued.Mercer said Republicans will answer with a family-first message around the economy and public safety.""Whether it's with sky-high inflation, the open southern border or the migrant crime crisis,"" he said, voters are ""fed up"" with Biden.Trump lost an opportunity Saturday to make that case himself. But for voters like Matt Mazak, a 32-year-old who described himself as an independent, the verdict already is in.""I want someone who is not going to go with the flow of D.C.,"" Mazak said. ""I'm not even saying Trump is the right answer. But he's the best we've got.""","Donald Trump cancels his first planned rally since the start of his criminal hush money trial.

Maternity leave can’t be denied during probation: Maharashtra tribunal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maternity-leave-cant-be-denied-during-probation-maharashtra-tribunal/articleshow/109469076.cms,"MUMBAI: Probation should not be an obstacle to a woman who wants to be a mother during the period, held Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal, quashing a 2015 state order denying maternity leave to a then 28-year-old assistant forest conservator in Mumbai. A probationer's seniority should not suffer if she wants to be a mother which is her basic human and natural right , held MAT.The state, being a welfare and progressive state, has guaranteed 180-day maternity leave to every woman employee, stated the MAT judgment pronounced on Friday by its member Medha Gadgil. Such leave is as much a right of the newborn to be with the mother as it is the mother's to be with the child, it held in an application filed last year by the woman, now a divisional forest conservator at SGNP. She had challenged the 2015 order.The forest department in Jan 2015 ""illegally"" regularised as ""extraordinary leave"" the 180 days of maternity and an additional 43 days of post-natal leave taken in 2013 by the public servant while on probation.In 2023, the state, failing to consider her maternity leave, held her probation had ended in March 2015 instead of mid-2014 and it cost her her seniority, argued her lawyer.Any probationer, though, must mandatorily complete the period of one or two years, held MAT, saying the solution lay in changing the method to compute the probation period. Probation can be extended for an employee's assessment only if the person's performance in the corresponding months on her resuming work is found ""unsatisfactory"", ruled MAT. If her work is satisfactory in the 180-day period after she resumes work post maternity, her seniority would be deemed from the end date of her originalprobation period , along with her batchmates, said MAT. Such a mechanism would ensure govt gets sufficient and legally mandated period to appraise the probationer and ""similarly valuable rights"" of a child to be with the mother and mother's to be with the child are protected, the judgment noted.The state cited recruitment rules of a three-year probation, including two years of training, to justify its actions.Maternity leave is statutory under Maternity Benefits Act, her lawyer had argued. ""Seniority of such female employees should not go below her batchmates on grounds of her maternity leave,"" MAT held and directed that her 180 days' leave be treated as maternity leave and 43 additional days as childcare leave.","Probation should not be an obstacle to a woman who wants to be a mother, says tribunal.

"Climate Change Blamed for Dubai Floods, Not Cloud Seeding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/climate-change-blamed-for-dubai-floods-not-cloud-seeding/articleshow/109408915.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: Many wondered whether it was cloud seeding - a weather modification technique to induce rains - that led to flooding of Dubai, but scientists involved in such projects in India categorically dismissed any link, and meteorologists and climatologists rather blamed climate change for the record precipitation in arid West Asia.Since parched UAE periodically conducts cloud seeding to increase level of its dwindling groundwater, extreme rainfall between Monday night and Tuesday evening raised questions on the artificial rain mechanism.The country received a record 255 mm of rain in less than 24 hours, flooding Dubai.Though it rained heavily in neighbouring Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well, Dubai in UAE faced the maximum impact.IIT Kanpur professor Sachchida Nand Tripathi, who is closely involved with the cloud seeding project in India said, there was no connection between cloud seeding and the floods in Dubai. “Seeding is tried at an early stage of storm development. In this case when the system progressed from the Gulf of Oman it was already an intensified storm. It is highly unlikely and unsafe to seed such systems. Seeding can at max contribute to 25% enhancement in rainfall. In this case the total rainfall was 25 cm. So even without seeding 20 cm of rainfall would have happened,” Tripathi toldEven distinguished climate scientist and former secretary in the ministry of earth science (MoES), Madhavan Rajeevan, dismissed the possibility of any link, saying cloud seeding cannot trigger such heavy rainfall and floods.Asked about likely reasons, he said, “This is absolutely a clear signal of climate change. It was a huge thunderstorm caused by a synoptic system which was moving across the Gulf region. With global warming there is now a tendency that if it rains, it rains very heavily. We should expect this kind of events more frequently in any part of the world and at any time.”Former chief of India Meteorological Department (IMD), K J Ramesh, too believed that cloud seeding was not the primary cause for the downpour. “Western disturbance-triggered extreme rainfall event development is the primary cause of the floods in the region,""he said.On its link with climate change, Ramesh said, “It is well known that any rain bearing system will become stronger under changing climate - global warming regime as warming enables atmospheric clouds to hold extra moisture and grow bigger and bigger leading to enhanced intensity of rain bearing systems.”Elaborating on the weather phenomena, he said, “Southward extension of passing westerly wave trough, supported by additional moisture feed from Arabian Sea, basically caused extreme weather events, causing unprecedented quantum of rainfall over not only UAE but also over Oman, north Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar.""Prior to this, a similar westerly wave gave heavy rainfall spells for two days over Afghanistan, leading to floods, thunderstorms and lightning over Pakistan”.On the UAE’s cloud seeding project, Ramesh said the country through its Rainfall Enhancing Experiment, launched in 2002, has been trying to carry out aircraft based cloud seeding as and when rain bearing weather systems develop over the surrounding regions. “Through such efforts, the cloud seeding team was able to enhance the quantum of rainfall up to 15% over and above the rainfall otherwise occurring any way naturally.”","The country received a record 255 mm of rain in less than 24 hours, flooding Dubai.

Indian-origin men involved in Canada's largest-ever gold and money heist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indian-origin-men-involved-in-canadas-largest-ever-gold-and-money-heist/articleshow/109415390.cms,"It was a brazen theft: thousands of gold bars and millions of dollars in bank notes stolen a year ago from Toronto's international airport.Canadian and US authorities said on Wednesday six people, including two Indian-origin men , have been arrested and three more are being sought in connection with what they called the largest gold heist in Canadian history - a cargo of over C$22 million ($16 million) in gold and currency.The arrests were announced after a long-year investigation under Project 24K. The suspects, including two Air Canada employees, forged an airway bill to steal a cargo arriving from Switzerland of C$20 million-worth 6,600 gold bars weighing 400 kg and C$2.5 million in foreign currency, police officials said. The gold was melted down and used to purchase illegal firearms. ""This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,"" said Nishan Duraiappah, chief of Peel police, responsible for law enforcement at Toronto airport .The gold theft appeared to be remarkably simple. The gold and cash arrived at the Toronto airport in a special container aboard an Air Canada flight from Switzerland on April 17, 2023, and it was moved to one of the airline's warehouses. The container held gold bars that were destined for a Toronto-based bank and bank notes bound for a currency exchange. About two hours later, a truck driven by a man who was arrested in Pennsylvania pulled up at the warehouse. The man carried a waybill - a document usually issued by a carrier with details about a shipment - that gave him access to the warehouse. It was actually a duplicate of a waybill, printed on an Air Canada printer, for a shipment of seafood that had been picked up a day earlier. The container with the gold bars and bank notes was loaded into the truck. Video recordings showed the truck travelling down Canada's busiest highway before eventually disappearing from sight in a rural area west of the city.Peel police officers were called early the next morning after an armoured truck of Brinks, an American cash handling company, arrived with the actual waybill for the shipment of gold and bank notes. Canada police said Wednesday that they believe the gold bars, which had serial numbers, were all melted down and that they had seized smelting pots. The only gold recovered, police said, was six bracelets made out of C$89,000 worth of gold.Air Canada employee Parmpal Sidhu, 54, from Brampton, Ontario, jewellery store owner Ali Raza, 37, from Toronto, Amit Jalota, 40, an Oakville, Ontario resident, Ammad Chaudhary, 43, from Georgetown, Ontario and Prasath Paramalingam, 35, from Brampton are among those that have been arrested. According to a PTI report, Sidhu and Jalota are of Indian origin. Police are searching for former Air Canada manager Simran Preet Panesar, 31, from Brampton as well as Archit Grover, 36, from Brampton and Arsalan Chaudhary, 42, from Ontario.Peel detective sergeant Mike Mavity said the truck driver that allegedly picked up the gold, Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old from Brampton, is currently in custody in the US. Sixty-five illegal firearms were found in his possession, two of which had been modified to have fully automatic capabilities.They were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada.

Third temporary channel opens for vessels to Baltimore port after bridge collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/third-temporary-channel-opens-for-vessels-to-baltimore-port-after-bridge-collapse/articleshow/109464112.cms,"BALTIMORE: A third temporary channel for boats to enter and depart the Port of Baltimore has opened, expanding further shipping access as collapsed sections of the Francis Scott Key Bridge are salvaged before the span can ultimately be rebuilt.The alternate channel, located to the northeast of the fallen bridge, is open to “commercially essential vessels ,” port officials announced late Friday.The new temporary path, with a controlling depth of 20 feet (6.1 meters), a horizontal clearance of 300 feet (91.4 meters) and a vertical clearance of 135 feet (41.2 meters), allows a greater variety of vessels to access the port while crews work to reopen the main channel, Coast Guard and port Capt. David O’Connell said in a news release.With the new channel open, about 15% of pre-collapse commercial activity will resume, O'Connell said. The first temporary channel opened April 1. The bridge collapsed early March 26 after it was struck by the cargo ship Dali.Officials hope to open a channel by the end of the month to allow most maritime traffic back into one of the East Coast’s busiest maritime transit hubs.Workers are laboring to remove thousands of tons of debris sitting atop the Dali, the cargo ship that veered off course and struck the 1.6-mile-long (2.57-kilometer-long) bridge. Six roadwork crew members on the bridge died. Two of their bodies have not been found.With massive cranes, workers so far have taken away about 1,300 tons (1,179 metric tons) of steel. The debris on the stationary ship must be removed before the vessel can be returned to the port.","A third temporary channel for boats to enter and depart the Port of Baltimore has opened.

"The House votes for possible TikTok ban in the US, but don't expect the app to go away anytime soon",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-house-votes-for-possible-tiktok-ban-in-the-us-but-dont-expect-the-app-to-go-away-anytime-soon/articleshow/109464312.cms,"WASHINGTON: The House passed legislation Saturday that would ban TikTok in the United States if the popular social media platform's China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year, but don't expect the app to go away anytime soon.The decision by House Republicans to include TikTok as part of a larger foreign aid package, a priority for President Joe Biden with broad congressional support for Ukraine and Israel, fast-tracked the ban after an earlier version had stalled in the Senate.A standalone bill with a six-month selling deadline passed the House in March by an overwhelming bipartisan vote as both Democrats and Republicans voiced national security concerns about the app's owner, the Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd.The modified measure now goes to the Senate after negotiations that produced a compromise.Even if the legislation becomes law, though, the company would have up to a year to find a buyer and would likely try to challenge the law in court, arguing it would deprive the app's millions of users of their First Amendment rights. Court challenges could significantly delay the timeline set out by Congress or block the law from going into effect.The company lobbied hard against the legislation, pushing the app's 170 million US users - many of whom are young - to call Congress and voice opposition. But the ferocity of the pushback angered lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where there is broad concern about Chinese threats to the US and where few members use the platform themselves.""We will not stop fighting and advocating for you,"" TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in a video that was posted on the platform last month and directed toward the app's users. ""We will continue to do all we can, including exercising our legal rights, to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you.""The bill's quick path through Congress is extraordinary because it targets one company and because Congress has taken a hands-off approach to tech regulation for decades. Lawmakers had failed to act despite efforts to protect children online, safeguard users' privacy and make companies more liable for content posted on their platforms, among other measures.The TikTok ban reflects widespread concerns from lawmakers about China.Members of both parties, along with intelligence officials, have worried that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over American user data or direct the company to suppress or boost TikTok content favorable to its interests. TikTok has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the Chinese government and has said it has not shared US user data with Chinese authorities.The US government has not publicly provided evidence that shows TikTok shared US user data with the Chinese government or tinkered with the company's popular algorithm, which influences what Americans see.The company has good reason to think a legal challenge could be successful, having seen some success in previous legal fights over its operations in the US. In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued.In 2020, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights. His administration brokered a deal that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok. The sale never went through for a number of reasons; one was China, which imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers.Dozens of states and the federal government have put in place TikTok bans on government devices. Texas' ban was challenged last year by The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which argued in a lawsuit that the policy was impeding academic freedom because it extended to public universities. In December, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state.Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have backed the app. ""Congress cannot take away the rights of over 170 million Americans who use TikTok to express themselves, engage in political advocacy, and access information from around the world,"" said Jenna Leventoff, a lawyer for the group.Since mid-March, TikTok has spent $5 million on TV ads opposing the legislation, according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. The ads have included a range of content creators, including a nun, extolling the positive impacts of the platform on their lives and arguing a ban would trample on the First Amendment. The company has also encouraged its users to contact Congress, and some lawmakers have received profanity-laced calls.""It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the US economy, annually,"" said Alex Haurek, a spokesman for the company.Nadya Okamoto, a content creator who has roughly 4 million followers on TikTok, said she has been having conversations with other creators who are experiencing ""so much anger and anxiety"" about the bill and how it's going to impact their lives. The 26-year-old, whose company ""August"" sells menstrual products and is known for her advocacy around destigmatizing menstrual periods, makes most of her income from TikTok.""This is going to have real repercussions,"" she said.",The House passed a bill that would ban TikTok in the United States if the popular social media platform's China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year. The modified measure now goes to the Senate after negotiations that produced a compromise. The company would have up to a year to find a buyer and would likely try to challenge the law in court.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109464321,imgsize-30002,width-400,resizemode-4/109464321.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Maldives, opposition parties are calling for an investigation and possible impeachment of President Mohamed Muizzu in response to a leaked report dating back to 2018 alleging corruption.The parliamentary elections for the Majlis are scheduled for Sunday, ahead of which, the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and President Muizzu 's People's National Congress (PNC) have engaged in trading barbs and accusations against each other.The political turmoil began when an anonymous individual using the handle 'Hassan Kurusee' shared leaked intelligence reports on social media, which included documents from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Maldives Monetary Authority and the Maldives Police Service. These reports purportedly linked President Muizzu to financial misconduct, citing irregularities in money transfers to his personal bank account and suggesting possible involvement with politically exposed individuals, embezzlement, structured transactions, and the use of corporate entities to conceal fund origins.The allegations sparked a firestorm of reactions on social media, with demands from the MDP and People's National Front (PNF) for an official investigation into the matter. Former vice president Dr Mohamed Jameel Ahmed went a step further, calling for President Muizzu's impeachment based on the leaked intelligence reports. Jameel emphasized the importance of accountability in governance and urged President Muizzu to cooperate with independent investigations into the allegations, including those related to the Ras Male' development project and alleged excessive spending on public relations.President Muizzu responded to the corruption allegations on Tuesday, asserting that the opposition's attempts to implicate him were baseless and driven by desperation. He denied any wrongdoing and accused the opposition of leaking the reports to tarnish his reputation.""The same allegations had been made during his campaigns for mayor and President,"" he said adding, the response would also be the same as before.""While you attempt to pin something on me like this, you couldn't do it before and you can't do it now.

Prince Harry marks US residency start on day of Frogmore Cottage exit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-harry-marks-us-residency-start-on-day-of-frogmore-cottage-exit/articleshow/109399914.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: On June 29 last year, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle removed the last of their belongings from Frogmore Cottage , signaling the end of their residence in the UK . This day, as new business documents revealed, also marks the date Prince Harry formally declared his residency in the United States.The transition comes in the wake of an order by King Charles, which left Harry ""deeply wounded,"" as he and Meghan were asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage—a property gifted by the late Queen Elizabeth.Royal experts suggest that Harry's choice of this significant date to mark his formal move to the US was deliberate, reflecting his acknowledgment of a new life away from royal duties.Frogmore Cottage had served as the couple’s UK base even after their move to California in 2020. The change was officially recorded in filings at Companies House for Harry's eco travel venture, Travalyst, where his ‘New Country/State Usually Resident’ is now listed as the USA, a Daily Mail report said.This relocation raises substantial questions about Prince Harry’s ability to serve as a Counsellor of State—an office requiring a UK domicile. Dr Craig Prescott, a constitutional law expert, describes the scenario as ""uncharted waters,"" given the legal framework was not designed to address a senior royal family member choosing to live abroad.The implications extend beyond his royal duties, as Harry has also indicated considering US citizenship, which could necessitate renouncing his royal titles. ""The thought has crossed my mind but not a high priority right now,"" Harry stated in a February interview on Good Morning America.The disclosure of Harry's residency status has also sparked calls for the Biden administration to release his visa records, fueled by a statement from the American ambassador to London ensuring that Harry would not face deportation under the current administration.The recent developments highlight ongoing family tensions and the changing dynamics within the British royal family, as they navigate the practical and legal complexities of Prince Harry’s new life in the United States.","On June 29 last year, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle removed the last of their belongings from Frogmore Cottage.

UK PM Rishi Sunak faces leadership test as Tories trail Labour in new poll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-faces-leadership-test-as-tories-trail-labour-in-new-poll/articleshow/109398085.cms,"Key findings from the poll include:

NEW DELHI: A comprehensive poll conducted by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft has revealed that the Conservative Party is trailing behind Labour on every significant political issue as articulated by the voters. This includes traditional Conservative strongholds such as defence, tax, and immigration, with an astonishing 35-point deficit on matters related to the NHS.As per a Daily Mail report, despite the overwhelming support for Labour across these issues, 45% of the electorate expressed reservations about a government led by Labour's Sir Keir Starmer. This sentiment places considerable pressure on current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to avert a potential electoral defeat.The poll, which surveyed over 5,400 voters, indicates that Labour holds a commanding 21-point lead over the Conservatives, with potential results translating into a historic landslide victory for Labour if the trend holds in the upcoming general .On the NHS and social care, 49% of respondents favored Labour, compared to only 14% for the Conservatives.Labour also leads on the cost of living with a 41:19 margin, and on the economy and jobs with a 37:23 margin.Even on immigration, traditionally a Conservative stronghold, Labour leads by 34:20.Addressing the issue of leadership, only 13% of respondents felt that the Conservative Party's values align closely with those of the public, and a mere 11% believe theTories will win the upcoming election. Meanwhile, 34% of respondents see Sir Keir Starmer as the preferable Prime Minister over Sunak, who garnered only 19% support.The poll also touched on controversial policies such as the plan to deport Channel migrants to Rwanda, which is seen as critical to galvanizing Conservative support. Yet, public opinion is divided: 38% support the scheme, whereas 42% echo Sir Keir’s opposition, the Daily Mail report said.Lord Ashcroft highlighted the dilemma faced by Sunak, whether to delay the election in hopes of a political turnaround or to proceed as planned. He noted, ""We can surely understand why a beleaguered PM would want to put off calling an election for as long as possible in the hope that something might turn up. But what if things just keep getting worse?""As the political landscape shifts, the Conservatives face the challenge of not only retaining their base but also winning back those who have shifted their allegiance to other parties, a task made daunting by the widespread preference for Labour across almost all policy fronts.","A comprehensive poll conducted by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft has revealed that the Conservative Party is trailing behind Labour on every significant political issue.

How Russia's 'grain diplomacy' is reshaping global trade dynamics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-russias-grain-diplomacy-is-reshaping-global-trade-dynamics/articleshow/109439133.cms,"NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin’s strategic use of ' grain diplomacy ' is reshaping global trade dynamics , potentially shifting the balance of agricultural market power more in favor of Moscow. Amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions , the European Union has found itself grappling with the implications of Russia 's maneuvering, which includes significant increases in Russian grain exports.According to recent actions by the European Commission, tariffs on certain Russian and Belarusian agricultural goods have been proposed to curb the level of EU imports. These measures reflect the broader struggle to counteract Russia's expanding influence in the global grain market, which has seen a dramatic uptick following the initial spike in prices due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.While the Black Sea grain deal initially facilitated Ukrainian grain exports, easing some market pressures, Russia's subsequent suspension of this agreement and the booming export of Russian wheat to record levels have added new layers of complexity to international trade relations. The situation has led to a $13.4 billion current account surplus for Russia in March, bolstering its economic position significantly, an Asia Times report said.Furthermore, the discussion in the EU about extending the suspension of import duties on Ukrainian agricultural exports until June 2025 has sparked controversy among European farmers, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. These farmers argue that suspended duties lead to unfair competition from cheaper Ukrainian imports.Amid these developments, the proposal of a Brics grain exchange by Putin aims to challenge the Western-dominated grain pricing system and could redefine the global agricultural trade landscape. This move could strengthen Russia's geopolitical and economic influence across the BRICS nations, which now include significant global players in grain production and consumption.The influence of Russian grain diplomacy extends beyond mere economics. In Africa, where many countries rely heavily on Russian and Ukrainian wheat, Russia has initiated a program to ship free grain to several nations, enhancing its diplomatic ties and presence on the continent.For traditional grain-exporting countries like the US and Australia, the rise of a Russia-led Brics grain exchange represents a formidable challenge. It compels these nations to reassess their agricultural policies and explore new markets to maintain their global market shares amidst increasing competition.","Russian President Vladimir Putin’s strategic use of'grain diplomacy'is reshaping global trade dynamics.

China's Urban Population Facing Risk of Land Subsidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-urban-population-facing-risk-of-land-subsidence/articleshow/109451428.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent study has revealed a concerning trend in China, where about one-third of the urban population is facing the risk of land subsidence. This issue however is not unique to China but is seen as a global phenomenon .The study predicts that China's urban areas below sea level could triple by the year 2120, potentially impacting a significant number of residents, ranging from 55 to 128 million.Using satellite data, a research team that included experts from the University of East Anglia in the UK examined 82 cities in China, such as Shanghai and Beijing, which are home to nearly 700 million people.The team discovered that 45% of the urban land area studied is sinking, with 16% experiencing a rapid rate of subsidence at 10 millimetres per year. Notable hotspots for this phenomenon were identified in Beijing and Tianjin, a coastal city.The study suggests that around 270 million urban residents could be affected by land subsidence, with almost 70 million experiencing rapid sinking of 10 millimetres or more annually.The researchers warned that this subsidence is primarily driven by human activities in cities, which can exacerbate climate change and sea-level rise, posing a particular threat to coastal cities like Tianjin.The findings, published in the journal 'Science', speaks about the importance of factoring in land sinking when developing adaptation and resilience plans.Not accounting for land sinking in adaptation and resilience plans now could potentially risk destruction of lives and infrastructure in the coming years, they pointed out.","Study predicts that China's urban areas below sea level could triple by the year 2120.

Dubai floods expose weaknesses to a rapidly changing climate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-floods-expose-weaknesses-to-a-rapidly-changing-climate/articleshow/109455484.cms,"The heavy rains that flooded Dubai this week halted air traffic, damaged buildings and streets — and left climate experts and common citizens asking whether one of the world’s hottest and driest cities should be better prepared for extreme storms .Weather forecasters knew days in advance that a major storm was heading for the United Arab Emirates and authorities issued warnings asking citizens to stay home.Yet its largest city Dubai was still brought to a halt this week, with one of the worst rain events in decades flooding streets, homes and highways.“Stormwater management systems were historically deemed an ‘unnecessary cost’ due to the limited rainfall” in the UAE, said Karim Elgendy, an associate fellow at the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House. “As the variability of rainfall increases across the region and as the likelihood of such events rises, the economic case for such systems becomes stronger.”Human-caused climate change is making extreme weather events like heat and rain more intense, frequent and harder to predict. The Middle East is forecast to face higher temperatures and a decline in overall rainfall, according to long-term scientific projections. But these very arid places will also experience storms that drop unprecedented rain, according to researchers. That’s forcing governments to consider whether to adapt to rare but destructive events — and how.Representatives for the UAE government didn’t immediately reply to a written request for comment.“It’s a real tradeoff in thinking about the cost and the opportunity costs,” said Linda Shi, an assistant professor specializing in urban climate adaptation at Cornell University in the US. “These events are likely to be erratic and unpredictable.”The UAE was battered on Tuesday by its heaviest downpour since records began in 1949. Scientists and weather forecasters attribute the storm to a large amount of moisture rising from warming seas to the atmosphere, before falling as rain over to the Arabian Peninsula.El Niño, the climate phenomenon that makes seas warmer and alters weather patterns globally, may have affected the storm. Climate change can’t be ruled out as a factor, though more detailed studies are needed to establish its exact influence, several climatologists and forecasters told Bloomberg Green.“While massive floods like this have occurred in the past, the huge scale and intensity of the rainfall that caused it are exactly what we are seeing more of in our warmer world,” said Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading in the UK. “With so much rain falling all at once, even carefully designed drainage systems will struggle to cope.”The floods drew immediate attention to the UAE’s cloud-seeding program, which involves injecting particles into clouds that can influence rainfall. But it will take “significant data analysis” to ascertain the role, if any, it played in making the rains more extreme, according to Auroop Ganguly, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Northeastern University in Boston. “Often major floods in a city relate to urban drainage and related infrastructures,” he said.Dubai and the UAE more broadly were unprepared for such a large amount of water falling over such a short period. Drainage systems quickly proved insufficient to absorb the deluge. Underground garages completely flooded, with water flowing into streets, highways and homes.Tankers were deployed to pump water from streets once the storm passed, but some communities, lakes and local football grounds remained waterlogged days later. The impacts continue to ripple outward. Shelves in some local supermarkets were still empty on Thursday evening. Schools were shut for four days and government employees were asked to work from home where possible. Dubai’s international airport said Friday afternoon it was allowing departures to operate but it was limiting the number of inbound flights for the next 48 hours.“Cities in arid regions may be especially ill-prepared for heavy rain events because buildings, landscapes and infrastructure have not been designed with drainage capacity as a primary concern,” said Zachary Lamb, an assistant professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of California at Berkeley in the US. “Climate change is unsettling long-held assumptions about landscape and climate conditions that have informed the design and planning of buildings and cities for generations.”Dubai is not alone in facing that problem. Last year, a superstorm burst dams in Libya, causing floods that wreaked havoc in the city of Derna and killed at least 5,000 people. Parts of Beijing were also submerged last year after the Chinese capital was battered by the heaviest rainfall in 140 years of weather records. The flooding washed away homes and caused dozens of fatalities.“Dubai can only prepare for what it sees as being within the range of probability for the future,” said Lisa Dale, a climate adaptation specialist at Columbia University in the US. “Predictions for future weather patterns foundationally rely on past weather patterns, leaving many governments unprepared for climate change impacts that are not historically common.”","Dubai and the UAE more broadly were unprepared for such a large amount of water falling over such a short period. “It’s a real tradeoff in thinking about the cost and the opportunity costs,” said Linda Shi, an assistant professor specializing in urban climate adaptation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109455475,imgsize-51928,width-400,resizemode-4/109455475.jpg"
