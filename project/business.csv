(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Devyani Khobrogade, the Indian ambassador to Cambodia , on Sunday grabbed eyeballs on social media by dressing as a ' Khmer Apsara ' to extend New Year wishes to the Cambodian people.The photoshoot showcasing her elegant attire has been circulating widely on the internet.The Indian Embassy in Cambodia shared on X, ""Ambassador Devyani Khobragade has a deep admiration for Khmer culture and tradition.Embracing the spirit of Khmer New Year, she elegantly dressed as a Khmer Apsara, embodying the rich bond of our civilizations. Wishing all our Cambodia friends a joyous Khmer New Year celebration.""Khobrogade, an Indian Foreign Service officer since 1999, has previously served in various Indian missions, including Berlin, New York, Islamabad, and Rome. However, her tenure in New York was marked by controversy when she was arrested on visa fraud charges and accused of providing a ""false statement"".Additionally, allegations surfaced claiming she paid her domestic help below the minimum wage in the United States, which she strongly denied as ""false and baseless."" The charges were later dismissed by a US court, citing diplomatic immunity.The incident strained India-US relations as India refused to waive Khobrogade's diplomatic immunity despite US requests.Consequently, Khobrogade returned to India, and New Delhi responded by downgrading the privileges of certain US diplomats in the country.In retaliation, the US withdrew one of its diplomats from India, marking a tense period in the diplomatic relations between the two nations.","The photoshoot showcasing her elegant attire has been circulating widely on the internet.

The accused officials are said to have diverted illegal gains to themselves and falsified accounts to avoid detection.Sisodia was arrested by CBI on February 26 and ED on March 9 last year in connection with these allegations. He resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28, 2023.Earlier, while opposing the regular bail plea of Sisodia, ED said that there was no delay on the part of the prosecution, rather, the delay was caused by the accused persons by filing frivolous applications in the excise policy case, extending his judicial custody till April 18.However, Sisodia's counsel cited in his bail plea a delay in trial. It was argued that trial proceedings are going at a snail's pace.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia's request for interim bail to campaign in general elections.

"DoT to consult Trai's on satcom spectrum allocation, licensing process",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/dot-to-consult-trais-on-satcom-spectrum-allocation-licensing-process/articleshow/109290243.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is set to consult with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) regarding the allocation of spectrum and licensing for satellite communication (satcom) services. Sources indicate that DoT will seek Trai 's recommendations on pricing and methodology for spectrum allocation, as well as clarify the scope of services that satcom companies with administratively allocated spectrum can offer.Trai had previously initiated a consultation on the assignment of spectrum for space-based communication services in April 2023 but returned the reference to DoT following the announcement of the new Telecommunication Act. Satcom technology enables internet connectivity in remote areas or challenging terrains, and several companies, including Bharti Group-backed OneWeb , Reliance Group Jio Satcom , and Elon Musk-owned Starlink, have shown interest in providing these services in India.""DoT will seek views of Trai on pricing and methodology to allocate spectrum for space based communication services. It may also look to fine-tune existing licences to bring in full clarity on the kind of services that satcom companies with administratively allocated spectrum can provide,"" said a source, who did not wish to be named.OneWeb and Jio Satcom have already been issued GMPCS (satellite telephony) and VSAT licenses, while Starlink has applied for a permit to commence satcom services in India. Starlink currently dominates the satcom space with a constellation of 4,000 low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, while OneWeb has over 600 LEO satellites.The source also highlighted the need to fine-tune VSAT licenses, as their current norms are not entirely aligned with the provisions of the new Telecommunication Act. The Act allows satellite communication companies to obtain spectrum without auction for point-to-point communications. However, the provisions permitting VSAT service operators to provide internet services to multiple independent subscribers may be interpreted differently than intended in the Telecommunication Act 2023.""Hence, there is a need felt to fine-tune licences for satcom services. A decision will be taken based on Trai's recommendation on the permits that should be issued to satcom service providers,"" the source said.","The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is set to consult with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) regarding the allocation of spectrum and licensing for satellite communication (satcom) services.

Passport portfolios: Why many rich Americans are considering life abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/passport-portfolios-why-many-rich-americans-are-considering-life-abroad/articleshow/109290997.cms,"NEW DELHI: In an increasingly volatile and uncertain world, wealthy Americans are taking significant steps to safeguard their future financial stability by seeking second citizenships . A global law firm specializing in investment migration and citizenship consulting, Henley & Partners, has observed a notable trend among high-net-worth individuals aiming to develop "" passport portfolios ."" This strategy allows them to hedge against potential upheavals by having the option to relocate should the need arise.Dominic Volek, executive and group head of private clients at Henley, emphasized the importance of having a backup plan, stating, ""The U.S. is still a great country, it's still an amazing passport, but if I'm wealthy, I would like to hedge against levels of volatility and uncertainty."" This sentiment reflects a broader understanding among the affluent that diversification should extend beyond investments to include citizenship and residency, ensuring they are not tied down to a single country's fortunes, a CNBC report said.The US passport, which currently ranks sixth on the Henley & Partners' passport index, allows Americans visa-free access to 189 countries. However, holders of the world's top-ranked passports—such as those from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and Spain—enjoy even greater freedom, with visa-free access to 194 countries. This discrepancy highlights the tangible benefits that a second citizenship can provide in terms of global mobility .The trend is not limited to the wealthy; more Americans across various socioeconomic backgrounds are exploring options for living abroad. Jennifer Stevens, executive editor at International Living, noted an increase in interest among Americans concerned about the future in the U.S., investigating alternatives for a more affordable and relaxed lifestyle overseas, the CNBC report added.Recent surveys underscore the growing desire among Americans to relocate; a Monmouth University Polling Institute survey revealed that over a third of Americans would like to live in another country, a significant increase from previous years. Patrick Murray, the director of Monmouth's polling institute, suggested that the partisan political discord in recent years might be contributing to this heightened desire to emigrate.As wealthy Americans and others look abroad for security and quality of life, the concept of citizenship diversification emerges as a critical component of their contingency planning, reflecting broader concerns about political, economic, and social stability in the United States.","Law firm Henley & Partners has observed a notable trend among high-net-worth individuals aiming to develop "" passport portfolios"" This strategy allows them to hedge against potential upheavals by having the option to relocate should the need arise.

"Should marijuana be legal for medical, recreational use? What Americans say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/should-marijuana-be-legal-for-medical-recreational-use-what-americans-say/articleshow/109274816.cms,"Here's an overview of the key findings:

Key findings:

Demographic differences in legalization views:

Perceived impacts of legalization:

As the US continues to see a shift in the legal landscape for marijuana, with many states legalizing it for medical or recreational use, Pew Research Center has released new findings on Americans' attitudes and experiences with marijuana.High support for legalization : About 90% of Americans believe marijuana should be legal in some form, either for medical only (32%) or both medical and recreational uses (57%).Only 11% believe it should not be legal at all. This sentiment has remained relatively stable over the past five years.Age: Support is lowest among those 75 and older, with only 31% backing legalization for both medical and recreational use. This contrasts with 71% of those under 30.Political Affiliation: 42% of Republicans support full legalization, versus 72% of Democrats. More conservative individuals within both groups are less likely to support.Race and Ethnicity: Hispanic and Asian Americans show lower support (45% each) compared to Black (65%) and White (59%) adults.Growing General Support: Support for legalization has surged over two decades. In 2023, 70% supported legalization, up from around 30% in 2000.Usage Trends : 50.3% of US adults have used marijuana at least once, though only 23% used it in the past year and 15.9% in the past month.Economic: 52% see legalization as economically beneficial, 17% disagree, and 29% see no impact.Criminal justice: 42% believe legalization makes the criminal justice system fairer, 18% see a negative impact, and 40% see no change.Drug use: 27% think legalization reduces the use of drugs like heroin, while 29% believe it increases it, and 42% see no effect.Community safety: 21% say it increases safety, 34% disagree, and 44% see no impact.Support for reduced penalties: Two-thirds of adults favor releasing those jailed for marijuana only, and 61% support expunging these offenses from criminal records.State legalization status: As of March 2024, 24 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for both medical and recreational use.This research highlights the complex and evolving relationship between American society and marijuana as legal and societal perceptions continue to change.","90% of Americans believe marijuana should be legal in some form.

"Battleground Pennsylvania: Trump holds rally, Biden plans tax speech as rematch heats up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/battleground-pennsylvania-trump-holds-rally-biden-plans-tax-speech-as-rematch-heats-up/articleshow/109269816.cms,"PHILADELPHIA: Former US President Donald Trump heads to the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday for a rally and a fundraiser just days before he is set to go on trial in New York over an alleged hush money scheme.He will be closely followed by President Joe Biden , who will make three Pennsylvania stops next week, speaking first in his hometown of Scranton about his push to reform the US tax code.With 19 electoral votes - one of the highest counts among all 50 states - and voters that swing between backing Democrats like Biden and Republicans like Trump, Pennsylvania is a top prize in the 2024 presidential and is likely to see many more visits in coming months.Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020 by less than 1.5%, or roughly 80,000 votes, after Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by less than 45,000 votes in 2016. State opinion polls taken in March swing from showing Biden with a 10-percentage-point lead to Trump up 4 points, election data site FiveThirtyEight shows.Democrats are betting on a strong turnout in Philadelphia and its surrounding suburbs, a region that accounts for 33% of all voting registrations, to offset losses throughout much of the rest of the state. Trump and Republicans are looking to run up huge margins in less populous, largely white counties to offset urban votes.Biden, who has been to Pennsylvania four times so far this year, will also travel to the Pittsburgh area and Philadelphia over three days, the White House said on Friday.Trump is expected to be in Manhattan on Monday for the beginning of his first criminal trial, a case involving hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. The trial could last several weeks. Trump's Saturday rally at Schnecksville Fire Hall targets the Lehigh Valley, a mix of Rust Belt cities, sprawling suburbs and rural towns. It includes Northampton County, one of two counties Biden flipped in 2020, which has long been a reliable bellwether of statewide success.""If you win Northampton County, you are likely to win the state. It's that important of a location,"" Chris Borick, a political science professor at Pennsylvania's Muhlenberg University, said of Trump's rally.The former president will attend a fundraiser before his rally in Bucks County, another bellwether region that Biden narrowly won in 2020. The event is hosted by Jim Worthington, a wealthy gym owner who has pressured Trump to stop criticizing mail-in voting. Roughly 200 people are expected, and the event should generate several million dollars, according to two sources familiar with the event.It will be a ""razor-thin race,"" Borick predicted.SENATE RACE , POPULATION DECLINESPennsylvania is a sprawling, politically complex place where voters historically have often elevated consensus-minded statewide candidates, a history that could affect the closely watched US Senate race.Incumbent Bob Casey, a Democrat, will battle Republican Dave McCormick, a wealthy former hedge fund executive, one of just a handful of races in 2024 that will decide who controls the Senate.Population shifts could also affect the race. Pennsylvania's population topped 13 million in 2021, but has declined in the two ensuing years, finishing at 12.96 million people last year. Declines since 2020 have come from counties that Biden won, according to an analysis by Franklin & Marshall College.Democrats continue to lose their voting registration advantage in the state as they face defections from rural and blue-collar voters, who are joining Republicans or registering as unaffiliated, according to state voter data.In 2020, Democrats held a roughly 700,000-voter registration advantage, but that has narrowed to 400,000 this year as Democratic voters switched to unaffiliated.The defections are due to voters who supported Republican candidates but never bothered to change their party status until now, some political analysts believe.","Former US President Donald Trump heads to the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday for a rally and a fundraiser.

"Pakistan's economic outlook 'uncertain', says ADB as it predicts 1.8% growth for FY2024",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-economic-outlook-uncertain-says-adb-as-it-predicts-1-8-growth-for-fy2024/articleshow/109254364.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank has said that Pakistan's economic outlook remains uncertain , as political instability would remain a key risk to the sustainability of stabilisation and reform efforts, according to a media report. The Manila-based lending agency in its 'Asian Development Outlook' said potential supply chain disruptions from the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East would weigh on the economy, the Dawn newspaper reported.It said if reforms are implemented, growth is forecast to restart gradually this fiscal year and improve slightly next year.""The outlook is uncertain, with high risks on the downside. Political uncertainty that affects macroeconomic policy-making will remain a key risk to the sustainability of stabilisation and reform efforts,"" the ADB said in its report.The ADB predicted 1.9 per cent growth in the fiscal year 2024 (ending on June 30, 2024) and then gradually improve to 2.8 per cent in the fiscal year 2025, driven by higher confidence, reduced macro-economic imbalances, adequate progress on structural reforms, greater political stability, and improved external conditions.The shift back to positive growth will come from a recovery in both agriculture and industry, it said.Meanwhile, real gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to grow by 1.9 per cent in 2024, driven by a rebound in private sector investment linked to progress on reform measures and transition to a new and more stable government.The ADB said the economy shrank as floods, uncertainty, and disrupted external support caused public investment to plunge and private investment and industry to contract.""Inflation reached a 5-decade high as supply disruption and currency depreciation propelled increases in food and energy prices,"" the agency said.""Inflation is projected to moderate somewhat this year, and more next year, under stabilisation policies. Improving women's financial inclusion is critical to strengthen growth,"" it said.The report further forecast that inflation will remain at about 25 per cent this year, driven by higher energy prices, but was expected to ease in 2025.The ADB highlighted that support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a medium-term reform agenda would considerably improve market sentiment and catalyse affordable external financing from other sources, the Dawn newspaper reported.On the supply side, it noted growth would be led by post-flood recovery in agriculture. The report said output would rise from a low base on improved weather conditions and a government package of subsidised credit and farm inputs supporting expanded area under cultivation and improved yields, the report said.Higher farm output would help expand manufacturing, which would also benefit from the increased availability of critical imported inputs. Large-scale manufacturing expanded in three of the first six months of 2024, the report highlighted.According to the report, the relaxation of import restrictions, coupled with economic recovery, was expected to widen the current account deficit.However, imports were expected to expand during the year as domestic demand strengthened and the stabilisation of the currency market made it easier for firms to import inputs. Thus, the current account deficit was projected to widen to 1.5 per cent of the GDP in 2024.The report pointed out that Pakistan would continue to face challenges from substantial new external financing requirements and the rollover of old debt, exacerbated by tight global financial conditions.The ADB said tax collection increased by 29.5 per cent, as reforms in the personal income tax, higher taxes on property transfers, and the reintroduction of taxes on cash withdrawals from banks and the issuance of bonus shares raised direct tax collections, the Dawn reported.","The Asian Development Bank has said that Pakistan's economic outlook remains uncertain. The Manila-based lending agency said potential supply chain disruptions from the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East would weigh on the economy. If reforms are implemented, growth is forecast to restart gradually this fiscal year and improve slightly next year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109254353,imgsize-752294,width-400,resizemode-4/109254353.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In an attempt to woo Indian tourists back to Maldives, a major tourism body in the island nation has revealed plans to conduct road shows across several key Indian cities. The move comes as the number of Indian visitors to the Maldives has seen a decline in recent times.The Maldives Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (MATATO) disclosed its intention to hold discussions with India's high commissioner in the Maldives, Munu Mahawar, to explore ways to enhance travel and tourism cooperation between the two countries.The decision to ramp up efforts to draw Indian tourists follows a significant backlash against the Maldives triggered by derogatory remarks made against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media by three Maldivian officials. This backlash led to numerous cancellations of reservations and a drop in plans to visit the Maldives by Indian tourists, including several celebrities.According to statistics from the Maldives' ministry of tourism, India, which was previously one of the top visitor countries, has slipped to the sixth position in terms of tourist arrivals. China currently leads with the highest number of tourists, followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, and Germany.Following discussions held at the Indian high commission in Male, MATATO announced plans to collaborate closely with the Indian high commission to boost tourism initiatives. This includes launching comprehensive road shows across key Indian cities and organizing influencer and media familiarization trips to the Maldives in the coming months.MATATO emphasized the importance of India as a crucial tourist market for the Maldives and expressed its eagerness to partner with prominent travel associations and industry stakeholders in India to promote the Maldives as a premier travel destination.This initiative comes amid tensions between the Maldives and India, with Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu previously requesting the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the country, citing sovereignty concerns.

Why the green onion has become a contentious poll issue in the South Korean elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/why-the-green-onion-has-become-a-contentious-poll-issue-in-the-south-korean-elections/articleshow/109105265.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Ahead of South Korea's crucial parliamentary election on April 10, green onions have unexpectedly taken center stage, overshadowing traditional hot topics like foreign policy and the economy. So contentious is the humble allium that it has been banned from polling stations due to concerns of electoral interference, sparking a wave of discussions among voters and election officials.The green onion frenzy began on March 18 when current president Yoon Suk Yeol visited a grocery store in Seoul to check consumer prices.His comment on the reasonable price of green onions, at 875 won ($0.65), stirred controversy as local media revealed the store had discounted the vegetable for his visit.This incident led to online backlash and opposition parties using green onions as a symbol of the president being out of touch with the people.As early voting commenced, photos of voters holding green onions at polling stations flooded social media, accompanied by hashtags like #earlyvotedone and #greenonions875won. Despite the high early voting turnout, reaching 13.8 million out of 44.2 million eligible voters, the National Election Commission (NEC) intervened by prohibiting green onions from polling stations to prevent any potential election interference .The NEC's decision faced ridicule online, with more onion memes circulating on social media platforms. This ban prompted a rush for green onion-themed memorabilia to circumvent the restrictions. Some voters expressed defiance by planning to wear green onion headbands on election day, criticizing the NEC's ban as arbitrary and condescending.One voter, Hyun Jung, voiced her disapproval, questioning the ban's logic and suggesting other items like colored clothing or luxury bags could also be restricted. Despite the ban on green onions, election officials will decide on-site whether green onion-themed items are acceptable, according to an NEC official.Political analyst Yum Seung-yul criticized the NEC's decision, deeming it too hastily implemented. While the ban is within the NEC's discretion, it has raised questions about the reasoning behind prohibiting green onions and the potential impact on voters' freedom of expression .As the election day approaches, the green onion controversy continues to stir debate and creativity among voters. The unexpected focus on this humble vegetable has become a symbol of political discourse and resistance against perceived restrictions on electoral participation.The green onion saga highlights the intersection of political symbolism and everyday life, illustrating how a seemingly mundane item can spark a nationwide conversation during a crucial electoral period. The outcome of the parliamentary election remains uncertain, but one thing is clear – green onions have secured their place in South Korea's political landscape, serving as a reminder of the power of everyday objects in shaping public discourse.",Green onions have taken center stage ahead of South Korea's crucial parliamentary election.

Unpopular Rishi Sunak in 'doom loop' as UK PM's victory in doubt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/unpopular-rishi-sunak-in-doom-loop-as-uk-pms-victory-in-doubt/articleshow/109282105.cms,"NEW DELHI: Britain's Conservative leader , Rishi Sunak , hasn't delivered on important promises, and his popularity in opinion polls has dropped. He also caused trouble with a popular Adidas shoe. This makes it likely that he'll lose the upcoming general election .Even with two tax cuts and a slightly better economy, Rishi Sunak's political luck hasn't turned around.Criticism from Boris Johnson , the former Prime Minister, and uncertainty about Nigel Farage's Brexit stance are only making things worse for him.According to political scientist Rob Ford, Rishi Sunak appears helpless in the face of the seemingly unstoppable shift in political momentum away from the ruling Tories.""When the herd moves, it moves. There's not much you can do,"" he told AFP.Sunak, aged 43, has not yet revealed the election date. It's expected that he will schedule it for October or November, but legally, he can delay it until January at the latest.Surveys overwhelmingly indicate that Britons desire an end to the 14-year rule of the Tories, and nothing Sunak has done since assuming the role of Prime Minister 18 months ago seems to be altering their opinions.A recent YouGov poll revealed that the Conservatives would only secure 155 seats in the UK Parliament, a significant decrease from the 365 seats they won under Johnson in the last election in December 2019.The same survey found that Keir Starmer's opposition Labour Party would secure 403 seats, resulting in an impressive 154-seat majority.""Right now, it's very challenging to envision how the Conservatives could stay in government after the next election simply due to the magnitude of the shift they would require,"" remarked Keiran Pedley, director of politics at polling firm Ipsos.Sunak took over from Liz Truss in October 2022 after Tory MPs ousted her following a tumultuous 49 days in office. Truss's mini-budget caused turmoil in financial markets, leading to a decline in the pound and a surge in mortgage payments. Truss had succeeded Johnson, who was removed from office by his colleagues amid scandals, including allegations of illegal parties in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns.The chaos of the two preceding administrations has certainly hindered Sunak, but political analysts argue that he has also worsened his own situation by failing to fulfill promises and failing to resonate with voters.Despite pledging to do so, Sunak has not halted the influx of migrants arriving from France on small boats. NHS waiting lists have increased since he took office. Economic growth remains sluggish, although inflation has decreased by more than half.Rishi Sunak's efforts to steer leadership and policy changes have not gained traction, with some initiatives like relaxing carbon net zero goals to appease drivers and addressing extremism failing to resonate. Analysts believe Sunak is struggling to find a game-changing solution, with public sentiment towards the Conservative Party hitting a low point.A recent Ipsos poll disclosed that 58% of voters hold an unfavorable view of the Conservatives, marking a significant decline in popularity. Sunak's personal favorability rating also took a hit, with a net score of minus 38, the lowest among all politicians surveyed.Critics often point out Sunak's disconnect with the average citizen, labeling him as ""awkward and nerdy"" and quick to appear defensive when challenged. In an attempt to bolster the party's standing, Sunak has been actively engaging with voters across the country amid speculation of a potential leadership challenge following the upcoming local elections on May 2.However, setbacks continue to plague Sunak, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson publicly criticizing his proposal for a comprehensive smoking ban and rumors circulating about the PM's involvement in an AI fund post-election defeat, which Sunak's spokesperson promptly denied.Sunak found himself issuing a public apology to the Samba community after facing backlash for sporting Adidas trainers, leading to mocking headlines questioning his fashion choices. As political commentator Ford highlighted, the negative media coverage and public sentiment can create a detrimental cycle for unpopular politicians.Despite the challenges, observers anticipate a potential shift in polling trends closer to the election day, with some moderate Conservatives likely to rally behind the party to prevent a significant Labour victory and maintain a robust opposition force.With the focus now on minimizing damage and regaining public trust, Sunak faces a critical juncture in his leadership as he navigates through a period of heightened scrutiny and skepticism from both within and outside the party.(With inputs from agencies)","Britain's Conservative leader Rishi Sunak hasn't delivered on important promises, and his popularity in opinion polls has dropped.

Western media questions Indian democracy in string of op-eds on Lok Sabha elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/western-media-questions-indian-democracy-in-string-of-op-eds-on-lok-sabha-elections/articleshow/109276708.cms,"LONDON: Opinion pieces on the Indian elections have been appearing thick and fast in the Western press.On Monday, the Times ran a “leading article” saying: “Mr Modi is likely to be recognised as probably the most significant Indian leader since independence”, putting his popularity down to spectacular growth, new technology, and welfare policies.“Modi has cultivated the image of a strongman… thumbing his nose at Western liberals and telling Indians their turn in the global spotlight has come.This plays as well with the poor as the rich elites,” it said.But “there is a darker side to his popularity,” the editorial continued. “Modi embraces ‘Hindutva”, playing up a nationalist Hinduism and discriminating against and passing laws that “disadvantage India’s large Muslim minority”. It said Modi was “intolerant of the opposition”, referring to the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, and claimed that “heavy pressure has been imposed on India’s once lively press to toe the government line,” including occasional harassment of the BBC.The arrest of AAP ministers and freezing of Congress bank accounts have been frequently mentioned.Edward Luce, associate editor at the FT, asked on X: “Will this be India's last democratic election”, whilst Hannah Ellis-Petersen, the Guardian’s correspondent, wrote: “Analysts and opponents have warned this could be the most one-sided election in India’s history.”The FT’s editorial board penned an article titled “The ‘mother of democracy’ is not in good shape”, saying: “PM Modi has repeatedly called India the ‘mother of democracy’. If so, an intensifying clampdown on opposition parties suggests this matriarch of representative government is in ill health. Harassment, often by tax or legal authorities, has become common for government critics… The BJP ’s muscular Hindu nationalism has eroded India’s tradition of secular democracy.”Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee wrote that the ""more progressive and successful part of the country"" was ""drifting away from the poverty-ridden north"" and its ""majoritarian leader."" “A Hindu rashtra, or nation-state, will play well in the north. The very prospect of such an outcome fills the south with dread,” he claimed.In the FT, Ruchir Sharma argued that Modi had expanded his base, not because of Hindutva ideology, but because he was delivering economic progress, and that the people of India were prepared to “trade political freedom for perceived progress” in the same way countries such as Taiwan and South Korea put together long runs of rapid growth with low inflation under autocratic leaders.All the op-eds predicted BJP would win the election and Congress faced a wipeout. The Economist published a list of books on Hindutva, telling its readers that non-Indians needed to understand the origins and core ideas of the “dangerous ideology”.“The residual Congress ideology is a sort of English Fabian socialism left out too long in the sun. The Congress manifesto was a standard left-of-centre list of desirable state handouts.It said little about more inclusive growth. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that Congress deserves the obscurity to which it is headed because of its acute intellectual shortcomings,” Philip Collins wrote in the Times.","All the op-eds predicted BJP would win the election and Congress faced a wipeout.

Last year £4.3 billion (28%) of UK's £15.4 billion overseas aid budget was spent on supporting refugees in Britain , an increase of £600 million on 2022, when it was £3.7 billion, statistics show.Of the £4.3 billion, £2.9 billion was spent by the home office mostly on housing refugees and asylum-seekers in UK hotels, at a cost of £8.2 million per day, an increase of 23% on 2022.The amount spent out of the aid budget on UK-based refugees has increased by a staggering 950% from £410 million in 2016 due to the surge in small boat arrivals and the UK's Ukraine and Afghanistan resettlement schemes .Under OECD rules, the costs of hosting refugees in UK can count towards the foreign aid budget for the first 12 months refugees are in the UK.Yet soaring costs for UK-based refugees have caused major disruption to govt's aid programme, which is meant to be spent on helping developing countries alleviate poverty and deal with disasters. There is now less money spent on bilateral aid than on asylum seekers in Britain as more aid spent by the home office means less available to the foreign office to spend in developing countries.Aid given bilaterally to poorer nations in 2023 fell by nearly 10%, from £4.6 billion in 2022 to £4.1 billion in 2023. The largest cuts were made to Asia which saw its UK bilateral aid fall by 33%.

NEW DELHI: Prince William is set to resume full-time royal responsibilities with a blend of in-person and digital engagements , forming a new operational strategy that could foreshadow his approach during his future reign. This decision comes after a period of reduced public visibility following his wife, Kate Middleton's cancer diagnosis.""William, who had not been seen or heard from in over three weeks since before his wife Kate Middleton announced she had been diagnosed with cancer, returned to public visibility Wednesday with a social media post paying tribute to a leading female soccer player retiring from England’s national team,"" sources indicated this shift aims to maximize his impact while accommodating his current family circumstances, a the Daily Beast report said.In light of his father, King Charles III's step back due to his own health issues, Prince William has been thrust into a more prominent role sooner than anticipated. He spent the school holidays at the Sandringham Estate, balancing family time with preparations for his increased responsibilities.The prince is navigating his duties with a newfound approach to work, integrating more virtual engagements to maintain his presence while managing his familial obligations. ""In many ways the next few weeks and months will be a template for his future reign because he will have similar personnel available after he succeeds to the throne, even if that doesn’t happen for many years,"" a friend of William and Kate shared with The Daily Beast.As the royal family adapts to these personal and public challenges, William's strategy reflects a broader shift in the monarchy's engagement with the public and its causes. The Prince expressed a desire to focus more deeply on fewer causes for greater impact, a pivot from the traditional royal practice of patronizing a vast array of charities, the Daily Beast report said.William's return to a full schedule is planned to coincide with the end of the school term, signaling a return to more regular public appearances. His efforts to balance the demands of his state responsibilities with his role as a family man are setting a precedent for what might be expected during his future kingship.While Kensington Palace has not detailed specific plans, the coming weeks are expected to reveal more about how Prince William will manage his dual roles as a working royal and a supportive family man amid his wife's health challenges.","Prince William is set to resume full-time royal responsibilities with a blend of in-person and digital engagements.

Inside SBTi row that has divided carbon offsets market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/inside-sbti-row-that-has-divided-carbon-offsets-market/articleshow/109280855.cms,"When the biggest funders and promoters of the $2 billion carbon offsets market assembled in London last month, the gathering was billed as a series of technical discussions on subjects such as emissions accounting. But, at least to some attendees, there also appeared to be another motive -- to make a case for why the Science Based Targets initiative, the biggest and most-respected verifier of corporate climate targets, is the main impediment to the growth of a market that advocates deem critical in fighting climate change .In a world full of greenwashing, SBTi has become a gold standard in emissions accountability because of its strict criteria for net-zero plans. It currently limits how corporations can use offsets - credits that companies can buy to ostensibly cancel out their pollution - to achieve their green targets. The issue is one of the most divisive among climate experts. Powerful proponents including former US climate envoy John Kerry argue they're needed to shift money into important sustainability projects, while critics say it's almost impossible to verify the true impact of the instruments.The meetings last month were hosted by the Bezos Earth Fund, a supporter of growing the voluntary carbon market and one of two main funders of SBTi.They were held in a workspace in London's Clerkenwell district. Two SBTi representatives were present and faced a barrage of implicit and direct requests to relax their position on carbon offsets from senior leaders of prominent carbon market standards and lobbying groups, the people said.A month later, on April 9, SBTi made an about-face on offsets that caught even its staff off guard -- the group said it would loosen its rules for how companies can use carbon credits to reduce their reported emissions. That would lead to a boon for the carbon offsets market, which has recently been rocked by turbulence. BloombergNEF says such a change could help annual demand soar to $1.1 trillion in 2050.The move outraged SBTi staff, who called on the CEO and board to resign in an April 10 letter. They argued that the board violated SBTi rules and procedures by making this decision unilaterally, rather than relying on guidance from SBTi's independent technical council, which wasn't informed or consulted.On April 12, SBTi added a clarification to its previous statement, emphasizing that ""no change has been made to SBTi current standards,"" and that any shifts to its rules will go through all of its standard procedures.",SBTi has become a gold standard in emissions accountability because of its strict criteria for net-zero plans.

However, Meloni's Brothers of Italy party has introduced a bill that would further criminalise the act by increasing fines from USD 6,40,290 to USD 1,067,150 and increasing jail terms from three months up to two years.In her address at a conference 'For a Young Europe: Demographic Transition, Environment, Future' in Rome on Friday, Meloni said, ""I continue to believe that surrogacy is an inhuman practice.""She further said, ""I support the bill that makes it a universal crime."" Her remarks regarding surrogacy fall in line with the viewpoint of the Catholic Church.Pope Francis in a document released on Monday said that surrogacy ""violates"" the dignity of the child and the woman, who ""becomes a mere means subservient to the arbitrary gain or desire of others.""The conference on Friday was designed to focus on Italy's declining birth rates, which the Meloni-led government has vowed to reserve by making it easier for working mothers to find adequate child care and other support.At the conference, Meloni said, ""The demographic challenge, and the economic sustainability to which it is connected, is one of the main challenges for us."" She added, ""There is no point in managing the present if the future is not secure.""Italian PM has been calling for public spending increases to support families, including baby bonuses and tax breaks for families with children. She has already reduced taxes on diapers and baby formula, CNN reported.Meloni's decision to criminalize surrogacy is largely considered a move against the LGBTQ+ community, CNN reported. Italy was the last European nation to legalize same-sex unions, which it did in 2016. However, it has not allowed gay couples to be ""married,"" in line with the Catholic Church.Under Meloni's government, birth certificates mention the name of the ""mother"" and ""father"" instead of ""parent 1"" and ""parent 2.""

Despite his daily emails and applications, Devorin's follow-ups did not advance past the initial stage, and he believes that the resource management group blocked his applications. In contrast, a younger Indian employee was quickly found a role and offered several other positions, none of which were offered to Devorin.The lawsuit follows complaints filed by at least 22 workers with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) since late Dec, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. These experienced American professionals accuse TCS of terminating their employment on short notice and replacing them with workers from India on H-1B visas. The lawsuit said that of the 14 global managing partners that were laid off, three Indian global managing partners were rehired into a different role while the rest were let go.When TOI sent an emailed query to TCS, the company said it is in a silent period. it pointed TOI to its earlier response that said allegations that TCS engaged in unlawful discrimination are meritless and misleading.","Randy Devorin, a 61-year-old US citizen who worked for TCS for over a decade in global consulting practice, has filed a complaint against the tech company's alleged discriminatory employment practices.

Big tax worry for NRIs in the UK! New proposed tax regime may make United Kingdom less attractive to migrate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/big-tax-worry-for-nris-in-the-uk-new-proposed-tax-regime-may-make-united-kingdom-less-attractive-to-migrate/articleshow/109237268.cms,"New Proposed Tax Regime in UK

The UK government is set to implement a new tax regime in April 2025, which will impact non-resident Indians ( NRIs ) and recent migrants residing in the country. This change will abolish a 200-year-old feature of the British tax system, potentially increasing the tax burden for individuals and families planning to make the UK their new home.According to an ET report, tax experts and lawyers have been strategizing to mitigate the effects of this upcoming tax overhaul.The proposal aims to end the current tax treatment for UK resident non-domiciled (non-doms) individuals. Indian income and capital gains of NRIs are currently not taxed unless remitted to the UK.Under the new regime, individuals arriving in the UK will not be taxed on their foreign income for the first four years of residency. However, starting from the fifth year, UK residents will be liable to pay taxes on their worldwide income, including earnings from sources like rent, bank fixed deposits, and stocks in India.Existing NRIs who migrated two years ago as non-doms will be able to claim tax relief on their foreign income for the remaining 2 years period. Dinesh Kanabar, CEO of Dhruva Advisors LLP was quoted as saying, “Present tax rates in the UK for the highest tax band is 40% for dividend income and 45% for other income. As against this, the tax rate for the highest band in India is 10% for dividend income under the India-UK tax treaty, 28% on rental income after considering standard deduction and 40% for other income. So, this will lead to additional tax leakage of 30% on dividend income, 17% on rental income and 5% on other income for NRIs under the new regime.”Also Read | Mini-Goldilocks moment! Why Motilal Oswal thinks India is big, bold and blazing The proposed framework outlines that NRIs who have been in the UK for a decade and are currently non-doms will face a tax rate of 50% on their foreign income in the initial year. Additionally, remittances towards pre-2025 foreign income will be taxed at 12% for the first two years.Kanabar suggested that Indian families considering migration to the UK may postpone their plans until after the next UK election, anticipating a possible revision of the tax regime by the incoming government. Families already residing in the UK are advised to assess the impact of the new tax rules on their income sources and inheritance planning.Wealthy NRI families with offshore trusts may need to reevaluate their trust structures and distribution strategies to align with the changing regulations. Mitil Chokshi, a senior partner at Chokshi & Chokshi, emphasized the need for strategic financial planning in light of the impending tax adjustments.Also Read | India’s Mission 2047: How India aims to become a developed economy - high speed expressways, electric mobility, digital payments & more The debate is ongoing on whether the shift towards taxing global income will diminish the appeal of the UK as a destination for wealthy individuals. The reduction of the non-dom period to four years may make the UK less attractive compared to countries like Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland, which offer more favorable tax regimes.Experts in the field, including Rajesh Shah from Jayantilal Thakkar & Company and Uday Ved from KNAV, highlighted the potential need for NRIs to restructure their investments and income streams due to the new tax regulations.","The UK government is set to implement a new tax regime in April 2025, which will impact non-resident Indians ( NRIs ) and recent migrants residing in the country.

New PPI rules: Boosting options, flexibility, and security

Convenient UPI transactions: Using wallet funds

UPI rule change for PPIs : Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and wallets like Paytm, PhonePe, and Amazon have become integral to our daily transactions. Whether it's paying for groceries, bills, or other expenses, we rely on these platforms regularly.However, a common complaint among users is the limited flexibility in using wallet funds for UPI transactions .Typically, you can only use wallet money through the issuer's app, like PhonePe for PhonePe wallet . Using the same funds through other UPI apps is not possible, which is also the case for prepaid cards. Now, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has proposed an update, allowing users to link their prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) with third-party UPI applications.Prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) are tools for making payments using stored money, like wallets or cards, states an ET report. You can load funds into them and use them for UPI payments or online transactions. PPIs work separately from your bank account. When you use them for payments, the money comes from the prepaid account linked to the PPI. So far, wallets could only be used for UPI payments through the issuer's app, as per RBI regulations.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das stated on April 5th that there is a proposal to allow the linking of PPIs with third-party UPI apps to offer greater flexibility to PPI holders. This will empower PPI holders to make UPI payments similar to bank account holders.Customers can now use any UPI app to access their wallets, even if they're from different companies, as explained by Shivaji Thapliyal from Yes Securities India Ltd.With the new RBI rules, PPI wallet holders are no longer tied to the issuer of the wallet, says Shravan Shetty from Primus Partners. This means that customers can now use their wallet balance seamlessly on other UPI-enabled apps, extending its usability beyond the wallet's platform.For instance, if you have funds in your PhonePe Wallet, you can access them through any third-party UPI app, not just the PhonePe app. This allows users to access their money stored in wallets like PhonePe, Amazon Pay, through any third-party UPI application.There are closed wallets like those from BigBasket, Country Delight, Milkbasket, and Ola Money, where you can only use the loaded money to purchase goods and services from that specific company through their app. This money cannot be used elsewhere.According to Vinayak Goyal, Executive Director of AGS Transact Technologies Limited, closed-loop PPIs can only be used for a single merchant and are not UPI certified, so they cannot be integrated into third-party apps. The RBI's decision to link UPI with PPI applies only to open-loop PPIs, which are accepted on multiple merchant platforms. This is expected to encourage the adoption of open-loop PPIs, offering users more payment options and empowering them with features like expense tracking and secure transactions, especially for smaller amounts.Further clarification on this issue is expected soon as the central bank releases more directions on how the new rule will operate.The new RBI rule for PPIs offers customers more options, flexibility, and security. According to Shetty, this means customers can use their wallet balance at a wider range of merchants, making digital payments more convenient without the need to switch between different apps. This rule also benefits rural areas where many small banks don't offer UPI services.According to Sarvjeet Singh Virk, this will address challenges such as UPI unavailability with certain PPI issuers, allowing more people to access organised financial management.Looking ahead, Shetty suggests viewing wallets as a ""debit card"" for online transactions.Wallets are handy for small UPI transactions like Rs 10 or Rs 100. Now, users can use their wallet or prepaid account funds through third-party apps for UPI payments. This is especially helpful for smaller transactions and enhances security by avoiding the need to share bank account details, says Goyal.Shetty further adds that the RBI's announcement, enabling UPI access for PPI wallets through third-party apps, offers customers more payment choices, convenience, and wider acceptance.","Prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) are tools for making payments using stored money.

'Existential threat': What’s behind the latest US-China trade fight?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/existential-threat-whats-behind-the-latest-us-china-trade-fight/articleshow/109290942.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The escalating trade tensions between the United States and China are once again making headlines, this time over the burgeoning sectors of green technology and electric vehicles . Treasury secretary Janet Yellen highlighted these concerns during her recent five-day visit to China, marking these industries as a new battleground in the ongoing trade disputes between the two economic giants.China’s rapid increase in the production of electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries—sectors also heavily supported by the Biden administration—has sparked fears not only in the US but across Europe and Mexico.These regions worry about the potential for a flood of Chinese exports that could undermine local manufacturers and disrupt global markets.The Alliance for American Manufacturing issued a report in February noting that BYD, a leading Chinese automaker, launched an electric SUV at an “astonishingly low” price of $14,000. This move has been described as posing an “existential threat” to US carmakers. Reflecting the political fallout from these developments, former President Donald Trump, speaking at a rally in Ohio, warned that China could exploit trade routes through Mexico—where there are no tariffs—to export cars into the US. He predicted a “bloodbath” for the auto industry if Biden were reelected and failed to implement new tariffs.China’s strategy involves over a decade of subsidizing its automakers, leading to it commanding 60% of the global electric vehicle market, as per the International Energy Agency. This has resulted in Chinese firms producing millions more vehicles annually than their domestic market can absorb, pushing them to seek markets abroad.This scenario echoes past trade issues where the US accused China of flooding the market with cheap goods in other sectors such as steel and aluminum, leading to significant tariffs during Trump’s administration. Yellen recalled a similar situation affecting Suniva, a solar cell manufacturer in Georgia that shut down due to competition from cheap Chinese imports but is now resuming production thanks to new subsidies from the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act.While the US also provides subsidies to similar industries, a 2022 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies highlighted that China’s subsidies were double those of the US in 2019. This disparity underscores a fundamental difference: China focuses heavily on production without equally fostering domestic consumption, which was notably supported in the US through stimulus checks during the pandemic.China, on its part, argues that its cheaper green technologies aid in combating climate change globally, even as it acknowledges the need to manage its manufacturing overcapacity and stimulate domestic consumer spending to ensure sustainable economic growth.","The escalating trade tensions between the United States and China are once again making headlines.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107449351,imgsize-22516,width-400,resizemode-4/107449351.jpg"
Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.
