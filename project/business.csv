How IT companies are pressing staff to return to office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-it-companies-are-pressing-staff-to-return-to-office/articleshow/110130775.cms,"BENGALURU: Some IT companies wield the stick, while others offer carrots.Tech companies are employing different strategies to encourage their workforce to return to the office. The unprecedented flexibility that employees enjoyed during the pandemic is now being scaled back as companies reassert their expectations and exert control over the work environment.Employees find themselves in a challenging position, with no option but to comply with these directives or potentially face repercussions for non-compliance.Earlier this year, Cognizant's CEO, Ravi Kumar, announced the development of a new app that will enable managers to create a roster based on requirements, in addition to the existing FlexiSeat app for booking seats across its facilities. This application will allow the company to monitor work-from-office compliance . In a memo, Kumar had stated, ""Our collective goal is to ensure that we are in the office with a purpose."" He also mentioned that employees are expected to come to office three times a week or as defined by their leader. In fact, Cognizant has embarked on the NextGen programme aimed at simplifying its operating model and consolidating and realigning office space to reflect the post-pandemic hybrid work environment. An email sent to Cognizant on the new app rollout didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press.TCS has implemented a policy that links the amount of variable pay employees receive each quarter to their presence in office. Employees who work from office less than 60% of the time will not receive any variable pay, while those with an office attendance between 60-75% will receive 50% of the variable pay. Employees who come to office 75-85% of the time will be eligible for 75% of the variable pay, and only those with an office compliance level above 85% will receive full variable pay for the quarter.Dell Technologies plans to use electronic badge swipes, VPN, and a colour-coding system to track employee presence. The four colours used are blue (consistent on-site presence), green (regular on-site presence), yellow (some on-site presence), and red (limited on-site presence). Tech chronicler The Register was the first to report the development. Dell has a significant presence in India but does not disclose the exact number of employees in the country.In contrast, Wipro has taken a milder approach. In a recent letter to employees, its chief human resources officer Saurabh Govil stated that local-level councils have been set up to ""enhance associate participation, engagement, collaboration, and networking"". Govil informed employees that there would be more in-office activities to encourage people to work from Wipro campuses across India.Infosys's employee experience platform, InfyMe, allows employees from select business units to apply for work-from-home for 11 days in a month. Last year, Infosys had asked select employees at the junior and mid-levels to return to office ten days a month starting Nov 20, deviating from some of its peers who are enforcing a five-day work week.","Tech companies are employing different strategies to encourage their workforce to return to the office.

Income Tax Return Filing: How new AIS correction status update feature will help taxpayers - explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/income-tax-return-filing-how-new-ais-correction-status-update-feature-will-help-taxpayers-explained/articleshow/110152813.cms,"What does the new feature do in AIS?

What happened in the previous AIS feedback system?



Income Tax Return e-filing: Taxpayers facing inaccuracies in their Annual Information Statement (AIS) now have a solution at hand. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has revamped the AIS system, enabling individuals to track the status of their correction requests in real-time.The CBDT announced in a press release dated May 13, 2024, that they've added a new feature to the AIS.This feature will show if the taxpayer's feedback has been addressed by the source, either partially or fully, by accepting or rejecting it.As per an ET report, the AIS can be found on the compliance portal, which is accessible to all registered income taxpayers. You can't access the compliance portal directly. First, you need to log in to the e-filing ITR portal, then go to the 'Pending Actions' tab to access the compliance portal.CBDT stated in its press release that the Annual Information Statement is accessible to all registered Income Taxpayers via the compliance portal, which can be reached through the e-filing website (incometax.gov.in).According to the CBDT's press release, if the feedback is partially or fully accepted, the source needs to correct the information by filing a correction statement.The AIS will display the following details regarding feedback confirmation from the source:- Confirmation Status: Indicates if feedback has been shared with the reporting source.- Date of Feedback Sharing: Shows when feedback was sent to the reporting source.- Date of Source Response: Displays when the reporting source responded to the feedback.- Source Response: Indicates the response provided by the source based on the taxpayer's feedback (whether correction is needed or not).CBDT mentioned in the press release that this new feature is anticipated to enhance transparency by showing such information in AIS to the taxpayer.If there's incorrect AIS data, you need to give feedback for correction. But in the past, there have been issues when the reporting source didn't act promptly to fix this. As a result, taxpayers got income tax intimation notices because of discrepancies between AIS and ITR data.Mihir Tanna, an associate director-direct tax at S.K Patodia LLP, a CA firm, states that they have observed how incorrect information in AIS has caused distress to numerous legitimate taxpayers upon receiving intimation from the income tax department regarding data mismatches between AIS and filed ITR. In the past, some of their clients encountered issues where sale and purchase transactions of shares appeared in AIS, despite not being conducted by them. They provided feedback in the AIS tab but were uncertain if the reporting entity took necessary action.This new feature will make it clear if you need to do anything more after providing feedback on wrong AIS information. According to Tanna, if the reporting source doesn't accept the feedback, then the taxpayer only needs to take necessary action. This clarity and transparency are provided by the new functionality.Experts note that the CBDT's press release doesn't specify how the taxpayer will be informed about the feedback provided by the reporting source.Divya Jokhakar, a CA and Associate of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) in the United Kingdom (UK), explains that the new feature will now notify the taxpayer after they provide feedback on incorrect AIS data, including the date when the reporting source is informed and confirmation is sent. Similarly, the taxpayer will also be notified about the response and its date from the source. The press release doesn't mention how this communication will happen, but it's likely to be through SMS to the registered mobile number and email to the registered email ID.Experts also mention that the communication between the taxpayer and reporting source becomes simpler. According to Jokhakar, this change means that communication is no longer one-sided as it was before. This should provide taxpayers with some relief, knowing that their feedback is being addressed. Additionally, they can interact with sources like tax deductors , collectors, and SFT filers more easily.The AIS gathers financial data from various sources known as reporting entities. This data offers a snapshot of the taxpayer's financial transactions, forming the basis for filing income tax returns. Yet, since this information comes from third-party reports, there's a possibility of errors entering the AIS database due to reporting mistakes.To address this issue, CBDT implemented a feedback system within AIS.CBDT stated in the press release that within AIS, taxpayers can now give feedback on each displayed transaction. This feedback allows taxpayers to comment on the accuracy of the information provided by the source. If there's incorrect reporting, the system automatically follows up with the source for confirmation. Currently, this confirmation process is operational for information provided by Tax Deductors/Collectors and Reporting Entities.With the recent update, the feedback system has become more responsive, giving taxpayers the ability to take corrective actions and track the status of correction requests.","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has revamped the AIS system, enabling individuals to track the status of their correction requests in real-time.

A group led by Blackstone , the biggest private equity fund globally, together with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ( ADIA ) and GIC of Singapore, made a non-binding offer recently to purchase a majority stake in Haldiram Snacks Food Pvt Ltd (HSFPL), the joint packaged snacks and foods business of the Agarwal family's Delhi and Nagpur branches, according to informed sources.Haldiram, at 87 years old, stands as India's foremost snack and convenience foods enterprise.According to an ET report, Blackstone and its partners are eager to acquire 74-76% of the company, valuing the business at $8-8.5 billion (Rs 66,400-70,500 crore). ADIA and GIC are both limited partners or sponsors of Blackstone's global funds. Should the deal materialize, it would mark the most significant private equity buyout in India to date.When asked for comment, Haldiram CEO KK Chutani told ET, ""The company has no comments to offer.""Last year in May, Chutani, previously the chief executive of Dabur International, was brought in as Haldiram's CEO, marking the first time a professional has taken the helm.The completion of any transaction hinges on the successful merger currently underway between the Nagpur and Delhi factions, as part of a plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). This merger is anticipated to conclude within the next three to four months.The Haldiram family has undergone a significant restructuring, with the Nagpur and Delhi factions splitting their FMCG (packaged foods) and restaurant businesses into separate entities.The newly formed Haldiram Snacks Food Pvt Ltd (HSFPL) is the result of a merger between Haldiram Foods International Pvt Ltd (HFIPL), led by the Nagpur faction, and Haldiram Snacks Pvt Ltd (HSPL), led by the Delhi family.The Delhi side of the family, represented by Manohar Agarwal and Madhu Sudan Agarwal, will hold a 55% stake in HSFPL, while the Nagpur faction, led by Kamalkumar Shivkisan Agrawal, will own the remaining 45%.

Additionally, Haldiram's has acquired smaller brands such as Babaji Namkeen, Akash Namkeen, and Atop Foods.The restaurant business, valued at Rs 1,800 crore, is not included in the merger transaction.Haldiram's has a rich history, dating back to 1937 when Ganga Bishan Aggarwal started the business as a family-run sweets and namkeen shop in Bikaner, Rajasthan. While Haldiram's is a dominant player in the snacks market, it faces competition from other notable brands such as PepsiCo's Lays and Kurkure, Balaji Snacks, Prataap Snacks' Yellow Diamond, Bikanervala, the recently listed Bikaji Foods, and ITC Foods' Bingo franchise.","Haldiram, at 87 years old, stands as India's foremost snack and convenience foods enterprise.

N Chandrasekaran to chair Tata Electronics as Tata group focuses on semiconductor business with $14 billion investments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/n-chandrasekaran-to-chair-tata-electronics-as-tata-group-focuses-on-semiconductor-business-with-14-billion-investments/articleshow/110079154.cms,"Tata Group's Strategic Move

Tata Electronics means business on semiconductors: N Chandrasekaran , the chairman of Tata Sons , is set to take on an additional role as the chairman of Tata Electronics. This move comes at a crucial time when Tata Electronics has allocated approximately $14 billion for investments to make a significant entry into the semiconductor industry .Chandrasekaran will succeed Banmali Agrawala, who has held the position for several years and has recently transitioned into an advisory role within the Tata group, according to an ET report.The change in leadership will take effect once the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained.As Chandrasekaran already chairs several key Tata group companies, his appointment as chairman of Tata Electronics underscores the importance of the semiconductor business to the conglomerate.Chandrasekaran played a pivotal role in persuading Randhir Thakur, a former veteran of Intel Foundry Services, to join Tata Electronics as CEO & MD in 2023. Additionally, in January, Srinivas Satya, previously the country president of the semiconductor products group at Applied Materials, joined Tata Electronics as the chief supply chain officer and president of the components business.Industry experts believe that these strategic appointments, combined with Chandrasekaran's unwavering focus, have positioned Tata Electronics at the forefront of India's electronics manufacturing landscape. To further strengthen its capabilities, Tata Electronics has recruited 50-60 top-level expatriates in recent months, leveraging their extensive knowledge in semiconductor technology, strategic planning, and design.An executive close to the company stated, ""The board of Tata Electronics now has the management width and heft to scale up the business. It is now wooing top tier global clients and may surpass growth expectations. The challenge earlier was talent and technology, and the company is chasing both aggressively to drive growth.""Also Read | ‘GenAI impact to be unimaginable’: TCS chairman N Chandrasekaran makes important observation Neil Shah, vice president of Counterpoint Research, has emphasized the need for a strategic and bold approach as Tata Electronics ventures into this new territory. He said, ""Since this is a completely greenfield territory for Tata, Tata Electronics will need a more strategic, measured and bold approach moving towards the 'One Tata' vision laid out by Chandrasekaran."" Shah further highlighted the immense potential in the electronics industry, from semiconductor fabrication to finished goods, and the importance of Chandrasekaran's involvement in ensuring a strong pipeline.Established in 2020, Tata Electronics is the sole Indian vendor assembling iPhone enclosures for Apple. The company is expanding its operations by ramping up its existing facility in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, and acquiring Wistron's facility in Karnataka. Reports also indicate that Tata Electronics is considering taking over Pegatron's facility in Tamil Nadu to further increase its capacity.Also Read | Apple iPhone exports from India nearly double in April to $1.1 billion; may hit Rs 1 lakh crore mark in FY25 The global pandemic has caused significant supply chain disruptions, which, coupled with recent geopolitical shifts, has created new opportunities for Indian companies like the Tata group.

First, India standardised foreign ownership limits in 2020.

"Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq end at records as US inflation cools",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dow-sp-500-nasdaq-end-at-records-as-us-inflation-cools/articleshow/110162061.cms,"Wall Street surged to new heights on Wednesday following encouraging signs of easing inflation, which has sparked anticipation of upcoming interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve . The release of US consumer price data for April showed a slight moderation in inflation rates, sending the three major stock indices to record levels.The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared by 0.9 percent, reaching 39,908.00 and nearing the monumental 40,000 mark.The S&P 500 increased by 1.2 percent to 5,308.15, and the Nasdaq Composite grew by 1.4 percent, ending the day at 16,742.39, marking consecutive record closes.This optimism was partly due to the monthly consumer price index indicating an annual inflation rate of 3.4 percent for April, a slight decrease from 3.5 percent in March. ""The reports together point to a cooling of inflation and economic growth, as well as an increase in the likelihood that the Fed will begin its rate-cutting cycle later this year,"" commented Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.Despite robust market performances, US retail sales in April were stagnant, missing the anticipated 0.4 percent growth. This could signal a deceleration in consumer spending, potentially impacting economic stability.In the bond market, the easing of Treasury yields alleviated some pressure, enhancing the appeal of stocks, especially those likely to benefit from lower interest rates. Homebuilders like Lennar, DR Horton, and PulteGroup all saw significant gains, driven by hopes that rate cuts could lower mortgage costs.Tech stocks also enjoyed a boost, with Nvidia rising by 3.6 percent, significantly contributing to the S&P 500's gains. Utility and real estate sectors likewise performed well, as lower bond yields made their dividends more attractive.Market sentiment was influenced by various corporate performances and economic indicators. Dell Technologies saw an 11.2 percent jump after an optimistic analyst upgrade from Morgan Stanley, while Boeing faced a 2.1 percent drop amid legal troubles. The fluctuating fortunes of 'meme stocks' such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment highlighted the volatile nature of these investments, with significant losses following recent gains.As traders now place a nearly 95 percent probability on the Fed cutting rates at least once this year, the market remains sensitive to economic signals and Federal Reserve policies. This delicate balance of slowing the economy to manage inflation without triggering a recession continues to be a central theme in market dynamics.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared by 0.9 percent, reaching 39,908.00 and nearing the monumental 40,000 mark.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107449351,imgsize-22516,width-400,resizemode-4/107449351.jpg"
Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Gold outshines Nifty with 18% returns over 5 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-outshines-nifty-with-18-returns-over-5-years/articleshow/110157399.cms,"Mumbai: The yellow metal, which is in the middle of a bull rally, has given an annual return of 18% in the last five years that beats Nifty 's 15% gain. However, the leading equity index still beat the yellow metal in terms of returns over several other time periods like one, three, 10 and 15 years, according to an ET report.Over the seven-year horizon, the returns were nearly equal: Compared to Nifty's compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%, gold's was 14%, Amrita Farmahan, CEO, Ambit Global Private Client said in the report.So far this year, globally gold prices have jumped about 20% to the current level of around $2,390/ounce. In mid-April the price of the yellow metal had briefly breached the $2,400-level too, a life-time high figure.In the domestic market as well, gold prices had jumped above the Rs 70,000/10gm mark in early April and was almost on the verge of breaking above the psychologically important Rs 75,000 mark on the MCX during the month. Since then it has cooled a bit to the current level of about Rs 73,000.There are a host of reasons for this rally in gold prices, Farmahan said. For one, many major central banks are on a gold buying spree. And the list includes China, India and Russia. After the US froze dollar-denominated assets of Russian origin after the start of the Ukraine war, global investors ' trust on the greenback was shaken. This prompted several central banks to buy gold, often regarded as a global currency due to its acceptance. This in turn is driving up gold prices.The rising debt pile of the US and the EU are also leading to higher demand for gold, since it serves as a safe haven asset amid concerns of currency debasement, she said. Another minor reason for the gold's rally is the demand from Chinese investors as they have lost faith in real estate and stocks. And it's expected the US retail investors will take a similar path, she said.","Gold has given an annual return of 18% in the last five years that beats Nifty's 15% gain.

BJP on the offensive

Options before the cops

NEW DELHI: High-voltage drama unfolded at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ’s residence in north Delhi on Monday morning after Aam Aadmi Party’s Rajya Sabha MP, Swati Maliwal, claimed in a PCR call that she had been assaulted by Kejriwal’s personal assistant, Bibhav, on the former’s instructions. This brought the cops to the spot. Later, she went to the Civil Lines police station in order to file an FIR.The Rajya Sabha MP, however, didn't file any complaint. She reportedly received some phone calls, after which she left the station. She told the cops that she would return later but didn't.Bibhav and Swati have been with Kejriwal since his NGO days and their falling out has left a large section within AAP dismayed.The falling out between the two is particularly concerning as Kejriwal prepares for the upcoming poll campaign. Another AAP's Rajya Sabha member confirmed the incident on Tuesday, stating that "" Bibhav Kumar misbehaved with her. This is a highly condemnable incident. Kejriwal has taken cognisance of it and will take strict action.""Sanjay Singh addressed the issue at a press conference, praising Maliwal's work for the country and society and emphasising that the party stands with her. He also indicated that the party wants to resolve the controversy quickly, with Kejriwal set to undertake a hectic campaigning. ""CM has taken cognisance and AAP doesn't support such people, we want to make it clear,"" said Sanjay Singh.The BJP, on the other hand, has gone on the offensive, with Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva questioning why arrests were not made immediately and why pressure was put on Maliwal to remain silent. Sachdeva demanded that an FIR be filed promptly based on Sanjay Singh's statement and that those responsible be dealt with swiftly.“Sanjay Singh's statement should be the basis for immediate filing of an FIR by police and those guilty should be promptly dealt with. They are just talking about entrapping small fish, but in the end, who instigated this incident and what were the reasons? All these questions should be answered by Kejriwal,” said Sachdeva.“The chief minister's residence is famous for such incidents whether it was the incident involving a former chief secretary or Maliwal. This is the true character of AAP and it is now out in the open,” he said.The police have marked Maliwal's complaint as ""pending,"" and no FIR has been filed yet. They are seeking legal opinion on whether they can proceed based on the DD entry and PCR call, a protocol followed in many cases. The police brass held a meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss the case, and attempts to contact Maliwal have been unsuccessful. Sources indicate that the police are in the process of collecting CCTV footage from outside the CM's residence.","Aam Aadmi Party's Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal claims she was assaulted by Kejriwal's personal assistant, Bibhav Kumar.

OpenAI's chief scientist and co-founder is leaving the company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/openais-chief-scientist-and-co-founder-is-leaving-the-company/articleshow/110130685.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Ilya Sutskever , the OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist who in November joined three other board members to force out Sam Altman , the company's high-profile CEO, before saying he regretted the move, is leaving the San Francisco artificial intelligence company.Sutskever's departure, which the company announced in a blog post Tuesday, closes another chapter in a story that stunned Silicon Valley and that raised questions about whether Altman and his company were prepared to lead the tech industry into the age of AI.After returning to OpenAI just five days after he was ousted, Altman reasserted his control and continued its push toward increasingly powerful technologies that worried some of his critics. Sutskever remained an OpenAI employee, but he never returned to work.""This is an emotional day for all of us,"" Altman said in an interview. ""OpenAI would not exist without him and certainly was shaped by him.""In a statement, Sutskever said: ""I have made the decision to leave OpenAI. The company's trajectory has been nothing short of miraculous, and I'm confident that OpenAI will build A.G.I. that is both safe and beneficial."" AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is an as-yet-unbuilt technology that can do anything the brain can do.Sutskever, 38, added that he was starting a new project, but did not elaborate.A key OpenAI researcher, Jakub Pachocki, will replace Sutskever as chief scientist at the company, which is valued at more than $80 billion, according to a recent fundraising deal.On Monday, OpenAI unveiled a new version of its ChatGPT chatbot that can receive and respond to voice commands, images and videos, joining tech giants including Google and Apple in a race toward a new kind of talking digital assistant.Founded in 2015 by Altman, Elon Musk and several young researchers, including Sutskever, OpenAI has long been at the forefront of AI research. Sutskever's involvement provided the company with instant credibility. As a graduate student at the University of Toronto, he had been part of an AI breakthrough involving neural networks -- the technology that has driven the field's progress over the past decade.In late 2022, OpenAI wowed the world with the release of ChatGPT, an online chatbot that could answer questions, write poetry, generate computer code and chat a lot like people. The tech industry quickly embraced what is called generative artificial intelligence -- technologies that can generate text, images and other media on their own.The result of more than a decade of research inside companies like OpenAI and Google, generative AI is poised to remake everything from email programs to internet search engines and digital assistants.Altman became a spokesperson for the shift toward generative AI, testifying before Congress and meeting with lawmakers, regulators and investors around the world. In November, OpenAI's board of directors unexpectedly ousted him, saying he could no longer be trusted with the company's plan to eventually create artificial general intelligence.The OpenAI board had six people: three founders and three independent members. Sutskever voted with the three outsiders to remove Altman as CEO and chair of the board, saying -- without providing specifics -- that Altman had not been ""consistently candid in his communications.""Greg Brockman, OpenAI's chief operating officer and another co-founder, resigned from the company in protest. So did Pachocki.Days later, as hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Sutskever said he regretted his decision to remove Altman and effectively stepped down from the board, leaving three independent members in opposition to Altman.Altman returned as CEO after he and the board agreed to replace two members with Bret Taylor, a former Salesforce executive, and Lawrence Summers, a former U.S. Treasury secretary. Altman regained his board seat several months later, as the board expanded to seven people.Last year, Sutskever helped create a Super Alignment team inside OpenAI to explore ways of ensuring that future versions of the technology would not do harm. Like others in the field, he had grown increasingly concerned that AI could become dangerous and perhaps even destroy humanity.Jan Leike, who ran the Super Alignment team alongside Sutskever, has also resigned from OpenAI. His role will be taken by John Schulman , another company co-founder.In the weeks leading up to Altman's ouster, Pachocki, who helped oversee the creation of GPT-4, the technology at the heart of ChatGPT, was promoted to director of research at the company. After occupying a position below Sutskever, he was elevated to a position alongside him, two people familiar with the moves said.After Altman was reinstated, Sutskever did not return to work. Altman indicated that he was hoping to negotiate his return, but ultimately that was not possible.Pachocki has effectively served as chief scientist since November. After Sutskever recruited him and others to join OpenAI, he was among the key researchers on several of the company's most important projects, including, most notably, GPT-4.""I am grateful to Ilya,"" Pachocki said in an interview. ""We have different and in many ways complementary styles of leadership.""Altman said he talked with Sutskever on Tuesday.

Fed's Powell downplays potential for a rate hike despite higher price pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/feds-powell-downplays-potential-for-a-rate-hike-despite-higher-price-pressures/articleshow/110125324.cms,"WASHINGTON: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the central bank is unlikely to raise its key interest rate in response to signs of stubborn inflation and underscored his view that price increases would soon start to cool again.Yet Powell, during a panel discussion in Amsterdam, said his confidence that inflation will ease ""is not as high as it was"" because price increases have been persistently hot in the first three months of this year.Powell stressed that the Fed's preferred approach was to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak rather than increase it.""I don't think that it's likely, based on the data that we have, that the next move that we make would be a rate hike ,"" Powell said. ""I think it's more likely that we'll be at a place where we hold the policy rate where it is.""Financial markets and economists have been hoping for signs that one or two Fed rate cuts might be coming this year, given that inflation is down sharply from its high in 2022. But with price pressures still elevated, Powell and other Fed officials have signaled that no rate cut is likely anytime soon.Powell spoke hours after a report on U.S. producer prices showed that wholesale inflation picked up in April. On Wednesday, the government will issue the latest monthly report on consumer inflation, which is expected to show that price growth cooled a bit last month.In his remarks Tuesday, Powell downplayed the wholesale price report, which also showed that some costs cooled last month, including for airfares, hospital visits and car insurance.""I wouldn't call it hot,"" he said of the wholesale inflation data. ""I would call it sort of mixed.""Economists are divided over whether the high inflation figures this year reflect a re-acceleration in price growth or are largely echoes of pandemic distortions. Auto insurance, for example, has soared 22% from a year ago, but that surge may reflect factors specific to the auto industry: New car prices jumped during the pandemic, and insurance companies are now seeking to offset the higher repair and replacement costs by raising their premiums.Other economists point to consistent consumer spending on restaurant meals, travel and entertainment, categories where in some cases price increases have also been elevated, possibly reflecting strong demand.Powell said that upcoming inflation reports will reveal whether such factors are keeping inflation high or whether inflation will soon fall back to the Fed's 2% target, as he said he expects. Inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in the summer of 2022, is forecast to slow to 3.4% in Wednesday's latest report.The Fed chair noted that rising rents are one key factor keeping inflation high. He called that ""a bit of a puzzle"" because measures of new apartment leases show new rents barely increasing. Such weaker data has apparently yet to flow into the government's measures, which cover all rents, including for tenants who renew their leases. Though rents are still growing faster for tenants who renew leases, Powell said the government's measures should eventually show rent growth easing.The Fed chair also acknowledged that the economy ""is different this time"" because so many Americans refinanced their mortgages at very low rates before the Fed began raising borrowing costs in March 2022. Many large businesses also locked in low rates at that time.""It may be,"" he said, that the Fed's rate policy ""is hitting the economy not quite as strongly as it would have if those two things were not the case.""Last week, Fed officials underscored that they were prepared to leave their key interest rate at 5.3%, the highest level in 23 years, as long as needed quell inflation.","Jerome Powell says the Fed's preferred approach is to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak.

NEAR Protocol (NEAR) recently experienced a significant price uptrend as Nethermind announced that the NEAR Fast Finality Layer went live on Holesky. It was developed in collaboration between both projects, and this could enhance the overall demand and utility of the crypto. Binance Coin (BNB) also saw a notable upswing as Binance completed the integration of the dYdX Mainnet and enabled deposits.Ripple Labs and the SEC also made significant progress in their legal battle, as the SEC filed its final reply. In the meantime, the first parallelised confidential computing network was announced for Solana (SOL). Despite their success, traders are moving towards KangaMoon (KANG) as it is up 400% and could soon see a major surge in value. To understand why these are among the top altcoins , let’s explore them individually.Here, we will take a much deeper look into the price performance of each one of these altcoins to determine which one can provide the most substantial gains.KangaMoon (KANG) is a rising star in the current Bitcoin frenzy and has gathered over 20,000 users due to its impressive presale performance and unique ecosystem. Having surpassed $6.5 million raised, the project is now on track to reach $8 million by the end of May, as KangaMoon boasts features from the Play-to-Earn (P2E) space alongside Social-Fi elements.The project introduces a dedicated game in which KANG serves as the in-game currency and facilitates purchases and character upgrades. This utility distinguishes KangaMoon from the plethora of altcoins that are driven exclusively by hype. Another differentiator for KangaMoon is in its strategic distribution of free KANG tokens, which are given to the most active users on social media platforms such as X (Twitter), incentivising community engagement.Through this approach, the project has sparked a surge in users actively following and sharing social media content. Currently, the project is at the Bonus Stage of the presale, priced at $0.025, which also reflects a significant 400% increase from its initial valuation of $0.005 and putting it as one of the top altcoins in 2024. This could just be the beginning, however, as experts predict a 100x price increase following its listing on Tier-1 exchanges in Q2 2024.NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is moving in an upward direction, fueled by the overall market sentiment and bullishness following its most recent announcement. Specifically, the NEAR Fast Finality Layer went live on Holesky , which was developed by the foundation in collaboration with Nethermind. This can increase the usage of the NEAR Protocol crypto and possibly drive demand further, positioning it as one of the best altcoins to invest in.The NEAR Protocol price’s RSI and MACD data both showcase major bullishness, and the future for its price is optimistic. According to the NEAR Protocol price prediction, the crypto can end Q4 of 2024 at $10.10.Binance Coin (BNB) is now dominant on the charts as well, following the most recent expansion of its exchange. Based on the latest announcement, the dYdX mainnet got integrated on top of the Binance exchange , and deposits are now open. This can drive further demand for the Binance Coin crypto, positioning it as one of the best altcoins to invest in.The Binance Coin price chart is bullish, and according to the recent metrics, it's forming an upward pattern that can result in a dominant position. According to the Binance Coin price prediction, it can climb as far as $856.44 in 2024.Solana (SOL) recently displayed major bullishness after Archium was announced for the network. This marks a monumental milestone as it is the first parallelised confidential computing network , and could lead to increased Solana crypto demand.Moreover, the Solana price is showcasing bullish on-chart metrics and could soon experience massive gains as more traders diversify with this crypto and bulls enter the market. According to the Solana price prediction, it can end in 2024 at a maximum price of $178.33.Ripple (XPR) has recently been in the spotlight after Ripple Lands, SEC making significant progress in their legal battle. In a recent response, the SEC challenged Ripple’s insistence that the blockchain startup acted without recklessness and there should be no uncertainty about the legal status of the Ripple crypto. This marked the final reply in the lawsuit’s remedies stage.Following this news, the Ripple price went in a bullish direction and began climbing the charts. According to the Ripple price prediction, by the end of Q4, 2024, the crypto can reach $1.08.NEAR Protocol is bullish on the charts and Binance Coin is expanding with integrations that can result in better utility, also contributing towards a value increase. Solana and Ripple also showcased solid metrics and could see substantial gains, yet, KangaMoon has the most significant growth potential and is seen as the most compelling investment opportunity within the altcoin landscape.The project has distinguished itself from the crowd by focusing on utility and offering a compelling proposition for traders seeking high-growth potential. With a strong presale performance and solid potential for future development, it is poised to capitalise on the booming P2E market.Discover the exciting opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) presale today!","KangaMoon (KANG) set to become a behemoth in the Altcoin space.

Saudi Arabia concerns stall China-Arab free trade talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/saudi-arabia-concerns-stall-china-arab-free-trade-talks/articleshow/110117791.cms,"DUBAI: Negotiations between China and an Arab bloc for a free trade agreement have stalled over concerns by Saudi Arabia that cheap Chinese imports could undermine its ambitions to transform the kingdom into an industrial powerhouse, sources say.Saudi Arabia has backed renewed efforts over the past two years for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the Arab bloc which includes the kingdom, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, among others, to finally seal a long sought deal with China.But five sources briefed on the negotiations said the sides were at an impasse over Saudi reservations with a list of goods put forward by Beijing to be exempt from Gulf import duties.Saudi Arabia is worried that a wave of lower cost Chinese versions of products that it hopes to manufacture domestically would be damaging to its industrial agenda, the sources said.Saud Arabia's government communication office, the GCC Secretariat and China's commerce ministry did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the trade negotiations.The kingdom, the world's biggest oil exporter, has a nascent manufacturing industry that the government hopes will one day make everything from computer chips to tires as part of a wider economic transformation plan to create a vibrant private sector.Saudi Arabia is spending trillions of dollars developing its economy under that program, known as Vision 2030, driven by the country's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .Prince Mohammed wants Saudi Arabia to not only lessen its dependence on oil rents by creating a strong private sector but also to transform the kingdom into a major global business hub.The industrial part of that transformation plan faces challenges even without competing with lower cost Chinese goods. That includes finding skilled workers among its citzens in a country where about 60% of the 32 million population are Saudi nationals.To build its own manufacturing industry, Saudi Arabia is partnering with foreign firms, including from China, to develop local capabilities and manufacturing lines in the kingdom.The sources said a China-Gulf trade deal was not off the table but that the Saudis and the Chinese would likely have to settle on some sort of compromise to see the deal finalised.Gulf officials last October spoke of reaching a deal soon. China's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Chen Weiqing was quoted by local media in January as saying that although progress had been made, there were difficult issues that needed to be resolved.China and the GCC, which also includes Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain, started trade talks almost 20 years ago. But the loose political and economic Arab bloc has finalised very few deals. It signed a free trade agreement with South Korea in December.China is a massive buyer of Gulf energy and in 2023 bilateral trade between China and the Gulf stood at $286.9 billion, according to Chinese customs data, with Saudi Arabia accounting for nearly 40% of trade between the Gulf and China.China and the Gulf states have deepened economic cooperation in recent years, to the concern of the United States, which has long been the core security partner of the Gulf Arab states.US officials have increasingly sought to drive a wedge between the Gulf states and China, including issuing ultimatums to pick between American and Chinese technology.","Negotiations between China and an Arab bloc for a free trade agreement have stalled.

"US president Joe Biden hikes tariffs on Chinese EVs, solar cells, steel, aluminum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-president-joe-biden-hikes-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-solar-cells-steel-aluminum-adding-to-tensions-with-beijing/articleshow/110114790.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration announced plans to slap new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells , steel, aluminum and medical equipment - an election-year move that's likely to increase friction between the world's two largest economies.The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China.The tariffs are unlikely to have much of an inflationary impact because of how they're structured. Administration officials said they think the tariffs won't escalate tensions with China, yet they expect that China will explore ways to respond to the new taxes on their products. It's uncertain what the long-term impact on prices could be if the tariffs contribute to a wider trade dispute.The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminum and more. There are currently very few EVs from China in the US, but officials worry that low-priced models made possible by Chinese government subsidies could soon start flooding the US market.Chinese firms can sell EVs for as little as $12,000. Their solar cell plants and steel and aluminum mills have enough capacity to meet much of the world's demand, with Chinese officials arguing that their production keeps prices low and would aid a transition to the green economy.Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, said the tariffs will raise the cost of select Chinese goods and help thwart Beijing's efforts to dominate the market for emerging technologies in ways that pose risks to US national security and economic stability.""China is simply too big to play by its own rules,"" Brainard told reporters on a Monday call previewing the announcement.Administration officials have stressed that the decision on tariffs was made independently of November's presidential election. But Brainard noted in her remarks that the tariffs would help workers in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two of the battleground states that will decide who wins the election.Under the findings of a four-year review on trade with China, the tax rate on imported Chinese EVs is to rise to 102.5% this year, up from total levels of 27.5%. The review was undertaken under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the government to retaliate against trade practices deemed unfair or in violation of global standards.Under the 301 guidelines, the tariff rate is to double to 50% on solar cell imports this year. Tariffs on certain Chinese steel and aluminum products will climb to 25% this year. Computer chip tariffs will double to 50% by 2025.For lithium-ion EV batteries, tariffs will rise from 7.5% to 25% in 2024. But for non-EV batteries of the same type, the tariff increase will be implemented in 2026. There are also higher tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes, critical minerals and medical products.The new tariffs, at least initially, are largely symbolic since they will apply to only about $18 billion in imports. A new analysis by Oxford Economics estimates that the tariffs - which would be implemented over time - will have a barely noticeable impact on inflation by pushing up inflation by just 0.01%.Still, Chinese officials voiced their frustration with the move.Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu rejected US claims that Beijing has encouraged excess factory capacity in order to dominate global trade in these goods. He also said that more expensive EVs and solar panels will make it more difficult to transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.""Despite its professed willingness to strengthen cooperation with China on climate change, the US has been hyping up the so-called 'overcapacity' in China's new energy sector and vowing to impose additional tariff hikes on Chinese electrical vehicles and solar products,"" Liu said. ""This is self-defeating.""The Chinese economy has been slowed by the collapse of the country's real estate market and past pandemic lockdowns, prompting Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to jumpstart growth by ramping up production of EVs and other products, making more than the Chinese market can absorb.This strategy further exacerbates tensions with a US government that claims it's determined to strengthen its own manufacturing to compete with China, yet avoid a larger conflict.""China's factory-led recovery and weak consumption growth, which are translating into excess capacity and an aggressive search for foreign markets, in tandem with the looming US election season add up to a perfect recipe for escalating US trade fractions with China,'' said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.China's production of EVs and other green products are ""coming to be seen by the US as a zero-sum game in which China plays the spoiler that could hamper a US manufacturing revival,'' Prasad said.The Europeans are worried, too. The EU launched an investigation last fall into Chinese subsidies and could impose an import tax on Chinese EVs.After Xi's visit to France last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that government-subsidized Chinese EVs and steel ""are flooding the European market. ... The world cannot absorb China's surplus production. Therefore, I have encouraged the Chinese government to address these structural overcapacities.''The Biden administration views China with subsidies of its own manufacturing as trying to globally control the EV and clean energy sectors, whereas it says its own industrial support is geared toward ensuring domestic supplies to help meet US demand.""We do not seek to have global domination of manufacturing in these sectors, but we believe because these are strategic industries and for the sake of resilience of our supply chains, that we want to make sure that we have healthy and active firms,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters Monday.The tensions go far beyond a trade dispute to deeper questions about who leads the world economy as a seemingly indispensable nation. China's policies could make the world more dependent on its factories, possibly giving it greater leverage in geopolitics. At the same time, the United States says it's seeking for countries to operate by the same standards so that competition can be fair.For it's part, China maintains that the tariffs are in violation of the global trade rules that the United States originally helped establish through the World Trade Organization.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Friday that the new tariffs compounded the problems caused by tariffs that the Trump administration had previously put on Chinese goods, which Biden has kept.""Instead of ending those wrong practices, the US continues to politicize trade issues, abuse the so-called review process of Section 301 tariffs and plan tariff hikes,"" he said. ""This will just double the US's fault.""Those questions are at the heart of November's presidential election, with a bitterly divided electorate seemingly united by the idea of getting tough with China. Biden and Trump have overlapping but different strategies.Biden sees targeted tariffs as needed to defend key industries and workers, while Trump has threatened broad 10% tariffs against all imports from rivals and allies alike.Biden has staked his presidential legacy on the US pulling ahead of China with its own government investments in factories to make EVs, computer chips and other advanced technologies.""So far, we've created $866 billion in private-sector investment nationwide - almost a trillion dollars - historic amounts in such a short time,"" Biden said last week in Wisconsin. "" And that's literally creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.""Trump tells his supporters that America is falling further behind China by not betting on oil to keep powering the economy, despite its climate change risks. The former president may believe that tariffs can change Chinese behavior, but he believes that the US will be reliant on China for EV components and solar cells.""Joe Biden's economic plan is to make China rich and America poor,"" he said at a rally earlier this month in Wisconsin.","The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminum and more. Administration officials said they think the tariffs won't escalate tensions with China, yet they expect that China will explore ways to respond to the new taxes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110114790,imgsize-118186,width-400,resizemode-4/110114790.jpg"
