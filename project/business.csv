Diesel prices jump 56% as Malaysia revamps decades-old fuel subsidies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/diesel-prices-jump-56-as-malaysia-revamps-decades-old-fuel-subsidies/articleshow/110861783.cms,"KUALA LUMPUR: Diesel price in Malaysia jumped by more than 50% on Monday as part of a revamp of decades-old fuel subsidies to tighten government spending and save billions of ringgits annually. The restructuring eliminates blanket energy subsidies and redirects them to the needy.They're part of economic reforms pledged by PM Anwar Ibrahim, whose government says they're needed to build and more sustainable economy and plug losses from smuggling cheap oil to neighbouring countries.Anwar has been cautious to bring about higher fuel prices, however, with working-class voters are still struggling with rising cost of living. He announced the decision to cut fuel subsidies last month to give time to lower-income groups to prepare for the transition.The government eventually plans to follow suit with more petrol subsidies.Essentials including fuel, cooking oil and rice are heavily subsidised in Malaysia which have strained national finances for years.Second Finance Minister Amir Hamzah Azizan announced Sunday that diesel price will rise to 3.35 ringgit ($0.71) a litre on Monday, up 56% from its previous subsidised price of 2.15 ringgit ($0.46). He said the price will be reviewed on a weekly basis to be aligned with market prices.The price hike will not apply to Malaysian states on Borneo island and eligible logistic vehicles, he said. Lower prices previously set for fishermen and a wide fleet of land public transport vehicles such as school buses, taxis and ambulances will also remain unchanged.Monthly cash aid will also be given to eligible individuals with diesel vehicles including farmers and commodity smallholders, the government said.Despite the hike, Amir said Malaysia's diesel price remains among the lowest in Southeast Asia. Diesel costs 8.79 ringgit ($1.86) a litre in neighbouring Singapore and more than 4 ringgit ($0.86) in most other regional countries.Amir said the targeted subsidies will help cut the fiscal deficit, with the government expected to save at least four billion ringgit ($850 million) annually. Malaysia's diesel subsidy bill surged from 1.4 billion ringgit ($300 million) in 2019 to 14.3 billion ringgit ($3 billion) last year.""Malaysia cannot afford to continue losing billions of ringgit due to widespread smuggling of diesel. The money is better spent on improving the people's quality of life and developing the country,"" Amir said.",Diesel price in Malaysia jumped by more than 50% on Monday as part of a revamp of decades-old fuel subsidies.

Godrej L’Affaire: Leading events and experiences with a commitment to environmental stewardship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/godrej-laffaire-leading-events-and-experiences-with-a-commitment-to-environmental-stewardship/articleshow/110763814.cms,"Disclaimer: This article has been produced on behalf of Godrej by Times Internet’s Spotlight team.

In a world rife with corporate slogans about making a difference, it's easy to become cynical. Not everyone believes that businesses can be a force for good and green behaviour. Yet, in this era of skepticism, there are organisations committed to goodness, not just as slogans but as a philosophy that permeates every aspect of their operations, from product development to community engagement.Godrej Industries, with its unique approach, strives to integrate the philosophy of Good and Green into everything they do, from their sustainable practices to the experiences they curate. This ethos is perhaps most vividly showcased through their owned media property, Godrej L'Affaire - a brand-agnostic platform to celebrate nuances of lifestyle in an experiential manner. This year’s rollout that culminated recently had a relevant theme - “all things goodness”. This platform sought to highlight the impact of deliberate good choices that contribute positively to society. Over 1000 content creators and celebrities witnessed the magic of over 55 participating brands.Elaborating on the impact, Sujit Patil, Chief Communications Officer, Brand and Corporate Communications, Godrej Industries Group said, “Even large-scale events can be sustainable and to bring out this element, we ensured that at each stage of Godrej L’Affaire, elements of sustainability are demonstrated. The entire event was audited by Skrap, a sustainability leader that helps businesses achieve zero-waste goals. Godrej L'Affaire 2024 achieved a zero-waste-to-landfill milestone through responsible waste management practices. Partnering with Skrap, we diverted an impressive 94.8% of event waste (1,843.2 kgs) from landfills, the same was recycled, composted, reused, or donated. This reduced our carbon footprint by an estimated 2,697 kgs, equivalent to what 44.6 saplings could capture in 10 years or carbon sequestered in 3.1 acres of US forests in a year, or the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by burning 1347 Kgs of coal. Hence establishing the fact that community events can also be highly sustainable. We understand that experiences are powerful. They shape who we are and how we connect with the world. But for experiences to be truly ""good"" they can't exist in a vacuum. A healthy environment is the foundation for a thriving lifestyle, and one cannot tackle climate change with hashtags alone.”This understanding is why, for World Environment Day 2024, Godrej L'Affaire joined hands with the Bhamla Foundation and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Maharashtra Forest Department, Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board for a campaign aptly christened as #BhoomiNamaskar. Meaning ""Salutation to the Earth"" in Hindi, this campaign highlights the importance of nurturing our land.The campaign's focus on land restoration is timely and critical. As we grapple with the consequences of deforestation and land degradation, #BhoomiNamaskar seeks to inspire our generation to understand and fight for the countless species facing extinction. It's about more than just planting trees—it's about nurturing the land that sustains us, preserving vital water resources, and ensuring a sustainable future.Mr. Patil further added, “By supporting #BhoomiNamaskar, Godrej L'Affaire is demonstrating that a platform celebrating lifestyle can—and should—champion environmental causes. After all, what good is a fashionable wardrobe or a gourmet meal if we don't have a healthy planet to enjoy them on? This collaboration underscores Godrej L'Affaire's holistic view of goodness, one that encompasses personal well-being, community welfare, and environmental health. By participating in and promoting this initiative, we aim to inspire others to take meaningful steps towards a sustainable future. We recognise that the journey towards sustainability is ongoing. We are committed to continually evolving our practices and pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a responsible corporate citizen. Our goal is to create a legacy of goodness that transcends generations, ensuring a better, healthier planet for all.”The success of #BhoomiNamaskar lies in its simplicity and profound impact. It serves as a reminder that every small action counts. Whether it's planting a tree, conserving water, or reducing waste, every effort contributes to the larger goal of restoring our planet- It starts with us.","Godrej Industries strives to integrate the philosophy of Good and Green into everything they do, from their sustainable practices to the experiences they curate.

"Mid, senior level startup executives hunt for stable jobs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mid-senior-level-startup-executives-hunt-for-stable-jobs/articleshow/110884551.cms,"MUMBAI: Even as investors and sector experts point towards a funding revival for the startup ecosystem in the second half of the year, employees are not convinced. Several startup employees continue to ditch new-age firms for more stable companies, with the trend more visible among mid and senior-level employees.In FY24, the percentage of CVs flowing in from startups to legacy companies, MNCs and even GCCs was 12-15% higher on a year-on-year basis, Viswanath PS, MD and CEO at Randstad India, told TOI. ""This is considerable given that startups generally house smaller teams as compared to large organisations,"" Viswanath said.A former Byju's employee working out of Mumbai said that he recently joined an IT firm even though it required him to move base to Bengaluru. ""I was drawn to the stability, resources and network that an established IT firm can provide,"" the person said on condition of anonymity.Employees, however, are not in a ""mad rush"" to move out of startups. While the mass exodus of staff the industry saw in the aftermath of the funding winter as well as the huge layoffs across companies - including in big unicorns - has stabilised to some extent, employees are on the lookout for better opportunities and are willing to move to safer pastures as and when they can, said Anshuman Das, CEO and founder at Longhouse Consulting.""The attractiveness of the startup sector has eroded. The uncertainty associated with working in startups, the sudden rejig of business models, discontinuation of projects at companies and the resultant layoffs have been deterring candidates from taking up jobs at these companies. They are now more grounded in terms of their expectations and are keeping options for secure jobs open,"" added Aditya Narayan Mishra, MD & CEO, CIEL HR Services. This is in stark comparison to the past when the lure of higher pay packages and building innovative solutions often led job-seekers to opt for startups.""The mid- and senior-level employees are looking to switch to larger and established companies with more structure. The age group of these employees also requires them to have more stability and balance in life to attend to familial responsibilities,"" said Viswanath. A recent survey by CIEL HR based on the analysis of over 1 lakh respondents working across 70 startups showed that 67% of startup employees are open to move to more established firms.While deal activity in the startup ecosystem has picked up, late-stage funding needs to gain momentum for full revival of the sector.","In FY24, the percentage of CVs flowing in from startups to legacy companies, MNCs and even GCCs was 12-15% higher on a year-on-year basis, Viswanath PS, MD and CEO at Randstad India, said.

"Demat accounts, mutual fund folios sans nomination won't be frozen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/demat-accounts-mutual-fund-folios-sans-nomination-wont-be-frozen/articleshow/110885282.cms,"Markets regulator Sebi said that their investments through these two channels will not be frozen (Reuters photo)

MUMBAI: Bringing relief to a large number of investors who are yet to make nominations in their demat accounts and mutual fund folios, markets regulator Sebi on Monday said that their investments through these two channels will not be frozen. Those investors will continue to receive dividends, interest, redemption proceeds from such accounts, Sebi said.

However, all new investors under Sebi will have to compulsorily either nominate or opt out from nominating anyone in their demat accounts and MF folios.

The change in Sebi's stance came after investors and mutual fund distributors made representations to the markets regulator to do away with this rule. ""Based on representations from market participants, for ease of compliance and investor convenience,"" Sebi has decided, among other issues, ""non-submission of 'choice of nomination ' shall not result in freezing of demat accounts as well as mutual fund folios.""

About two months ago, Sebi had diluted the nomination rules by making nomination voluntary in jointly-held MF folios and demat accounts. For Sebi, the main reason for insisting on nomination was to avoid any complications including delay in transfer of assets in demat accounts and MF folios during the time of succession.

Sebi, however, said that all brokers and fund houses should insist on getting nominations done in demat accounts and MF folios. It further said that all new investors/unit holders would continue to be required to mandatorily provide the 'choice of nomination' for demat accounts/MF folios (except for jointly-held demat accounts and MF folios). The regulator has asked depository participants, AMCs or RTAs to encourage demat account holders or mutual fund unit holders, respectively, to update 'choice of nomination' by sending a communication on a fortnightly basis by way of emails and SMS to all such investors, who have not provided the 'choice of nomination'.

","Investors will continue to receive dividends, interest, redemption proceeds from such accounts, Sebi said. All new investors under Sebi will have to compulsorily either nominate or opt out from nominating anyone in their demat accounts and MF folios.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110885665,imgsize-1343183,width-400,resizemode-4/110885665.jpg"
Lock-in period for tax saving fixed deposits to be reduced to 3 years?

New rules for tax saving fixed deposits soon? State Bank of India , along with other public sector lenders, are appealing to the government to permit them to offer incentives aimed at bolstering deposits. The drop in deposits has affected the flow of credit.According to an ET report, during FY24, the growth in bank deposits lagged behind the rise in credit, compelling banks to rely on costlier Certificates of Deposit (CDs) to close the funding gap.Banks have informed senior government officials about the slowdown in deposit growth. ""One suggestion is that the lock-in period for tax-saving fixed deposits should be reduced to three years from five years,"" a senior bank executive was quoted as saying.Bankers have pointed out that investors are favoring equities, mutual funds , and tax-saving equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS), thanks to their impressive returns. These alternatives also have a five-year lock-in period.Reducing the lock-in period for tax-saving fixed deposits to three years could help address this imbalance, according to bankers.In FY24, aggregate deposits grew by 12.9%, while bank credit rose by 16.3%. This shift is attributed to investors seeking other options for their money.The proportion of deposits in the gross financial savings of households declined from 6.2% of gross national disposable income (GNDI) in FY21 to 4% in FY23. During the same period, investment in shares and debentures increased from 0.5% to 0.8%.""Because of the exuberance in the Indian stock markets, investors have tilted more towards the same.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures. You can save on taxes by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107352991,imgsize-1609512,width-400,resizemode-4/107352991.jpg"
Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-focuses-on-youth-and-women-entrepreneurship/articleshow/107357923.cms,"By

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

"Meet Bujji, the made-in-Kovai star of Kalki 2898 AD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/meet-bujji-the-made-in-kovai-star-of-kalki-2898-ad/articleshow/110853146.cms,"It’s a car and a character – a cross between the batmobile and the R2D2 but as desi and rugged as they come. Meet made-in-Tamil Nadu Bujji, the six-tonne beast of a car that plays sidekick to Prabhas in the soon-to-release sci-fi extravaganza Kalki 2898 AD. Jointly designed and developed by Mahindra Research Valley and Jayem Automotives Coimbatore, Bujji’s debut was cheered on X by Anand Mahindra who tweeted: “Our team in Mahindra Research Valley in Chennai helped the Kalki team realise its vision for a futuristic vehicle by simulating the powertrain configuration, architecture and performance. In fact, the vehicle runs on two Mahindra e-motors … And Jayem Automotives put it all together… Let the games begin.”For Nag Ashwin, director of Kalki 2898 AD and its prelude Bujji & Bhairava, the robot car is intrinsic to the storyline. “In the story, the main character builds Bujji from scrap. So while building the real Bujji, we had to make sure it was a bit rough around the edges, not as gleaming and factory-made as batmobile or R2D2,” he says. With a top speed of 45 km per hour, two swappable battery packs powering its all-electric engine and customized tyres and braking system, Bujji is more futuristic than any auto show concept vehicle. “We wanted the vehicle to be as close to the sci-fi concept as possible,” says Ashwin. “We didn’t want an ICE engine, we didn’t want to steer it from the front, we didn’t want regular tyres. We wanted something unique so they built the product ground up with full-time testing and engineering.”At a budget of around `4 crore, Bujji is cheaper than many super cars but then for the Jayem team, Project K (for Kalki) was a creative opportunity not a commercial one. “The design work was not done along commercial pricing standards,” says J Anand, MD, Jayem Automotives.When the Kalki crew first met the Mahindra and Jayem teams, Anand was far from convinced. “They came with an imagination sketch,” he says. “Initially I was reluctant because we don’t do one-off vehicles but then I found it to be a really interesting concept and I was excited. I felt, if Hollywood can do it, why can’t we?”The most challenging aspect of Bujji is that it veers so far away from usual automotive design and parts. “Nag Ashwin and his team wanted out-of-the-box things such as hubless wheels with twin motor, front arm suspension and single wheel rear axle, independent steering drive, synchronization of vehicle drive systems, swappable battery pack, remote emergency disconnect etc,” says Anand. “The vehicle needed a 360-degree camera and AC with automated electronics for the seat and yet it had to look rugged and worn out.”But the biggest challenge was that the vehicle had no room for failure. “Bujji has to perform but it is not a big product programme with prototypes and simulations,” says Anand. “Prabhas is driving it in front of hundreds of people so everything has to work perfectly. There’s no place to hide because Bujji is a film star.” That performance has already kicked off with Bujji going cross country to promote the film. “For the next month or two, Bujji will travel all over India,” says Ashwin. “It’s already in Mumbai, then it will go to Nagpur, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Delhi.” It will be driven not only by Prabhas but other celebrities and influencers. And it will be open for people to gawk and click. For the automotive brains behind the vehicle that meant it had to have several systems checks despite the tight schedule.“We ran it in a different configuration as systems check vehicle because Bujji does not have regular steering, its drives are different and we needed to make sure powertrain, battery and other electricals and electronics work perfectly,” says Anand. Wheels, tyres and drives were custom built and some parts such as screens were outsourced. “One thing was commendable – Nag Ashwin never compromised. I said why do it this way, why not do something simpler but Ashwin said we have to have hubless tyres and Bujji’s particular look. That’s the character it is.” At the end of the day Bujji is not just a car. It’s a star.","Made-in-Tamil Nadu Bujji plays sidekick to Prabhas in the soon-to-release sci-fi extravaganza Kalki 2898 AD.

MUMBAI: Paytm is pruning its workforce as part of its strategy to check costs and create a leaner organisation .

Several employees across departments have been laid off while many have quit their jobs at the firm in the past 3-4 months, following RBI's move to impose restrictions on its banking unit, sources said. The fintech has also been increasing its reliance on artificial intelligence to streamline work processes and build in more efficiencies, making some job roles redundant in the process.

""The operations of Paytm Payments Bank (PPBL) and Paytm were interdependent at several levels. It was not possible for the company to absorb everyone from PPBL. As part of the firm's move to control costs, all departments have been asked to reduce their budgets,"" said company sources. Paytm did not disclose the number of people that have been laid off and in a statement on Monday said that there have been no new layoffs. Sources, however, did not rule out the possibility of more layoffs in the coming months.

A former PPBL employee who recently moved to another fintech said that several Paytm employees were handed pink slips in the last week of May. ""Two of my friends who had moved from PPBL to the parent company got laid off. They have reached out for job referrals,"" the employee said. The two affected employees could not be reached immediately. Another former employee who was terminated from the company in April said that the firm never furnished any set reason behind his abrupt termination.

This is the highest number of days in 14 years.From May 14 to June 10, the city has continuously seen temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius for 28 days. This too is the highest number of days in 14 years.This was clear from IMD data, gathered by TOI.As a comparison, 2023 and 2022 saw 10 and 27 days, respectively, when the maximum temperature crossed 40 degrees Celsius during the same period.The IMD’s data available in the public domain from 2011 onwards. It shows that before 2024, no year saw the maximum temperature crossing 40 degrees Celsius consecutively for 28 days.Even the number of such days in this streak will increase as mercury is predicted to stay above 40 degrees Celsius for the next seven days.Delhi has seen intense heat this summer. Between May 1 and June 10 this year, some stations, such as Narela, Najafgarh, Pitampura, Mungeshpur and Jafarpur, recorded the mercury consistently above 45.Most weather records were broken on May 28 and 29 as many stations saw peak temperatures. The highest maximum temperature at Safdarjung was 46.8 degrees Celsius on May 29.However, Narela and Mungeshpur recorded a maximum of 49.9 degrees Celsius each on May 28, which is the highest ever recorded in Delhi. Pitampura and Pusa saw 49.8 and 49, respectively.IMD’s data shows that this current spell of intense heat is more severe than 2013 when mercury crossed 40 degrees Celsius for 31 days.Experts said scanty rainfall this summer led to a high temperature. However, only 0.4 mm rainfall was logged on May 11 and May this year ended with a rain deficit of 99%. In June so far, Safdarjung has received 1.2mm rainfall and is staring at a rain deficit of 85%.“In the absence of significant rain activity, Delhi has seen clear skies, which cause the surface heating up faster. On most days, westerly dry and warm winds have prevailed in the city. These winds, from Rajasthan and south Haryana that are also recording high mercury, cause the temperature to rise,” a Met official said.“In the past years, rain would bring down the temperature to below 40 degrees Celsius and would provide respite to Delhiites from a spell of blistering heat. For instance, last year, the city logged excess rain — March (206%), April (23%), May (262%) and June (37%). Since no intense rain is expected in the next seven days, the mercury is expected to stay on a higher side,” the Met official said.","From May 1 to June 10, the city has seen 32 days when the temperature has been above 40 degrees Celsius.

"Apple joins AI race, brings ChatGPT to iPhone",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-joins-ai-race-brings-chatgpt-to-iphone/articleshow/110886807.cms,"Apple unveiled a long-awaited AI strategy on Monday, integrating 'Apple Intelligence' across its suite of apps including Siri, and announced a partnership with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to its devices.With these moves, the iPhone maker is seeking to reassure investors that it has not lost the AI battle to Microsoft , even though it may have forfeited a few rounds. Microsoft took an early lead in the race to commercialise AI through its bet on OpenAI. But shares of the iPhone maker were down nearly 2% in afternoon trading as investors sought more AI announcements.The AI features were unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference and Apple also showed its latest operating system for its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset and iPhone.The company said the new AI features will come with the latest software for its devices and allow users to summarize text and generate other content, such as personalized animations to wish a friend happy birthday. Apple said the ChatGPT integration would be available later this year and that other AI features will follow, adding that the chatbot could be accessed for free and that users' information will not be logged.As part of the updates, a revamped Siri will also tap in to ChatGPT's expertise and seek permission from users before querying the OpenAI service.While its AI rivals are targeting enterprises, Apple plans to stand out by making the technology relevant to its more than 1 billion users - most of whom are not tech aficionados. Apple said iOS 18, the software powering its flagship device, makes the iPhone home screen more customizable and includes improved versions of its in-house apps.The new software will also come with a ""lock an app"" feature that will help people protect sensitive information. Users can opt to lock specific apps and keep data more tightly controlled in the OS.Apple also said it would group messages in its email client starting later this year, categorizing them in a primary folder, a transactions folder, a promotions folder and other more specific groupings, for instance communications by an airline. The high-level categorizations are similar to a now-old feature in Gmail. Apple uses the developer conference at its Cupertino, California, headquarters each year to showcase updates to its own apps and operating systems as well as to show developers new tools they will be able to use in their apps.","Apple unveiled its long-awaited AI strategy on Monday, integrating 'Apple Intelligence' across its suite of apps including Siri.

The 1000PEPE-PERP offering has increased liquidity and speculation, although the meme coin has faced some volatility. PEPE trades at $0.00001446, showing a 70% gain over the past month despite a recent 4% dip. This fluctuation was partly due to a major sell-off by a whale who offloaded $5.3 million worth of PEPE, creating mixed market signals. As traders watch the whale activity closely, the question remains whether PEPE can sustain its upward trajectory.Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen its value drop by nearly 3%, trading at $0.000024. The decline has pushed SHIB below its daily SMA 50, raising investor concerns. Bulls and bears are in a tug-of-war, trying to sustain SHIB above key resistance levels. The cryptocurrency's performance in the $0.000025 to $0.00003 range is critical, with 92.2 trillion SHIB bought in this range. For SHIB to rally, it must overcome significant selling pressure and stabilise above crucial support levels, making its future uncertain.BlockDAG has surged to the top of CoinSniper, creating a significant buzz in the crypto community. This achievement is underscored by a remarkable boost count of 3,269, placing BlockDAG ahead of competitors like Playdoge and Sealana.

IMF lowers Philippine 2024 growth forecast to 6% from 6.2% estimated in April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/imf-lowers-philippine-2024-growth-forecast-to-6-from-6-2-estimated-in-april/articleshow/110872976.cms,"MANILA: The Philippine economy would likely grow 6% this year, less than forecast in April, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday, but the pace of expansion will pick up from last year as domestic demand recovers.

The IMF's latest estimate is down from its April forecast of 6.2%, but exceeds the economy's 5.5% expansion in 2023. The figure was at the lowest end of the government's 6.0-7.0% target for 2024.

The IMF maintained its 2025 growth forecast of 6.2%.

""Growth is expected to rebound...on the back of stronger consumption demand, higher public and private investment, and a recovery in exports,"" the IMF said in a statement.

The outlook is not without downside risks, the IMF said, due to geopolitical tensions, climate-related shocks, and higher interest rates.

The Philippine central bank's key policy rate is at a 17-year high of 6.50% after a series of rate hikes last year to tame inflation which has come down from a 14-year peak of 8.7% in January last year. Annual inflation averaged 3.5% in the five months to May.

With inflationary risks still tilted to the upside, the IMF said ""monetary policy should remain sufficiently restrictive to firmly anchor inflation"" within the central bank's 2.0% to 4.0% target band.

The central bank, which will meet on June 27 to review monetary policy, has said it could reduce rates as early as August and deliver another rate cut in the fourth quarter.

The discussion focused on Sharma's main argument: the common belief that the government has been shrinking in recent years is incorrect, and the solutions proposed by both major political parties may worsen the problems they intend to solve. Instead of advocating for increased government intervention through higher spending, regulation, or protectionism, Sharma suggested a rebalancing that promotes greater economic competition and individual freedom.The second event, hosted by Berkshire Hathaway's Ajit and Tinku Jain at the architectural landmark University Club, featured a probing interview conducted by renowned TV personality Fareed Zakaria.During the interview, Sharma revealed that the inspiration for his book came during the pandemic's darkest days, when governments imposed widespread lockdowns while simultaneously injecting trillions into the economy to support those confined to their homes.Sharma argued that while many considered the crisis unprecedented, it was the logical result of capitalism's gradual shift towards excessive state control, which stifles individual initiative and economic liberty. Drawing on his personal experience with statism in India, he cautioned the West against the temptation of ever-expanding government overreach.Both events were attended by 100 influential individuals, including CEOs, fund managers, authors, and thought leaders.

""Therefore, it would be surprising if his presser altered our subjective odds of a cut in September.""","US Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged this week, but could pare back the number of cuts it has penciled in for this year.
