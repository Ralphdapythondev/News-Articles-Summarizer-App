APMC constructing a mall and five-star hotel is a scam: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apmc-constructing-a-mall-and-five-star-hotel-is-a-scam-sc/articleshow/109448949.cms,"NEW DELHI: Success in business may be most Gujarati’s alter ego but the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee of Surat took it to the next level by constructing a mall and a five-star hotel on its land, which was acquired by Gujarat govt in the 1960s for the benefit of farmers.A Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and J B Pardiwala castigated Surat APMC for frittering away land meant for welfare of farmers.“This is a scam of the highest proportion. How could the APMC have used the surplus land for a mall and five-star hotel? Which law authorized it to take such a decision?”Appearing for APMC, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said it was APMC’s land and the committee was free to put it to proper use for revenue generation. “How can the Gujarat HC direct the state to take over the land and property of APMC?” The hotel lease holder through senior advocate Nidhesh Gupta said there was no irregularity in the grant of the lease to run the hotel.The bench remained unconvinced and said the HC passed the extreme order considering the level of irregularity in allotment of APMC land for a hotel and a mall. It dismissed the appeal of both the APMC and the leaseholder of the hotel.The HC bench of CJ Sunita Agarwal and Aniruddha Mayee on March 27 had ordered the state to take possession of APMC’s five-star hotel constructed on the market yard’s land. It also ordered a public auction of the property and directed authorities to deposit the amount to the state's market funds.The bench ordered action against erring officials and APMC members responsible for construction of the luxurious hotel, which violated the aims and objectives of the market yard, for which the govt had acquired about 14,000 sq mt land.The HC ordered the director of Agriculture, Marketing and Rural Finance to conduct inspection of ‘Krushi Bazar’ on allegations by a petitioner that shops in the mall were leased for sale of items like jewellery and clothes. It ordered closure of all activities in the mall that were not for the welfare of the farmers.The SC’s view found broader acceptance in the December 2019 report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture. The Committee had severely criticized the way APMCs across India, except UP and Punjab, were managed and how they were acting in detriment to the benefit of farmers. It had recommended radical reform in APMC Act in the country.","A Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and J B Pardiwala castigated Surat APMC for frittering away land meant for welfare of farmers. “This is a scam of the highest proportion.

How monsoon impacts economy

Former President Pranab Mukherjee, who was earlier a finance minister, had once remarked that the monsoon season (June-Sept) was India’s true finance minister, indicating the significance of rain during the period for the country. A lot has changed since then – large parts of India’s agriculture have been droughtproofed through irrigation networks, better varieties of seeds are being used — but the importance of summer (southwest) monsoon remains high, for some old and some new reasons.It contributes 70% of the country’s rainfall and still supports farming sector to a large extent, recharges ground water and greens energy supply by making hydro power viable. Changing food consumption pattern, more open trade and increased role of sentiments in the economy have altered the way monsoon impacts our economic life. But first, what exactly is a normal monsoon?Normal or above normal? The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted on Monday that the country is “most likely” to experience ‘above normal’ rainfall. The seasonal rainfall is likely to be 106% of long period average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5%. The LPA of seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1971- 2020 is 87cm. Factors indicating good rainfall IMD believes the gradual weakening of El Nino ( climate patterns associated with warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean), expected development of La Nina (climate pattern associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific), positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and below normal snow cover over northern hemisphere will ensure good rain this monsoon.El Nino (means ‘little boy’ in Spanish): It occurs on average every two to seven years, and typically lasts nine to 12 months. It influences weather and storm patterns in different parts of the world. The current El Nino event, which developed in June 2023 and peaked in December, was at its strongest between Nov and Jan this year.The Met department says moderate El Nino conditions are currently prevailing over the equatorial Pacific region. The latest climate model forecasts indicate that El Nino conditions are likely to weaken further to neutral El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) condition in the early part of the monsoon season.La Nina (means ‘little girl’ in Spanish): La Nina is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent. IMD says La Nina conditions are likely to develop during the second half (Aug Sept) of the monsoon season. Records show that the summer monsoon was either ‘normal’ or ‘above normal’ in most of the last 22 La Nina years since 1954, except 1974 and 2000 when it was below normal. Data from 1951 to 2023 shows that out of nine years when La Nina was preceded by El Nino, the summer monsoon seasonal rainfall was ‘above normal’ in two years, ‘excess’ in five years and on the positive side of ‘normal’ in two years.It is one of the dominant modes of variability of the tropical Indian Ocean. It is an ocean-atmosphere interaction which is very similar to El Nino. It is, therefore, also known as Indian Nino. It’s defined as the difference in sea surface temperatures between the eastern and western regions of Indian Ocean and can significantly impact weather patterns in the Indian sub-continent and elsewhere, including southeast Asia and Australia. IMD says neutral IOD conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean and the latest climate model forecasts indicate that positive IOD conditions are likely to develop during the latter part of the southwest monsoon season.Instead of quantitative rainfall over the country as a whole, it’s the distribution of fairly good rainfall across states that matters the most. Though IMD’s latest forecast predicted good rainfall in the ‘monsoon core zone’ (rainfed agriculture region of India), its other rounds of forecasts next month and at the end of June, July and August will give a fairly clear indication of spatial distribution of rainfall.Water-guzzling paddy is the main crop of the monsoon season beginning June. Though states like Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh h man age to sow fairly large areas of land even during the ‘below normal’ mon soon season as they have robust irrigation networks and they use substantial amount of groundwater with the help of subsidised fuel, the states in ‘monsoon core zone’ that largely depend on monsoon rain suffer. It also reflects in their output of Rabi (winter sown) crops such as wheat and mustard. Rabi crops benefit from good monsoon rain as it not only fills reservoirs and water bodies for irrigation during winter but also provides enough moisture content in the soil. Drought years, when the country gets less than 90% of LPA, on the other hand, affects the entire country. If we look at the past 10 years’ data, the deficient (drought) monsoon years of 2014 and 2015 resulted in a decline in overall food-grain production. Growing efforts to make the country drought-proof through measures such as expanding the irrigation network, water conservation, precision irrigation (drip and sprinkler) and use of drought-resistant seeds, however, have resulted in cushioning the impact of ‘below normal’ monsoon rains.The Indian economy, growing at 7% for three consecutive years, is expected to benefit immensely from a good monsoon. A bumper harvest adds to rural prosperity and triggers demand for everything — from motorcycles to mobile phones. It also helps calm prices as supplies improve. Robust rain also helps in reducing the demand for diesel used in the farm sector. It helps in re charging reservoirs and groundwater levels and also leads to greater hydro power generation.",The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted on Monday that the country is ‘most likely’ to experience ‘above normal’ rainfall.

"Meet Vasuki Indicus, the ‘crocodile’ that was a 50ft snake",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-vasuki-indicus-the-crocodile-that-was-a-50ft-snake/articleshow/109414059.cms,"NEW DELHI/ROORKEE: A fossil found in 2005 from Gujarat’s Kutch and believed till now to be that of a giant crocodile has turned out to be of one of the largest snakes that ever existed on Earth .The discovery of ‘ Vasuki Indicus ’ by scientists of IIT , Roorkee could prove to be a “jackpot” of information of the evolutionary process, continental shift and India’s vital link to origin of many species, especially reptiles, researchers say.According to Sunil Bajpai, chair professor in IIT-Roorkee’s department of earth sciences, this serpent measuring between 11m (36ft) and 15m (49.22ft) could have been even longer than the now extinct Titanoboa, which once lived in Colombia. The closest relatives of ‘Vasuki Indicus’, the study finds, are Titanoboa and python.Researchers said the large size of ‘Vasuki Indicus’, named after the mythical king of serpents usually depicted round the neck of Shiva and in reference to its country of discovery, would have made it a slow-moving, ambush predator akin to an anaconda.The study named, ‘Largest known madtsoiid snake from warm Eocene period of India suggests intercontinental Gondwana dispersal”, was published in ‘Scientific Reports’ on ‘Springer Nature’ platform on Friday.Bajpai and post-doctoral fellow Debajit Datta from IIT-Roorkee said the fossil of this snake recovered from the Panandhro Lignite Mine in Kutch dates back to Middle Eocene period, approximately 47 million years ago. During their exploration, the researchers discovered 27 well-preserved vertebrae that appear to be from a fully grown reptile. Its length makes it the the largest known madtsoiid snake, which thrived during a warm geological interval with average temperatures estimated at 28°C.On the finding which is as much scientific as much accidental, Bajpai said: “The fossil was found in 2005, but since I have been working on different other fossils, it went on the backburner. In 2022, we started re-examining the fossil. Initially, due to its size, I thought it was of a crocodile. But then we realised it was of a snake and it turned out to be the biggest in its family and possibly one of the biggest and similar to Titanoboa.”The scientists claim that comparing its inter-relationship with other Indian and North African madtsoiids, ‘Vasuki’ represents a now-extinct relic lineage that originated in India. Subsequent India-Asia collision led to intercontinental dispersal of this lineage from the subcontinent into North Africa through southern Eurasia. “Though this discovery we have been able to show that we have some of the most remarkable snakes in India as well as other species,” said Bajpai, who along with his fellow reserachers had also discovered the fossil of a plant-eating dinosaur believed to be 167 million years old, in Jaisalmer last year.","'Vasuki Indicus' could prove to be a ‘jackpot’ of information of the evolutionary process, continental shift and India’s vital link to origin of many species, especially reptiles.

It followed a similar notification by the Centre for Food Safety in Hong Kong. The importer, Sp Muthiah & Sons, has been directed to recall the products, SFA said in a statement on April 18.The 57-year old brand founded by late Vadilal Bhai Shah is India's largest manufacturer of pure and blended spices and is present in more than 80 countries globally.In a statement to TOI, the company said that all its products go through stringent checks before despatch and before export. Every shipment goes through quality inspection by the Spice Board of India, it said. ""We strictly follow the highest hygiene and food safety standards and norms laid down by the authorities concerned and statutory bodies like the Indian Spice Board , FSSAI and others. However, we are awaiting an official communication to understand the issue and our quality control team will look into the matter,"" it added.Everest, which competes with players like MDH Spices and Catch Foods in India's branded spices market, is pegged by analysts at well over Rs 20,000 crore and has been endorsed by Bollywood biggies like Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan.

Nestle adds sugar to infant milk sold in poorer nations but not in Europe & UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nestle-adds-sugar-to-infant-milk-sold-in-poorer-nations-but-not-in-europe-uk/articleshow/109382967.cms,"Nestle adds sugar to infant milk sold in poorer countries but not in its main markets in Europe or the UK. This was revealed when Public Eye , a Swiss investigative organisation, and IBFAN (International Baby Food Action Network) sent samples of the company's baby food products sold in Asia, Africa and Latin America to a Belgian laboratory for testing.In India, where sales surpassed $250 million in 2022, all Cerelac baby cereals contain added sugar , on average nearly 3 grams per serving.Public Eye's investigation that was made public Wednesday said Cerelac wheat-based cereals for six-month-old babies sold by Nestle in Germany, France and UK had no added sugar, while the same product contains over 5 gms per serving in Ethiopia and 6 gms in Thailand.Presented with the findings, Nigel Rollins, a scientist at WHO told Public Eye and IBFAN: ""There is a double standard here that can't be justified."" He added that the fact that Nestle doesn't add sugar to these products in Switzerland but is quite happy to do it in lower resources settings ""is problematic both from a public health & ethical perspective.""WHO warns that exposure to sugar early in life can create a life-long preference for sugary products increasing the risk of developing obesity and other chronic illnesses, the report said. In 2022, WHO had called for a ban on added sugars and sweeteners in food products for babies, and urged industry to ""be proactive"" and ""support public health goals"" by reformulating its products.Interestingly, Nestle's website giving advice on nutrition for babies states: ""It is not recommended to add sugar when preparing food for your baby, nor to offer him sugary drinks. Some leading nutrition and health experts suggest that fruit juices should not be introduced in the first year because of their relatively high natural sugar content. ...Avoid juice drinks or other mixed drinks, which have added sweeteners. Always check the label."" This doesn't seem to apply to its own products sold in low and middle income countries.Though Nestle did not respond to questions from Public Eye and IBFAN about the double standard, it stated that it ""has reduced by 11% the total amount of added sugars in infant cereal portfolio worldwide"" over the past decade and that it will ""further reduce the level of added sugars without compromising on quality, safety and taste"".When contacted by TOI, a Nestle India spokesperson said, ""Over the past 5 years, Nestle India has reduced added sugars by up to 30%... in our infant cereals portfolio"". The spokesperson added, ""We regularly review our portfolio and continue to innovate and reformulate our products to further reduce the levels of added sugars without compromising on quality, safety and taste.""","In India, where sales surpassed $250 million in 2022, all Cerelac baby cereals contain added sugar.

BSE Sensex rose over 1,200 points from the day’s low and Nifty50 move above 22,100. The Indian markets surged despite global geopolitical tensions and uncertainty. BSE Sensex ended the day at 73,088.33, up 599 points or 0.83%.Nifty50 closed the day at 22,147.00, up 151 points.While the Indian stock market experienced a significant recovery from the day's low, with both the Sensex and Nifty indexes rebounding sharply, the Indian rupee continued its downward trend, reaching a new record low against the US dollar.In the global market, oil prices surged by $3 due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market saw Bitcoin's value dip below $60,000.The Indian government bond yields climbed to a three-month high, reflecting the current economic situation. In Japan, the Tokyo's Nikkei index closed with a substantial loss of over 1,000 points.ET quoted Prashanth Tapse, Mehta Equities saying, “Nifty bears are seizing the opportunity amid Middle East tensions. However, for a sustained rally at Dalal Street , positive surprises in inflation, geo-political developments, or Q4 earnings are crucial. Wall Street experienced volatile trading on Thursday, driven by corporate earnings and Fed commentary hinting at reduced rate cut expectations. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari advocated patience, suggesting policy adjustments might not occur until 2025.”Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pulled out approximately Rs 20,000 crore from the Indian markets in just four trading sessions, despite significant events such as the start of the Lok Sabha elections and the Q4 earnings season. However, the primary concerns for FIIs are the increasing bond yields, the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, and changes in the India-Mauritius tax treaty.Market expert Ajay Bagga stated, ""The main risk to India and other oil importers is the oil price. Otherwise, it is a regional conflict. It is not that major. But the risk is if Iran chooses to strike Saudi oil refineries or bring down oil shipping in the Persian Gulf. So, India will stay equidistant. Israel is a friend of India as is Iran. As far as foreign policy goes, do not expect India to take any sides. Overall, our economy is not that impacted, but oil prices will be if this conflict escalates.""Analysts anticipate that further FII selling may occur in the near future, potentially impacting largecap stocks. Dr VK Vijayakumar from Geojit Financial Services commented, ""Investors may wait for clarity to emerge on the geopolitical front. Uncertainty is very high."" The current geopolitical situation and its potential impact on oil prices remain a significant concern for investors, leading to a cautious approach in the market.The technical analysis indicates that the previous closure around 21,800 might act as a support level for the bears, and if the bulls fail to defend it, the market could test the 100-day exponential moving average around 21,600, Osho Krishan of Angel One said.In the United States, stocks closed near the unchanged mark on Thursday as investors analyzed corporate earnings and economic data. The Dow gained 0.06%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.22% and 0.52%, respectively.Several companies, including Wipro, Jio Financial, HDFC AMC, and Hindustan Zinc, are set to announce their fourth-quarter earnings on Friday.

'Mbappe arrival will make Real Madrid complete',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/mbappe-arrival-will-make-real-madrid-complete/articleshow/109452804.cms,"PANAJI: Julio Baptista was part of the famed Real Madrid squads of the 2000s era that had Galacticos or superstars jostling for the world’s attention. The Brazilian forward shared the dressing room with the likes of Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Raul. It perhaps proved too intimidating when he joined from Sevilla FC, as a season later he was loaned to Arsenal.On his return to Los Blancos, though, he scored the winner against Barcelona in El Clasico and helped his side win the 2007-08 league title.“I have been fortunate to be part of great teams and they’ve been important moments in my career,” Baptista told TOI during a global media interaction arranged by LaLiga . “There cannot be a comparison between the Galacticos and the current team. I feel that being at Madrid drives players (forward) since the (media) impact is so huge. It’s something that you may not have with other teams.”Real Madrid president Florentino Perez abandoned his ‘Galactico’ transfer policy to build sustainable teams but could break the bank to complete the transfer of Kylian Mbappe , who has been one of the best players on the planet for a number of years now.Should, as highly-expected, the transfer go through next season, Baptista feels Madrid will become even more stronger.“If a player of Mbappe’s level comes to Real Madrid, it will make this team even more dangerous. It will give them a broader range (of attacking options), make them complete and help breach that gap in attack,” said Baptista, referring to the exits of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema that have left a void upfront.Madrid have won LaLiga twice in the last four years and the UEFA Champions League five times in a hugely-successful decade. This season, there could be more. They are now in the semifinals of the Champions League and can have at least one hand on the LaLiga crown should they put it across Barcelona in El Clasico on Sunday.With seven games left to be played, Madrid enjoy an eight-point lead over Barcelona at the top of the table.“Any team can win, but I think Real Madrid have the advantage in terms of mental strength. The mental factor plays an important role in games like the Clasico and Barcelona’s Champions League exit will hurt. Madrid players are euphoric after making it to the semis,” said Baptista.Barcelona’s adventure in the Champions League came to a painful end at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), who overhauled the Catalans’ two-goal lead in the tie. Madrid, on the other hand, fought hard to stave off the challenge of Manchester City on penalties.“It hurts to exit the Champions League and see that your rivals have progressed and playing against the best teams in the world,” said Baptista. “Let’s see how Barca players feel when they come to Madrid. (Carlo) Ancelotti will have to make changes because the players put in a huge physical effort (against City) but they will still have a competitive team with players who can make the difference on their own.""","Julio Baptista was part of the famed Real Madrid squads of the 2000s era.

The decision was made just one day before the deadline to formalize the candidate selection, following a five-hour meeting among the 10 parties comprising the Unitary Democratic Platform .The coalition initially provisionally registered Gonzalez on March 26, amid criticism after opposition leaders claimed they were obstructed from registering their preferred candidate. With Saturday marking the final deadline to solidify his candidacy, the opposition bloc moved to ensure Gonzalez's status as their official contender.The opposition coalition had to replace its initial candidate, Maria Corina Machado , who won a primary organized by the bloc in October but was subsequently barred from running by the government. Machado was disqualified from holding public office for 15 years by the ruling party-controlled State Comptroller's Office.Despite promises from Maduro's administration to facilitate fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief, the opposition has faced crackdowns ahead of the July 28 presidential election . The Biden administration recently reimposed oil sanctions, condemning Maduro's actions.Concerns have also been raised by the governments of Colombia and Brazil, with Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo accusing Maduro's government of further entrenching an anti-democratic system.In response to criticism, Venezuelan foreign minister Yvan Gil labeled it as undue interference in internal affairs of Venezuela.Maduro, a self-proclaimed socialist leader, officially launched his candidacy last month for a potential third term extending until 2031.While the election is expected to feature over 10 candidates, but except for the main opposition coalition, none are anticipated to pose a significant threat to Maduro's political stronghold.","Venezuela's primary opposition coalition has unanimously agreed to support former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez.

Working independently, they aimed to draw attention to the ongoing challenges faced by those seeking missing persons across Mexico, where nearly 100,000 people are registered as missing.Operating without official support, these search groups face significant risks, with documented cases of violence against those involved in searching for missing relatives, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other organizations.Over the weekend, hundreds of collectives across the country conducted search operations to highlight the lack of assistance from authorities. They chose to work without government protection as a form of protest against what they perceive as authorities' indifference towards disappearances.Juan Carlos Trujillo Herrera, who has been searching for his four missing brothers for over a decade, emphasized the importance of collective action in raising awareness about the issue. Despite challenges and dangers, he stressed the need to continue searching with or without government support.During the search at the dump, volunteers utilized various tools, including shovels, picks, and a backhoe, to sift through the waste. Despite ongoing efforts by the current administration to address the issue through initiatives like a national database and the National Search Commission for Missing Persons, criticism persists, particularly regarding the handling of missing persons' data.","Dozens of women and men engaged in a search effort at a garbage dump near Mexico City on Friday.

The advisory comes following the disruption caused by unprecedented weather conditions in the UAE earlier this week because of which DXB “has temporarily limited the number of inbound flights.”“While the UAE authorities are working round the clock to ensure normalisation of operations, the situation is unprecedented. Airport authorities have advised that passengers may travel to the Airport only after final confirmation from the respective airlines regarding the departure date and time of the respective flights,” the embassy said.While announcing temporary suspension of check-ins for transfers, Emirates said Friday: “Passengers already in Dubai and in transit will be accepted on their flights.

"No vacations, no flights, no hotels: How China is punishing 'delinquent debtors'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/no-vacations-no-flights-no-hotels-how-china-is-punishing-delinquent-debtors/articleshow/109397610.cms,"NEW DELHI: China is grappling with an economic slowdown exacerbated by a significant rise in personal debt, which has surged by 50% in the past five years to approximately $11 trillion. This staggering figure, though lower than the $17.5 trillion owed by Americans, is considerable given the lower income levels in China. The economic downturn is marked by falling home prices, increasing the risk of entrenched deflation, and persistent unemployment challenges.This financial strain is affecting consumer behavior significantly, as more funds are allocated to debt repayment rather than discretionary spending, such as new clothing or vacations.As per a Wall Street Journal report, in response to this economic crisis, Chinese authorities have intensified their efforts to enforce debt repayment. This crackdown involves severe penalties for those who fail to meet their financial obligations. Measures include seizing salaries, restricting employment opportunities in government jobs, and limiting access to luxury services like high-speed trains and air travel. Moreover, individuals with outstanding debts are often barred from purchasing expensive insurance policies, taking vacations or staying in upscale hotels. The number of people listed on the government's publicly available delinquency blacklist has soared by nearly 50% since late 2019, reaching 8.3 million.Chinese policies do not allow for personal bankruptcy declarations for most citizens, unlike in the US, where individuals can discharge insurmountable debts and start afresh. This lack of a financial relief mechanism is being increasingly criticized by Chinese scholars as unfair, particularly in light of the economic pressures faced by the population.The personal stories of those caught in the debt trap highlight the human impact of these policies. Qin Huangsheng's tale is particularly poignant, the WSJ report said. Once a hopeful factory worker who moved from her rural village at 16, Qin is now in her early 40s and saddled with $40,000 in debt on a base salary of just $400 a month. The government restrictions have barred her from using the high-speed rail network, limiting her to slower, aging trains where she reflects on her and her fellow passengers' plight: “I wonder if they’re all bad debtors like me.”However, she chose not to disclose the extent of her difficulties to her parents. If they were aware of the full situation, Qin said, they “wouldn’t be able to sleep.”Another individual, a 38-year-old man from Guangzhou, petitioned the courts to raise his monthly allowance to better support his newborn child. However, the courts not only denied his request but also reduced his existing allowance, further tightening the financial noose. The punitive measures have even spawned a black market, helping those barred from purchasing high-speed train tickets to circumvent the restrictions, though authorities are cracking down on these activities as well.These individual experiences underscore the broader challenges facing many in China today. Critics argue for the introduction of a personal bankruptcy system that would allow debtors a chance to recover, thus supporting broader economic stability and fairness, the WSJ report added.","China's personal debt has surged by 50% in the past five years to approximately $11 trillion.

H5N1 bird flu strain detected in milk: WHO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h5n1-bird-flu-strain-detected-in-milk-who/articleshow/109438308.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday announced that the H5N1 bird flu virus strain had been found in significant quantities in raw milk from infected animals , though the duration of the virus's survival in milk remains unknown.Earlier in 1996, Avian influenza A(H5N1) initially surfaced, but since 2020, there has been a remarkable surge in outbreaks among birds, with an increasing number of mammals also falling victim to the disease.This has resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, along with infections in wild birds, as well as land and marine mammals.Last month, cows and goats were added to the list of affected animals, surprising experts who previously didn't consider them susceptible to this strain of influenza. The outbreak of bird flu in cow has affected at least 13 herds in six states, as per the New York Times.The reports of sick cows began to emerge in Texas and New Mexico. Dead birds were also found on some of these farms, and laboratory testing confirmed that some cows were infected with bird flu.Earlier this month, US authorities reported a case of a person recovering from bird flu after exposure to infected cattle on a Texas dairy farm.""The case in Texas is the first case of a human infected by avian influenza by a cow,"" said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization.""Bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow and cow-to-bird transmission have also been registered during these current outbreaks, which suggest that the virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood,"" she told a media briefing in Geneva.This incident marks only the second case of human infection with bird flu in the United States, following illnesses in herds apparently exposed to wild birds.""Now we see multiple herds of cows affected in an increasing number of US states, which shows a further step of the virus spillover to mammals,"" Zhang said.""The virus has also been detected in milk from infected animals.""Zhang said there was a ""very high virus concentration in raw milk"", but experts were still investigating exactly how long the virus is able to survive in milk.The Texas health department assured that infected cattle do not pose a threat to the commercial milk supply since dairies are mandated to discard milk from sick cows, and pasteurization effectively kills the virus.""It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming only pasteurised milk and milk products,"" said Zhang.(With inputs from agency)","The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday announced that the H5N1 bird flu virus strain had been found in significant quantities in raw milk from infected animals. Since 2020, there has been a remarkable surge in outbreaks among birds, with an increasing number of mammals also falling victim to the disease.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109438877,imgsize-23560,width-400,resizemode-4/109438877.jpg"
Indian-origin men involved in Canada's largest-ever gold and money heist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indian-origin-men-involved-in-canadas-largest-ever-gold-and-money-heist/articleshow/109415390.cms,"It was a brazen theft: thousands of gold bars and millions of dollars in bank notes stolen a year ago from Toronto's international airport.Canadian and US authorities said on Wednesday six people, including two Indian-origin men , have been arrested and three more are being sought in connection with what they called the largest gold heist in Canadian history - a cargo of over C$22 million ($16 million) in gold and currency.The arrests were announced after a long-year investigation under Project 24K. The suspects, including two Air Canada employees, forged an airway bill to steal a cargo arriving from Switzerland of C$20 million-worth 6,600 gold bars weighing 400 kg and C$2.5 million in foreign currency, police officials said. The gold was melted down and used to purchase illegal firearms. ""This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,"" said Nishan Duraiappah, chief of Peel police, responsible for law enforcement at Toronto airport .The gold theft appeared to be remarkably simple. The gold and cash arrived at the Toronto airport in a special container aboard an Air Canada flight from Switzerland on April 17, 2023, and it was moved to one of the airline's warehouses. The container held gold bars that were destined for a Toronto-based bank and bank notes bound for a currency exchange. About two hours later, a truck driven by a man who was arrested in Pennsylvania pulled up at the warehouse. The man carried a waybill - a document usually issued by a carrier with details about a shipment - that gave him access to the warehouse. It was actually a duplicate of a waybill, printed on an Air Canada printer, for a shipment of seafood that had been picked up a day earlier. The container with the gold bars and bank notes was loaded into the truck. Video recordings showed the truck travelling down Canada's busiest highway before eventually disappearing from sight in a rural area west of the city.Peel police officers were called early the next morning after an armoured truck of Brinks, an American cash handling company, arrived with the actual waybill for the shipment of gold and bank notes. Canada police said Wednesday that they believe the gold bars, which had serial numbers, were all melted down and that they had seized smelting pots. The only gold recovered, police said, was six bracelets made out of C$89,000 worth of gold.Air Canada employee Parmpal Sidhu, 54, from Brampton, Ontario, jewellery store owner Ali Raza, 37, from Toronto, Amit Jalota, 40, an Oakville, Ontario resident, Ammad Chaudhary, 43, from Georgetown, Ontario and Prasath Paramalingam, 35, from Brampton are among those that have been arrested. According to a PTI report, Sidhu and Jalota are of Indian origin. Police are searching for former Air Canada manager Simran Preet Panesar, 31, from Brampton as well as Archit Grover, 36, from Brampton and Arsalan Chaudhary, 42, from Ontario.Peel detective sergeant Mike Mavity said the truck driver that allegedly picked up the gold, Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old from Brampton, is currently in custody in the US. Sixty-five illegal firearms were found in his possession, two of which had been modified to have fully automatic capabilities.They were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada. ""This is a story about reverse alchemy,"" said Nando Iannicca, chair of Peel Police Services Board. ""This is about how gold becomes guns.""","Six people, including two Indian-origin men, have been arrested in connection with the largest gold heist in Canadian history.

NEW DELHI: A New York appeals court judge on Friday dismissed Donald Trump 's attempt to halt his hush money criminal trial over defense complaints that jury selection was unfairly rushed, reported AP.Justice Marsha Michael quickly made the decision following a short hearing. This decision came hours after the jury selection process concluded in Trump's criminal trial , which is currently taking place roughly two miles south.The ruling is set to proceed with opening arguments starting on Monday before prosecutors begin laying out their case alleging a scheme to cover up negative stories Trump feared would hurt his 2016 presidential campaign.A jury comprising 12 individuals and six alternates was seated for the trial setting the stage for opening statements next week.The completion of the jury selection process marks the first criminal trial of a former US president, with allegations of Trump falsifying business records to suppress stories about his personal life during the 2016 election. The jury features a diverse group, including a sales professional, a software engineer, an English teacher, and multiple lawyers.The jury selection process initially progressed swiftly, with seven jurors selected by Tuesday. However, two jurors were dismissed on Thursday, one citing concerns about impartiality and the other facing questions about past disclosures on whether he had provided accurate answers.This hush money case is the first of Trump's four indictments to proceed to trial, centering around a $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels by Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer to prevent her allegations of a sexual encounter with Trump from going public in 2016.Facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, Trump could potentially receive up to four years in prison if found guilty, though it's uncertain whether the judge would opt for imprisonment. Trump would likely appeal any conviction.","A New York appeals court judge dismissed Donald Trump's attempt to halt his hush money criminal trial over defense complaints that jury selection was unfairly rushed.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Maldives, opposition parties are calling for an investigation and possible impeachment of President Mohamed Muizzu in response to a leaked report dating back to 2018 alleging corruption.The parliamentary elections for the Majlis are scheduled for Sunday, ahead of which, the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and President Muizzu 's People's National Congress (PNC) have engaged in trading barbs and accusations against each other.The political turmoil began when an anonymous individual using the handle 'Hassan Kurusee' shared leaked intelligence reports on social media, which included documents from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Maldives Monetary Authority and the Maldives Police Service. These reports purportedly linked President Muizzu to financial misconduct, citing irregularities in money transfers to his personal bank account and suggesting possible involvement with politically exposed individuals, embezzlement, structured transactions, and the use of corporate entities to conceal fund origins.The allegations sparked a firestorm of reactions on social media, with demands from the MDP and People's National Front (PNF) for an official investigation into the matter. Former vice president Dr Mohamed Jameel Ahmed went a step further, calling for President Muizzu's impeachment based on the leaked intelligence reports. Jameel emphasized the importance of accountability in governance and urged President Muizzu to cooperate with independent investigations into the allegations, including those related to the Ras Male' development project and alleged excessive spending on public relations.President Muizzu responded to the corruption allegations on Tuesday, asserting that the opposition's attempts to implicate him were baseless and driven by desperation. He denied any wrongdoing and accused the opposition of leaking the reports to tarnish his reputation.""The same allegations had been made during his campaigns for mayor and President,"" he said adding, the response would also be the same as before.""While you attempt to pin something on me like this, you couldn't do it before and you can't do it now.

NEW DELHI: In an attempt to woo Indian tourists back to Maldives, a major tourism body in the island nation has revealed plans to conduct road shows across several key Indian cities. The move comes as the number of Indian visitors to the Maldives has seen a decline in recent times.The Maldives Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (MATATO) disclosed its intention to hold discussions with India's high commissioner in the Maldives, Munu Mahawar, to explore ways to enhance travel and tourism cooperation between the two countries.The decision to ramp up efforts to draw Indian tourists follows a significant backlash against the Maldives triggered by derogatory remarks made against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media by three Maldivian officials. This backlash led to numerous cancellations of reservations and a drop in plans to visit the Maldives by Indian tourists, including several celebrities.According to statistics from the Maldives' ministry of tourism, India, which was previously one of the top visitor countries, has slipped to the sixth position in terms of tourist arrivals. China currently leads with the highest number of tourists, followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, and Germany.Following discussions held at the Indian high commission in Male, MATATO announced plans to collaborate closely with the Indian high commission to boost tourism initiatives. This includes launching comprehensive road shows across key Indian cities and organizing influencer and media familiarization trips to the Maldives in the coming months.MATATO emphasized the importance of India as a crucial tourist market for the Maldives and expressed its eagerness to partner with prominent travel associations and industry stakeholders in India to promote the Maldives as a premier travel destination.This initiative comes amid tensions between the Maldives and India, with Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu previously requesting the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the country, citing sovereignty concerns. Muizzu has announced plans to repatriate all Indian military personnel from the Maldives by May 10.",The Maldives Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (MATATO) has revealed plans to conduct road shows across several key Indian cities. The move comes as the number of Indian visitors to the Maldives has seen a decline in recent times.

Labour MP meets JKLF leader in UK Parliament to discuss Yasin Malik trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/labour-mp-meets-jklf-leader-in-uk-parliament-to-discuss-yasin-malik-trial/articleshow/109443691.cms,"LONDON: A Labour MP has sparked outrage after meeting with members of Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) UK and JKLF “diplomatic bureau” chairman Zafar Khan in the British Parliament to discuss the ongoing trial of Kashmiri separatist Yasin Malik. JKLF is a banned organisation in India.JKLF has been declared an unlawful association in India for inciting terror and abetting secessionism in Jammu and Kashmir.MP Rachel Hopkins, who represents Luton South, which has a large Mirpuri diaspora, wrote on X: “This afternoon JKLF UK and my constituent Zafar Khan held an important meeting to update us on Yasin Malik’s ongoing trial and appeal against the death sentence.I continue to stand up for Kashmiris and their right to self-determination.” The tweet includes pictures of the meeting being held in a committee room of the British Parliament.JKLF chairman Malik was given a life sentence in 2022 after pleading guilty to charges relating to terrorism and sedition. The NIA appealed his sentence and is seeking the death penalty.Overseas Friends of BJP UK president Kuldeep Shekhawat told TOI that this move by the Labour MP “is unacceptable as JKLF is a banned organisation in India” and that “this proves Labour’s continued support to extremism and policy of interference in India’s internal affairs”,Vinod Tikoo, volunteer at the Jammu Kashmir Study Centre UK, told TOI: “Rubaiya Sayeed, daughter of former Union home minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who was kidnapped in 1989 in Kashmir, has identified Yasin as the person who kidnapped her. For an MP to host Yasin’s sympathisers in the UK Parliament is murder of democracy.”Friends of India Society International UK said: “It’s appalling to see a British parliamentarian sympathising and intentionally disregarding the multitude of facts regarding Yasin Malik and his terror-affiliated organisation, JKLF, to cater to vote-bank politics.”Indian Kashmiri Muslim Javed Beigh wrote on X: “Yasin Malik stands accused of initiating a violent, bloody, Islamist separatist movement at the behest ofPakistan in early 1990s which… completely destroyed Indian ethnic Kashur-speaking Kashmiri society.

Kenvue was not immediately available for comment, but said this week it was conducting its own assessment and working with health authorities to determine a course of action.Since Nigeria's recall, five other African countries have also pulled the product from shelves - Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa, where the drug was made.South Africa’s regulator has also recalled another batch of the syrup, which is used to treat coughs, hay fever and other allergic reactions in children.Diethylene glycol is toxic to humans when consumed and can result in acute kidney failure, although there have been no reports of harm in the latest incident.In the 2022 cases, the contamination in the syrups came from the raw materials used by manufacturers in India and Indonesia.The WHO said it was collaborating with both the manufacturer and regulatory authority in South Africa to investigate this for the Benylin paediatric syrup, and had information on the source of the raw ingredients used. It did not disclose the source.According to WHO, Kenvue said it tested the raw ingredients used in the syrup before manufacture, and ""no issues of concern were noted"".The agency said the possibility that the syrup was counterfeit was also ""under consideration as part of investigations"".","Nigeria's regulator recalled a batch of Benylin syrup last Wednesday.

UK PM Rishi Sunak to Consult on Tougher Rules to Combat 'Sick Note Culture',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-to-consult-on-tougher-rules-to-combat-sick-note-culture/articleshow/109420311.cms,"NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is considering tightening the rules around long-term sick leave to address the growing number of Britons permanently leaving the workforce .The participation of working-age Britons in the labor force has hit its lowest level since 2015, primarily due to an increase in long-term illness and a higher number of students compared to other large, wealthy nations which have seen rising participation since 2020.""We need to be more ambitious about helping people back to work and more honest about the risk of over-medicalising the everyday challenges and worries of life,"" said Sunak in a speech in London, seeking to appeal to core Conservative voters and arguing that a 'sicknote culture' around mental health needed to be reined in.Official data reveals that 9.4 million Britons aged 16 to 64, representing 22% of this age group, are neither employed nor actively seeking employment, a notable increase from pre-pandemic levels. Among them, 2.8 million are on long-term sick leave, while 206,000 are temporarily unwell.A report from last year highlighted that a significant portion of individuals on long-term sick leave were awaiting medical treatment, with the prospect of reducing waiting times to pre-2015 levels potentially reintegrating 25,000 individuals into the workforce. Over 50% of long-term sick individuals cited issues like depression, anxiety, or nervousness, often alongside their primary health condition.Sunak's office pointed out a tendency among healthcare professionals to issue prolonged sick notes instead of actively supporting individuals in returning to work, leading many to transition to long-term sickness benefits. ""We don't just need to change the sick note, we need to change the sick note culture , so the default becomes what work you can do – not what you can't,"" he said.Sunak proposed a potential shift in the assessment responsibility from general practitioners to healthcare workers tasked with providing objective evaluations of an individual's work capacity and the customized support needed for their reintegration.",British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is considering tightening the rules around long-term sick leave.
