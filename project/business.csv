"TDP's priority is to 'rebuild' Andhra Pradesh, take it out of debt trap: Kanakamedal Ravindra Kumar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tdps-priority-is-to-rebuild-andhra-pradesh-take-it-out-of-debt-trap-kanakamedal-ravindra-kumar/articleshow/109638600.cms,"VIJAYAWADA: A senior TDP leader has said the priority of the party is to "" rebuild "" Andhra Pradesh and take the state out of the debt trap by getting rid of the YSR Congress Party ( YSRCP ) government. Telugu Desam Party (TDP) National Coordinator (Election) and ex-Rajya Sabha MP Kanakamedal Ravindra Kumar said Andhra Pradesh has suffered more losses during the Jagan Mohan Reddy government than during the creation of the two Telugu states in 2014 when resources were shared with Telangana.According to the state government data, the public debt of Andhra Pradesh has increased from 31.02 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in 2019-20 to 33.32 per cent in 2023-24 fiscal, indicating deterioration in the fiscal health of the state in the last five years.""Under the role of Jagan Mohan Reddy (Andhra CM) in the state, our party's priorities have changed. Our main priority is to get rid of Jagan Mohan Reddy and rebuild the state which has gone back 20 years,"" Kumar told PTI in an interview.Given the changed priorities, the TDP has returned to NDA tying up with BJP and Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena party (JSP) for both assembly and Parliamentary polls to safeguard the existence and the interest of Andhra Pradesh, he said.""The reason behind the alliance is to ensure not to divide the anti-government vote,"" he noted.Claiming that the rise in corruption and anti-incumbency sentiments against the YSRCP government will favour the TDP this time, the party leader said the TDP is highlighting these issues in the campaign along with the six promises it plans to implement if voted to power.The TDP's six polls promises are: create 20 lakh jobs for youth and provide monthly unemployment allowance of RS 3,000 till they secure a job; give Rs 15,000 a year to every school-going child, three free gas cylinders a year; Rs 20,000 annually to Annadata scheme farmers; Rs 1,500 per month to women aged 18 to 59 under Aadabidda Nidhi Scheme and free bus service to women.Asked if the TDP was playing into the hands of BJP as the saffron party might get the support of the regional parties if either wins, Kumar said, ""There is a possibility. But we are supporting BJP at the cost of the future of over 5 crore Andhra people.""""The state development is the main consideration for the party, we don't want to consider central politics at this stage. Priorities will change only when things are set right in Andhra Pradesh, not now,"" he said.In the simultaneous 2024 polls to be held on May 13, TDP is contesting Lok Sabha polls from 17 seats, JSP in six and BJP in two. In the case of the assembly poll, TDP is contesting from 144 seats, JSP in 21, and BJP in 10 seatsIn the 2019 elections, the TDP exited NDA over the alleged lack of enough central funding and demand for special status for Andhra Pradesh. Kalyan withdrew support to the TDP in 2018.Expressing concern over the rising public debt of the state government, Kumar claimed that the debt has risen multifold in the last five years due to ""misrule"" and ""mis-administration"". The state finances are in such bad shape that the government is taking loans from the RBI to release pensions to its employees. ""The loss sustained by Jagan Mohan Reddy's regime is more than the loss incurred due to the state bifurcation,"" he claimed.The TDP leader said that the YSRCP has failed to fulfill several promises including special status to the state, made during the 2019 elections. The CM had promised that if YSRCP gets 25 MP seats from Andhra Pradesh then it would get a special status.""But after coming to power, he forgot that promise...he visited Delhi not less than 31 times in the last five years. He did not make any demand from the Centre for fear of arrest and threat. He is on the ventilator of the central government,"" he claimed.He further claimed that the central government's schemes have not been implemented in Andhra Pradesh because the state government has not provided a matching grant. ""The central funds have been diverted in the state,"" he said.The CM has also failed to create a new capital for Andhra Pradesh even after completion of ten years of sharing Hyderabad as common capital with Telangana as per the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, he said.Adding to people's woes, the state government has recently come out with a new 'land title law' under which the original property document of a buyer will be vested with the state government and a revenue authority will be constituted to resolve the disputes and not civil courts, he claimed.""This is a dangerous Act and takes away the rights of the people,"" he added.

"5,000 tonne of onions to be irradiated to ensure higher availability of onions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5000-tonne-of-onions-to-be-irradiated-to-ensure-higher-availability-of-onions/articleshow/109638011.cms,"NEW DELHI: In its bid to ensure more availability of onion when supply dips, govt has decided to irradiate 5,000 tonne of the key kitchen item this year, which will improve shelf-life and reduce storage losses . Last year as a pilot 1,200 tonne of onion was irradiated using gamma rays in line with the protocol developed by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre ( BARC ).BARC has developed onion-specific irradiation and cold storage system which extends shelf-life of onion harvested in summer months upto seven and a half months. The irradiation of onion reduces storage losses to only 10% compared to the normal level of 25%. Govt is also looking at expanding the irradiation facilities built in collaboration with BARC currently at Lasalgaon in Nashik.Sources said govt plans to store the irradiated onion in cold stores located in areas such as Delhi-NCR, which face supply crisis during lean season rather than having them only in Nasik. “Since the irradiated onions need to be disposed off quickly after taking them out from cold stores, we need to keep them near consumption centres. Transporting them from part of the country to another causes more damage to the produce,” said a source.This will reduce transportation losses.Last month, govt instructed National Cooperative Consumers Federation (NCCF) and farmers’ cooperative Nafed to start procurement of 5 lakh tonne of onion from farmers at market price for the buffer. In 2023, Nafed and NCCF had bought 6.5 lakh tonne of onion from farmers for the buffer.","Last year as a pilot 1,200 tonne of onion was irradiated using gamma rays.

'Seal EVM symbol loading units for 45 days': Highlights from SC verdict on VVPAT case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/highlights-from-supreme-court-verdict-on-vvpat/articleshow/109619204.cms,"Here is what the bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar said:

""We have rejected all of them, after referring to the protocol in place, technical aspects and data which is on record,"" said the bench in separate yet concurring judgements.

The apex court gave two directions saying, ""One direction is after the completion of symbol loading process, the Symbol Loading Unit (SLU) should be sealed in containers. The SLU should be stored at least for a period of 45 days.""

In its second directive, the top court specified that a team of engineers would examine the burnt memory in the microcontroller EVM upon request by candidates, which must be made within seven days after the declaration of results.

The bench stated that candidates requesting verification would be responsible for covering the expenses, and if the EVM is discovered to be tampered with, the incurred costs will be reimbursed.

""While maintaining a balanced perspective is crucial in evaluating systems or institutions, blindly distrusting any aspect of the system can breed unwarranted scepticism...,"" Justice Datta said. ""Instead, a critical yet constructive approach guided by evidence and reason should be followed... to ensure the system's credibility and effectiveness.""

""It is of immediate relevance to note that in recent years, a trend has been fast developing of certain vested interest groups endeavouring to undermine the achievements and accomplishments of the nation, earned through the hard work and dedication of its sincere workforce. There seems to be a concerted effort to discredit, diminish, and weaken the progress of this great nation on every possible frontier.

Justice Datta said one cannot be oblivious that in a society pledged to uphold the rule of law, none - howsoever high or low – is above the law. ""Concepts of unfettered discretion or unaccountable action has no place in the matter of governance; hence, neither can the ECI nor can any other authority claim to possess arbitrary power over the interests of an individual voter and seek cover from the sunlight of judicial scrutiny if, indeed, a valid cause is set up for interference,"" he said.

He said sanctity of the electoral process has to be secured at any cost has never been in doubt.

He said the larger the electorate, greater are the challenges associated with the elections and the EC has an onerous responsibility to shoulder and there is absolutely no margin for error.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday rejected all the petitions seeking 100 per cent verification of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) votes with their Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail ( VVPAT ) slips. The apex court also rejected pleas to revert to paper ballot voting system.An EVM consists of three components: the ballot unit, control unit, and the VVPAT (Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail).Each of these units contains microcontrollers with pre-programmed burnt memory provided by the manufacturer. Presently, the Election Commission conducts random matching of VVPAT slips with EVMs at five polling booths per assembly constituency.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also hailed Supreme Court verdict and said that the judgment was a “tight slap” on the Congress-led opposition which must “apologise” for committing the “sin of creating distrust” against Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).""Today, when the whole world is praising India's democracy, the country's election process, and the use of technology in elections, these people were busy in defaming EVM for their personal interests,"" PM Modi said. ""Look at the power of the country's democracy and Baba Saheb Ambedkar's Constitution, today the Supreme Court has given such a severe blow to those who intended to loot the ballot boxes that all their dreams have been shattered.

Rahul's attack comes amid PM Modi's relentless campaign against the Congress targeting the grand old party over charges of ""redistribution of wealth"" and ""implementing of inheritance tax.""At an election rally in Karnataka, Rahul said: “You have heard the Prime Minister's speeches.He is scared. It's possible that he may shed tears on stage.” “Modi tries to divert your attention. Sometimes he talks about China and Pakistan, and sometimes he will make you beat plates and ask you to switch on the torch light of your mobile phones,” he added.In his recent election speeches, PM Modi has accused the Congress of having plans to carry out a wealth survey and then redistribute the assets of people to minorities, especially Muslims, if voted to power. The Prime Minister has linked Congress's manifesto pitch of socio economic and caste survey with a 2006 remark of Manmohan Singh to corner the grand old party. The Congress has accused the Prime Minister of quoting words out of contest from the manifesto to mislead the people and spread lies.Rahul Gandhi claimed that the Prime Minister is not saying anything on the core issues in India including poverty, unemployment and price rise.""Modi has only snatched money from poor people. He has made some billionaires. There are 22 people who have wealth equivalent to the 70 crore people of the country. Just one per cent people are controlling 40 per cent of the wealth of the nation,” the former Congress chief alleged.He claimed that in the present scheme of things, there is ""no scope"" for Dalits, OBCs, tribals, minorities and poor general category people.“I will just tell you a clear thing in a simple one line. The wealth Modi has given to those billionaires, the same money we are going to give to the poor people of the country,” he added.The Congress leader also promised the youth that his party will scrap the ‘Agniveer' scheme if it is voted to power. He dubbed the ‘Agniveer' scheme in the armed forces offering three years services to the youth from 18 years to 21 years as an insult to the Army and soldiers.“Narendra Modi snatched the Army jobs from the youth of India. He brought the Agniveer scheme, which is an insult to the Indian Army and soldiers. We will scrap it,” Rahul said.Rahul also charged PM Modi with imposing a faulty GST where he introduced five different types of tax, which are hefty. Alleging that the PM was doing injustice to Karnataka, he said the Congress will change the GST and rectify the injustice meted out to the people of the state.Rahul also took a veiled swipe at PM Modi saying that this election is different from previous ones. ""This election is not an ordinary election, it's not like the previous elections because, for the first time in the history of India, a party and an individual are trying to abolish the constitution and democracy of India,"" he said.(With inputs from PTI)","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accuses PM Narendra Modi of diverting public attention from real issues facing the people.

Naha said that as many as five chartered flights had been arranged from UAE alone for this election, facilitated by Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre (KMCC) affiliated to the IUML.Apart from that, many expats had come home through mass bookings in normal flights.As 13 states went to polls in the third phase of Lok Sabha elections on Friday, many NRIs made it a point to fly down to cast their vote.While many flew to the coastal states of Kerala and Karnataka, in the north, Meerut saw 3 NRIs fly home to exercise their voting rights. Manav Tyagi (35) hails from New Zealand, while Gaurav Gulati (37), an IT professional, returned from Germany, and Harsh Vardhan Agarwal (31) came from the US.Tyagi, a resident of Rasna village in UP’s Meerut district, said, “I have been living in New Zealand for 10 years. I went there to pursue my higher studies in 2014 and got a job there. I even qualified for citizenship, but I did not take it because I did not want to let go of my right to vote in India. In New Zealand, they still conduct elections on ballots, but India is doing a commendable job by conducting electronic polls with such a huge population.”In Kerala, expats taking chartered flights back home to cast vote became the talk of the town. Hassan Chalil, state president of Dubai KMCC, who cast his vote in Nadapuram under Vadakara LS constituency, said that expat voters had come in two chartered ‘vote flights’ to Vadakara constituency alone. They booked flights to come home for voting from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other Gulf countries, Chalil said.According to sources, around 12 ‘vote flights’ would have arrived in Kerala ahead of the elections. “We were able to provide tickets to voters at a rate of AED 349 through negotiations with airline companies,” Chalil, who had been working in the UAE for 35 years in the restaurant sector, said.Mangaluru saw many NRIs take leave for a few days to return home to vote. Christopher Roshan Lobo, a resident of Kulshekar near Mangaluru, said he decided to return home for the weekend rather than stay back in Bahrain where he is employed.“I flew into Mangaluru on Thursday evening and will return on Saturday,” Lobo said, adding that he was among many who arrived at the polling station before it opened at 7am on Friday.Gokuldas Bhat, from Belthangady who owns and runs a transport company in Kuwait, gave 45 of his employees two days leave to return and vote, while Abdulla Madumoole from Abu Dhabi posted on X: “Spent almost 1 lakh rupees for this one mark — in an effort to bring back sanity, civility, and normalcy to our great nation.”Harsha DM and his wife Spoorthi CS, who hail from Bengaluru, landed in the city from Sydney on Thursday. Harsha voted at a polling station in Dasarahalli near Hebbal, while Spoorthi exercised her voting franchise at a booth in Hebbal, both in the Bangalore North Lok Sabha constituency.","13 states went to polls in the third phase of Lok Sabha elections on Friday. Many NRIs made it a point to fly down to cast their vote. While many flew to the coastal states of Kerala and Karnataka, Meerut saw 3 NRIs fly home to exercise their voting rights.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109634094,imgsize-37900,width-400,resizemode-4/109634094.jpg"
Water shortage looms for southern India as reservoir levels in 5 states reduce to 17% of capacity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/water-levels-in-42-reservoirs-in-south-india-drop/articleshow/109634068.cms,"NEW DELHI: Looming water shortage continues to stare at southern India as level of storage of 42 key reservoirs in five states - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu - has collectively reduced to 17% of the reservoir capacity, bringing the level to lower than the storage during the corresponding period last year. Individually, Kerala’s reservoirs have, however, better storage than last year.Data released by the Central Water Commission (CWC) shows that these reservoirs had 8.8 billion cubic meters (BCM) of water as on Thursday (April 25) against a total storage capacity of 53.3 BCM.The storage during the corresponding period of last year was 29% of total capacity whereas average storage of the last 10 years during corresponding period was 23% of the total live storage capacity of these reservoirs.“Thus, storage during current year (17% of total capacity) is less than the storage of corresponding period of last year and is also less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period,” said a weekly bulletin on status of the country’s 150 key reservoirs, spread over five regions, monitored by the CWC.Though water level in reservoirs of other regions, except the eastern region, too declined compared to the live storage during the corresponding period last year, reservoirs in the southern region showed the steepest fall.Overall, 150 reservoirs across the country collectively had 53.3 BCM of waters which was 30% of the total live capacity of 178.7 BCM on Thursday. Reduction in water level at this time of the year is, however, not unusual, but its sharp decline this year is quite worrisome as monsoon is still more than a month away from the country’s mainland.“The overall higher decline in reservoirs across India is attributed to below average monsoon rainfall last year. Less monsoon rains means less storage in these reservoirs during the rainy season and more withdrawal of water during the post-monsoon phase, both for drinking and irrigation purposes,” said an official.He said the forecast of ‘above normal’ monsoon rainfall this year would, however, bring relief.","42 key reservoirs in five states - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu - collectively reduced to 17% of the reservoir capacity.

PM Modi doubles down on charge of appeasement after Manmohan video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-doubles-down-on-charge-of-appeasement-after-manmohan-video/articleshow/109634074.cms,"NEW DELHI: Armed with a video of his predecessor Manmohan Singh standing by his remark that “minorities, particularly Muslims”, should have first claim on the nation’s resources , PM Modi on Friday claimed vindication and sharpened his “appeasement” charge against Congress and its allies.In the 2009 video, Singh, possibly in response to a question at a presser, twice iterates the statement he first made at the 2006 meeting of National Development Council about Muslims being prioritised in allocation of resources.“I said minorities, particularly Muslim minorities, if they are poorer, they have prior claim on economic resources of the country. I said all minorities and I added particularly Muslim minorities... and I stand by that,” Singh said is seen saying.PM’s response was swift and aggressive. “Today, another old video of Manmohan Singh has surfaced where he is again saying that Muslims have the first right to the country's resources. I urge the media to make people aware of this video and debate it. The country also needs to know the mindset of those who ran the coalition government for 10 years,” he said at a rally in Araria in Bihar.Modi said the video had exposed Congress and others who accused him of distorting Singh's 2006 comment. “The video which has surfaced today has exposed Congress and the INDI Alliance parties and their ecosystem seems numbed. They spread the lie that Manmohan Singh never made any such assessment. They abused me without any basis, evidence or fact check,” he added.Modi said BJP's approach over who should have the first claim on national resources was very different as it believed in prioritising the poor, irrespective of their caste and community. ""We believe that the first claim is that of the poor, of the worker, of the farm labourer, of our poor mothers and sisters. They believe inappeasement , whereas we believe in saturating all with benefits,"" he said.The ""appeasement"" charge ran through a thread at the speeches also in Munger and Malda, with the PM repeating the allegation that Congress's manifesto reflected the influence of Muslim League and linking Singh's pitch for privileging Muslims to Congress's plan to conduct a survey of wealth and assets as a prelude to equitable distribution. He also attacked other members of INDI Alliance for their silence over Congress's plan to conduct an ""X-ray"" of who owned how much assets. ""They are all glued by their politics of appeasement,"" he said.The PM also accused Congress of having ""stolen"" reservations meant for OBCs and transferring the benefits to Muslims in Karnataka, where the party is in office. He said it wanted to replicate the ""conspiracy"" in the rest of the country, including in Bihar where its ally RJD has ""not spoken a word against"" the move in the southern state.""Being an OBC myself, I know the hardships faced by the backward classes. In future, they may loot reservations for SCs and STs as well,"" Modi said.He also tore into Rahul Gandhi and technocrat Sam Pitroda, without mentioning either of them by name, saying ""The Shehzada (crown prince) of Congress and his guru do not want you to bequeath your property to your children. They have come up with the dreadful idea of imposing inheritance tax.""","Modi claims vindication and sharpens his “appeasement’ charge against Congress and its allies.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

In an interview with ANI, Garcetti expressed pride in the efforts undertaken over the past year, resulting in a three-quarters reduction in visa wait times across various categories, with no wait time except for first-time tourist visas, which have seen a 75% decrease.""I am very proud of the work we have done in just one year to reduce the visa wait time by three quarters and to have no visa wait time in any of the categories except for first-time tourist visa which is down 75 per cent,"" he said.Garcetti noted the surge in visa applications from Indians for various purposes, including business, education, and immigration. He reiterated President Joe Biden's directive to streamline visa processing times in India, underscoring the administration's commitment to facilitating travel and exchanges between the two nations.He highlighted how at the same time, the US has ""increased the number of visas with the same number of people by 60 per cent in a single year, so we are hearing that challenge loud and clear.""""We are excited about the number of Indians who want to come for reasons from business to students to even immigrant visas people becoming citizens..."" Garcetti said.While addressing the green card backlog issue, Garcetti acknowledged the legislative challenges involved, suggesting that Congress would need to address issues related to legal immigration, green card allocations, and citizenship eligibility. Despite these hurdles, he highlighted the substantial decrease in waiting times due to increased adjudication of visas.Responding to inquiries about the possibility of US universities establishing foreign branch campuses in India, Garcetti expressed enthusiasm for fostering bilateral educational partnerships. He emphasized the goal of facilitating as many American students to study in India as there are Indian students studying in the US. Garcetti revealed plans for the establishment of joint campuses and programs between US and Indian universities, citing Arizona State University's announcement of its expansion across multiple locations in India as an example.""Last year, over 245,000 student visas came from India. Number one in adoptions, number one in all these categories that show 1.4 billion people, a lot of them would love to come to America. And so it's a good problem to have. But a couple of things were changing...,"" he said, on being asked about the green card backlog issue, and why there are mostly Indians who are on the backlog.Further, on being asked if US has similar plans just like Australia to launch the foreign branch campus of universities here in India, Garcetti said, ""Absolutely, it's my goal to get as many Americans to India as we are seeing Indians come to America...You will see announcements in the coming years of dozens of US campuses""""We will have joint campuses, and joint programmes here; one Arizona State University announced that there are going to be in more than 10 different campuses around India. To me, this is what the future is about,"" he said.""Indians know more about the US and the US knows more about Indians, taking the world where we can be multiplicative as India times the US, I think the relationship is not just India plus the US,"" the envoy added.Notably, Australia's Deakin University earlier inaugurated its branch campus in GIFT City, Gujarat.In January this year, Vice Chancellor of Australia's Deakin University Iain Martin met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Gandhinagar, where they had a productive discussion on enhancing collaboration between government and academic institutions about cybersecurity.

Islamabad, according to finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, could secure a staff-level agreement on the new programme by early July.Following the PM's brief address, the house was opened for a question and answer session where business leaders voiced their appreciation of the government’s recent moves but made more demands. They also shared proposals for economic measures to accomplish the intended goals and expressed concerns about political instability.“You have made a few handshakes after taking charge that have produced good results and progress on the IMF deal is one of them,” said Arif Habib, a top Pakistani entrepreneur. “I suggest you do a few more handshakes. One of them is regarding trade with India, which would greatly benefit our economy. Secondly, you should also patch up with a resident of Adiala Jail (a reference to jailed PTI leader Imran Khan). Try to fix things at that level as well, and I believe that you can do it.”The PM avoided responding directly to questions aimed at political stability, but claimed to have noted down his proposals for economic growth and assured him that he would soon invite businessmen from all across the country to Islamabad and sit with them “till all the issues aren’t resolved”.Pakistan had downgraded its ties and suspended trade relations with India after the Modi-led govt changed the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. Since then, Pakistan has linked its decision to normalising ties with India with the restoration of the special status of the Himalayan region.However, Pakistan’s incumbent govt, with the tacit approval of the military establishment, has been trying to create an environment conducive for business and trade ties.",PM Shehbaz Sharif met with business leaders in Karachi on Wednesday.

The warning came after Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (FSVPS) issued a notification regarding violations of international and Russian phytosanitary requirements over a shipment of rice imported from Pakistan.Dated April 2, the notification highlights the presence of a quarantine organism, ""Megaselia scalaris (Loew),"" in the rice consignment.Pakistan's trade representative at its embassy in Russia was asked to carry out an immediate investigation into the matter.The Russian authorities have written to the Pakistan embassy to prevent such violations and ensure all Pakistani rice exporters follow phytosanitary standards to ensure the safety of agricultural products traded between the two countries.The trade wing of the Pakistani embassy in Moscow, while forwarding the Russian authority's letter to the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) in the Ministry of Food Security and other relevant government offices, has warned of a possible ban on rice exports in future if more complaints were received from Russian authorities.Russia had previously imposed a ban on rice imports from Pakistan in 2019 because of health safety reasons.Similarly, in December 2006, Russia stopped the import of rice from Pakistan for not meeting food safety standards.Chairman of the Pakistan Rice Exporters Association, Chela Ram Kewlani, said that Pakistani rice exporters needed to be very careful in choosing and packaging all rice for export.He said that Pakistan had benefited from India banning exports of non-Basmati rice last year, given that India has a nearly 40 per cent share in the globally traded rice.Last year, India banned the export of white non-Basmati and parboiled rice.According to a leading Pakistani rice dealer, about 700,000 tonnes of rice were exported in December 2023 alone, the highest in a month for the fiscal year.He said Pakistan exported rice with an increase in higher production and demand and elevated global prices last year.The Rice Export Corporation is projecting a 60 per cent jump in exports of Basmati rice to over a million tonnes and a 36 per cent jump for non-Basmati rice to 4.25 million tonnes from Pakistan.It is eyeing exports of above five million metric tonnes of all rice in the fiscal year of 2023/2024, which would be much higher than last fiscal year's exports of 3.7 million tonnes.",Russia has warned Pakistan that it would ban rice imports again if Moscow's phytosanitary concerns are not addressed in future consignments. The warning came after a quarantine organism was detected in the rice consignment.

NIA arrests UK resident for 2023 London high commission attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/nia-arrests-uk-resident-for-2023-london-high-commission-attack/articleshow/109605265.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) has arrested a key accused involved in last year’s violent attack on Indian high commission in London. The suspect — identified as Inderpal Singh Gaba , a resident of Hounslow in the United Kingdom — was arrested upon arrival in Delhi on the basis of a look-out circular issued against him earlier.The development is significant given the agency, in a first, has arrested a British resident for a crime that happened under the UK’s jurisdiction.“While the move affirms the growing coordination between law enforcement agencies of both countries, it is also being considered a major deterrent that will ensure there is no repeat of such breach of security, disrespect to the Indian flag or any threat to Indian interests abroad,” said a senior officer.NIA’s investigation in the case so far has revealed that the incidents in London on March 19 and 22, 2023, were parts of a larger conspiracy to unleash vicious attacks on Indian missions and its officials.The attacks were found to be in retaliation to the action taken by Punjab Police against pro-Khalistan separatist Amritpal Singh, who was arrested in March last year. Govt had taken strong objection to the developments and summoned the senior-most diplomat in UK high commission in London and demanded an explanation on the absence of security.The high commission was attacked by a group of 50 persons, who committed criminal trespass, disrespected the Indian flag, damaged public property and caused injuries to officials at the high commission.The attack was allegedly organised by Gurcharan Singh, Dal Khalsa, UK; Avtar Singh Khanda of KLF, Jasvir Singh and their associates, both Indian and foreign nationals, who were identified during the probe.An NIA team visited the UK in May 2023 to probe the attack. Subsequently, a crowdsourcing of information was also carried out to identify and collect information about the UK-based entities and individuals involved in the incident, based on which the agency identified many of the attackers. Around a dozen lookout circulars were issued, and a manhunt was initiated.Last August, NIA had raided 31 locations in Punjab and Haryana to “unravel and unearth full contours of the conspiracy” behind the March attack. In Oct, UK’s Metropolitan Police had arrested a suspect, whose identity was not revealed, and was later released on bail.NIA had earlier said it was leaving no stone unturned to pinpoint culpability in the London attack and arrest the perpetrators, their associates and their supporters, based in India and abroad. The raids had also led to the seizure of digital data containing information related to the accused persons involved in the attack.","Inderpal Singh Gaba was arrested upon arrival in Delhi on the basis of a look- out circular issued against him earlier.

However, the man was released on bail pending further enquiries.In the attack on the Indian High Commission on March 19 in 2023, pro-Khalistan extremists scaled the building and attempted to pull down the Indian national flag. At least one official was injured as objects were hurled at the building and windows were shattered.Reacting to the incident, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) summoned the senior-most UK diplomat in New Delhi to convey India's ""strong protest"" at the actions of separatist and extremist elements against the High Commission of India in London.In June, the NIA also released photographs of suspects they believed were involved in the violent protest as the central agency took over the probe after Home Ministry officials met UK representatives in the wake of the attack.","Inderpal Singh Gaba has been arrested for carrying out unlawful activities during protests that took place on March 22, 2023, in London.

The application form had the name Diana Spencer for the elite nanny agency Solve Your Problem Ltd in May 1979. The contract is expected to fetch up to £8,000 at auction in Bristol on 30 April.But something intriguing has been noted in the contract, that Diana lied about her Date of birth. Diana who was born on July 1, 1961, making her 17 years and ten months old filled her date of birth as July 1, 1960, making her 18 years and ten months old.It is believed that Diana filled incorrectly to look older and more mature to get a job quicker or receive more pay.As BBC quoted Andrew Stowe, from Auctioneum Ltd who said, ""Our client had always been told that this was done deliberately, so that Diana would appear older and therefore more likely to secure a job with the agency, or at least a higher rate of pay,"" he said.""It could, of course, just be a simple oversight."" The document is thought to be Princess Diana's first official work contract to undertake various short-term jobs as a nanny, mother's help and child career. Before this, in 1978 Lady Diana Spencer had worked for friends and family, in an unofficial capacity, and some of them are noted as referees on the contract.","The application form had the name Diana Spencer for the elite nanny agency Solve Your Problem Ltd in May 1979.

There is also the year-old conflict in Sudan, which has created the world's largest internal displacement crisis ""with atrocious impacts on hunger and nutrition,"" he added.According to the report, over 36 million people in 39 countries and territories are facing an acute hunger emergency, a step below the famine level in Phase 4, with more than a third in Sudan and Afghanistan. It's an increase of a million people from 2022, the report said.Arif Husain, the UN World Food Program's chief economist, said every year since 2016 the numbers of people acutely food insecure have gone up, and they are now more than double the numbers before the COVID-19 pandemic.While the report looks at 59 countries, he said the target is to get data from 73 countries where there are people who are acutely food insecure.Secretary-General Guterres called for an urgent response to the report's findings that addresses the underlying causes of acute hunger and malnutrition while transforming the systems that supply food. Funding is also not keeping pace with the needs, he stressed.""We must have the funding, and we also must have the access,"" WFP's Husain said, stressing that both ""go hand-in-hand"" and are essential to tackle acute food insecurity.The report is the flagship publication of the Food Security Information Network and is based on a collaboration of 16 partners including UN agencies, regional and multinational bodies, the European Union, the US Agency for International Development, technical organisations and others.","Nearly 282 million people in 59 countries suffered from acute hunger in 2023.
