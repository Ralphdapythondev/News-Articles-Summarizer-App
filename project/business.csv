"Stock market today: BSE Sensex, Nifty50 see longest rally in 2024; end in green ahead of US Fed chair speech",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-today-bse-sensex-nifty50-august-23-2024-dalal-street-indian-equities-global-markets/articleshow/112726758.cms,"Stock market today : Indian equity benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , extended their winning streak to a seventh consecutive session on Friday, marking their longest rally in 2024. However, the gains were more modest as investors exercised caution ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech, which is anticipated to provide insights into potential U.S.interest rate reductions.The NSE Nifty 50 index edged up 0.05% to close at 24,823.15, while the S&P BSE Sensex added 0.04% to reach 81,086.21. Over the past seven sessions, both indices have risen by approximately 3%, driven by increasing expectations of a U.S. rate cut and sustained domestic inflows.However, the majority of these gains were realized on the second day as concerns about a U.S. recession subsided. In the last two sessions, the daily gains have moderated, and the Nifty's trading range has narrowed to less than 100 points.Aishvarya Dadheech, chief investment officer at Mumbai-based Fident Asset Management, told Reuters that while the market's outlook remains optimistic, ""caution prevailed on the session as investors contemplated if the Fed is behind the curve or ahead in terms of rate easing.""Global markets were mixed, with Asian markets trading flat and European markets inching higher ahead of Powell's speech, which is scheduled after Indian market hours. Although a U.S. rate cut in September is widely anticipated, the probability of a 50-basis-point reduction has been diminishing, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Dadheech suggested that if Powell adopts a dovish tone, it could redirect foreign inflows to India and potentially trigger a rally to record highs.On the domestic front, the U.S. rate-sensitive IT index declined by 1%, recording the smallest gains over the week. TVS Motors and Bajaj Auto rose 2.24% and 4.97%, respectively, boosting the auto sector by 1.12%, following J.P.Morgan's endorsement of them as its top two picks in the sector. Conversely, Reliance Group companies, including Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Home Finance, and Reliance Power, experienced losses ranging from 5% to 10% after Chairman Anil Ambani and 24 others were banned from the securities markets for five years due to the diversion of funds.","The NSE Nifty 50 index edged up 0.05% to close at 24,823.15.

"Piyush Goyal softens stand, cos awaits new e-commerce policy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/piyush-goyal-softens-stand-cos-awaits-new-e-commerce-policy/articleshow/112720525.cms,"NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal 's allegations of violation of rules by e-commerce companies, such as Amazon , have raised expectations of government finally moving ahead with a new set of regulations for e-commerce, along with a policy, as well as e-pharmacies.A day after his comments at an event organised by Pehle India Foundation, the minister seemed to have softened his stance on Thursday.""We are very clear that we want to invite FDI (foreign direct investment), we want to invite technology, we want to have the best of the world, and we are not against online at all,"" he said in Mumbai.""What the country always desires is fair play, is honesty - for the customer, honesty to the supplier of goods and services and to ensure that other people also have a fair chance to compete against such online business,"" Goyal said.Goyal's ministry and the food and consumers affairs ministry, which he headed before the general election, had worked together to formulate the e-commerce policy as well as rules to protect consumer interest.While stakeholder discussions had also been completed several months ago, the two decisions have not been implemented, despite the minister flagging his concern over predatory policy and violation of FDI rules.The proposed e-commerce rules are likely to restrict all marketplaces, including those owned by Indian companies, from selling private label products of companies where they have ""significant interest"" or holding inventory. Several Indian companies in the e-commerce space have also held detailed discussions with govt departments promising compliance, although the rules are meant to primarily check violation of marketplace guidelines by Amazon andFlipkart , which are controlled by overseas investors.Besides, the e-marketplace operators will have to do away with prompts pushing for payment platforms promoted by them, a move again aimed at Amazon Pay. ""The purpose was to create a level-playing field between brick and mortar retailers and e-commerce to the extent possible, but the decision has been delayed for months,"" said an official.Similarly, when it comes to e-pharmacies, the policy has been hanging fire with the Centre for several years. In the absence of any clarity these platforms have only grown in size."," Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal's allegations of violation of rules by e-commerce companies, such as Amazon, have raised expectations of government finally moving ahead with a new set of regulations.

Source: ET quoting CA (Dr.) Suresh Surana

Over 7.28 crore income tax returns (ITR) were filed by July 31, 2024 and approximately 5 crore of these ITRs were filed by July 26, 2024, indicating that 2.28 crore ITRs were filed between July 27 and July 31, 2024. Consequently, the deadline for verifying the 2.28 crore ITRs filed in the last days of July falls between August 26 and August 30, 2024.It is crucial for taxpayers who submitted their ITRs during this period and have not yet verified them to do so promptly to avoid the penalty associated with filing a late ITR.As per income tax rules, ""The time limit for e-verification or submission of ITR-V (offline process) is 30 days from the date of filing of the ITR.""According to an ET report, the tax department reported that the total number of ITRs filed until August 20, 2024, was 7,41,37,596, with 7,09,89,014 (approximately 7.09 crore) ITRs verified by 6PM on the same day. This indicates that around 32 lakh ITRs were filed but not verified as of August 20, 2024.Although the total number of verified ITRs as of August 19 may include ITRs filed after July 31, it is estimated that at least 19 lakh ITRs out of the 7.28 crore filed by July 31, 2024, are yet to be verified.Chartered accountant Dr Suresh Surana spoke about the 30-day time limit for ITR verification,, ""Such a time-period shall be calculated including the 30th day as per the bare reading of the provisions of the income tax act. The income tax return filed under section 139(1) has to be verified within a period of 30 days from the date of furnishing the ITR. Hence if the ITR is filed on 31st July, 2024, the same shall be verified up to 30th August, 2024."" Verification of ITR is essential for processing the return and receiving tax refunds.Ashish Niraj, a chartered accountant and partner at A S N & Company, told ET that if an individual has filed their ITR online but used the offline process (ITR-V) for verification and the form is submitted or reaches the Centralized Processing Center (CPC) beyond 30 days from the date of filing the ITR, it will be considered as if the individual has not filed an ITR at all. ""Hence all consequences of late filing of ITR under the Act shall follow,"" he says.Filing an income tax return is necessary to receive an income tax refund if you are eligible for one. In case you missed the July 31, 2024 deadline for filing the ITR or filed it by the deadline but failed to verify it within the 30-day period, you can still file a belated ITR. It is crucial to verify the filed ITR before the 30-day deadline expires; otherwise, your effort will be in vain, and you may not receive the tax refund.CA Twinkle Jain explains, ""If an ITR is not verified within this (the 30 day) period, it is considered invalid. This means that any tax refund claims associated with these ITRs will not be processed, and the taxpayer may have to file the ITR again, resulting in a delay in the tax refund process.""Failing to verify the submitted ITR within the 30-day deadline would result in the need to file a belated ITR and face the consequences of late filing, such as a late fee under section 234F of Rs 5,000 (limited to Rs 1,000 if the total income does not exceed Rs 5 lakh).Furthermore, if you have not verified the ITR filed before the 30-day deadline and the ITR filing deadline (July 31, 2024) has passed, you may not be able to opt for the old tax regime.","As per income tax rules, ""The time limit for e-verification or submission of ITR-V (offline process) is 30 days from the date of filing of the ITR"" It is crucial for taxpayers who submitted their ITRs during this period and have not yet verified them to do so promptly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112707486,imgsize-29474,width-400,resizemode-4/112707486.jpg"
SEBI bans Anil Ambani & 24 other entities from securities market for 5 years; imposes Rs 25 crore penalty on Ambani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-bans-anil-ambani-24-other-entities-from-securities-market-for-5-years-imposes-rs-25-crore-penalty-on-ambani/articleshow/112730559.cms,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) has taken action against Anil Ambani and 24 other entities, including former key officials of Reliance Home Finance ( RHFL ), for their involvement in the diversion of funds from the company. Ambani has been barred from the securities market for five years and fined Rs 25 crore, according to a PTI report.Additionally, he is prohibited from holding any position as a director or Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) in any listed company or intermediary registered with Sebi during this period, the report said.RHFL has also been barred from the securities market for six months and fined Rs 6 lakh. Sebi's extensive investigation revealed that Anil Ambani, aided by RHFL's key managerial personnel, had devised a fraudulent scheme to siphon off funds from the company by disguising them as loans to entities associated with him.According to the PTI report quoting Sebi’s order, despite clear directives from the Board of Directors to cease such lending practices and regular reviews of corporate loans, the company's management disregarded these orders, indicating a significant failure of governance influenced by certain key managerial personnel under Ambani's influence.Sebi noted that given the circumstances, RHFL itself should not be held equally responsible as the individuals involved in the fraud. The remaining entities were found to have played the role of either recipients of illegally obtained loans or conduits to facilitate the illegal diversion of funds from RHFL.In its final order, Sebi stated, ""existence of a fraudulent scheme, orchestrated by Noticee No. 2 (Anil Ambani) and administered by the KMPs of RHFL, to siphon off funds from the public listed company (RHFL) by structuring them as 'loans' to credit unworthy conduit borrowers, and in turn, to onward borrowers, all of whom have been found to be 'promoter linked entities' i.e. entities associated/ linked with Noticee 2 (Anil Ambani)"".Anil Ambani, in his capacity as ""chairperson of the ADA group"" and through his substantial indirect shareholding in RHFL's holding company, orchestrated a fraudulent scheme, the Sebi order said.Sebi's order highlighted the company management and promoter's reckless approach in sanctioning substantial loans to entities with minimal assets, cash flow, net worth, or revenue.The suspicious nature of these ""loans"" is further amplified by the fact that many of the borrowers had close ties to RHFL's promoters. Ultimately, most of these borrowers defaulted on their loan repayments, causing RHFL to fail in meeting its own debt obligations. This led to the company's resolution under the RBI Framework, leaving public shareholders in a precarious situation.RHFL's share price plunged from around Rs 59.60 in March 2018 to a mere Rs 0.75 by March 2020, as the magnitude of the fraud became apparent and the company's resources were depleted. Currently, over 9 lakh shareholders remain invested in RHFL, facing substantial losses.Sebi has restrained 24 entities, including former key officials of RHFL – Amit Bapna, Ravindra Sudhalkar, and Pinkesh R Shah – and imposed fines on them for their involvement in the case. Ambani, Bapna, Sudhalkar, and Shah have been fined Rs 25 crore, Rs 27 crore, Rs 26 crore, and Rs 21 crore, respectively.Furthermore, the remaining entities, including Reliance Unicorn Enterprises, Reliance Exchange next Lt, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd, Reliance Cleangen Ltd, Reliance Business Broadcast News Holdings Ltd, and Reliance Big Entertainment Private Ltd, have each been fined Rs 25 crore for either receiving the illegally obtained loans or facilitating the illegal diversion of funds from RHFL.In February 2022, Sebi had issued an interim order restraining Reliance Home Finance Ltd, Anil Ambani, and three other individuals (Amit Bapna, Ravindra Sudhakar, and Pinkesh R Shah) from the securities market until further notice for allegedly siphoning off funds from the company.(With inputs from PTI)","Anil Ambani has been barred from the securities market for five years and fined Rs 25 crore. He is prohibited from holding any position as a director or Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) in any listed company or intermediary registered with Sebi. 24 other entities, including former key officials of Reliance Home Finance ( RHFL), have also been fined.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112730920,imgsize-22960,width-400,resizemode-4/112730920.jpg"
"New bank locker rules: Amendments to nomination rule for bank lockers, deposits proposed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-bank-locker-rules-amendments-to-nomination-rule-for-bank-lockers-deposits-proposed-heres-what-you-should-know/articleshow/112517270.cms,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has introduced the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four. The current Banking Regulation Act permits single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit, items left in the custody of a bank, or a locker hired from a bank.In the event of the nominator's death, the nominee can access the deposit, articles, or locker.According to an ET report, the new Bill suggests allowing up to four nominees for these purposes. For deposits, nominees can be appointed either successively or simultaneously, while for other purposes, they can only be appointed successively.When there are multiple simultaneous nominees, the nomination will be effective in a predetermined proportion. In the case of successive nominations, priority will be given to the nominee named higher in the nomination order.""The Banking Regulation Act allows single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit. Such a nominee can also be appointed for items left in custody of a bank or for a locker hired from a bank. The nominee can access the deposit, articles, or locker in case of death of the person who nominated him. The Bill allows the appointment of up to four nominees for these purposes. For deposits, such nominees can be appointed either successively or simultaneously while for other purposes they can be appointed successively. In case of simultaneous nominees, the nomination will be effective in a declared proportion. For successive nomination, the nominee who has been named higher in the order of nomination will receive priority,"" according to The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 quoted in the ET report.Also Read | Latest FD rates: Which PSU banks are offering highest fixed deposit rates in August 2024? Check List Nomination is a crucial aspect of opening lockers and savings accounts in India. The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) says, ""Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules 1985 permits banks to pay dues to nominees in the event of death of depositor(s) without asking for succession certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. This simplifies settlement. Of course, as Trustee the nominee is accountable to legal heirs.The IBA further clarifies that the nomination facility is available for bank deposits, safe deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. A single deposit account, whether held individually or jointly, can have only one nominee. However, a jointly held locker can have two nominees. In the case of a minor's account, a person legally empowered to operate the account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.The State Bank of India emphasizes the importance of availing the benefits of nomination facility and survivorship clause for locker-hirers. In the unfortunate event of the death of one of the joint locker-hirers, the contents of the locker do not automatically transfer to the surviving joint locker-hirer or nominee(s) unless there is a survivorship clause or nomination in place.When renting a locker, the bank charges a nominal annual rent based on the size of the locker and the location of the branch. The rent should be paid in advance for the financial year. The bank provides a copy of the signed Locker Agreement to the locker-hirer, outlining their rights and responsibilities.","The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four. The current Banking Regulation Act permits single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit, items left in the custody of a bank, or a locker hired from a bank.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112517954,imgsize-36802,width-400,resizemode-4/112517954.jpg"

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens.

Rising claims pose challenge for health insurance sector in India: Jefferies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rising-claims-pose-challenge-for-health-insurance-sector-in-india-jefferies/articleshow/112761140.cms,"NEW DELHI: The health insurance sector may face challenges in the coming months due to rising claims and increased competition, particularly in the retail sector, highlighted a report by Jefferies .""Health (approx. 35 per cent of mix) can see pressure in its retail segment from rising claims frequency and elevated competition"" the report stated.The report indicated that India's non-life insurance sector is experiencing significant shifts, the health insurance segment may face challenges as healthcare costs continue to rise and more consumers claim their insurance, and insurers are grappling with increased payouts.This trend could squeeze margins and put pressure on insurers to find ways to manage costs while remaining competitive in the market.However, for the motor insurance segment, the report draws a promising picture and added that it is entering a promising multi-year upcycle. This positive momentum is expected to benefit large private insurers of the motor segment, who are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends.""Initiate on Non-Life Insurers Large pvt. insurers are set to gain from multi-year upcycle in motor (approx. 35 per cent of premium mix) led by premiumization of underlying auto mix and moderating competitive intensity"" the report mentioned.The report also added that the motor insurance segment in India is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14 per cent over the financial years 2024 to 2027. The key driver behind this growth is the ongoing shift in the automobile market towards higher-value vehicles.Over the past three years, the average selling price (ASP) of passenger vehicles (PVs) has increased by 41 per cent, reflecting a move towards premium segments. This trend is expected to continue, benefiting motor insurance renewals, which account for 60-70 per cent of the motor insurance premium mix.""Motor segment amidst a multi-year upcycle (est. 14 pc CAGR over FY24-27E) as renewals (60-70 pc of premium mix) will continue to benefit from the underlying change in auto mix towards premium high-value segments (ASP of PV up +41pc in last 3 yrs)"" the report added.Despite these challenges, the report mentioned that the broader non-life insurance market in India remains significantly underpenetrated, with insurance premiums representing only about 1 per cent of the country's GDP. This is relatively low compared to global peers, where non-life insurance to GDP ratios range between 2 per cent and 4 per cent.However, the Indian non-life insurance market has shown steady growth, with gross premiums expanding at a CAGR of 12 per cent over the past five years, reaching Rs 2.8 trillion (approximately USD 35 billion). Notably, the private sector has outpaced the overall market.""India remains an under-penetrated market with non-life insurance to GDP at approx. 1 pc (vs 2-4 pc for global peers). Gross premiums have expanded at 12 pc CAGR over the last 5 years to Rs2.8tn (approx. USD 35bn) with the private sector growing faster at 15 pc CAGR and improving its market share to 68 pc (from 57 pc)"" said Jefferies in the report.Despite these challenges, the overall insurance market in India remains underpenetrated, offering significant long-term growth potential for insurers who can navigate these dynamics effectively.",The report indicated that India's non-life insurance sector is experiencing significant shifts.

With over 600 certified PPE-producing companies, India is well-positioned in a market expected to exceed $92.5 billion by 2025, up from $52.7 billion in 2019.The textile industry is also a major employment driver, providing direct jobs to 45 million individuals and an additional 100 million in related sectors. Cotton cultivation alone supports an estimated 6 million farmers and 40-50 million people involved in processing and trade.Several factors contribute to the industry's growth, including India's world-class infrastructure, a focus on technical textiles driven by demand from sectors such as automotive, healthcare, and infrastructure, and the availability of raw materials and skilled labour. Competitive manufacturing costs and a growing retail landscape, including e-commerce, further enhance the sector's attractiveness.To support this growth, the Indian government has introduced the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme with an allocation of Rs 10,683 crore. This initiative aims to scale up the production of man-made fiber (MMF) apparel, MMF fabrics, and technical textiles. Under the PLI scheme, 64 applications have been approved, involving a proposed investment of Rs 19,798 crore, with a projected turnover of Rs 1,93,926 crore and anticipated employment for 2,45,362 individuals. Investments are notably planned in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan.Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the textile sector remains robust, with 100 per cent FDI permitted under the automatic route. From April 2000 to March 2024, India has attracted $4.47 billion in FDI in textiles, including dyed and printed fabrics.Currently, India is one of the world's largest producers of textiles and apparel, contributing approximately 2.3 per cent to the country's GDP, 13 per cent to industrial production, and 12 per cent to exports.The country holds a 4 per cent share of global textile and apparel trade, highlighting its substantial role in the international market.The Indian textile sector is diverse and extensive, with India being the second-largest producer of cotton and jute globally and the second-largest producer of silk. Remarkably, India accounts for 95 per cent of the world's hand-woven fabric.","India's textile industry is on the brink of expansion, with total textile exports projected to reach $65 billion by FY26.

India needs 400 million more women in workforce by 2047 to fuel $14 trillion economy: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-needs-400-million-more-women-in-workforce-by-2047-to-fuel-14-trillion-economy-report/articleshow/112762156.cms,"Redefining work through platform jobs and digital microwork could activate fractural employment. Enhancing entrepreneurship opportunities via digital commerce infrastructure could invigorate the sector. Addressing bottlenecks like mobility and digital access is crucial to improving women's participation in the labour market.

NEW DELHI: India needs an additional 400 million women in the workforce by fiscal year 2047 to contribute $14 trillion to the economy, nearly doubling the current female labour force participation rate (LFPR) from 37 per cent to 70 per cent, according to a new report by The/Nudge Institute.According to The Labour Force Participation Distillation Report, based on the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data over the years, only 110 million women are projected to join the workforce by 2047, leaving a gap of 145 million women needed to meet the target.The report reveals significant disparities between men and women in job security and recovery. Women are seven times more likely to lose their jobs and eleven times more likely not to recover from job loss. By 2020, nearly half of the women employed in 2019 had exited the workforce, the report read.Women are predominantly employed in low-productivity sectors like agriculture and manufacturing, where advancement opportunities are limited. In the construction sector, women make up just over 12 per cent of the workforce and often earn less than men in unskilled roles. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened these issues, forcing many rural women back into the workforce due to income loss or job loss by primary earners, highlighting the fragility of female employment.The report identifies three key pathways to increase female labour force participation.According to PTI, Director & Head of The/Nudge Prize, Kanishka Chatterjee said: ""India's demographic dividend and dreams of a $30 trillion economy cannot be realised without boosting the participation of women in the workforce.""He noted the progress made but stressed the need for urgent and sustained action to overcome economic, social, and cultural barriers. The/Nudge Prize team analyzed all of the PLFS data across the last two cycles of different sectors that are contributing to or witnessing higher growth rates to build this report.""When we looked at PLFS data, we understood what the supply side is or where women or men work today. But there are no other data pointers available where we can clearly see what are the demand markers available in India which will hire women, or which may be better suited for women to take jobs or to drive their entrepreneurial journeys,"" the report said.""One of the key things to consider, if we need to solve or address labour force participation rate, is to have a holistic approach. Not only to see how labour is available and what skills are available, but also to see what is driving demand today -- and this is exactly what we also bring out in the report,"" it added.",India needs an additional 400 million women in the workforce by fiscal year 2047.

Why it’s time to explore bold & path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-its-time-to-explore-bold-path-breaking-alternatives-that-put-indian-railways-on-a-smooth-track/articleshow/112317406.cms,"By Ashutosh Bhandari

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

"Changes in LTCG tax post Budget 2024: Higher tax rate with indexation benefits, grandfathering for ancestral properties being considered?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/changes-in-ltcg-tax-post-budget-2024-higher-tax-rate-with-indexation-benefits-grandfathering-for-ancestral-properties-being-considered/articleshow/112214106.cms,"Gradual Change in LTCG Regime?

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 adopts multifaceted approach to bolstering manufacturing sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-adopts-multifaceted-approach-to-bolstering-manufacturing-sector/articleshow/112216383.cms,"By Saurabh Agarwal and Mohit Sharma

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement.

Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Path ahead

Chairman Jerome Powell said the time has come for the Federal Reserve to cut its key policy rate, affirming expectations that officials will begin lowering borrowing costs next month and making clear his intention to prevent further cooling in the labor market.“The time has come for policy to adjust,” Powell said Friday in the text of a speech at the Kansas City’s Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.“The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.”The Fed chief also acknowledged recent progress on inflation, which has resumed moderating in recent months after stalling earlier in the year: “My confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%,” he said, referring to the central bank’s inflation target.Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve during the Jackson Hole economic symposium in 2019.Treasury yields fell and the S&P 500 index of US stocks rose while the dollar declined.Swaps traders held steady in their pricing for the total rate cuts they foresee through the end of 2024, at about 98 basis points. Odds also remained steady for a quarter-point cut in September.While the remarks provided some clarity for financial markets in the near term, they offered few clues as to how the Fed might proceed after its September gathering.Still, the speech confirmed the Fed is on the cusp of a key turning point in its two-year battle against inflation. For most of that time, the labor market proved surprisingly sturdy, giving officials room to focus doggedly on lowering inflation toward the central bank’s 2% target.The Fed has held its benchmark rate in a range of 5.25%-5.5% — its highest level in more than two decades — for the last year in support of that goal, propping up borrowing costs across the economy.Yet just as inflation has neared its target, cracks have appeared on the employment front, prompting several Fed officials to worry that high rates now pose a threat to the economy’s continued strength. Warning signals included a disappointing July jobs report that rattled financial markets.“We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.” Powell said, adding that the slowdown in the labor market was “unmistakable.”After being late to raise rates in response to an inflation surge during the Covid-19 pandemic, Powell’s remarks underscore how Fed officials are hoping to avoid another policy error now that price growth is easing. Their success or failure will determine whether there’s a so-called soft landing, the rare feat of smothering a burst of inflation without tipping the economy into recession.“Our objective has been to restore price stability while maintaining a strong labor market, avoiding the sharp increases in unemployment that characterized earlier disinflationary episodes when inflation expectations were less well anchored,” Powell said. “While the task is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome.”At their last gathering in July, the “vast majority” of Fed officials felt it would likely be appropriate to cut rates in September if economic data continued to come in as expected.While inflation remains above the Fed’s goal, it has retreated markedly from its recent peak of 7.1% in 2022. The central bank’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 2.5% in June from a year earlier.Powell’s comments will likely be well-received by Americans contending with high interest rates attached to mortgages, autos, credit cards and other borrowing. Investors are widely anticipating a quarter-point cut when when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets Sept. 17-18.Questions remain about the Fed’s path forward and Powell provided no additional clarity.Investors are weighing whether another negative jobs report would compel the Fed to cut rates by a larger-than-usual 50 basis points in September. Another key matter is how policymakers might proceed with the pace and size of rate cuts in subsequent months.Powell said policymakers “will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability.”","Jerome Powell said the time has come for the Federal Reserve to cut its key policy rate. He affirmed expectations that officials will begin lowering borrowing costs next month.
