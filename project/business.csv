Mumbai: Former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit is set to exit the real estate financing business established by veteran dealmaker Nimesh Kampani .INH Mauritius , an investment fund managed by Pandit, will sell 49% in JM Financial Credit Solutions (JMFCS) — the realty financing business — to Kampani’s JM Financial in a deal valued at about Rs 3,000 crore.Pandit will subsequently step down from the chairman’s position of the mid-tier NBFC.The move will increase JM Financial’s stake in JMFCS to 96% from 47%. The balance 4% is held by Moraine Master Fund and Aparna Aiyar, the wife of Pandit’s business partner Hariharan Aiyar. Hariharan too will step down from the board of JMFCS following the change in shareholding. JM Financial, which has been restricted from managing debt issues as well as offering loans against shares by regulators due to governance lapses, will buy 43% from INH Mauritius for Rs 1,282 crore in the first phase of the transaction. It will finance the deal through internal accruals which stands at over Rs 4,000 crore.INH is exiting JMFCS as the fund’s life is getting over, sources said. It first bought into JMFCS in fiscal 2015 and later acquired more shares in 2017 and then again in 2018, investing a total of Rs 950 crore in the NBFC. JMFCS marked Pandit’s first investment in India’s financial services sector. Pandit also holds 1.2% in the listed JM Financial. The deal valuation of Rs 3,000 crore is lower than JMFCS’ net worth of Rs 4,200 crore. This is because there has been under-recoveries in real estate financing and the same hasn’t been provided in the books. The under-recoveries are a result of stress on developers, said sources.Separately, JMFCS will buy 72% in an asset reconstruction company from JM Financial for Rs 856 crore. The move will increase JMFCS’ stake in JMFARC to 82% from 10%.The balance 18% is held by Ambuja Cements founder Narotam Sekhsaria (9%), Valiant Mauritius Partners and Indian Overseas Bank. The step is being taken as JM Financial Asset Reconstruction (JMFARC) needs funding on a regular basis as it has been under stress because of certain investments. Moreover, JMFCS, with a cash reserve of Rs 1,300 crore, is in a much better position to support JMFARC.","Ex-Citi chief Vikram Pandit to exit Kampani's fin biz in Rs 3k crore deal.

"With Elon Musk’s Tesla yet to plug into India, government plans changes in new EV policy; tweaks may benefit legacy car companies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-elon-musks-tesla-yet-to-plug-into-india-government-plans-changes-in-new-ev-policy-tweaks-may-benefit-legacy-car-companies/articleshow/111568275.cms,"EV Sales Racing Ahead

New EV policy tweaks in works: The Indian government is considering modifications to its recently introduced electric vehicle (EV) policy to provide incentives to automakers that have already invested in the country, according to sources familiar with the matter. This development comes as Tesla Inc , the US electric carmaker, has yet to make a firm commitment to building a factory in India.The current policy only supports fresh investments aimed at accelerating the local manufacturing of high-end electric cars.According to an ET report, automakers have raised two primary concerns: first, that the scheme should take into account current investments, and second, that it should include plants producing both petrol and diesel cars alongside EVs, given the small share of EVs in India's passenger vehicle market, which does not justify high investments. No automaker has yet made any official comment on participating in the EV scheme since its announcement on March 15.Discussions are also underway with stakeholders regarding another critical issue affecting carmakers. The government may potentially consider investments in plants producing both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles as eligible for incentives, in order to add scale and make large investments viable for automakers, according to the sources quoted by the financial daily.Several carmakers, including Volkswagen-Skoda , Hyundai-Kia, and VinFast , have expressed interest in the new policy, known as the Scheme for Manufacturing of Electric Cars ( SMEC ).Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk , had planned a visit to India in April to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, government officials, and spacetech executives. During this trip, Musk was expected to announce Tesla's intention to establish an EV manufacturing facility in India. However, he abruptly postponed the visit.Also Read | VinFast, Tesla’s rival, to soon drive into India with locally assembled electric vehicles; likely to sell cars in Rs 25-30 lakh range According to a source, given the unlikelihood of the American automaker committing to the construction of a local factory in the near future, discussions are underway with industry stakeholders to make the scheme more accommodating to established players. These discussions may include permitting investments in facilities that manufacture both internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles.SMEC offers reduced import duties of 15% on fully assembled EVs with a minimum CIF value of $35,000. This concession is available for a period of five years, provided companies invest at least $500 million in establishing new manufacturing facilities within the country.SMEC scheme initially mandated that only companies investing in new EV manufacturing plants within three years of receiving government approval would qualify for incentives. The scheme did not consider retrospective investments for local EV production.Also Read | India’s hopes for Tesla investment cool as Musk ceases contact According to a senior official, discussions are underway to make the scheme more appealing to traditional companies as well. One of the proposed modifications is to specify a backdate for investments made in indigenous manufacturing of high-end EVs. This change would allow companies like VinFast, which has already commenced construction of a new plant in Tamil Nadu and pledged to invest $500 million over five years in India, to be eligible for incentives under SMEC.Another official stated that some established companies interested in the scheme have expressed concerns about the specified investment amount in EV-only facilities. The market for high-end electric vehicles, priced above Rs 25 lakh, is very limited in India. To commit investments of Rs 4,000 crore, companies require scale, which is capped at Rs 25 lakh in the Indian market.The decision to limit SMEC to greenfield EV plants was primarily intended to accurately assess the localization of content by companies. Under the current scheme, companies must produce electric cars with 25% local content, increasing to 50% by the fifth year. Auto companies and component makers will need to calculate domestic value addition (DVA) across their supply chain and submit these details to vehicle testing agencies for evaluation.",The Indian government is considering modifications to its recently introduced electric vehicle (EV) policy.

That far exceeds about 200 billion rupees of net inflows into index-eligible bonds in the period, and suggests global banks that typically buy as clients’ custodians have also been snapping them up for their own accounts.The scale of purchases by these custodian banks, such as Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings Plc, reflects their optimistic outlook on India, following its inclusion into JPMorgan Chase & Co’s emerging-market bond index at end-June.Additionally, the inflows were bolstered by election results that reinforced political continuity.“Banks were possibly running light going into the election, and after the results, they covered those short positions and have since gone long,” said Nitin Agarwal, head of India trading at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “Macro fundamentals also remain strong for India.”The rise in demand is also because of a popular derivative trade between banks and insurers called the bond-forward rate agreement, according to Agarwal. The strategy helps insurers lock in longer-term yields without having to take on more debt on their balance sheets. Banks charge a margin to hold these bonds until maturity.Foreign banks bought local bonds on a net basis for all but four days in June, according to data from the Clearing Corp In contrast, state-run banks, mutual funds and private banks have all been net sellers.India’s inflation is trending lower and is expected to average 4.5% in the fiscal year through March, opening up the possibility for rate cuts, Parul Mittal Sinha, head of India financial markets at Standard Chartered Plc, said on Bloomberg TV Friday.“As and when the global yields start moving lower, and if the RBI also starts cutting rates, the intensity of inflows might pick up,” she said, referring to the Reserve Bank of India . “Capital gains are just around the corner.

Make cable/DTH set-top boxes interoperable: Trai to I&B ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/make-cable/dth-set-top-boxes-interoperable-trai-to-ib-ministry/articleshow/111591640.cms,"NEW DELHI: In what may come in as a relief for millions of DTH and cable TV subscribers , regulator Trai has recommended that they make set-top boxes (STBs) interoperable, a measure that will make it easier for consumers to switch from one operator to another without changing the STBs.Another key recommendation that may impact monthly TV tariffs, Trai removed the Network Capacity Fee (NCF) that service providers charge consumers (Rs 130 for 200 channels and Rs 160 on over 200 channels), giving them the option to charge less in the name of competitive spirit and regional issues.“Ceilings of Rs 130 for 200 channels and Rs 160 on more than 200 channels have been removed on NCF and is kept under forbearance to make it market driven as well as equitable. Service provider may now charge different NCF based on number of channels, different regions, different customer classes or any combination thereof. To ensure transparency, all such charges have to be mandatorily published by the service providers and communicated to the consumers besides reporting to the Trai,” it said while notifying ‘Amendments to the Regulatory framework for Broadcasting and Cable Services’.On the interoperability of STBs – which the cable and DTH operators have been resisting for years citing technological challenges and proprietary software issues – Trai said it is desirable. “The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting may direct private DPOs (cable and DTH providers) to adopt and implement interoperable STBs,” Trai said, though not mandating the measure.Trai also allowed DTH and cable operators – who face stiff competition from online OTT platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime – to offer discount up to 45% while forming their bouquets to enable flexibility and offer attractive deals to consumers. Earlier this discount was permitted only up to 15%.Charges for services like installation and activation, visiting, relocation and temporary suspension -- which were prescribed earlier under regulation -- have now been kept under forbearance.In another key decision, Trai said that Prasar Bharati should take steps to convert DD Free Dish platform from a non-addressable system to an addressable system which is encrypted. This should be done to ensure quality of viewing experience, prevent unauthorized re-transmission of television channels to combat piracy and maintain the record of subscribers.“Prasar Bharati should adopt interoperable STBs for DD Free Dish to act as catalyst for transitioning the entire ecosystem from operator-based STBs to interoperable STBs to empower consumers' choice. This will eliminate the need for changing STBs every time the service provider is changed,” Trai said.",Regulator Trai has recommended that set-top boxes (STBs) be interoperable.

Budget 2024 expectations : With an aim to enhance healthcare accessibility, the Modi government is actively pursuing plans to double the reach of its flagship Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme over the next three years.According to a PTI report, discussions are intensifying to increase the annual insurance coverage under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) from the current Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per family - a step that may be announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget 2024 .The expansion of AB-PMJAY would likely begin by covering all individuals aged 70 years and above, potentially extending comprehensive health coverage to more than two-thirds of India's population. This expansion is expected to add approximately 4 to 5 crore new beneficiaries to the program, significantly enhancing healthcare access for senior citizens across the country.This enhancement is crucial to alleviate financial burdens associated with costly medical treatments like organ transplants and cancer therapies, addressing a critical factor contributing to family indebtedness due to healthcare expenses.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers According to estimates by the National Health Authority, implementing these proposals would necessitate an additional annual expenditure of Rs 12,076 crore for the exchequer.

MUMBAI: The long-term capital gains tax provisions are not fair to certain taxpayers, and this requires an amendment in the upcoming Budget 2024 . Income-tax (I-T) is a progressive tax mechanism, the more you earn the more you pay. Understandably, the very rich, having a taxable income of over Rs 5 crore pay tax at the rate of 42.74 per cent , whereas those having a taxable income of Rs 5 lakh or less fall in the ‘nil’ tax bracket.The latter stand to benefit because of a rebate mechanism, that was introduced by the interim budget of 2019.A rebate is a deduction from the I-T payable and section 87A of the I-T Act allows for a full rebate from tax for an individual having income up to Rs. 5 lakh subject to an upper cap of Rs. 12,500. Thus, while the basic exemption limit is Rs. 2.5 lakh under the old regime and Rs. 3 Lakhs in the new regime owing to the rebate an individual with an income of up to Rs. 5 lakh and up to Rs. 7 lakh under the old and new regime respectively, do not have to pay tax.In fact, if the taxpayer under old regime takes the full benefit of Rs. 1.50 lakh available as a deduction for various investments made during the year (such as public provident fund, repayment of housing loan, LIC Premium, tax saving mutual funds), a gross income of up to Rs. 6.50 lakh may not attract any I-T at all. In addition, if such taxpayer is salaried, the standard deduction of Rs. 50,000 would ensure that a gross income of up to Rs. 7 lakh may not attract any tax. (Refer Case 1).However, the same taxpayer can be in for a rude shock if he has earned long-term capital gains, for which a ‘concessional’ rate of tax at 20 per cent is prescribed under section 112. For instance, long-term capital gains arising on sale/transfer of debt mutual funds, unlisted equity shares, immovable property are taxed under this section at 20 percent, with indexation benefit.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 3 steps Modi government should consider for employment generation “While the concessional tax rate under section 112 can be an advantage for an individual in the higher tax brackets, it works to a great disadvantage for an individual who is having his/her taxable income, including long term capital gains, at less than Rs. 5 lakh. Under the new regime this disadvantage will continue for a person having income less than Rs. 12 Lakhs,” explains Ketan Vajani, chartered accountant.Vajani goes on to illustrate: An individual, offering his income under old regime, has sold his residential house and has earned a long-term capital gain of Rs. 4 lakh. His other income, during this particular financial year is just Rs. 75,000, which takes his total income to Rs. 4.75 lakh. As per the rational of section 87A, his tax liability should be nil.Unfortunately, he will end up paying a tax of Rs. 32,500. Here is how (Refer Case 2).“Even after getting rebate a rebate of Rs. 12,500, this individual will end up paying Rs. 32,500 as basic tax, plus a cess of Rs. 1,300 bringing his total tax liability to Rs. 33,800. In short – he is paying tax even if his total income is less than Rs. 5 lakh,” explains Vajani.Also Read | Budget 2024: 7 structural reforms FM Nirmala Sitharaman should target for sustainable growth Under the new regime, the tax rate of 20 per cent is provided beyond the income level of Rs. 12 Lakhs and accordingly the disadvantage will continue to the taxpayers having income up to 12 Lakhs, beyond which the calculations will be tax neutral.The Chamber of Tax Consultants had in the past represented that considering the inequity that is created, section 112 should be amended. Tax on long term capital gains should be charged at 5 per cent (instead of 20 per cent), in cases where the total income, including such long-term capital gain is more than the basic exemption limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh but less than Rs. 5 lakh or 7 lakh (for the new regime). Now with the optional tax regimes in place, the need for such an amendment is even more acute.","The long-term capital gains tax provisions are not fair to certain taxpayers, and this requires an amendment in the upcoming Budget 2024. Income-tax (I-T) is a progressive tax mechanism, the more you earn the moreYou pay. The very rich, having a taxable income of over Rs 5 crore pay tax at the rate of 42.74%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111575368,imgsize-1045394,width-400,resizemode-4/111575368.jpg"

Interest for a three-month period:

Need for increase in threshold limit :

MUMBAI: The Income-tax (I-T) Act prescribes for payment of advance taxes if a taxpayer’s liability is more than Rs. 10,000. Section 234C provisions which entail payment of interest for an entire three-month period, till the next instalment date is unfair, especially for certain sections of individuals – like gig workers . Will Budget 2024 usher in a suitable amendment?Salaried individuals can disclose their total income (including the non-salary portion, such as bank interest, rent etc) to their employer, who then accordingly deducts tax at source, each month.If not, they must ensure advance taxes are duly paid as the tax deducted at source by the employer would not cover the entire tax liability . Non-salaried, have to meticulously compute and pay their own advance taxes.This is how it is done: Estimate the total income during the financial year. Reduce all eligible exemptions and deductions, based on the tax regime you have opted for. Further, reduce the tax deducted at source, or collected at source. Compute your estimated tax. If the amount of tax is more than Rs. 10,000 advance tax obligations apply.Small taxpayers who have opted for presumptive taxation scheme u/s 44AD (businessmen) and 44ADA (professionals such as doctors, lawyers) can pay their entire advance tax in one instalment by March 15. Further, senior citizens are not required to pay advance tax, if they do not earn any income from business or profession.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers The first instalment falls due within 75 days from the commencement of the new financial year. Those who do not have a steady salaried income (such as gig workers who have not opted for or are not eligible for presumptive taxation) find it challenging to gauge their income for the entire year at the very onset.Several individuals who moonlight – hold a job, but take up a small assignment here and there – for experience as well as additional income, tend to not opt for the presumptive tax scheme where 50% of the gross revenue has to be offered to tax.Capital gains that may arise on future sale of assets also cannot be predicted – this should be covered in the immutably following advance tax instalment.Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, partner, Nangia Andersen LLP says, “The exponential growth of income opportunities, especially for freelancers in the gig economy and new entrepreneurs, makes it exceedingly challenging to accurately predict annual income during the initial months of the financial year.”Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why 50% HRA exemption should include cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad For their default, taxpayers have to bear interest under section 234C of one per cent per month, until the next instalment which falls due after three months. Even if there is an oversight and a default of one day, the interest payment is for the entire three months.To illustrate: Mr. A ought to have paid advance tax of Rs. 15,000 by June 15. However, he paid only Rs. 5,000. The shortfall is Rs. 10,000. Interest under section 234C will be Rs. 300 (which is @1% for three months).Jhunjhunwala states: “The challenge is further compounded by the stringent interest penalty structure. Even a one-day delay in any of the first three quarterly instalments results in a substantial 3% interest charge for the delayed quarter. Ideally, a more nuanced approach should be implemented. For example, if the June 15 instalment is paid by July 14, a lower interest rate of perhaps 1% could be applied instead of the punitive 3%. This would provide taxpayers with a small buffer period and alleviate the burden of unforeseen delays.”Earlier, the Bombay Chartered Accountants’ Society (BCAS) had in their pre-budget memorandum pointed out that the threshold limit of Rs. 10,000 was last amended by the Finance Act, 2009. Considering inflation, there is a need to increase this limit to a more realistic figure. Further, the requirement to pay advance tax in four instalments (which was only for corporate entities) was introduced for non-corporate taxpayers, by the 2016 budget. The law must be suitably amended to ensure that this requirement is removed for individuals.Prior to this amendment, the three due dates for payment of advance taxes were: September 15 (30% of the tax liability); December 15 (60% of the tax liability) and March 15 (100% of tax liability).Also Read | Budget 2024: 7 structural reforms FM Nirmala Sitharaman should target for sustainable growth “To streamline tax compliance and truly incentivise participation in this evolving economic ecosystem, broader relaxations from advance tax provisions for specific taxpayer categories are warranted. This could include freelancers, whose income is closely tied to project availability and market fluctuations, making income estimation highly improbable.Additionally, early retirees below the age of 60 years, who often generate income from various sources other than PGBP, could also benefit from such relaxation.” “Further, simplifying the current advance tax framework and potentially deferring advance tax liability for the first two quarters (Q1 and Q2) for individuals and new entrepreneurs merits serious consideration.This would alleviate the burden of early and potentially inaccurate income estimation, enhance cash flow management for nascent businesses, and ultimately foster a more supportive environment for taxpayers,” suggests Jhunjhunwala.","The Income-tax (I-T) Act prescribes for payment of advance taxes if a taxpayer’s liability is more than Rs. 10,000.

Differently abled need a fairer treatment under the new tax regime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/differently-abled-need-a-fairer-treatment-under-the-new-tax-regime/articleshow/111519091.cms,"Deduction limit under section 80U

Is denial of this deduction under the new regime fair?

Since its introduction from the financial year 2020-21, the new ‘simplified’ tax regime has seen a few amendments. Under the new regime, while concessional slab rates are available to income up to Rs. 15 lakh, various exemptions be it for HRA, LTA have to be foregone. A majority of deductions available under Chapter VI-A, say for investments in a PPF (section 80C) are also not available.Even the deduction otherwise available to the differently abled under section 80U is denied.Under section 80U of the Income-tax (I-T) Act (applicable only under the old tax regime) some monetary respite is available to individuals with disabilities , depending on the degree of their disability, by offering a deduction against their total income.·For disability between 40-80% the maximum deduction allowed is Rs. 75,000·In cases of severe disability (80% or more) the deduction limit increases to Rs. 1.25 lakhA range of disabilities (set conditions are prescribed) are covered by this section, which include blindness, visual impairment, deformities arising owing to leprosy, locomotion disability, mental retardation, mental illness and multiple disabilities (combination of two or more disabilities in these specified categories). For a claim under this section a medical certificate from a recognized medical authority, specifying the nature and percentage of disability is required.The question that is being asked is whether denial of a deduction under section 80U under the new regime is fair?The Bombay Chartered Accountants Society (BCAS), a voluntary organization of chartered accountants, in its pre-budget memorandum states: Many disabled individuals need to purchase assistive devices or employ the services of an attendant or assistant to help them in their daily living activities and in their work.For example, blind individuals need to purchase screen reading software to work on computers, employ readers for reading hard-copy documents etc.The government has introduced the new tax regime and has given indications that it is the preferred tax regime. Unfortunately, by denying deductions under section 80U, the new tax regime has greatly disadvantaged the disabled taxpayers. In fact, even the amount of deduction available, which was set more than ten years ago, needs to be revised upwards, states BCAS.Vishesh Sangoi, partner at DPS & Co, a firm of chartered accountants points out that the Memorandum to the Finance Bill, 2016, which had revised the deduction limit had pointed out its necessity. “The government had clearly acknowledged the fact that the medical costs have been increasing and the needs of disabled people need to be given special emphasis. By taking away these deductions under the new tax regime, an ordinary person and a person with disability stand on the same footing as far as income tax is concerned,” said Sangoi.He adds, “Deduction u/s 80U, which is aimed at providing financial relief to individuals with disabilities, is fundamentally different from investment-based tax breaks. Unlike deductions under sections 80C or 80D, which incentivize savings and insurance investments, section 80U offers a flat deduction directly addressing the additional costs incurred due to disability. This essential support is not available under the new tax regime with its lower rates, making it crucial to understand that such deductions serve distinct purposes and should not be compared. The choice between tax regimes must consider the unique benefits that deductions like Section 80U provide, beyond mere tax savings. Inclusion of these deductions would not only provide equitable tax relief to taxpayers but also uphold the principles of fairness and inclusivity in our tax system.”Keeping in view the ground realities, BCAS has also suggested that an additional allowance of at least Rs. 50,000 in the nature of ‘care-giver allowance’ or ‘assistive devices allowance’ should be allowed to disabled individuals.","Under section 80U of the Income-tax (I-T) Act, some monetary respite is available to individuals with disabilities. For disability between 40-80% the maximum deduction allowed is Rs. 75,000. In cases of severe disability (80% or more) the deduction limit increases to Rs. 1.25 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111519150,imgsize-848614,width-400,resizemode-4/111519150.jpg"

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July. Like every year, salaried individuals are looking at FM Sitharaman to provide tax relief in the form of reduced tax rates, changed income tax slabs and even higher deductions.One such relief that is sought is to include more non-metro cities in the 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption list.HRA is a common component of employee compensation packages provided by many employers.Employees receiving HRA and paying rent for their accommodation can claim a tax exemption on the allowance under the old income tax regime. The exemption amount depends on whether the employee resides in a metro city or not for tax purposes. However, if an employee receiving HRA does not live in a rented house, the entire allowance becomes fully taxable.According to an ET report quoting Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, the Income-tax Act, 1961, under Section 10(13A), provides tax exemption for HRA. The amount of HRA that can be claimed as tax exempt is the lowest of the following:1. Actual HRA received;2. Actual Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary;3. 50% of basic salary (for metro cities)/40% of basic salary (for non-metro cities).Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report - top 5 points Currently, rented houses in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for a 50% exemption from HRA, while those in other locations fall under the 40% category. It is important to note that this classification was established over three decades ago, according to Viswanathan.As cities have expanded in terms of population and economic growth, it has become necessary to re-evaluate the way we define metro and non-metro cities.Interestingly, the Constitution (seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, also recognizes the National Capital Region (NCR), Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad as metro cities. Despite this, the HRA tax exemption for salaried individuals in these cities remains at 40% due to outdated tax laws.Also Read | Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime Residing outside of metro cities can result in a higher proportion of one's income being paid in taxes. For instance, an individual living in Bengaluru may have to pay a higher average rent compared to someone residing in Kolkata or Chennai, which are classified as metro cities for tax purposes.Those living in rapidly developing non-metro cities, as defined by the Income-tax Act, may pay higher rents due to rapid urbanization. But, they receive lower tax benefits for house rent compared to metro cities. With an increasing number of people relocating to these non-metro cities for employment, it is crucial for the government to reassess the regulations for claiming rent exemptions to alleviate the financial strain on taxpayers, feel experts.",Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July.

Claude 3.5: A basic guide to writing code using Claude 3.5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/a-basic-guide-to-writing-code-using-claude-3-5/articleshow/111502364.cms,"Snip from TOI e-paper

How to start

Master prompts

We asked software developers how they would use an AI assistant like Claude 3.5 Sonnet for a coding project . A frequently cited starting tip is to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts. Software development , especially at the enterprise level, is a complex orchestra of parts that need to come together, so whatever your coding task is for the day, you can always get help from an AI assistant, as long as you have a specific task in mind.Shauvik Mazumdar, senior director of front-end engineering at Ascendion, says he has been amazed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s capabilities in generating websites, apps, and even games. “With the recent addition of ‘ artifacts ,’ it allows us to view and interact with the results in real time too.”He says if Artifacts is not enabled, you should do that by going to the left sidebar, clicking on your name, and navigating to ₹Feature Preview’, where you have the enabling feature.The next step, Shauvik says, is to get back to the chat window and type a prompt to get your project started.If you’ve been tasked with creating a login page for a business, you could create a prompt like this:Design a login page (plain html). The login form needs to have a username and password as the first step. It also needs a ₹forgot password’ feature. Further on successful login, it should show Multifactor authentication. Use Material stylesheet and do basic validation. To test the system, you can use user name and default password like admin, admin and OTP as 1111. On successful login a message should be shown.“Claude will generate the code and an HTML version of the login page side-by-side.You can quickly test the output and instruct Claude to refine it. For plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript, Claude typically provides a demo. It can also generate Angular or React code, though not a live demo as of now,” says Shauvik.Once you have your code, test it, starting with small, isolated tests, before integrating it into larger systems, says Arun Prakash Agrawal, professor & head of the department of computer science & applications at Sharda School of Engineering and Technology in Greater Noida.Maintaining a comprehensive documentation of the code and decisions made during the project, Arun says, will aid in debugging and future maintenance.Mastering the art of writing prompts might be the most crucial skill to gain to make your coding journey more productive. This is the method by which a developer communicates with AI systems, and so being clear and concise is crucial.“Developers need to be specific, and provide proper context to a problem statement. Breaking down tasks, giving examples of similar codes, and asking for code comments will help the prompt responses to be more aligned with the desired outcome. A basic prompt can be refined through proper feedback,” says Deepak Visweswaraiah, VP of platform engineering, and site MD at Pegasystems, India.Vijay Navaluri, co-founder at Supervity, says structuring interactions as multi-turn conversations is also beneficial for complex tasks, as it allows the model to build on previous responses and maintain context.","Claude 3.5 Sonnet can generate websites, apps, and even games.

Evolutionary AI: Evolutionary AI is a powerful answer to complex problems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/evolutionary-ai-is-a-powerful-answer-to-complex-problems/articleshow/111501685.cms,"Real-world use cases

Last week on our webinar, we had three experts – Risto Miikkulainen, Babak Hodjat, and Amir Banifatemi — in the field of what’s called evolutionary AI who painted a vivid picture of the innovative technology and its potential to reshape decision making across industries.Miikkulainen, VP of AI research at Cognizant and professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, and a pioneer in the field of evolutionary AI, explains that evolutionary AI takes its cues from biology, much like neural networks .However, unlike most machine learning techniques that rely on supervised learning with clearly defined targets, evolutionary AI thrives in scenarios with weaker feedback. It can navigate complex problem spaces without predetermined answers.While traditional AI might excel at recognising patterns – like identifying a dog in an image – Miikkulainen says stopping at just prediction is akin to “leaving money on the table”. Instead, evolutionary AI goes a step further: it doesn’t just predict, it suggests actions. By simulating a population of potential solutions and allowing them to “evolve” towards better outcomes, evolutionary AI can uncover novel strategies that even human experts might overlook.As Hodjat, CTO of AI at Cognizant, puts it, evolutionary AI is more aligned with the way we go about making decisions. In the real world, decisions often involve balancing multiple, sometimes conflicting objectives. Evolutionary AI excels here, says Hodjat, offering a range of strategies that balance various outcomes, allowing decision-makers to choose the most suitable approach.“Look at the pandemic, you want to reduce the number of cases, but at the same time you don’t want to have a major economic impact on people’s livelihoods. Evolutionary AI is very good at coming up with strategies that give us a balance of multiple outcomes and lets us then choose which balance of outcomes is more interesting to us.”Hodjat describes a two-step process: first, using AI to create “predictors” that forecast outcomes based on different decisions. Then, evolutionary algorithms search the vast space of possible strategies to find optimal solutions. This approach, he argues, mirrors human decision making processes, allowing for scenario testing and collaborative refinement between AI and human experts.Banifatemi, technology and innovation strategist for AI Commons, a nonprofit that seeks to bring the benefits of AI to everyone, high lights evolutionary AI’s creative potential. Unlike traditional AI that derives solutions from existing knowledge, evolutionary algorithms, he says, can create entirely new solutions. This creativity, coupled with the ability to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously, makes evolutionary AI a powerful tool for tackling complex, multifaceted problems.Banifatemi also points out a crucial advantage: transparency. While many AI models operate as “black boxes,” the solutions generated by evolutionary AI are often more explainable. This transparency is vital in fields where understanding the reasoning behind a decision is as important as the decision itself.Miikkulainen describes an agricultural experiment where evolutionary AI discovered that basil thrives under 24-hour light – a counterintuitive finding that challenged biologists’ assumptions. The experiment involved planting about 300 basil plants and providing them with different amounts of light, water, nutrients, temperature, etc. “Most of them were recipes that the biologists came up with – the usual suspects. But we also had some exploratory examples. And so, we now had 300 points about how the plant grows under different conditions. And then we built a predictive model . We could then come up with crazy recipes and ask the model what would happen in different scenarios. It so happened that we had initially set up a limitation of six hours of darkness. But then we said, let’s open it up to try other solutions. And to the biologists’ big surprise, the model found basil thrives when lights were on 24 hours. This is the kind of solution that will be difficult for humans to discover because they have all kinds of assumptions and evolutionary AI does not,” Miikkulainen says.Banifatemi says evolutionary AI is also showing a lot of promise in pharmaceutical research, particularly for rare diseases where traditional approaches fall short. “For rare diseases, from a pharmaceutical perspective, a number of drug candidates need to be identified. And while the cost of drug research is huge, the market is not that large. With evolutionary AI you can find a cluster of potential molecules for a given set of constraints: like for toxicity, or for a particular genetic background. This accelerates drug research,” he says.The story of evolutionary AI is still unfolding. As researchers and companies like Cognizant continue to invest in and develop this technology, more innovative applications will emerge – and some could come from Cognizant’s India offices. “Cognizant has a very strong presence in India and we have colleagues in India that are well versed in using evolutionary AI,” says Hodjat."," evolutionary AI takes its cues from biology, much like neural networks.

Industry needs to boost capital investments to capitalise on growth opportunities: Anand Mahindra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/industry-needs-to-boost-capital-investments-to-capitalise-on-growth-opportunities-anand-mahindra/articleshow/111465064.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian companies need to enhance capital investment in order to take advantage of the growth opportunities available in India and abroad, according to Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra .Addressing shareholders in the company's annual report for 2023-24, the leading industrialist noted that the interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-Covid era has seen India's position strengthen.India's emerging role as one of the vital nodes in future-proofed supply chains across industries opens the door for growth within the country and expansion beyond, he stated.""How can we, in private industry , ensure that we ride this upsurging tide? ..In the spirit of 'ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country', I would argue that the most important thing industry can do at this critical juncture is to increase private investment ,"" Mahindra said.Private capital investment is the key to capitalising on this opportunity as it is a key driver of growth, jobs, and demand, he stated.After the economic reforms of the 1990s, private investment rose from around 10 per cent to around 27 per cent of GDP, however, from 2011-12 onwards, private investment as a percentage of GDP has been falling to a worrisome level, Mahindra stated.""We need to remedy that situation,"" he added.Mahindra noted that the problem is not one of resources—rather, it is one of mindset.Particularly after Covid, Indian companies have become increasingly risk averse, sticking to the tried and true rather than blazing new trails, he said.""To some extent, this is understandable. But when opportunity beckons, when private industry can make a significant difference, it is time to set aside our fear of failure and take a leap of faith and self-belief,"" he noted.It is undoubtedly a good time to be an Indian company, Mahindra said.""The interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-COVID era has seen India's position strengthen. A new multi-polar manufacturing world is emerging, as nations and companies rush to reconfigure their supply chains to be more resilient and diversified. India has emerged as a key beneficiary,"" he added.For private industry, particularly manufacturing, this confluence of factors translates into an excellent chance to be a serious player in this new, multi-polar world, Mahindra stated.He noted that India has been heavily investing in infrastructure and logistics and the country has become the cheapest manufacturing destination in the world.""Externally too, conditions are working in our favour. It's time to seize the day,"" he stated.Elaborating on the Mahindra Group, he said, ""On the back of this rising tide, we are stepping up our investments. We have already announced an investment of Rs 37,000 crore across our auto, farm and services businesses (excluding Tech Mahindra) in FY25, FY26 and FY27.""These investments will, to a large extent, go towards building capacity, with a pipeline of 26 new models/facelifts in the next 5 years, he said.The valuation of the company's growth gems increased over fourfold in the last four years, Mahindra said.The contribution of services businesses (Mahindra Finance, Tech Mahindra and growth gems) to M&M's net cash generation was almost Rs 7,000 crore over the FY22-FY24 period, he said.Mahindra & Mahindra MD and CEO Anish Shah said the company recognises the fact that private capital investment plays a crucial role in maximising the opportunities in India.""By outlining a capex plan of Rs 37,000 crore for the next three years, we remain committed to our proven strategy of prudent capital allocation,"" he stated.The Mahindra Group draws confidence from the cash generation across businesses, low debt levels, and a robust balance sheet, he added.",The interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-Covid era has seen India's position strengthen.

Jayachandran Ramachandran: Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new coding benchmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/claude-3-5-sonnet-sets-new-coding-benchmarks/articleshow/111329656.cms,"Anthropic’s latest AI model , Claude 3.5 Sonnet , arrived seemingly out of nowhere last week, free to use for everyone, and is now setting new benchmarks in a number of metrics. Most notably, it aced the leader boards in key categories of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena , a benchmark used to measure large language model performance. Specifically, it secured the top position in the ‘Coding Arena’ and ‘Hard Prompts’ categories, beating industry behemoths like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro , all while being a lighter, faster model to run.Jayachandran Ramachandran , senior VP of Artificial Intelligence Labs for C5i, says the LMSYS Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced open benchmarking platform and that users perform various tasks in pair wise comparison of models and provide feedback on which models can satisfactorily provide the best response. “The ranking system is quite transparent, robust, and reliable. In recent times, the top position was occupied by frontier models such as GPT-4 series and Gemini-1.5 series. It is a significant development for Claude 3.5 Sonnet to outsmart other leading frontier models and occupy the top position, especially in coding tasks,” he says.Saurav Swaroop , co-founder & CTO of financing platform Velocity, which recently launched Vani AI , a GenAIled customer calling solution for financial institutions, says that while GPT-4 has been assisting developers with writing code for some time now, it has been prone to errors and hallucinations. “However, Claude can write production level deployable code now. This will boost developer productivity and the time to build software will keep coming down,” he says.With its advanced reasoning skills, it’s great at handling multi-step workflows too, which is essential for complex projects, says Sourabh Kumar, senior manager of experience engineering for Publicis Sapient. “Compared to other industry leaders like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers faster processing speeds and higher accuracy in complex coding and reasoning tasks. For industries such as finance, where accurate data analysis is critical, or retail, where trend prediction can drive success, integrating Claude 3.5 Sonnet can lead to significant efficiency gains and innovation,” he says.Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also offer alternative solutions that coders might not have even considered, says Bebi Negi, senior lead data scientist at the Analytics Centre of Excellence for Happiest Minds Technologies.However, Bebi says coders will still need to check the code created by the model. “While it can create code quickly, it is very important to understand the code and make sure it meets a project’s requirements and standards. Even though benchmarks rate the model at around 90%, the remaining 10% gap underscores the necessity for coders to review the outputs,” she says.Securing the top spot in the Hard Prompts category was also a big deal, says Bebi. “The Hard Prompts category was all about handling complex tasks and instructions. The model did a great job here too, showing it can understand and generate high-quality content, even when the instructions are quite tricky.”","Anthropic’s latest AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is now free to use for everyone.

GenAI: On-device AI is cheaper and faster than cloud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/on-device-ai-is-cheaper-and-faster-than-cloud/articleshow/111329501.cms,"As devices such as smartphones , laptops, tablets and cars become more intelligent and powerful with increased processing capabilities and sensors, the tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on-device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.And while AI may have started off as something very specific to image processing, it has over the past four to five years evolved and exploded, especially with GenAI coming into play, to include a lot more use cases around text processing, voice processing and multimodal use cases, said Rajesh Narayanan, vice president of engineering at Qualcomm .He was speaking on ₹AI on the Edge’ at the first edition of the ‘TechForward’ research seminar series launched by Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIITH). The series seeks to spark regular and deep academia-industry conversations around emerging technologies.Narayanan pointed out that on-device AI has evolved to offer advantages such as personalisation , privacy and security, and with lower energy consumption and costs, and better performance compared to AI on the cloud.“Today, smartphones, smartwatches, devices that are a part of home automation, devices in the car and industrial IoT are equipped with plenty of cameras and sensors and are becoming a lot more powerful with the ability to collect more data. They also have more processing capacities, leading to more context aware user experience that can lead to a much better day-to-day life for all of us,” he said.He said that for all this to become a reality, you need a very powerful AI engine, and the overall solution has to be extremely power efficient.Personalisation is a key selling point for on-device AI as all the data that was earlier being sent to the cloud, potentially compromising privacy and security, can be done on the device. On-device AI also brings down energy consumption significantly compared to running workloads on a much bigger infrastructure like the cloud.Performance too improves as processing on the device itself can enable low latency as opposed to sending the query to the cloud, as with devices like Alexa.Narayanan said on-device AI is also a lot more affordable compared to the cloud. “As we transition from traditional AI to GenAI, the cost per query is actually going up and cloud economics isn’t going to work as compared to doing it on the device,” he said.In his talk on Vision on the AI edge’, Anoop Namboodiri , who heads the Biometrics and Secure Identity Lab and is associated with the Centre for Visual Information Technology at IIITH, said computer vision is playing a key role in pushing AI, and now GenAI.","The tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on- device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.

Service bots get our lingo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/service-bots-get-our-lingo/articleshow/111329125.cms,"Moving to complex functions

Indic language capability

is a little expensive now

The other day I decided to check out an airline’s chatbot to see how it works. I keyed in: “I’m travelling with my 8-year-old son, recommend the best flight without disturbing his sleep”. It asked for my source and destination, which I gave as Chennai and Hyderabad. It asked for the date. I typed ₹Mon’ (for Monday), but it did not recognise what I meant.I typed ₹tom’, it correctly recognised it as tomorrow.The bot responded that there were no flights that “fully meet” my specified criteria and provided a bunch of options. I then asked for the cheapest flight, and non-stop flights. The options it provided were correct – I confirmed that on MakeMyTrip and Google Flights. It automatically filled the passenger list as 1 adult and 1 child for booking. It even clarified the availability of gluten free food for my fictional son.Customer support bots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs. These sophisticated generative AI-based tools are much better than their predecessors, though still far from perfect. Sometimes they ask silly questions even after being explicitly told. They struggle to recognise colloquial words, have woefully poor memory, unlike human agents. But at least you don’t have to listen to hold music for 15 minutes.The leap comes from GenAI ’s ability to understand conversations better, their ability to understand multilingual queries , and support for interfaces like voice and videos. As these systems improve, customer support will become a lot quicker and easier for users, and hugely cheaper for companies, since they won’t have to hire thousands of contact centre staff.Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, director of AI Research at Zoho Corp, says with GenAI, the next goal is to make customer assistant bots do more complex and autonomous functions. He says they could hand over the issue to human agents when it figures it can’t handle it. He says they may even be able to process warranty claims, for instance. “As soon as you reach out, the system will be able to cross-check the database for similar issues/ queries where warranty claims are applicable. A human agent will have to call a supervisor to do the same job,” he says.But these are still some time away. Even for basic customer support services, companies are being careful due to concerns around data privacy, and hallucination. Nobody, after all, wants to get into a situation like Air Canada did earlier this year when its chatbot offered a discount to a customer that it wasn’t supposed to.Chaitanya Chokkareddy, cofounder of Ozonetel, the Hyderabadbased customer experience tech provider, says the focus currently is on automating the most common, repetitive queries. Chatbots, he says, fail in non-common areas of work.He says a lot of work is happening with AI in the back-end like data analysis, summary, intent analysis, and quality control, focusing on efficiency and productivity of human customer agents and improving margins of companies. “We handle about 20 million calls per day which last about 3 to 5 minutes each, and a lot of that data is currently not accessible to managers to make better decisions on their product and services. Demand for back-end services is higher than customer facing applications,” he says.While AI assistants perform relatively well in English, their performance in Indic languages is not great. Ozonetel is building Telugu language tokenisation by working with a non-profit and 1 lakh student interns to build a Telugu database. But Indian languages, he says, cost around 5x to 10x more compared to English because of the complex tokenisation of Indian languages compared to the Roman alphabet. “AI models are charged based on usage and chatbots using Indic scripts have more tokens and hence have higher computational costs. In many cases, the costs are equivalent to a human being and so our customers don’t want to automate,” Chaitanya says.Ankush Sabharwal’s CoRover.ai also has a local language model called BharatGPT. The bot can respond to voice queries in Indian languages, and provide tailored information. It also has video chatbots with pre-generated videos and text-to-video conversion and lip sync, which can be used for purposes like internal training.Ankush says redundant workload should be automated first, and as the adoption increases, more clear use cases will emerge. He says problems like hallucination can be reduced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and use of domain-specific small models.Abhiroop Medhekar, founder & CEO of financing platform Velocity, says they have built text-to-speech and speech-to-text tech for AI-agent voice call automation. They initially used it internally and then started commercial offerings. “Some BFSI applications require an immediate response from customers, but customers frequently don’t respond to mails or WhatsApp reminders. The current robotic IVR calls are not effective either. But these GenAI-based voice calls are interactive and provide better results,” he says.","Chatbots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs.

The inner core had slowed down for the first time in many decades,"" said John Vidale, a professor of Earth Sciences at the University of Southern California, US.Researchers usually study the core by analyzing seismograms, recordings of waves generated by earthquakes, as it is physically inaccessible.The researchers examined seismic data recorded from 121 repeating earthquakes that occurred in the same location between 1991 and 2023 in the South Sandwich Islands, a remote archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean known for its violent earthquakes for the this study.The analysis also included data from twin Soviet nuclear tests between 1971 and 1974, as well as multiple French and American nuclear tests from other studies of the inner core.The slowing down of the inner core is a topic of debate within the scientific community, with some studies even proposing that it rotates faster than the Earth's surface.The spin of the inner core is known to be influenced by the magnetic field generated in the outer core and the gravitational effects within Earth's mantle.Additionally, it is believed that the inner core is reversing and backtracking relative to the surface because it is rotating slower than the mantle for the first time in approximately 40 years.","Earth's inner core began to slow down its rotation in 2010 relative to the planet's surface.

Boeing to plead guilty in probe of 737 MAX crashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-to-plead-guilty-in-probe-of-737-max-crashes/articleshow/111587391.cms,"Boeing will plead guilty to criminal conspiracy in connection with two fatal crashes of its 737 Max jetliner , an agreement that disgraces the storied US planemaker as a felon but avoids a bruising courtroom confrontation as it tries to rebound from multiple crises.Under the agreement with US prosecutors, Boeing faces a criminal fine of as much as $487 million - the maximum allowed by law - though the actual amount will be determined by a judge, according to the Justice Department.The DOJ asked the judge to credit Boeing for the prior fine it paid, which would bring the new penalty down to $244 million, if approved.The company will install a corporate monitor and be required to spend at least $455 million to bolster its compliance and safety programs over the next three years as part of the deal, which requires court approval. It would also be subject to a period of court-supervised probation.The Justice Department determined in May that Boeing breached a 2021 deferred-prosecution agreement tied to the crashes that was struck in the waning days of the Trump Administration. That followed the blowout of a fuselage panel on a 737 Max 9 on Jan 5, just days before the deal was set to expire.The guilty plea marks a low point in the company's century-long history after years of turmoil sparked by two crashes of its 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. The agreement also has the potential to complicate Boeing's interaction with govt as a major defence contractor.

"Inside Boeing assembly line: A battle to win back flyers, airlines & regulators' confidence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/inside-boeing-assembly-line-a-battle-to-win-back-flyers-airlines-regulators-confidence/articleshow/111555714.cms,"What caused the Alaska Air door plug blowout on a B737-9 MAX minutes after it took off from Portland on January 5:

SEATTLE: “IT’S TIME TO EARN IT BACK!!!” Reads the last line (in screaming all capital letters) of a notice board at Boeing ’s Renton final assembly line (FLA) in Seattle where the ill-famed MAX version of the once best-selling B737s are rolled out. It reminds technicians at work here that “737 conformance rate for multiple (assembly) processes have dropped below confidence level” and that the goal is to “ensure a conforming product (for) our customers.”Following two deadly crashes that left 346 people dead; subsequent global grounding for 21 months and a mid-air door blowout involving the MAX in last six years, the 108-year-old aerospace major is battling the biggest crisis of its lifetime — including potential criminal charges by the US justice department.The old slogan “if it’s not Boeing, I am not going,” is a distant memory at least for now.Amid belated enhanced oversight by America’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a consequence of the MAX mishaps, Boeing is trying hard to win the trust back. It recently opened the doors of its single (737) and twin (777) aisle FLAs in Seattle to a section of the world’s media, including TOI. The senior management there admitted of lapses in recent years, while assuring corrective steps are being taken. Process heads spoke of bringing back checks & balances that had been done away with, in pursuit of churning out planes quickly.Clearly, there’s a lot of work to be done to regain the confidence. Multiple aerospace industry insiders in the US who worked for or with Boeing said the focus in last few years had shifted from engineering excellence to financial performance. “I used to be with a supply chain partner and we were constantly asked to cut corners to reduce cost of our supplies. Beyond a point, it became difficult to work with Boeing,” said an engineer in San Francisco who did not want to be named.The final straw proved to be the most recent MAX scare — Jan 5, 2024, door plug blowout on an Alaska Air B737-9 MAX in the US. Elizabeth Lund, Boeing’s senior VP (quality) says the company’s first reaction “was to take immediate action to ensure that no airplane ever leads our factory that could cause an accident. I will tell you very transparently.”She gave an exhaustive list of steps taken to spruce up safety, including something as basic as spelling out the task required in simple English; end of line inspection for critical systems; ensuring work not completed in a process does not travel to the next stage of FLA; enhanced workforce training; eliminating defects and 100% following of safety and quality management systems.“We knew we needed to address systemic issues. The first is workforce experience. We have brought in so many employees since Covid and it overlapped with the time of the MAX grounding (March 2019-Dec 2020). We didn’t actually do an involuntary layoff but we didn’t get them (many of those who left) back. When we came out of the MAX grounding, we were back flying again. We were coming out of Covid and the market came back, incredibly fast at that point. We were hiring lots and lots of people in a short period of time (many) with less experience. (And in) many cases, no aerospace experience. Our build plans are at times complicated. Particularly for a new employee with no aerospace experience. Perhaps they speak English as a second language, (making things) even more complicated,” she said.Elizabeth Lund (Image credit: Saurabh Sinha)Boeing then started using artificial intelligence to go from “engineering English” to “more clear” English. So Instead of saying Boeing wants a 0.375 (unit of measure) hole plus or minus 0.05, it now says the hole should be between 0.356 and 0.393. Many newcomers were found to be “struggling to do jobs correctly”. So Boeing says it overhauled its foundational training and linked it to proficiency testing.A key challenge for the leadership is to keep the workforce morale high as it tries to the with the world’s confidence in its planes. “We are humans and are affected by what has unfortunately happened in the recent past,” said a technician at the MAX assembly line. Katie Ringgold, VP of the 737 programme and Renton site leader, had one request for the media during the shop floor visit, “Keep the tough questions for me and the leadership (and not pose them to the technicians there).”Jason Clark, VP & GM of the B777 programme and Everett site leader, said “employee involvement (EI) — where workers discuss production issues regularly — has been brought back over a month back. “It was done away with as there was a lot of overlap. By doing so, we lost the voice of the mechanic. Now we have again created groups for mechanics to discuss and fix problems,” Clark said.The increased focus on safety and checks has meant FAA asked Boeing to churn out a lot fewer that the 38 allowed B737 MAX per month. Customer airlines, including Air India Express and Akasa, don’t know what will be the delivery schedule of their ordered MAX. The popular Dreamliner (B787) production, assembled at a FLA in Charleston in South Carolina, is also hit. “The production programme in Charleston has been slowed down to stability due to supply chain issues. The steadfast focus is on fey and processes. We will up the rate in next few years and return to five 787s per month later in 2024,” said Scott Stocker, VP & GM B787 programme and South Carolina site leader.Following the Indonesian Lion Air B737 MAX crash in October 2018; Ethiopian B737 MAX crash in March 2019, these planes were grounded globally. They were allowed to resume flying in Dec 2020 after Boeing assured all required corrective action has been taken. Then the door plug blowout happened this Jan on a US carrier.Asked why should anyone believe Boeing that it is actually all that is required to make safe planes, Lund admitted she gets that question as lot. “After the Max crashes we took (many) positive steps. We (created) a separate organisation focused on safety. Just a couple of days (later) I took over this position. There were various levels of internal audit for our production system focused on quality…. We are a company deeply committed to flying safety; to public safety and to our employees. I believe (the current) plan will make us stronger. We are transparent with you (media), with our regulators and our customers. We have opened our factories up to our customers so that they can come in. The regulator has access to all of our data. There is no hidden agenda. There is no hidden data. We are a transparent company who deeply cares about safety and the public and our employees and we are committed to be better every day,” Lund tried to reassure.“We have for years dedicated to making air transportation as safe as humanly possible and continue that way. I believe that the actions we have taken for many years have allowed air transportation to be the safest means of transportation. We have taken steps to address (safety issues) and continue to do so,” she said.Boeing says it has used the Alaska Air door plug-out to “to step back, holistically look at everything and be very introspective. To see what else could we do? How can we be certain that our system is as absolutely robust as possible. So we started collecting input from many many sources.” Boeing received over 30,000 ideas, pain points and areas for improvement across the board, apart from directives of FAA auditors, which are the “primary foundation” of the make-planes-safe-again plan.“How we make sure we make the perfect airplane? The first is invest in workforce training. The second is simplify plans and processes. The third eliminate defects both coming in and that we create and the fourth, elevate our safety and quality,” Lund said.“A defect, non-conforming rivets, arrived from our supplier which in themselves did not create a safety hazard but needed to be fixed. The airplane then traveled throughout the factory. It moved to the end of the (FLA) line while we discussed with our supplier back and forth. By the time we all reached agreement that the rivets needed to be removed and replaced, we had a non-compliance to our process,” Lund said.That plug was opened “without correct documentation and paperwork”. Boeing has a “loop crew” who just button the airplane up for weather when it rolls out of the factory. “In this case, they closed the plug. They did not reinstall the retaining pins. That is not their job. Their job is to just close it and they count on existing paperwork…. The last step is what we call an okay to close. The the plug had a little bit of a fit. That’s how it was able to fly for roughly 150 cycles (before the blowout happened)… A defect entered our system from our supply chain which travelled throughout our final assembly. And then there was a lack of compliance to our processes,” Lund added.Speaking about this under investigation case has earned Boeing the ire of US regulatory agencies.The reporter was in Seattle at the invitation of Boeing.","Boeing is battling the biggest crisis of its lifetime — including potential criminal charges by the US justice department.

The executive made slight adjustments after companies identified minor calculation errors in the initial disclosure.Beijing said then it would take ""all necessary measures"" to safeguard China's interests.These could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.The EU anti-subsidy investigation has nearly four more months to run.At the end of it, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, could propose ""definite duties"", typically applying for five years, on which EU members would vote.China's commerce ministry said on Thursday both sides have so far held several rounds of technical talks over tariffs on the issue.""There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,"" He Yadong, a ministry spokesperson, said.BYD will face duties of 17.4%, Geely 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%, the EU said on Thursday.
