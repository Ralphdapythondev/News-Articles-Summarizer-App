"Good news for EPS Pensioners! Now, get pension from any bank, any branch, anywhere in India from January 1, 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/good-news-for-eps-pensioners-now-get-pension-from-any-bank-any-branch-anywhere-in-india-from-january-1-2025/articleshow/113059993.cms,"Good news for EPS pensioners ! The Union Minister of Labour and Employment and Chairperson, Central Board of Trustees, EPF has given the green light to the proposal for a Centralized Pension Payment System (CPPS) for the Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995.This centralized system at the national level will allow pension disbursement through any bank branch across the country, representing a significant change.The facility will be introduced as part of EPFO 's ongoing IT modernization project, Centralized IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01), starting from January 1, 2025. In the subsequent phase, CPPS will facilitate a smooth transition to the Aadhaar-based payment system (ABPS).Commenting on this new step, Union Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya said, ""The approval of the Centralized Pension Payment System (CPPS) marks a significant milestone in modernization of the EPFO. By enabling pensioners to receive their pensions from any bank, any branch, anywhere in the country, this initiative addresses the long-standing challenges faced by pensioners and ensures a seamless and efficient disbursement mechanism. This is a crucial step in our ongoing efforts to transform the EPFO into a more robust, responsive, and tech-enabled organization, committed to serving the needs of its members and pensioners better.""The CPPS is anticipated to benefit over 78 lakh EPS pensioners of EPFO by leveraging advanced IT and banking technologies, providing a more efficient and user-friendly experience for pensioners.The new system will ensure pension disbursement throughout India without the need for transferring Pension Payment Orders (PPO) between offices, even when pensioners relocate or change their bank or branch. This will greatly benefit pensioners who return to their hometowns after retirement.The CPPS represents a significant shift from the current decentralized pension disbursement system, where each Zonal/Regional Office of EPFO maintains separate agreements with only a few banks.Pensioners will no longer need to visit the branch for verification at the commencement of their pension, and the pension will be credited immediately upon release. Moreover, EPFO anticipates a substantial reduction in pension disbursement costs after transitioning to the new system.","Centralized system at the national level will allow pension disbursement through any bank branch across the country. Facility will be introduced as part of EPFO's ongoing IT modernization project, Centralized IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01), starting from January 1, 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113060144,imgsize-92372,width-400,resizemode-4/113060144.jpg"
Delhi-Dehradun expressway status: Travel from Delhi to Dehradun in 2.5 hours soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/delhi-dehradun-expressway-status-travel-from-delhi-to-dehradun-in-2-5-hours-soon-details-here/articleshow/113013752.cms,"Delhi-Dehradun Expressway: Top Facts

Once finished, the travel time from Akshardham in Delhi to Dehradun will be reduced to just two and a half hours, compared to the current six hours. Similarly, commuters will be able to reach Haridwar from Delhi in two hours.

The 264-km expressway and the Haridwar link, with a total cost of around Rs 14,285 crore, are fully funded by the government. The project boasts special features, including ""Asia's longest elevated wildlife corridor (12 km) and animal underpass,"" which aim to minimize man-animal conflict in the Rajaji National Park and Shiwalik Reserve forest areas.

NHAI sources have indicated that the first leg of the expressway, stretching from Akshardham to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) interchange, is expected to be operational by November this year.

This section passes through areas such as Geeta Colony, Shastri Park, and Sonia Vihar in Delhi, as well as Vijay Vihar, Kasim Vihar, and Mandola in Uttar Pradesh. The opening of this stretch is anticipated to provide relief to many commuters from daily traffic congestion.

The Delhi-EPE access-controlled section, spanning 32 kilometers, includes an impressive 19 kilometers of elevated roadway. This elevated portion is designed to accommodate through traffic, while the six-lane service road below will cater to local traffic needs.

The Delhi-Dehradun expressway will offer seven entry points for vehicles traveling from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh, located at Akshardham, Geeta Colony, Shamshan Ghat (Kailash Nagar), Sonia Vihar, Vijay Vihar, and Mandola. Exits will be provided at Khajuri Chowk, Sonia Vihar, Vijay Vihar, and Mandola.

On the other hand, traffic moving from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi will have entry points at Mandola, Vijay Vihar, and 5th Pusta, with exits available at Mandola, Loni, Vijay Vihar, Usmanpur, Shamshan Ghat (Kailash Nagar), Geeta Colony, and Akshardham. Commuters entering and exiting the expressway within Delhi will be exempt from paying tolls, according to an ET report.

Delhi-Dehradun Expressway status: Come December 2024, you may be able to travel between Delhi and Dehradun in just 2.5 hours! The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to open the New Delhi-Dehradun Expressway for traffic by December. The same has been communicated to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by the road transport ministry officials during a recent meeting.However, the link connecting the expressway to Haridwar only will be ready by May 2025. The Prime Minister instructed the ministry to ensure timely completion of the project without any delays. Sources told TOI recently that all land-related issues have been resolved, and the NHAI has committed to finishing the remaining work on the Delhi-Dehradun expressway within the next four months.The access-controlled link from the expressway to Haridwar was a later addition to the project, and the NHAI will require an additional five months to complete it.","The 264-km Delhi-Dehradun expressway is expected to be completed by December 2024.

India losing to smaller rivals in manufacturing: World Bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-losing-to-smaller-rivals-in-manufacturing-world-bank/articleshow/113031692.cms,"India’s global trade share hasn’t kept pace with its fast growing economy, and the country is losing out to rivals like Bangladesh and Vietnam as low-cost manufacturing export hubs, the World Bank said.India’s trade in goods and services has been declining as a percentage of gross domestic product over the past decade despite its economic heft, the multilateral lender said in a report on Tuesday.The country’s share in global exports of apparel, leather, textiles, and footwear grew from 0.9% in 2002 to a peak of 4.5% in 2013, but has since declined to 3.5% in 2022, according to the World Bank. In contrast, Bangladesh’s share in global exports of these goods reached 5.1%, while Vietnam’s stood at 5.9% in 2022.To boost exports and benefit from China’s shift away from labor-intensive manufacturing, India will need to lower trade costs, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers and revise trade pacts, the lender said.“This is an area where India could focus on,” Nora Dihel, a senior economist at the World Bank, told reporters in New Delhi. “This is a call to action.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambition is to make India a manufacturing hub as businesses diversify their supply chains from China. Modi’s government has spent billions of dollars in subsidies to attract investment in industries such as electronics and chip-making.India’s export sectors are increasingly capital intensive, though, and unable to absorb the millions of jobless people in the country. The World Bank estimated that direct employment related to exports fell from a peak of 9.5% of total domestic employment in 2012 to 6.5% in 2020.The World Bank expects India’s economy to continue growing at a rapid pace of 7% in the current fiscal year through March 2025 after expanding more than 8% in the past year. Growth will probably average 6.7% in 2025-26 and 2026-27, the lender said.","India’s trade in goods and services has been declining as a percentage of gross domestic product.

Source: ET quoting Paisabazaar for interest rates data as on August 14, 2024.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens.

ADIA-backed India fund to seek $4bn for infra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adia-backed-india-fund-to-seek-4bn-for-infra/articleshow/113109566.cms,"India's quasi-sovereign fund plans to seek about $4 billion in its largest-ever fund-raise, according to people with knowledge of the matter, amid govt's drive to upgrade infrastructure across the country.The National Investment & Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), backed by the Indian govt and several global investors, is looking to raise money early next year, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.The new fund would be much larger than the predecessor Master Fund that closed in December 2020 with $2.34 billion, and would mark a restart of activities under a new chief executive officer. NIIF is also raising capital for its private markets fund, and will consider a new private equity fund after the infrastructure fundraise, one of the people said.The firm underwent a rough patch with its biggest shareholder the Indian government over resource allocation and direction, Bloomberg earlier reported. It searched for a new leader after its previous chief prematurely stepped down in 2022, and brought on board infrastructure veteran Sanjiv Aggarwal in February to lead the firm, which manages more than $4.9 billion of assets.Spokespeople for NIIF and the finance ministry didn't respond to requests for comment. Other NIIF backers include heavyweights Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, AustralianSuper and Singapore's Temasek Holdings Pte. Indian lenders HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are also investors. NIIF expects to collect more capital as co-investment commitments from its backers in this fundraise, according to one of the people familiar.NIIF has four funds across different asset classes. The Master Fund is the largest that invests in infrastructure. The other funds include a private markets fund, a strategic opportunities fund that takes direct stakes in companies, and an India-Japan private equity fund focused on environment preservation.The Master Fund recently invested in iBUS Network and Infrastructure, an infrastructure solutions company. Other investments include renewable energy platform Ayana Renewable Power and IntelliSmart Infrastructure, a smart meter platform. The Master Fund is also an owner in Athaang Infrastructure Pvt, which is looking to sell some toll road assets.

The Punjab Cabinet, headed by Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, has decided to raise VAT on petrol and diesel by 61 paise and 92 paise per litre, respectively. Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema indicated that this move is expected to generate an extra revenue of Rs 395 crore from diesel and Rs 150 crore from petrol for the state.

48% GST on hybrid cars, 5% on EVs to stay: Amitabh Kant

G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant highlighted the necessity of maintaining a significant duty differential between electric and hybrid vehicles to encourage zero-emission technologies. Speaking at a Mercedes-Benz event, he underscored the government's dedication to promoting green mobility through various policies, including sustaining a lower tax rate on electric vehicles compared to hybrids.

Preventing vehicle fires: Key causes and safety tips for petroleum, electric, and diesel cars

India's rapid advancements in transportation bring vehicle fire safety to the forefront. The article identifies key fire risks in petroleum, electric, and diesel carssuch as fuel leaks and battery failuresand offers prevention tips. Regular maintenance checks and adherence to safety standards are emphasized to mitigate these risks effectively.

New Delhi: Cracks appear to be building up in the hybrid lobby with Mercedes-Benz , the country’s biggest luxury maker, saying that any tax relaxation for the petrol-battery cars has the potential to create a ‘distortion’ in the industry and slow down the adoption of zero-emission electric vehicles Santosh Iyer, MD & CEO of Mercedes in India, said that being an expensive technology, electrics need to be given lower tax rates so that their affordability is maintained against petrol/diesel and hybrid vehicles.“Today, consumers are not ready to pay a premium for a sustainable mobility solution. They want the prices (of EVs) to be the same or even cheaper if possible (and) in that context, I think a continuation of difference in taxation will help in better adoption, or faster adoption, of EVs,” Iyer told TOI as the company drove in the Maybach EQS electric priced at nearly Rs 2.3 crore (ex-showroom, Delhi).Currently, the GST on electrics is 5%, while larger hybrids are taxed at 43% and regular petrol cars at 48%. “So, technically the govt has a three-tier approach, and the request is to just continue the approach so that it is beneficial in the long run,” Iyer said.Companies such as Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and now Mercedes do not support the demand made by Maruti, Toyota and Honda that tax rates on hybrids should be brought down since they are relatively cleaner than pure petrol/diesel vehicles. Tata Motors’ passenger vehicles division MD Shailesh Chandra has come out strongly on the matter, saying any tax benefits on hybrids will be “regressive and waste of govt money” and will “slow down the pace of EV adoption” while making the green vehicles globally uncompetitive.“You can’t confuse the country. From a tech perspective, incentivising hybrids is a regression for the country and makes us globally uncompetitive… Do you want the country to go slow on zero emissions tech?” Chandra had told TOI recently.","The Punjab Cabinet has decided to raise VAT on petrol and diesel by 61 paise and 92 paise per litre, respectively.

China creates its largest brokerage to take on Wall Street,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-creates-its-largest-brokerage-to-take-on-wall-street/articleshow/113110025.cms,"Profits decline

China is combining two of its largest state-backed brokerages to create a new behemoth as it seeks to consolidate the $1.7 trillion sector and build stronger investment banks to compete with overseas financial firms.Guotai Junan Securities Co will merge with smaller rival Haitong Securities Co through a share swap, according to statements from both companies on Thursday.The combination of the firms, both partly owned by Shanghai’s state assets administrator, will create a new entity with assets of 1.6 trillion yuan ($230 billion), topping Citic Securities Co as the largest brokerage.The merger is pending approval from the companies’ boards and shareholders, as well as regulatory authorities.The deal comes a year after President Xi Jinping urged financial regulators to cultivate a few top-ranked investment banks to compete with Wall Street firms expanding in China. Shares of local brokerages surged on Friday morning.The nation’s securities watchdog has also voiced its support for consolidation, with a goal of having two to three investment banks that can compete globally by 2035. China had about 145 securities firms at the end of 2023, with combined assets of 11.8 trillion yuan, according to official data.“The combination is conducive to building a first-class investment bank and promoting the high-quality development of the industry,” according to the statements.The sector has been hampered by a slump in deals and sluggish capital markets as stocks flounder on weak economic growth. Profits have declined in the past few years, and the outlook for earnings remains bleak after industry heavyweights China International Capital Corp and Citic Securities posted declines in first-half results.Haitong, valued at HK$106 billion ($13.6 billion) in Hong Kong, reported a 75% decrease in profit for the first half, while its shares are down 12% on the year.“The merger will potentially resolve” Haitong’s business concerns, Hua Chuang Securities said in a report. “The overall quality of the underlying assets is not very healthy, which also leads to the low valuation,” it said, adding that the merger may also lead to job cuts with the industry hit by a drought of companies going public.Guotai Junan has about 15,000 employees, while Haitong Securities employs more than 13,600 including 1,645 at investment banking. Guotai Junan didn’t break down its business-line staffing, according to the firm’s 2023 annual report.Under the agreement, Guotai Junan will issue shares to be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange to holders of Haitong’s A shares, and do the same in Hong Kong with H shares. The company also plans a placement of new A shares for ancillary fundraising. They didn’t disclose any financial terms.Both companies suspended trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong starting Friday. The trading halt in the China A shares is expected to last no more than 25 trading days.Brokerages have also become targets of Xi’s signature “common prosperity” campaign, resorting to pay cuts and layoffs to consolidate businesses and comply with tighter scrutiny.The deal would mark a big step in China’s years-long ambition to create an “aircraft carrier-sized” brokerage to take on Wall Street banks after it gradually opened up the financial markets to allow full foreign ownership in 2020.The push could spur consolidation in a sector that’s seen multiple brokerages merging or announcing plans to, fueling expectations for mega deals. This week, Guosen Securities said it aims to buy nearly all of Vanho Securities, and Guolian Securities said earlier it will acquire Minsheng Securities and Western Securities.China had mulled combining two of its largest investment banks four years ago, but progress has stalled. An earlier proposal was for Citic Group, parent of Citic Securities, to buy a stake in CSC Financial Co from Central Huijin, Bloomberg reported.The Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Management Commission indirectly holds about a third of Guotai Junan and almost 20% of Haitong, according to their official websites.","Guotai Junan Securities Co will merge with smaller rival Haitong Securities Co through a share swap.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

add to long list of woes for

Sebi chief

MUMBAI: Upending markets regulator Sebi's stance that all HR-related issues have been resolved amicably, a group of its employees demonstrated within its headquarters at Bandra Kurla Complex in the first half of Thursday. They demanded withdrawal of Sebi's release of the previous evening and resignation of its chief, Madhabi Puri Buch, sources said.More than 100 Sebi officials were present at the silent demonstration that lasted more than an hour, they said.In its press release on Wednesday Sebi had blamed ""external elements"" for instigating employees to agitate against the regulator's management and leadership. Sebi didn't comment about the unprecedented protest by its employees within its campus.The statement came after a letter from Sebi employees to the finance ministry, signed by around 500 officers, had complained about the ""toxic work culture"".""Shouting, scolding and public humiliation have become the norm"" at Sebi, and this, they said, was at the core of their grievances Earlier, a demonstration was scheduled, mainly to press for the employees' demand for a better work environment and withdrawal of unrealistic KRAs. On Wednesday, the demonstration was postponed after the management assured to address their grievances. However, the protests happened after Sebi through a press release on Wednesday evening said that external elements were instigating junior officers to voice theirgrievances to the govt and go to the press.Thursday's protests added to the already long list of allegations that the Sebi chief is currently dealing with. It started on August 11 when US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research accused her and her husband Dhaval Buch of conflict of interest in investigations against the Adani Group. A few days later, Hindenburg also published documents showing that she had earned advisory fees while at Sebi, first as a whole time member since mid-2017 and then as its chief from early 2022. Buch had denied all the allegations with Sebi too issuing a statement backing its chief.Earlier this week, main opposition party Congress alleged that Buch was receiving salary and income from ICICI Bank and its arm, her former employers, even while she was at Sebi. The bank later clarified that those funds, running into several crores, were part of her post-retirement benefits as well as ESOPs that had accrued to her during her employment with the lender. The Congress further questioned how one's retiral benefits could be higher than one's salary.Besides, Subhash Chandra of the Zee group called her 'corrupt' and said as Sebi chief she had a role for the failure of the proposed merger between global media giant Sony and Zee group. Unofficially, Sebi officials had called Chandra's accusations 'malicious' when the regulator was investigating embezzlements of large sums of money by the Zee group, including Chandra.","More than 100 Sebi officials were present at the silent demonstration that lasted more than an hour.

How much money is Elon Musk's X losing by being blocked in Brazil?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-much-money-is-elon-musks-x-losing-by-being-blocked-in-brazil/articleshow/113101317.cms,"Brazil ’s ban of Elon Musk ’s social network, X , will have little impact on the business, which has long relied on the South American nation for user growth and cultural influence but less so for revenue.Brazil has historically been a small part of X’s total business despite being one of the services’ largest markets in terms of users, according to several former employees, who declined to be named sharing private figures.Annual revenue from Brazil was $80 million to $100 million in 2021, the last full year before Musk’s takeover, these people said. That amounted to about 2% of the company’s total sales.That may help explain why Musk was willing to close X’s office in Brazil rather than comply with a judge’s orders to remove some accounts for sharing alleged misinformation and hate speech. Once Musk shuttered the office in August, X no longer had a legal representative in the country, which was part of a Supreme Court judge’s justification for banning the app last week.“The decision to close the X office in Brazil was difficult,” Musk posted at the time, adding that agreeing to the judge’s orders would have been even harder. “There was no way we could explain our actions without being ashamed.”While sales from Brazil would likely represent a small piece of X’s overall business, any revenue is important for the company, which is still fighting to win back advertisers and pay off significant debt obligations. Some of the largest advertisers who used to buy X ads in Brazil, including Apple Inc. and Walt Disney Co, have already halted or cut back spending on the service. It’s possible that Brazil’s share of X’s business has grown since Musk’s takeover in late 2022, especially with US sales down as much as 50%.Musk’s feud with Brazil could also lead to other business issues for the world’s richest man. The same judge who banned X also froze the bank accounts in Brazil for Starlink, the satellite internet provider that’s part of Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, as a way to apply pressure on him. Shortly after the bank freeze, Starlink ultimately agreed to block X.A spokesperson for X did not respond to a request for comment.What will be harder to quantify, though, is the cultural impact of leaving Brazil and ceding the largest country in South America to competitors. Executives at X, previously called Twitter, relied on Brazil to study consumer behavior trends. In 2013, then Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff returned to Twitter after a multi-year hiatus to help revitalize her re-election bid, which she won in 2014, offering Twitter employees a chance to observe its service in a heated democratic political contest. User conversations around the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics in Brazil also played a role in how Twitter executives thought about live events on the service, former employees said.Market research company eMarketer estimates that X has just over 40 million monthly users in Brazil, down nearly 5% from two years prior. Before the ban, eMarketer projected that audience to fall another 6% over the next two years. Some competitors are already reaping the benefits of X’s ban. Bluesky, a decentralized social networking service that was funded by Twitter and then-Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey back in 2019, added more than a million new users over a three-day period coinciding with the ban, the company said Saturday.",Brazil has historically been a small part of X’s total business despite being one of the services’ largest markets in terms of users. Annual revenue from Brazil was $80 million to $100 million in 2021.

Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs aide, told reporters that Turkiye has submitted an application ""for full membership"" in the bloc that Russia this year chairs, and it will be considered.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stated several times that his country aspires to become a member of the BRICS alliance, according to Omer Celik, a spokesman for Erdogan's ruling party. But Celik stopped short this week of confirming that Turkiye has applied formally.The BRICS alliance was founded in 2006 by Brazil, Russia, India and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. It recently has undergone an expansion, and now includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has said it's considering joining, and Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied.BRICS has a stated aim to amplify the voice of major emerging economies to counterbalance the Western-led global order. Its founding members have called for a fairer world order and the reform of international institutions like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.Erdogan, who has been in power for more than two decades, has sought to carve a more independent foreign policy for Turkiye and to enhance its global influence. The country is also frustrated by the lack of progress in its membership talks with the European Union.Last week, Erdogan said Turkiye should ""simultaneously"" develop relations with both the East and the West.Turkiye, which straddles Europe and Asia, joined the NATO military alliance in 1952. It began talks to join the European Union in 2005 but the negotiations have stalled due to concerns over democratic regression under Erdogan's administration, and ongoing disputes with Cyprus, an EU member, among other challenges.BRICS is expected to discuss taking in new members in a meeting in Russia next month.Putin earlier this year welcomed Turkiye's interest in the bloc and promised that Moscow ""will support this aspiration and desire to be together with the countries of this alliance, to be together, closer, to solve common problems.""On Monday, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said Turkiye expressed interest in joining BRICS.",NATO member Turkiye has applied for membership in the BRICS bloc of developing economies.

World Bank's IFC signs green financing deal with Indonesian steel mill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/world-banks-ifc-signs-green-financing-deal-with-indonesian-steel-mill/articleshow/113084959.cms,"SINGAPORE: The International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) has signed an agreement with Indonesian steelmaker PT Gunung Raja Paksi Tbk (GRP) to support its shift to lower-carbon production and help it access green steel markets, it said on Thursday.In its first investment in the Asian steel sector for more than a decade, IFC will provide $60 million to help upgrade GRP's electric arc furnace (EAF) and boost energy efficiency, and will also explore ways to finance the decommissioning of GRP's blast furnace.IFC said its investment in Indonesia's largest private domestically-owned steel manufacturer could be the first of many projects aimed at tackling climate warming CO2 emissions in the steel industry .Antonio Della Pelle, IFC's senior operations officer, said the World Bank 's financing arm plans to roll out similar projects and ""drive sector-wide decarbonisation"" through the use of EAF technology, which uses electricity rather than the coal that fuels traditional blast furnaces, bringing down emissions.IFC will also help GRP improve the performance of its current EAF operations and identify the products and sectors willing to pay a green premium on steel, he said.GRP's chief executive Kimin Tanoto said the company, located in West Java province, was planning to invest up to $600 million to upgrade its entire plant and position itself as a leading regional green steel producer.The company has already decided to write off a newly built and unused blast furnace, and hopes to apply for carbon credits when it is decommissioned in the new year. Della Pelle said IFC was also looking at various options to support the closure, including blended or sustainability-linked finance.""(The decommissioning) was the biggest sore point for our shareholders,"" said Tanoto. ""But the same thing is going to happen to the entire industry ... My message was that we needed to be brave.""The steel sector, responsible for around 8 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, is coming under increasing pressure to switch to cleaner production methods as more countries introduce carbon tax regimes.Europe's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will come into effect in 2026 and force importers to pay a levy on steel products depending on how much carbon dioxide they emit.GRP used to export around 80% of its flat steel products to Europe but it was unable to compete with giant Chinese manufacturers, but by raising the cost of traditional high-carbon steel products, CBAM could allow it to compete again in European markets, especially as green steel demand rises, Tanoto said.""We actually embrace the introduction of carbon tax and policies like CBAM,"" he said, ""With the introduction of the carbon tax, we are quite sure we will be very competitive in the future.""",International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) has signed an agreement with Indonesian steelmaker PT Gunung Raja Paksi Tbk (GRP) IFC will provide $60 million to help upgrade GRP's electric arc furnace (EAF) and boost energy efficiency.

JPMorgan abandons its recommendation to buy China stocks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jpmorgan-abandons-its-recommendation-to-buy-china-stocks/articleshow/113082492.cms,"JPMorgan Chase & Co abandoned its buy recommendation for Chinese stocks, citing heightened volatility around the upcoming US elections in addition to growth headwinds and tepid policy support.China was downgraded to neutral from overweight in the bank’s emerging markets allocation, strategists led by Pedro Martins wrote in a note Wednesday. The potential for another trade war between Washington and Beijing could weigh on shares, while China’s moves to lift itself out of its economic slump remain “underwhelming,” they said.“The impact of a potential ‘Tariff War 2.0’ (with tariffs increasing from 20% to 60%) could be more significant than the first tariff war,” the analysts wrote.“We expect China’s long-term growth to trend down structurally due to supply-chain relocation, the expansion of US-China conflicts, and continued domestic issues,” they added.JPMorgan joins a growing chorus of global firms downgrading their expectations for China’s stock market, following similar moves by former China bulls UBS Global Wealth Management and Nomura Holdings Inc. in the last few weeks. It signals exclusion of China is becoming a popular strategy for investors and analysts amid the country’s dimming prospects and the likelihood of better returns elsewhere.Economists increasingly think China will miss its growth target of around 5% this year — and many equity analysts are now pointing their clients elsewhere.The JPMorgan strategists suggested investors use the money freed up by downgrading China to raise exposure to the markets the US bank is already overweight on: India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Indonesia. They also noted challenges in managing the high weight of China in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and the growth of EM ex-China mandates.New EM equity funds that exclude China are sprouting up, and have already matched the annual record of new launches of 19 set last year as investors seek better returns outside of the country. Meanwhile, the outperformance of India and Taiwan puts the weight for each of them only a few percentage points away in replacing China’s top spot in EM equity portfolios.In a separate note written by strategists including JPMorgan chief Asia and China equity strategist Wendy Liu, the bank cut its end-2024 base target for the MSCI China Index to 60 from 66, and for the CSI300 Index to 3,500 from 3,900. Those predictions are still above where the two indexes are currently trading.The vast majority of global banks now expect China’s economy to grow less than 5% this year, with Bank of America Corp. the latest to slash its forecast. JPMorgan’s Haibin Zhu has also cut China’s 2024 GDP growth forecast to 4.6%.“We think the market may trade on the weak side during Sept-Oct after Q2 results,” Liu wrote. “During this time, the US presidential election, the Fed’s rate decisions, and the US growth outlook will be front and center.”JPMorgan also raised the cash level in its China equity model portfolio to 7.7% from 1%, according to a report.",China was downgraded to neutral from overweight in the bank’s emerging markets allocation.

HOUSTON: Abu Dhabi National Oil Company ( ADNOC ) will acquire a 35 per cent equity stake in Exxon Mobil Corp's proposed low-carbon hydrogen project in Texas , with the companies announcing a one-year start-up delay until 2029.ADNOC's investment shows a sign of confidence in a multi-billion dollar project that Exxon has threatened to cancel if the US government restricts tax credits for it.A final investment decision has been pushed into 2025, from 2024.Exxon and ADNOC declined to disclose the value of the transaction.""This is a very significant investment and the partners it is attracting give a sense for the momentum that's building around this project,"" Exxon President of Low Carbon Solutions Dan Ammann told Reuters.Exxon in 2022 disclosed plans to build the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen facility at its refining site at Baytown, Texas. Hydrogen is a fuel that produces water when burnt.The project would be powered by natural gas, with associated CO2 captured and buried underground. It was announced on the back of clean energy tax incentives proposed by the administration of US President Joe Biden.But the government limited incentives for natural gas-run facilities. Exxon CEO Darren Woods earlier this year said the project could be canceled without similar tax credits offered to hydrogen facilities powered by renewable fuels.The project's estimated production has been revised since its initial announcement. It was initially set to produce 1 million tons of hydrogen annually.Now, the goal is to produce 900,000 tons of low-carbon hydrogen and over 1 million tons of low-carbon ammonia, a well-established industrial product commonly used as fertilizer.Ammonia, which has three atoms of hydrogen in its composition, is also used as a carrier for hydrogen, allowing it to be exported by ship in a liquid form.Exxon earlier this year signed an agreement with JERA, Japan's top power generator, to explore selling about 500,000 tonnes annually of low-carbon ammonia.""The timing (for the hydrogen project) depends on supply, demand and supporting regulation coming together in sync,"" said Ammann.",Abu Dhabi National Oil Company ( ADNOC) will acquire a 35 per cent equity stake in Exxon Mobil Corp's proposed low-carbon hydrogen project in Texas.

""On our side, we are ready to move forward as and when our partners are ready,"" High Commissioner of India to the UK Vikram Doraiswami said.Subrahmanyan said: ""The fingers are touching but are not yet at handshaking distance - an extra five inches and you can grab."" He added: ""Institutions are not yet global in India. When you think global, you are open to free trade.""",Eight projects have been identified for support and funding under the UK-India Infrastructure Financing Bridge. Niti Aayog and the City of London Corporation signed an agreement that will allow global companies to bring international standards to make the projects attractive for funding.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113078014,imgsize-152514,width-400,resizemode-4/113078014.jpg"

On Tuesday, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris argued that US Steel should remain under domestic ownership, while Republican nominee Donald Trump vowed to block the deal if elected.Despite the criticism, US Steel and Nippon Steel have defended the agreement, highlighting its potential benefits.Earlier on Wednesday, Nippon Steel assured that if the deal proceeds, US citizens would hold key senior management positions and a majority of board seats at US Steel.Burritt also mentioned that the planned expansion of the company’s Arkansas mill would enable the closure of its last steelmaking operation in Pittsburgh’s Mon Valley, with a likely relocation of the company’s headquarters to the South.The deal has received regulatory approvals from outside the US and approval from US Steel’s shareholders, but it is still under regulatory review in the United States.",US Steel may close its mills and relocate its headquarters from Pittsburgh if the $14.9 billion buyout by Nippon Steel falls through.
