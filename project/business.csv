Indirectly, this could lower borrowing costs for govt and corporates, spurring investment and helping growth.Unlike in the past when sharp 50bps rate cuts in the US were aimed at stalling a recession in the world's largest economy, the current one is primarily aimed at pre-empting a downturn, economists said.On Thursday, the 50-basis-point (100bps = 1 percentage point) US rate cut decision propelled the sensex to a new peak even as it closed marginally higher at 83,185 points, the rupee gained 10 paise against the dollar to 83.66 while the 10-year yield closed barely changed at 6.76%.A top finance ministry official said that the Fed move will not have a significant impact on capital flows, while it's positive for the Indian economy overall. ""It is positive for the global economy, including the Indian economy,"" Ajay Seth, economic affairs secretary at the finance ministry, told reporters in Delhi. ""I don't see that (50bps cut) making any significant impact on inflows. We have to see from (the point of) where the (US interest rates ) levels are. We have to see how other economies' (and) markets behave,"" Seth said.Echoing Seth's views chief economic adviser, V Ananatha Nageswaran said that the impact of Fed decision on India will be ""little muted"" and much of the rate cut decision is already priced in.Economists feel that Fed's decision is unlikely to prompt a similar move by RBI and a rate cut in India could come in only early next year. ""The aggressive rate cut by the Fed has an important bearing on RBI's own decision on interest rates. Although this is not explicit, fall in dollar rates impact domestic inflation through international prices,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, SBI.""Additionally, the better liquidity position may provide the cushion to (RBI) to let the festive season tide over. As such, we don't anticipate any rate action by RBI in 2024. An early 2025 rate cut (Feb) looks the best bet,"" Ghosh added.From the stock market's side, ""this rate cut (by the Fed) will facilitate flows to the emerging market assets with weaker dollar and lower rates"", said Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak Mahindra MF.In the domestic market on Thursday, the Fed's decision had boosted investor sentiment that pushed the sensex up by nearly 850 points in early trades to 83,774.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore. In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112317825,imgsize-144990,width-400,resizemode-4/112317825.jpg"

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-losing-sheen-government-cuts-gold-bond-issuance-target-as-investors-look-at-better-alternatives/articleshow/112035342.cms,"Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

Supreme Court rejects telcos' plea to recalculate Rs 1L crore dues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/supreme-court-rejects-telcos-plea-to-recalculate-rs-1l-crore-dues/articleshow/113504368.cms,"AGR dues: Vi needs to pay Rs 70k crore, Airtel nearly Rs 30k crore

NEW DELHI: In a blow to ailing telco Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel , the Supreme Court has rejected their curative petition seeking re-calculation of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of over Rs 1 lakh crore that they were ordered to pay by the court in October 2019.A bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices Sanjiv Khanna and B R Gavai also rejected the plea of the telcos seeking to list the curative petitions for open court hearing.The plea's dismissal means the companies will have no option but to cough up the money by March 31, 2031, as the apex court had earlier allowed for the payment to be made over 10 years, starting March 2021.In July 2021, too, SC had dismissed a plea by the telcos seeking a ""correction of errors"". The court had held that the demand raised by the DoT with respect to AGR dues would be final. It also said that telecom companies shall not raise any dispute and there shall not be any reassessment.Last Oct, the top court had taken note of submissions of some of the telecom companies seeking listing of their pleas on the AGR due issue. The telcos had referred to alleged ""errors in the arithmetic calculation"" for arriving at the AGR-related dues by the DoT.""Application for listing the curative petitions in open court is rejected. We have gone through the curative petitions and the connected documents. In our opinion, no case is made out within the parameters indicated in the decision of this court in Rupa Ashok Hurra v Ashok Hurra. The curative petitions are dismissed,"" the bench said in an order dated Aug 30, which was uploaded on Thursday.The move will mean that Vodafone Idea, already crippled by losses, will have to cough up nearly Rs 70,000 crore. The company, which raised funds recently, has debt of over Rs 2.3 lakh crore, including AGR and statutory payments. The apex court's order sent Vi stock crashing by as much as 19% on BSE, closing at Rs 10.44.Sources said that Vodafone Idea management is ""not unduly worried"" by the decision, especially as ""none of the company's revival plans hinged on the outcome"" of the curative petition. ""The company has just raised Rs 20,000 crore, primarily through follow-on public offering (FPO) and some promoter funding. It is in the process of deploying the funds for network expansion. Simultaneously, the steps for raising debt remains on course. There is not much need to panic,"" a source said, requesting anonymity.Airtel has estimated AGR dues of under Rs 30,000 crore, but remained unscathed by the ruling with its shares gaining 1% to Rs 1,672 as its better financial position is seen to help it overcome fresh pressure. Reliance Jio's late entry has helped it avoid any major outstanding dues.According to the revenue-sharing model introduced by the Centre in 1999, telcos have to pay a certain portion of their AGR as licence fee. Initially, 15% AGR was fixed as licence fee under revenue-sharing, which was reduced to 13% and then to 8% in 2013.The contentious issue of AGR dues arose when the apex court in Oct 2019 dismissed the plea of telecom companies that AGR should include only core telecom services and exclude revenue from other sources. SC had accepted the Centre's contention that AGR should include dividends, handset sales, rent and profit from the sale of scrap, apart from revenue from services.","Vodafone Idea will have to cough up nearly Rs 70,000 crore.

Applications for US unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level since May, indicating the job market remains healthy despite a slowdown in hiring.Initial claims decreased by 12,000 to 219,000 in the week ended September 14, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That was below all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The period also corresponds with the so-called reference week when the survey is conducted for the September employment report.Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, also dropped in the previous week, to the lowest in three months.The four-week moving average, a metric that helps smooth out volatility in the data, fell to 227,500, the lowest since June.“Initial jobless claims declined more than expected in the survey week for September’s employment report, due in part to difficulty adjusting the data around a major holiday like Labor Day.

Declining sales and failure to evolve: How Tupperware found itself in crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/declining-sales-and-failure-to-evolve-how-tupperware-found-itself-in-crisis/articleshow/113489961.cms,"Tupperware Goes Bankrupt: How The Colourful Tiffin Box Maker Lost Its Vibe I Explained

Tupperware Brands , the company known for its iconic colourful food storage containers , filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Tuesday. The company has been reportedly struggling with mounting losses due to declining demand for its products in recent years.In the 1950s, Tupperware experienced a surge in popularity as women of the post-war generation held ""Tupperware parties"" at their homes to sell the containers, seeking empowerment and independence.However, the company has faced challenges in recent years as it struggled to place its products in retail stores and online sales platforms. Tupperware has traditionally relied on independent sales representatives to sell its products, but this strategy has failed to reach modern consumers, according to Brian Fox, Tupperware's chief restructuring officer, who said in a court filing, ""Nearly everyone now knows what Tupperware is, but fewer people know where to find it.""Financial analysts also criticized Tupperware in recent years for sticking with the direct sales model and failing to evolve with the times.Despite efforts to turn its business around, Tupperware has been facing challenges for years, reporting several quarters of falling sales. The post-Covid circumstances intensified these challenges. Initially, Tupperware saw a boost in sales as Americans turned to home cooking during the pandemic. Yet, as the world reopened, the company faced a sharp rise in labour, freight, and raw material costs—particularly for plastic resin. These increasing expenses, coupled with a failure to adapt its sales strategy, have resulted in several quarters of falling sales.Tupperware has been grappling with liquidity constraints and has raised doubts about its ability to remain in business. News agency Reuters reported that the company has $812 million in debt, much of which was purchased by distressed debt investors at a deep discount in July. These new lenders sought to use their debt position to seize Tupperware assets, including its intellectual property such as its brand, pushing the company to seek bankruptcy protection.Tupperware intends to continue operations and conduct a 30-day bidding process to find a buyer for the entire company.According to bankruptcy filings, Tupperware has estimated assets of $500 million to $1 billion and estimated liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion. The company has listed the number of creditors to be between 50,001 and 100,000. In 2023, Tupperware finalized an agreement with its lenders to restructure its debt obligations and engaged investment bank Moelis & Co to help explore strategic options.","Tupperware Brands, the company known for its iconic colourful food storage containers, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday.

US stocks dip despite larger Fed interest rate cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-dip-despite-larger-fed-interest-rate-cut/articleshow/113473355.cms,"On Wednesday, Wall Street stocks experienced a slight decline following the Federal Reserve's announcement of a half-percentage-point interest rate cut. The central bank's chair, Jerome Powell , assured a ""careful"" approach to lowering rates, acknowledging the progress made in combating inflation in the United States.The Federal Reserve's decision was supported by an 11-to-1 vote in favor of reducing the benchmark rate to a range between 4.75 percent and 5.00 percent.The larger-than-expected rate cut surprised some analysts who had anticipated a quarter-point decrease. Additionally, policymakers projected an extra half-point of cuts by the end of this year and a further percentage point of cuts in 2025.Meanwhile, major US stock indices fluctuated between positive and negative territory following the Fed's decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.08 points, or 0.25%, to 41,503.10, the S&P 500 lost 16.32 points, or 0.29%, to 5,618.26 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 54.76 points, or 0.31%, to 17,573.30. Briefing.com noted that the Fed's decision would be met ""with both elation and criticism,"" as the larger rate cut could appease those who believe the Fed is lagging in preventing a hard landing. However, it may also face criticism from those who think the more aggressive rate cut was unwarranted given broader economic trends, with concerns that it could reignite inflation.During a news conference, Powell described the US economy as being in ""good shape,"" highlighting lower inflation and robust growth. He emphasized the Fed's desire to maintain a strong labor market. The decision to implement a larger rate cut was based on various economic data points, leading policymakers to conclude that monetary decisions had been ""appropriately restrictive"" and that a ""more neutral"" approach was now necessary. Powell signaled that investors should expect more interest rate cuts in the future but cautioned that the central bank would proceed carefully and evaluate the matter ""meeting by meeting.""In Europe, stock markets in Paris and London closed lower, while Frankfurt ended the day flat. The dollar initially experienced a significant drop against the euro and other currencies but later recovered. The Fed now anticipates only a half-percentage point of cuts remaining in 2024, which is lower than the three-quarter percentage point that traders had been expecting. Traders are now focusing on the upcoming announcement by the Bank of England on Thursday.

Wednesday's decisive move highlights the growing concern among policymakers over the employment landscape .""The committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,"" the Fed said in a statement, adding that officials are ""strongly committed to supporting maximum employment"" in addition to bringing inflation back to their goal.Policymakers pencilled in an additional percentage point of cuts in 2025, according to their median forecast.Governor Michelle Bowman dissented in favour of a smaller, quarter-point cut, the first dissent by a governor since 2005, and the first dissent from any member of the FOMC since 2022.In their statement, policymakers said they will consider ""additional adjustments"" to rates based on ""incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks."" They also noted that inflation ""remains somewhat elevated"" and job gains have slowed. The central bank raised rates 11 times, bringing its benchmark to a two-decade high in July 2023.Since then, inflation has cooled considerably and - at 2.5% - is nearing the Fed's 2% target. And while the labour market has weakened, there's no clear indication the US economy is in recession or on the cusp of falling into one. Layoffs remain low, consumers are still spending and economic growth is strong.Still, there are growing signs of strain. Excess savings that helped support Americans in recent years have run dry, and delinquency rates are rising. An increase in job losses could trigger a pullback in spending and slow the economy. The muddied economic picture has increased uncertainty and spurred divisions among Fed officials over the best path forward for policy.Some are anxious to curb labour-market weakness before it spirals into more pain. Others worry that cutting rates too quickly may reignite demand and keep inflation elevated.","The Federal Open Market Committee voted 11 to 1 to lower the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%.

Wall Street holds near records after Fed delivers a big cut to rates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-holds-near-records-after-fed-delivers-a-big-cut-to-rates/articleshow/113468971.cms,"NEW YORK: Wall Street is holding near its records on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kicked off its efforts to prevent a recession with a bigger-than-usual cut to interest rates .The S&P 500 was virtually flat in late trading and 0.6% below its all-time high set in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 31 points, or 0.1%, and close to its record set on Monday.The Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher, as of 3:35 p.m. Eastern time.The momentous move by the Fed helps financial markets in two big ways. It eases the brakes off the economy, which has been slowing under the weight of higher rates, and it gives a boost to prices for all kinds of investments. Besides stocks, gold and bond prices had already rallied in recent months on expectations that cuts to rates were coming.Because the move was so well telegraphed, and markets had already climbed so much in anticipation of it, Wall Street's reactions were relatively muted despite the Fed's historic action. It marked the first cut to the federal funds rate in over four years, and it closed the door on a stretch where the Fed kept the rate at a two-decade high to slow the economy enough to stifle the worst inflation in generations.Now that inflation has eased significantly from its peak two summers ago and appears to be heading toward 2%, the Fed says it it can turn more of its attention toward protecting the slowing job market and overall economy.""The time to support the labor market is when it's strong and not when you begin to see the layoffs,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. ""That's the situation we're in.""The only question is how much the Fed will ultimately cut rates by to do so, which can prove to be a tricky balance. Lowering rates would help the economy by making it easier for US businesses and households to borrow. But it could also offer more fuel for inflation.The Fed released forecasts Wednesday that said its median official expects to cut the federal funds rate by another half of a percentage point through the end of the year. That could mean a traditional-sized cut of a quarter of a percentage point at each of its two remaining meetings scheduled for 2024.After that, the median Fed official is projecting another full percentage point of cuts during 2025.Some critics say the Federal Reserve may be moving too late to protect the economy after having kept rates too high for too long.""When the Fed is behind the curve, it sometimes takes a big move to catch up to where they should have been all along,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.""We don't think we're behind,"" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's announcement. ""We think this is timely. But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind,"" pointing to Wednesday's hefty cut of half a percentage point. Powell called it a ""good strong start to this.""Other critics, meanwhile, are saying the Fed will need to be careful about cutting rates too much because of the possibility that inflation will remain stubbornly higher than it's been in recent decades.Powell repeated several times that the Fed does not feel ""a rush to get this done"" and will make its decisions on interest rates at each successive meeting, depending on what incoming data say.""We'll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time,"" he said.

US Fed rate cut: Michelle Bowman's dissent is first from Fed Governor since 2005,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/michelle-bowmans-dissent-is-first-from-fed-governor-since-2005/articleshow/113468380.cms,"Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman made history on Wednesday by becoming the first Fed governor since 2005 to vote against an interest-rate decision, marking a rare moment of dissent within the US central bank. Bowman’s opposition denied Fed Chair Jerome Powell a unanimous decision at a critical juncture, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points.Bowman favored a more modest quarter-point cut, while the other 11 voting members supported the half-point reduction. Out of the Fed's 19 policymakers, only 12 cast votes on rate decisions, including the seven members of the Fed Board and the president of the New York Fed. The remaining 11 Fed presidents rotate in voting every year.Dissents from Fed governors were more common prior to 1995, but since then, the majority of the 90-plus dissents have come from Fed presidents. Fed chairs, including Powell, typically seek consensus to maintain credibility, often reaching compromises to avoid open disagreement. However, dissents are not unheard of, particularly at key moments in monetary policy . During the pandemic, unanimous decisions were more frequent, but Powell acknowledged that differences of opinion are a normal part of the process.Bowman’s dissent was a notable one, as she has become one of the more hawkish voices at the Fed, consistently advocating for higher interest rates to fully combat inflation. Her call for a quarter-point cut reflected her concerns about easing too quickly. This marks the first hawkish dissent from a Fed governor in nearly 30 years.While financial markets largely expected a half-point cut ahead of the meeting, Bowman's dissent underscores the balancing act the Fed faces. Dissenters, such as Kansas City Fed President Esther George in 2022, have historically marked significant moments in Fed decision-making. As ING economist James Knightley noted, such disagreements suggest ""tough discussions"" are taking place within the central bank.Bowman has also diverged from the majority on regulatory matters, advocating for a lighter approach to bank regulation. Her dissent on Wednesday continues her pattern of pushing for a stricter stance on inflation, even as the majority of her colleagues support easing monetary policy.",Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman was the first governor to vote against an interest-rate decision since 2005.

US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 50 bps in key FOMC meet chaired by Jerome Powell,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-rate-cut-fomc-meet-september-18-2024-jerome-powell-key-highlights/articleshow/113465996.cms,"US Federal Reserve Rate Cut: Key Points

The Fed delivered a half-of-a-percentage-point cut as part of the expected 100 basis-point reduction for the year.

The US Federal Reserve's latest economic projections, released on Wednesday following its Sept. 17-18 meeting, indicate that central bankers expect to reduce interest rates to a range of 4.25%-4.50% by the end of the year. This projection range is lower than what they had anticipated in June, as inflation moves closer to their 2% target and unemployment increases.

The Fed's current target range for its short-term borrowing benchmark stands at 4.75%-5.00%, and the projections suggest that policymakers anticipate quarter-point rate cuts at the remaining two meetings this year, scheduled for November and December.

Looking further ahead, the median Fed policymaker projects a policy rate of 3.4% by the end of 2025, implying an additional four quarter-of-a-percentage-point cuts in 2024.

The policy rate is expected to reach 2.9% by the end of both 2026 and 2027, indicating a return to what the median Fed policymaker now considers a neutral rate.

These projections represent a shift from the Fed's June projections, which had anticipated only one quarter-point reduction in all of 2024. The change in outlook comes as inflation has eased from unexpectedly strong readings earlier in the year, while the unemployment rate has risen to 4.2%, more than half a percentage point higher than when the Fed began its rate-hike campaign in March 2022.

The Fed's decision to cut rates was based on the progress made toward its inflation goal and the assessment that the risks to both its mandates are now ""roughly in balance."" However, the decision was not unanimous, with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman dissenting in favor of a smaller quarter-point cut.

It is important to note that the projections represent the views of individual policymakers rather than an agreed consensus. Two of the Fed's 19 policymakers felt that no further rate cuts were necessary this year, while seven believed that only one additional quarter-of-a-percentage point cut would be required. On the other hand, only one policymaker anticipated more rate cuts this year than the median view.

US Federal Reserve Meeting : The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates by 50 basis points. ""In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent,"" the FOMC statement read.This is the first time in over four years that the US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates.Today’s rate cut starts a cycle to reverse the restrictive conditions that had been imposed to keep inflation in check."" In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the FOMC statement read.Since July 2023, when the central bank last raised interest rates by 25 basis points to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% to address inflation, borrowing costs have remained at their highest levels in over two decades. Recently, however, attention has shifted to a moderating labor market.The latest US economic data shows that job growth, while slowing from the high levels seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, remains in positive territory, according to a Reuters report. Retail sales and industrial production figures released on Tuesday exceeded expectations, and the Atlanta Fed's model, which estimates economic growth based on incoming data, indicates that the economy is currently expanding at a 3.0% annual rate in the third quarter, surpassing the central bank's estimates of the U.S. economy's potential.Following the pandemic, a perfect storm of factors, including goods scarcity, significant spending, labor shortages, large government deficits, and aggressive corporate pricing, pushed inflation to its highest level in 40 years in 2022.Although wage growth was robust and outpaced price increases for many workers, sentiment remained negative for much of the time. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates to slow the economy, which led to higher home mortgage rates and banks tightening credit for various loans and borrowers.The Fed's preferred inflation measure is now just half a percentage point above the central bank's target, and it is expected to gradually decrease throughout the remainder of 2024 and into the following year.Despite the challenges, the economy has performed better than anticipated by nearly all measures.This year, US stock markets have rallied, with all three major indexes reaching record highs due to expectations of lower interest rates as inflation eased and the job market displayed gradual signs of cooling.","US Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates by 50 basis points.

"US Fed to kick off rate cuts, signal next steps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-to-kick-off-rate-cuts-signal-next-steps/articleshow/113441724.cms,"‘Dots’ and Economic Forecasts

The Fed's June Dot Plot

FOMC Statement

“The Fed is all but sure to kick off the rate-cut cycle at its Sept. 17-18 meeting. Whether they start with a 25- or 50-basis-point cut remains a close call. In our view, forecast coherence and risk management point to 50 basis points as the right choice. The absence of a clear steer — so far — on the possibility of a jumbo move points toward the 25-basis-point option.” Anna Wong, chief US economist

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates this week after holding borrowing costs at a two-decade high for more than a year.By how much, however, remains an open question.Forecasters largely anticipate the Federal Open Market Committee will reduce rates by a quarter point to a range of 5% to 5.25%, though economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co.expect a bigger, half-point move. Investors see better-than-even odds of a half-point adjustment.Fresh quarterly projections released at the conclusion of the central bank’s two-day policy meeting will offer further insight into the path ahead for borrowing costs and the economy.Investors generally see a more aggressive path of reductions this year than the series of quarter-point cuts expected by economists. Financial markets have priced in more than a full percentage point of cuts before the year is out, implying at least one half-point cut.Fed Chair Jerome Powell will need to strike a balance in the press conference between his own views, those of the committee and the message sent by the so-called “dot plot” of individuals’ rate projections — something that could prove challenging if the narratives differ.The decision will be announced via a post-meeting statement at 2pm on Wednesday in Washington. Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later. Here’s what to look for:Each quarter the Fed publishes what’s known as the Summary of Economic Projections, a compilation of policymakers’ individual forecasts for the federal funds rate, unemployment, economic growth and inflation. This week’s SEP will include projections for 2024 through 2027.It will likely include a range of views for the path of interest rates this year. Several participants saw the case for lowering interest rates at the FOMC ’s July meeting amid a pickup in unemployment and easing inflation. Since then, the labor market has weakened further. On the other hand, consumer prices excluding food and energy unexpectedly firmed in August, strengthening the case for moving with caution.While the median dot may signal three quarter-point cuts this year, there are likely to be several officials who think the Fed should lower rates faster.“There are a number of people who think this cut should be 50 basis points, or there should be a 50-basis-point cut later this year,” said Derek Tang, economist at LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics. “The economy is softening quicker than they expected.”The economic forecasts for this year will also be revised. The unemployment rate has already surpassed the Fed’s June projection of 4%, and the central bank’s preferred inflation metric — at 2.5% — has already fallen below the committee’s most recent median forecast.The FOMC doesn’t vote on the forecasts, but they do vote on the statement. The document provides a qualitative description of how the committee as a whole sees the near-term outlook relative to their mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.There are several possibilities for how the wording may change, including language around the balance of risks between employment and inflation.The July statement said those risks “continue to move into better balance,” a line MacroPolicy Perspectives’ Julia Coronado and Laura Rosner-Warburton say is now out of step with recent comments from both Powell and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Coronado and Rosner-Warburton said the FOMC could instead adopt a line similar to what Waller said on Sept. 6: “The balance of risks has shifted toward the employment side of our dual mandate.”The committee may also choose to describe further weakening in the labor market as “unwelcome,” a Greenspan-era term Powell resurrected in a recent speech.Economists are divided on whether and how policymakers would signal future cuts in the statement. Some 44% of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said officials will acknowledge the possibility of further adjustments in the document, while 31% said they’d more explicitly state their intent to pursue a string of rate cuts and provide guidance on the pace.Press ConferenceThe press conference will offer insight into not only the committee’s thinking but also Powell’s. Fed watchers judge that the chair is more uncomfortable with recent job market softening than the median committee voter.Powell has grown increasingly encouraged the Fed can tame inflation with little cost to the economy and jobs. A jump in unemployment now would have high political and economic costs, a situation any central bank chief would want to avoid.If officials do choose to lower rates by a quarter point, Powell has the latitude to signal he aims to guard against further deterioration in the job market.“The message will be: We want extra ammunition on the table, but we aren’t going to use it today,” said Ellen Meade, a former senior adviser on policy and communication at the Fed Board who is now a research professor at Duke University.New VoterThis Fed meeting will also be the first for Beth Hammack, the new Cleveland Fed president. The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc veteran started in August and will cast a vote for the remaining policy decisions this year.",The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates this week after holding borrowing costs at a two-decade high for more than a year.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
