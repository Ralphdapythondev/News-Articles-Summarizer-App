Stock market today : BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices rallied strongly in trade on Monday. While BSE Sensex reclaimed the 80,000 mark, Nifty50 too went above 24,500. BSE Sensex ended the day at 80,436.84, up 1,331 points or 1.68%. Nifty50 closed the day at 24,541.15, up 397 points or 1.65%. The top BSE Sensex gainers were Tech Mahindra, M&M, Tata Motors, TCS, Ultratech Cement, HCL Tech and ICICI Bank.The Indian stock market opened higher on Friday, following positive cues from global peers, as U.S. economic data alleviated recession fears in the world's largest economy.Several factors contributed to the rally, including cooling U.S. inflation, positive sentiment from U.S. markets, a decline in the dollar index, investors capitalizing on recent declines, Q1 results in line with expectations, and buying in IT stocks. The latest U.S. consumer price data, released earlier on Wednesday, showed that consumer prices rose moderately in July, with the annual inflation rate slowing to below 3% for the first time since early 2021.Wall Street's main indices closed higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq rising more than 2% after July U.S. retail sales data signaled resilient consumer spending. The dollar index declined below the 103 level, making emerging market assets more attractive to foreign investors. Investors also took advantage of recent declines in the Nifty and Sensex, which fell over 2.5% in August.The just-concluded Q1 earning season was in line with street expectations, with net income for Nifty growing by 5.2%. According to Kotak Institutional Equities, ""The positive surprises came from BPCL, COAL and ONGC. The Q1FY25 EBITDA of the Nifty-50 Index grew 3.2% versus our expectation of 0.6% growth. However, earnings are less relevant in the current sentiment-laden market, with the market rewarding modest beats in certain cases (IT service, as an example) and ignoring large misses (APNT and JSTL being two prominent cases) in 1QFY25.""Indian IT stocks also surged, with the Nifty IT Index rising 1.7%, led by gains in Mphasis, LTTS, Wipro, and TCS. The positive sentiment in the U.S. market, driven by favorable economic data, benefited Indian IT companies, which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the U.S.","BSE Sensex reclaims 80,000 mark, Nifty50 too goes above 24,500.

Fastest manufacturing growth in 50 years? Apple’s India business surpasses Rs 2 lakh crore; tech giant India’s largest global value chain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fastest-manufacturing-growth-in-50-years-apples-india-business-surpasses-rs-2-lakh-crore-tech-giant-indias-largest-global-value-chain/articleshow/112513335.cms,"Apple's Growing Harvest

Apple’s India business grows in leaps! In FY24, Apple 's India operations witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching a value of over Rs 2 lakh crore ($23.5 billion), a significant increase from Rs 1.15 lakh crore in the previous year. A significant increase in iPhone production, along with strong domestic sales of MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, Watches, and AirPods, has boosted the value of Apple's operations in India.Top officials told ET that Apple's growth in production and exports in India over the last 50 years is likely the fastest and unparalleled by any other company, establishing the tech giant as the largest global value chain (GVC) operating within the country. Moreover, Apple is the first GVC in India to rapidly shift a portion of its supply chain away from China.The acceleration in Apple's operations in India can be attributed to the government's introduction of the smartphone production-linked incentive ( PLI ) scheme in 2020.In 2021, Apple began manufacturing iPhones in India, marking the first time the company produced iPhones outside of China. Since then, iPhone production in India has steadily increased through its three contract manufacturers – Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron – reaching Rs 1.20 lakh crore in FY24. The government provides incentives based on the freight on board (FOB) value at which the devices leave the factory, with market value or retail prices being 50-60% higher.The Economic Survey highlights India's contribution to Apple's overall production, which has risen to approximately 14%, positioning the country as a crucial hub for the company's global exports. In FY23, India's share was around 7%. iPhones constitute the majority of these figures, with exported iPhones valued at around Rs 1.35 lakh crore ($15 billion) in the last fiscal year, based on official data calculations.Domestic sales of Apple products in India reached approximately Rs 68,000 crore ($8 billion) in FY24. In FY23, Apple exported iPhones with a market value of Rs 66,000 crore. The company's market share in India, although steadily increasing from 2% in FY18, remains below 6% due to the dominance of the Android ecosystem, led by Chinese brands such as Vivo and Xiaomi. Additionally, India's revenue contribution to Apple's global revenue of $383 billion in FY23 was less than 2%.Also Read | Apple ecosystem becomes biggest blue-collar job creator in India! 1.5 lakh direct jobs created since PLI scheme India revenue figures of Apple do not include export numbers, but the increase in manufacturing by the Apple ecosystem has generated more than 150,000 direct jobs since 2021. The company's largest factory in India, operated by Foxconn, employs 41,000 individuals.During the third-quarter earnings call in August, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company had achieved ""quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.""Despite Apple's success, smartphone shipments in India experienced a 2% year-on-year decline in the June quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. The market tracker attributed this decline to factors such as the heatwave, a seasonal slump, and a sequential slowdown in demand compared to the previous quarter.Recognizing the significance of India in the current geopolitical landscape, Cook visited the country in April last year to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and inaugurate the first two company-owned retail stores in Delhi and Mumbai.During the earnings call in May, Cook emphasized the company's comprehensive approach to India, stating, ""the company was working on everything — from developers to markets and operations — in India. I see it as an incredibly exciting market and as a major focus for us.""","In FY24, Apple's India operations witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching a value of over Rs 2 lakh crore ($23.5 billion) A significant increase in iPhone production, along with strong domestic sales of MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, Watches, and AirPods, has boosted the value of Apple's operations in India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112514332,imgsize-127566,width-400,resizemode-4/112514332.jpg"

Check List Nomination is a crucial aspect of opening lockers and savings accounts in India. The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) says, ""Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules 1985 permits banks to pay dues to nominees in the event of death of depositor(s) without asking for succession certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. This simplifies settlement. Of course, as Trustee the nominee is accountable to legal heirs.The IBA further clarifies that the nomination facility is available for bank deposits, safe deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. A single deposit account, whether held individually or jointly, can have only one nominee. However, a jointly held locker can have two nominees. In the case of a minor's account, a person legally empowered to operate the account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.The State Bank of India emphasizes the importance of availing the benefits of nomination facility and survivorship clause for locker-hirers. In the unfortunate event of the death of one of the joint locker-hirers, the contents of the locker do not automatically transfer to the surviving joint locker-hirer or nominee(s) unless there is a survivorship clause or nomination in place.When renting a locker, the bank charges a nominal annual rent based on the size of the locker and the location of the branch. The rent should be paid in advance for the financial year. The bank provides a copy of the signed Locker Agreement to the locker-hirer, outlining their rights and responsibilities.","The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four.

Car discounts galore! Car manufacturers and dealers are offering substantial discounts, including cash discounts, exchange bonuses, and additional benefits, even on popular models, in an effort to clear a significant inventory buildup caused by slowing sales.According to trade insiders, major automakers like Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai , Tata Motors , Skoda , and Honda are all providing cash discounts, exchange bonuses, and extra benefits on their popular models.Maruti Suzuki's average discount per vehicle increased by 50% to Rs 21,700 in the first quarter ended June, compared to Rs 14,500 in the last quarter of FY24, according to an ET report.Industry executives and dealers have reported that these discounts are among the highest seen in the local market since FY20, when promotional offers were rolled out to liquidate inventory before the transition to Bharat Stage VI emission standards.The industry started the fiscal year with normal stocks of around 300,000 vehicles, sufficient to meet demand for 30 days. However, sluggish sales led to an additional 100,000 units, prompting car makers and dealers to offer promotional schemes over the last four months, with benefits this month matching those in FY20. ""The discount levels now are among the highest I have ever seen in the market,"" an industry executive said on condition of anonymity.Passenger vehicle sales in the country reached a record high of 4.23 million last fiscal, partly due to pent-up demand after a global semiconductor crisis limited production for several months.However, sales have slowed down in the new fiscal year after three years of robust growth. A senior industry executive attributed the increased discounts to fewer launches this year compared to last year, when multiple SUVs were lined up ahead of the festive season and received a good response.Automakers and dealers are relying on the upcoming festive season, starting with Onam in Kerala next month, to boost market momentum. ""Kerala will be a harbinger of what we can expect during the festive season this year,"" said the senior industry executive.""If sales take off and inventory gets liquidated, wholesales will move. Or else, dealers may be hesitant to take more stocks. So far, vehicle sales in Kerala have been faring well due to inflow of remittances and better natural rubber prices.""","Maruti Suzuki's average discount per vehicle increased by 50% to Rs 21,700 in the first quarter ended June, compared to Rs 14,500 in the last quarter of FY24.

Haryana and Kerala both recorded 4.5% inflation rates.Out of the 22 states and Union territories for which data is published, 20 of them had an inflation below 5%.This is below the Reserve Bank of India's upper tolerance band and a major relief from the inflationary pressures witnessed during past few months.Latest data released by the National Statistical Office on Monday showed retail inflation softened to a near 5-year low in July, led by a moderation in vegetables, fruits and spices, and the impact of a statistical high-base effect.Retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, slowed to a 59-month low of 3.5%, lower than the 5.1% in June and below the 7.4% recorded in July last year. Rural inflation was at 4.1%, while urban was at nearly 3%. The food price index was at 5.4%, lower than the 9.4% in June.States have been witnessing a variation in their inflation rates and also the rural-urban rates.The Economic Survey for 2023-24 has said the rural consumption basket has a much higher weightage of food items (47.3%) than the urban (29.6%). ""Hence, in the last two years, states that witnessed elevated food prices also experienced higher rural inflation. It is also found that the inter-state variation calculated through standard deviation is higher in rural than urban inflation. Besides, states with higher overall inflation also tend to exhibit a wider rural-to-urban inflation gap,"" according to the survey.Experts expect RBI to cut interest rates, but it would depend on trajectory of food prices. ""With comfort on growth in the backdrop, we continue to expect the MPC to maintain its anti-inflation posture until there is clarity on food inflation risks.

In terms of earnings growth, this is the worst first-quarter performance after the pandemic (since Q1FY21).In Q1FY25, net sales of 2,539 companies totalled Rs 22.9 lakh crore, a 5.2% increase from Rs 21.7 lakh crore in Q1FY24.Total expenditure rose by 6.4%, reaching Rs 19.6 lakh crore compared to Rs 18.5 lakh crore in the previous year. Net profit shrunk by 3.1%, with companies reporting Rs 1.9 lakh crore net profit in Q1FY25, down from Rs 1.97 lakh crore in Q1FY24, a report by Bank of Baroda 's economics department showed.The corporate scorecard excludes the performance of companies in the BFSI segment. Meanwhile, an analysis of the country's top 50 companies represented in the Nifty by Motilal Oswal shows that their profit after tax rose 4%, with the aggregate performance being dragged down by public sector oil marketing companies. Excluding the oil marketing companies, Nifty 50 posted 9% growth in earnings.In Q1FY25, India Inc experienced a slowdown in profit growth despite stable interest rates and lower input costs. This underwhelming performance can partly be attributed to an unfavourable base effect. However, the more concerning factor according to Bank of Baroda is the continued muted sales growth , which remains in single digits. Sectors like cement, iron, and steel saw sales impacted by heatwaves and general elections, while consumer durables benefited from the heat, achieving their best quarterly sales.FMCG companies reported a sequential sales pickup and are optimistic due to the satisfactory monsoon progress. The overall profit slowdown is significant, as it impacts the calculation of gross value added, leading RBI to lower its GDP forecast for Q1FY25, reflecting moderation in corporate profitability .The good news is that despite the drop in profits, the ability to pay interest (ratio of earnings before interest and tax to interest expenses) has not been affected much because borrowings are under control.""Going ahead, an unfavourable base and increased input costs will weigh on corporate profitability. However, support will come from a pickup in demand due to the festive season, moderation in inflation and a pickup in rural demand. Interest costs too are expected to decline once the RBI cuts rate,"" Bank of Baroda economist Aditi Gupta said in the report.According to the Bank of Baroda report, Of the 33 sectors, 18 saw sales growth above the 7.7% average, with 22 industries showing improved sales compared to last year, partly due to the base effect from Q1 FY24. Key sectors with strong sales included consumer durables, electricals, and retailing, driven by seasonal demand. For net profits, 20 sectors exceeded the 3.5% average growth, but only 15 surpassed last year's profit growth, including consumer durables and healthcare.","Corporate India's profits shrunk by 3.1% in the first quarter of FY25 compared to a 31% growth in the corresponding quarter last year.

Similarly, Pune-based KPIT has increased its headcount by 1,843 during the same period. Cyient and Happiest Minds have increased their workforce by 289 and 250 employees respectively.Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based IT advisory HFS Research, stated that the demand for mid-cap companies is driven by their ability to cater to small and short-term projects, as they are more flexible to clients' needs. This business approach has consequently led to an increase in their headcount.In contrast, TCS and Infosys, India's leading IT services companies, only increased their employee count during the pandemic-induced IT boom. During the 2023-24 year, TCS and Infosys experienced modest constant currency revenue growth of 3.4% and 1.5% respectively, while Wipro and Tech Mahindra saw declines of 4.4% and 4.7%. In the 2023-24 financial year, the combined headcount of TCS, Infosys and Wipro dropped by nearly 64,000.The larger companies have been emphasising internal utilisation to improve margins. TCS reported that 33% of its fulfilment is through internal resources, while Tech Mahindra increased its internal resource utilisation for vacancies from 60% in the financial year ending March 2023 to 70% in the current year. ""Mid-cap IT firms are navigating the current market dynamics with a different strategy compared to larger players,"" Aditya Mishra, MD & CEO of CIEL HR, said.","Coforge, for instance, grew 13.3% in constant currency in the 2023-24 financial year, added 1,500 employees, bringing its total employee count to 24,726.

Global QSR brands lose mojo in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/global-qsr-brands-lose-mojo-in-india/articleshow/112612644.cms,"MUMBAI: Indians seem to be falling out of love with global quick service restaurant (QSR) brands like McDonald's, Burger King and Pizza Hut, nudging companies to go aggressive on value offerings in the market.Be it the rise of new age food brands that are finding favour with venture capital (VC) investors who are backing them with funds to scale up or the growth of Zomato and Swiggy which offer consumers access to a variety of food brands at the tap of their smartphones, global QSR giants have been struggling to get customers to their stores.Westlife Foodworld, which operates McDonald's chain of outlets in West and South India, said at the company's Q1 earnings call: ""....there's obviously been pressure in terms of customers entering our restaurants"".The company launched McSavers+ in Q1 which allows customers to get a chicken burger or a snacking item of their choice (from among a range of options available) and a Coke combo meal at Rs 69.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month. There are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024. The tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112186146,imgsize-55630,width-400,resizemode-4/112186146.jpg"

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India.

Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

NEW DELHI: Officials are discussing a proposal to increase the foreign direct investment ( FDI ) limit for insurance to 100%, from current 74%, a move which has the backing of the regulator , but will need political clearance since it involves an amendment to Insurance Act.Besides, other proposals to ease FDI rules for the sector , such as the mandate to have Indians in certain segments of the top management, are also being reviewed, officials privy to the talks told TOI.Apart from FDI, a comprehensive set of amendments to the law are also proposed although the bill timing is yet to be decided. The department for promotion of industry and internal trade, too, is undertaking a review of sectoral norms and rules to ensure that investments come unbridled. Insurance is among one of the consumer-facing sectors that remains only partially open to FDI, while other sectors have all moved on.Given that most large Indian companies and conglomerates have already invested in the insurance sector, officials said, it is time to allow 100% FDI in the sector since several foreign players with deep pockets are willing to come into the country but are not able to find a matching domestic player. A 100% limit will be especially beneficial for the long-gestation life insurance business where the promoter needs to keep capitalising the company to meet the solvency norms prescribed by the regulator. As a result, only promoters with deep pockets can enter space as it requires a constant flow of funds till the company starts generating profits.""It is almost 25 years since the sector was opened up and despite an increase in the limit, we still have strong Indian players in the business. There does not appear to be any threat especially when there are detailed guidelines and the regulator keeps a close watch on all the players,"" a second source said. There are several checks and balances on overseas investments and repatriation apart from the capitalisation norms which act as a safety valve, sources said.A senior finance ministry official said that amendments to the law are being discussed with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) and they would be finalised soon.Given that BJP's strength in Lok Sabha is below the majority mark, the political leadership will have the final say on the issue, although NDA partners may not have a problem with the plan.","Officials are discussing a proposal to increase the foreign direct investment ( FDI ) limit for insurance to 100%, from current 74%.

Where was it first discovered

What is the global threat

First case in Sweden

What does emergency declaration signify

How is current outbreak different from 2022 epidemic

What's happening in Africa

How can it be stopped?

(With input from agencies)

The World Health Organisation WHO ) announced on Wednesday that the escalating transmission of mpox in Africa constitutes a global health emergency, warning that the virus could potentially spread across international borders.The declaration was made by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus following a convening of the UN health agency's emergency committee. This announcement comes just a day after the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classified mpox as a public health emergency on the continent.Scientists first discovered mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, in 1958 when they observed outbreaks of a ""pox-like"" disease among monkeys.Prior to recent events, the majority of human cases occurred in central and West Africa, primarily affecting individuals who had close contact with infected animals.In 2022, the virus was confirmed to spread via sex for the first time and triggered outbreaks in more than 70 countries across the world that had not previously reported mpox.Mpox is a member of the same viral family as smallpox, but it typically causes less severe symptoms, including fever, chills, and body aches. In more serious cases, individuals may develop lesions on various parts of the body, such as the face, hands, chest, and genitals.WHO announced that mpox, a viral disease, has been detected in four East African nations for the first time: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, AP reported,According to the organization, these outbreaks were connected to the ongoing epidemic in Congo. The WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern about the potential for the disease to spread further within Africa and to other regions.In a separate development, health authorities in the Ivory Coast and South Africa have reported outbreaks of a different strain of mpox, which is considered less severe than the one that caused a global outbreak in 2022, infecting nearly 100,000 people worldwide.The novel mpox variant discovered in Congo has the potential to spread internationally, as is the case with other contagious diseases. Instances of this variant have already been reported in four additional East African nations.Authorities assessed the risk to the general population as ""very low"" and anticipated occasional imported cases to persist.In contrast to Covid-19 or measles, mpox is not transmitted through the air and usually requires close, skin-to-skin contact for transmission.Sweden has confirmed its first case of mpox, a viral infection that spreads through close contact. This follows the World Health Organization's declaration of mpox as a global public health emergency after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to other countries.Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed announced the confirmation on Thursday afternoon. The development marks Sweden's first encounter with the more severe type of mpox identified as Clade I.WHO’s announcement of an emergency is intended to galvanize support from nations and philanthropic organizations. However, past declarations have yielded inconsistent global responses.Africa CDC Director General Dr. Jean Kaseya stated that the agency's proclamation of a public health emergency aimed ""to mobilize our institutions, our collective will and our resources to act swiftly and decisively.""He called upon Africa's global allies for assistance, asserting that the worsening situation in Africa had been largely disregarded.During the global outbreak of mpox in 2022, gay and bisexual men made up the vast majority of cases and the virus was mostly spread through close contact, including sex, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group in collaboration with AP reported.In 2022, the worldwide mpox outbreak primarily affected gay and bisexual men, with the virus mainly transmitted through close contact, including sexual activity.However, the situation in Africa, particularly in Congo, presents a different picture. Children under the age of 15 constitute over 70% of mpox cases and account for 85% of fatalities in the country.Save the Children's Congo director, Greg Ramm, expressed concern about the potential spread of mpox in overcrowded refugee camps ""crammed into tents in unsanitary conditions."" He said the country's health system was already ""collapsing"" under the strain of malnutrition, measles and cholera.According to WHO, Africa has reported over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths attributed to mpox this year, surpassing the figures from the previous year.So far Congo accounts for more than 96% of all reported cases and deaths. Researchers are alarmed by the emergence of a new variant of the disease in Congo that may exhibit increased transmissibility among individuals.The Africa CDC has reported a significant increase in mpox cases across the continent. Compared to the same period in the previous year, the number of cases has risen by 160%, and fatalities have climbed by 19%. This year scientists reported the emergence of a new form of mpox in a Congolese mining town that can kill up to 10 per cent of people, AP reported.The mpox outbreak of 2022, which affected numerous nations, was primarily contained in wealthy countries through the utilization of vaccines and treatments, as well as encouraging individuals to avoid high-risk behaviors. However, these resources have been scarcely accessible in Africa.According to Marks from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, vaccination, including immunization against smallpox, a related virus, would likely be beneficial. ""We need a large supply of vaccine so that we can vaccinate populations most at risk,"" he said, specifying that this would encompass sex workers, as well as children and adults residing in outbreak-affected areas, as per AP reports.The Congolese government has requested 4 million doses, primarily for young children, but Cris Kacita Osako, the coordinator of Congo's Monkeypox Response Committee, stated that no doses have been received so far.","Sweden has confirmed its first case of mpox, a viral infection that spreads through close contact.

Some outsider politicians are trying to foment trouble in Bengal. This is a BJP-Left collusion... A DCP who was trying to protect people had gone missing for several minutes till he was found unconscious. Police were attacked, and yet they had shown extreme patience.

Luckily her cries for help reached colleagues in adjacent rooms and they quickly gathered after which the assaulter tried to run away but was eventually nabbed. The dazed young woman, who suffered bruises, was taken to hospital and is now back in India where she is being counselled, said an official.Confirming the same, an AI spokesperson said: “We are deeply anguished by an unlawful incident of intrusion at a hotel, operated by a major international chain, that affected one of our crew members.We are providing all possible support to our colleague and their broader team, including professional counselling. Air India is also working with the local police to pursue the matter to the fullest extent of the law, and with the hotel management to ensure such incidents are not repeated.”The airline added that it “accords foremost priority to the safety, security and wellbeing of our crew and staff members” and requested “the privacy of those involved is respected.”The incident happened post shortly after midnight at Radisson Hotel London Heathrow. That night crew member of multiple AI flights were at the property. “The crew member was sleeping when an intruder attacked her in her room around 1.30 am. Startled, she woke up and screamed for help. He attacked her with a clothes hanger and dragged her on the floor as she tried to escape towards the door,” said sources.Her colleagues immediately came to her rescue. “She was badly bruised and the intruder tried to escape. The police were called in and she was taken to a hospital. She could not fly back on duty and a friend from the crew stayed back with her,” sources add.The police are probing the attack. “The intruder was arrested. He might have been a homeless person who walked into the hotel and managed to enter the room. The lack of security in the hotel is shocking. Luckily the crew member’s friends came to her rescue quickly and save her just in time,” sources say.AI pilots stay in Central London and the cabin crew in hotels near Heathrow . This alleged attack took place just a day after an 11-year-old Australian girl was stabbed eight times while visiting Leicester Square as a tourist with her mother.“The law and order situation in some parts of Britain, including London, as of now requires everyone there to be alert. We avoid going out alone after late evening these days in London. Only hotels with foolproof security systems must be selected for stay of crew members, especially when those properties are not in central but outer London,” said multiple pilots who have been operating flights to London. Heathrow is in Zone 6 as per London tube map, with Zone 1 being Central London.","An Air India air hostess was assaulted by an intruder in her London hotel room earlier this week.

These terms will now be presented to the UN General Assembly in late November or early December, for final approval.A key term of reference which India and several countries wanted on board was addressing tax-related illicit financial flows , tax avoidance , tax evasion and harmful tax practices. Other points of reference are a fair allocation of taxing rights, including equitable taxation of multinational enterprises – which tax experts and government officials view would be favourable to India; addressing tax evasion and avoidance by high-net worth individuals and ensuring their effective taxation in relevant countries; effective mutual administrative assistance in tax matters, including with respect to transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes; and effective prevention and resolution of tax disputes.USA, UK, Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Republic of Korea were the eight countries that voted against adopting the Terms of Reference. 44 countries which include Switzerland and primarily various EU countries abstained from voting. The 110 votes in favour are seen as a thumping majority and a clear shift in international tax policy making from the OECD (whose 38 members are dominated by rich nations) to a more broad based and equitable platform of the UN.The Tax Justice Network, a think-tank, has welcomed this development. It had earlier pointed out that OECD-member countries with their territorial dependencies, are estimated to be responsible for nearly 78% of the $ 480 billion in tax losses suffered by countries across the globe. It had added that the world would lose nearly $ 5 trillion to tax havens over the next decade unless the UN tax convention was adopted.","India was among the 110 countries that voted, on Friday, in favour of adopting the ‘ Terms of Reference ‘ for a United Nations (UN) Framework on international tax co-operation.
