New Tax Regime: What else can be done?

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024 : The Modi government has been looking to make the new income tax regime more attractive for the common man, middle class and salaried income taxpayers. Raising of basic exemption limit , introduction of standard deduction , and tweaking of tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime signal that the government wants taxpayers to shift to the new regime.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024 and personal tax experts are of the opinion that some changes in the new income tax regime can be expected.What can be done to make the new income tax regime more attractive than the old tax regime, especially for individuals who have done their tax planning based on the old regime? TOI Online Survey of personal tax experts finds out:Also Check | Budget 2024 Live Updates All personal tax experts unanimously agree that to make the new income tax more attractive for taxpayers, especially for middle class salaried taxpayers , the government needs to tweak it to introduce more deductions and exemptions.One common deduction that experts believe should make way into the new income tax regime, and one that makes the old tax regime more lucrative for taxpayers, is housing loan deduction.Preeti Sharma, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India LLP says that currently under the new tax regime, exemption against interest paid on home loan taken for a self-occupied or vacant property is not available. “This provision may be relooked at and be allowed under the new tax regime,” she tells TOI.Agrees Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, saying, “the deduction for interest on housing loan may be introduced to make it (new tax regime) better for those who still chose the old tax regime.”Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings Yet another recommendation is to increase the basic exemption limit and standard deduction under the new regime.“Increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 to 5 lakhs, raise the standard deduction to Rs 100,000,” Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners says that the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime may be further raised by at least Rs 50,000, which will benefit all individual taxpayers (salaried or non-salaried) opting for the new income tax regime. This will help increase purchasing power of the taxpayers which may further boost the investments.Aarti Raote, Partner, Deloitte India says raising the basic exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh and introducing the 30% tax rate to the income category of Rs 20 lakh & above as against the existing limit of Rs 15 lakh will give tax relief to all. She also believes that the standard deduction should be increased to Rs 1 lakh from the existing Rs 50,000 limit.Aarti Raote is of the view that to make the new regime more attractive the government should consider allowing deductions for employee contributions to the NPS within the new tax regime framework.Vialto’s Chander Talreja notes that the employer’s contribution to the NPS is allowed as a deduction under the new income tax regime. “For the non-salaried individuals, while this deduction is not applicable, they do not even get any deduction for their own contribution. This is a hardship and the government may consider introducing deduction in respect of an individual's contribution to NPS under section 80CCD(1B), currently capped at Rs 50,000. This will benefit salaried as well as non-salaried individuals,” he tells TOI.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Raise basic exemption limit, standard deduction and NPS benefits for taxpayers Preeti Sharma believes that in order to promote savings towards retirement, the government may consider allowing deductions available under section 80C of the Act, under the new tax regime as well.Aarti Raote says that in line with the government’s agenda of affordable housing and green energy, it is anticipated that specific deductions towards mortgage repayments on affordable housing or electric vehicles be provided under the new tax regime besides incentivizing taxpayers for installation or adoption of solar energy equipment.However, Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors notes that the government has already rationalized the slabs and the rates in its Budget 2023. “I am not expecting that something more would be done except discontinuing the old tax regime whereby by default everyone is in the new regime,” he tells TOI.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024.

Budget 2024: Big Relief To Indian Taxpayers | Changes In New Regime Slabs | Nirmala Sitharaman

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure, despite the indexation benefit being withdrawn for property, and asserted that govt decided on the new structure after undertaking an elaborate exercise.“This perception that you will be at a disadvantage is not realistic, it’s absolutely not correct… In almost every case people have a lower tax burden under this system.The small or the medium people who are going into the market or property investments are going to benefit from it,” she told TOI in an interview.On Tuesday, she had announced a reduction in long term capital gains tax on property and gold from 20% to 12.5%, while withdrawing the benefit to adjust it for inflation. This came with the provision that indexation benefit will be available for properties bought up to 2001.The FM said the amendments have been proposed with the intent to simplify the tax regime and bring all asset classes at par.Sitharaman said the Union Budget presented on Tuesday was a continuation of the interim budget and insisted that the measures announced for Andhra Pradesh were part of the commitments given at the time of bifurcation of the state . “In Bihar’s case can anyone deny the devastation that happens because of Kosi flooding?” she said.She also said that the skilling plan through internship was voluntary for companies and she had received suggestions for such a scheme from various industry bodies. “We're not forcing anybody, we've had a lot of discussion with CII and Ficci and they thought it is possible to do it. It will actually help because they will have industry-ready people, who can be employed.”She hit out at the Opposition, saying, “This brazen method of building a false narrative, repeating it and restating it with the hope that it will stick has been tried in the Lok Sabha elections. They are trying it even now.”Along with the calculations released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes under different scenarios, tax authorities said, “Nominal real estate returns are generally in the region of 12-16% per annum, much higher than inflation. The indexation for inflation in in the region of 4-5%, depending on the period of holding. Therefore, substantial tax savings are expected for a vast majority of taxpayers.”The statement further said that the new regime is beneficial for five-year old properties under the new regime which have seen an appreciation of 1.7 times or more. Similarly, for 10 years, if the value rises 2.4 times the new mechanism is seen to be beneficial. Ditto for property purchased in 2009-10 with appreciation of 4.9 times or more, the tax department said.“It's only where returns are low (less than about 9-11% per annum) that the earlier tax rate is beneficial, but such low returns in real estate are unrealistic and rare (less than 10% of cases),” it said.Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra told TOI that benefits of reinvesting the capital gains in a new property and parking the funds in tax-exempt 54EC bonds issued by REC are intact.Asked about the revenue impact, he said that the Centre may end up losing revenue as most taxpayers are likely to gain from the decision.“Simplification of any tax structure has benefits of ease of compliance, including computation filing, maintenance of records. This also removes the differential rates for various asset classes,” CBDT said.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure.

This decision was made in light of recent developments, including last year's crisis at Silicon Valley Bank, when deposits were withdrawn within hours of the bank showing signs of stress.RBI's new guidelines on liquidity coverage ratio require that banks assign a higher 'run-off factor' to retail deposits that can be accessed via the internet and mobile banking.This means that stable retail deposits with these facilities will now have a 10% run-off factor, and less stable ones will have a 15% run-off factor. A run-off factor is essentially the percentage of deposits that are expected to be withdrawn in a stress scenario. LCR norms are aimed at ensuring that banks have enough liquid assets to meet their short-term obligations during a financial crisis. The high-quality liquid assets include bonds that can be easily converted to cash at little or no cost.

Laptop market size to double in 5 years: HP India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/laptop-market-size-to-double-in-5-years-hp-india/articleshow/112027010.cms,"There was a lull in computer sales after Covid boom. Is the demand back?

Govt had pushed laptop makers to Make in India and restricted imports and had announced an import management system to monitor progress. Was this knee-jerk?

You manufacture laptops in India in partnership with Flex. There are reports that you are looking at local suppliers like Dixon and VVDN to deepen manufacturing here?

In smartphones, almost all devices are being made in India. In laptops, nearly 75% are coming from China. Will this ever change?

Are there any policy or regulatory disabilities in India?

Ipsita Dasgupta took charge of HP's India operations (around 10 months back from Apple) at a time when the Covid-induced boom had just started to wane and demand appeared to be tapering down. She says demand is now building back and numbers are going up. She is also excited about the company's plans to Make in India .Unfazed by the controversy over govt's sudden diktat to laptop makers last year to restrict imports from countries like China (the decision was rescinded later), Dasgupta, MD, HP India , tells TOI in an interview that India is a natural contender for being a manufacturing powerhouse and PLI scheme has only sweetened the deal.Excerpts:Now, we are seeing market starting to grow. Also, if you take pre-Covid (numbers) and post-Covid, the market has grown by 50%. As far as the surge during Covid was concerned, it was a very unique situation. Overall, we expect the market size to double over next five years.Govt had to start somewhere. The PLI scheme has been a great enabler. We are participating in it because it creates a bridge for development of the sector from a manufacturing perspective. We are quite bullish that the ecosystem will develop over next few years and that too pretty quickly. In the intervening period, PLI is a solid programme. The starting point has been a very measured and a strong initiative.We started with Flex in August 2020 as we began making laptops here... We are going to further expand manufacturing. We are always assessing possible partnerships and possible relationships.The fact is we will increase manufacturing in India. This is our intention. We are excited about doing it. I can't get into targets and numbers. But absolutely, the industry is moving forward and govt is encouraging it in all the right ways.Not really. Level of interest and support that we see from govt needs to be sustained. That will be really important.

'Banks to follow home loan growth story for MSMEs',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-to-follow-home-loan-growth-story-for-msmes/articleshow/112026989.cms,"NEW DELHI: Banks will be asked to tap into the "" digital footprint "" of small businesses , including salary payments, electricity bills and municipal taxes paid by them, along with GST and provident fund details, to decide on loans given to them as govt seeks to replicate the home loan model to boost lending to this segment, which has remained in loan shadow zone, financial services secretary Vivek Joshi told TOI.""Often the bank manager knows that a small businessman is doing good business, but the rules bind him from giving a loan. The new mechanism will help provide funding. The bank accounts by themselves can provide so much information on a borrower,"" he said during a post Budget interaction.Currently, banks insist on balance sheets, income tax returns and other documents before deciding on whether to lend or not. But with data it is possible to appraise businesses even during their initial stages of operation for which FM Nirmala Sitharaman announced a new credit rating mechanism in the Budget. Joshi said banks will develop the framework on their own, but some broad parameters may be discussed by the Indian Banks' Association.RBI's ""frictionless credit"" is a step in the same direction, relying on digitised land records, MSME registration on govt portal, or even sale of milk to cooperatives such as Amul, to offer loans in 10-15 minutes.The high-ranking bureaucrat said the state-run entities have been asked to study the friction points to improve customer service. ""We often see young people banking with private banks, probably because they offer better services. There is a lot more that can be done by the public sector banks although they have been trying to improve their service levels,"" he said.Joshi also said that banks must be more efficient in mopping up low-cost current account and savings bank account (CASA) deposits, where state-run players are lagging. At the end of March, the share of CASA had dropped to 41%, as against 44-45% a few years ago, although it is not seen to be low.Asked about the plan to privatise two state-run banks, which was announced in 2021, he said the bank nationalisation law will require amendments, which is being considered by govt. He emphatically rejected any fresh move for merger of PSBs, saying it was ""pure speculation"".The finance ministry has, however, sought a waiver for five public sector banks - Bank of Maharashtra (86% govt stake), Central Bank of India (93%), Indian Overseas Bank (96%), Punjab & Sind Bank (98%) and Uco Bank (95%) - from the minimum public float requirement of 25%. GIC Re and LIC would also require some more time to meet the norms. Typically, the exemption is given by Sebi for two years.Besides, the financial services secretary said that govt will watch the performance of state-run general insurance players - Oriental, National and United India - before offering more funds for recapitalisation. Having been asked to focus on profitable business, Oriental Insurance turned profitable last year, while National narrowed its loss to Rs 187 crore and United India reported losses of Rs 800 crore.

Budget 2024 highlights infrastructural surge and transformative vision for Eastern states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-highlights-infrastructural-surge-and-transformative-vision-for-eastern-states/articleshow/112006144.cms,"By Neetu Vinayak

(The author is Partner – Infrastructure, EY India)

Budget 2024 : India's Economic Survey for 2024 revealed the country's infrastructure leap. FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20 with concerted efforts to boost physical connectivity, electricity, water and sanitation, urban development, strategic and digital infrastructure. It also marked emphasis on resource mobilisation from new sources and data aggregation and management for tracking projects and optimal allocation of scarce resources.While capital allocation for major infrastructure sub-sectors like roads, railways, etc. continues as already announced by the government during the interim Budget, the current final Budget heralds a transformative vision for the eastern states with the ‘Purvodaya’ plan, targeting holistic growth with announcements of new roads, power plant, airports, colleges and sports infrastructure.For the shipping sector, the government has announced ownership, leasing and flagging reforms which should improve the share of the Indian shipping industry and generate more employment.Capital projects in the sector uplifts the society at large and generates employment. Brownfield redevelopment of cities and houses for the poor will fuel demand in the sector thereby generating employment and economic growth. Additionally, the government has announced an employment incentive scheme for first time employers to further fillip jobs creation and youth empowerment.From a tax standpoint, the government recognised the potential of cruise tourism in India and in order to give a fillip to this employment generating industry, a simplified tax regime where 20 percent of revenues will be deemed as income from such business will be considered for the purpose of income-tax.India has recognised the need to have a robust MRO ecosystem for the airline and boat & ship sector in view of increased demand. From Customs perspective, the period for export of goods which are imported for repairs and requirement to re-import goods which are exported for repairs under warranty has been extended.The government recognises the need for participation from the private sector in this critical sector including investments from foreign investors. Deletion of angel tax provision is a welcome move which will propel raising of funds in the sector.Second round of VSV gives opportunity to minimise litigation with focus on ease of doing business.On an overall basis, this year’s Budget lays down a framework to propel growth and generate employment with higher involvement of the private sector in upskilling India and some relaxation for individual taxpayers."," FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20.

Finance ministry plugs under-reporting of income by overseas taxpayers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/finance-ministry-plugs-under-reporting-of-income-by-overseas-taxpayers/articleshow/111997579.cms,"MUMBAI: The finance ministry was quick to notice that some taxpayers were not including taxes withheld outside India for the purpose of calculating their total income. This, in turn, led to under reporting of income. These individuals offered the overseas income net of tax and at the same time claimed a foreign tax credit (FTC) for taxes withheld overseas against their India tax liability.In short - they got a double advantage.The Budget proposes to amend section 198 of the I-T Act to include income taxes paid outside India for the purpose of computing the income of the taxpayer who is liable to tax in India. This proposal will be effective financial year 2024-25.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said, ""The amendment is more clarificatory in nature. This was always the correct position. As explained in the explanatory memorandum. It appears that some taxpayers (including companies) were not doing so and hence this amendment was introduced making it abundantly clear.""She gives an illustration. An Indian employee of an Indian subsidiary of a German company was granted shares under the global Esop plan. He was eligible to receive dividend of 100 euros on such shares. According to German law, 10 euros was withheld and the balance was transferred to the employee's Indian bank account.""The correct tax position was always to offer the entire 100 euros as income and claim 10 euros as a double tax relief (credit against Indian tax liability on such 100 euros),"" KPMG India's Sirwalla added.Ameya Kunte, founder, Globeview Advisors, points out a few decisions where overseas tax was not held part of the total income assessable to tax in India - these now stand overturned.""The MP high court in the case of Yawar Rashid had held that the tax deducted at source outside India from foreign dividends and interest income was not part of the total income and thus not assessable in the hands of the taxpayer. This HC decision was also relied upon by the Bangalore bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in the case of Sunil Shinde. The proposed amendment makes it clear tax deducted at source outside India, will be part of income. The taxpayer can claim a foreign tax credit against the Indian taxes due on the overseas income.""",The Budget proposes to amend section 198 of the I-T Act to include income taxes paid outside India for the purpose of computing the income of the taxpayer who is liable to tax in India.

The opposition offensive against the Budget seeks to paint the governing party as beholden to its demanding allies TDP and JDU from Andhra and Bihar at the cost of others. The tactic clearly seeks to put BJP on the defensive on major turfs where it will be fighting elections soon - Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, or in states where BJP is seeking expansion of its political footprint, like TN, Kerala, Telangana.Rahul Gandhi Wednesday briefed 20 party MPs chosen to participate in the LS discussion. Sources said Rahul specifically told the members to focus on what their respective states have not got in the Budget, rather than speaking about what others have got. The party decided to accommodate maximum states through MPs in its allocated four hours discussion time. The choice of Haryana veteran Kumari Selja as the lead speaker and then Praniti Shinde of Maharashtra was to showcase the election states. Also, the focus of opposition's criticism is on unemployment, farmers, price rise - issues which are politically sensitive, as also how govt has ""picked"" various announcements from Congress election manifesto.The aggression against ""discrimination"" is going to be incessant during the ongoing Parliament session.

Budget's big job: Get back BJP's lost votes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budgets-big-job-get-back-bjps-lost-votes/articleshow/111973325.cms,"The best clue to the politics of this Budget ? The acronym emblazoned on the backdrop of Nirmala Sitharaman 's post-Budget presser. First letters of ten different 'priorities' made up that acronym - EMPLOYMENT.Fresh from an where BJP lost its single party majority in part because many voters were unhappy with the lack of decent paying jobs , FM wrote that political lesson into her Budget, via a raft of incentives for industry, both big and small, to employ more people.In a country where the young are the largest population cohort, disaffected young people are a political handicap. More so, when millions of them are college-educated and therefore relatively immune to the promise of welfare schemes. So, Sitharaman put their concerns front and centre, to win back votes that in 2014 and 2019 had played a pivotal role in giving BJP impressive majorities.What will be interesting is how the Budget's unconventional approach to job creation pans out, both in terms of actual jobs created and politically. FM has bet on incentives for private sector employers. If companies respond - and that's a definite 'if' - there will be job creation in the formal sector.There's a rider here. What happens if companies don't respond to the nudges GOI has given on taking on more people? Will the nudge become something stronger?The key question is 'how many jobs'. Because politically, for the Budget to make an appreciable difference to the perception that Modi govt ignored unemployment, a substantial number of new, steady jobs will have to be offered by the private sector. This question is even sharper politically when it comes to the internship programme. After one year, will the new interns get jobs? Or will they be unemployed young people with job experience? If most interns end up in the latter category, BJP's political difficulty over the jobs question may not lessen dramatically.This will be true even if BJP's own argument - that it didn't get enough credit for creating an enabling environment for creating jobs in sectors like the gig economy - remains valid.The Budget takes forward previous attempts on skilling by announcing new schemes. GOI's skilling programmes have had a patchy record so far. If this Budget changes that, many young voters will have a better shot at earning a decent livelihood. That has an obvious positive political impact.The catch, of course, is whether this Budget will do this job more skilfully than previous ones.There's a clear political plan in the Budget's MSME approach, too. First, because labour-intensive MSMEs, now helped by a friendlier credit regime, are reliable job-creators. Second, because MSME promoters contain a large subset of small businessmen generally thought to be sympathetic to BJP.Ally management was always going to be a priority for a coalition govt's budget. On this, Sitharaman's politics is better than that of many other coalition govt FMs. Instead of giving big bags of money to Nitish and Naidu, the budget allocates capex for specific projects, ensuring the help to allies is in tune with the larger focus of building infra, and also trying to ensure that whatever's allocated is spent better. Roads, bridges in Bihar and big irrigation projects in Andhra can deliver both politically and economically. Plus, it's also fiscally prudent.To that extent, therefore, Congress's charge that this was a 'save the govt"" scheme needs to be qualified.Women, who are voting in larger numbers in every successive election, are another big political constituency. The Budget allocates Rs 3 lakh crore for schemes for women and girls. These are likely to be implemented through self-help groups. These schemes aim to double down on the success of both labharti and lakhpati didi initiatives. 2024 elections showed that women vote can act as a counter in regions where other voter groups are dissatisfied with BJP.The investing classes won't be too happy about the Budget, what with capital gains tax burden going up.

'New capital gains regime brings value',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-capital-gains-regime-brings-value/articleshow/112026076.cms,"How confident are you of meeting this year's target and what would be the strategy?

This Budget focuses on simplification. What is the message?

The tax department issued several use cases and they suggested that you save more tax as the value of property goes up.

Can you have two regimes for capital gains, like the old and new tax regime?

Is there a possibility of a review of the capital gains tax issue, given the noise around it?

Are there plans to end the old tax regime?

Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman Ravi Agrawal has virtually ruled out a review, saying tax authorities are convinced that the changes in long-term capital gains tax , including withdrawal of indexation, will benefit most taxpayers. In an interview, he also tells TOI that govt is expecting more returns to be filed this year. Excerpts:Our target is Rs 22 lakh crore, against last year's collection of Rs 19.5 lakh crore.So far, the growth is 21% and return filing season is on. Based on present trends, I am confident of achieving the target. Last year, we received 8.5 crore tax returns, which is a good number, and we will cross that. As on date, 4.6 crore returns have been filed, with 28 lakh received on Wednesday. We expect to do better than the 6.7 crore returns that were filed till July 31, 2023.We are using technology, strengthening the tax deducted at source (TDS) because you can make the transaction details available to the taxpayer. Similarly, third party reporting information is also coming and it has reasonably matured. This also gets populated into the annual information statement and with the data available to the taxpayer, he can do the tax planning and comply with the law. It is natural human tendency to be law abiding. If you assist people with data and information, then to that extent, compliance gets triggered. The e-verification scheme has also resulted in better compliance.There is simplification both in terms of processes and also on part of the taxpayer. The new tax regime is a simplification because the taxpayer is not confined to prescriptive avenues for investment. The Budget has proposed changes to reopening of cases and also in search cases, where there will not be different proceedings and notices for each year. Rationalisation of TDS rates will help provide liquidity. The facility allowing credit for TCS payments in TDS is a major change for individuals, including those with foreign remittances. And of course, the much talked about capital gains changes are also a simplification exercise.If you analyse the trends - the way the property and asset rates have gone up - in the new regime, the tax obligation will be lower. Although capital gains, as such, may appear to be higher, but because of the lower tax rate, the obligation to pay tax will be lower. People are only looking at (withdrawal of) indexation , without looking at the rate coming down from 20% to 12.5%. The index itself was conservative - there was only 3.5 times increase in index from 2001 to 2024. Look at how property rates have increased (in this period).Besides, if there is rollover and you purchase a new property (using the sale proceeds), there is no capital gains tax. You can also invest in the bonds.The intent was to reflect what is the minimum escalation in the value that would make the new regime beneficial. As the sale consideration goes up, the multiples go up, then the incidence of the tax, the benefit that you derive, that would also go up. In the context of shares, the capital gains exemption limit has been raised to Rs 1.25 lakh. If there is a gain of three times in a year on Rs 1 lakh investment, the new regime is better. Beyond three times, you might as well pay more tax.Having two regimes may create more confusion. Ultimately, we are going for simplification.I don't think so. It is before Parliament. We are reasonably convinced that this brings value to the taxpayer and there should not be any occasion for withdrawal. Going forward, this tax regime is better. The indexation benefit may be 10% in two years, but the tax reduction is 7.5 percentage points. If you sell the property after two years, the tax liability will be lower. Even for old property, this is true.If you look at gold in 2001, it was Rs 4,400-4,500 per 10 grams, at Rs 75,000-76,000 (today) it has gone up by 17 times. If it is above 7.5 times, the new regime is better.Let us see the response from the people. It is encouraging that two-thirds of the individuals have already come in. In the context of corporates also, 58% of the income that has been declared is under the new regime. So, at a certain period of time, if one finds that a substantial number of people have opted for this and they are convinced about the new regime. We will take a call appropriately.","CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal says tax authorities are convinced that the changes in long-term capital gains tax will benefit most taxpayers.

International Business Machines Corp reported a jump in bookings for its artificial intelligence business as customers work to implement the latest technology.

Ford Motor Co posted second-quarter profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates, saying quality problems with new vehicles led to a surge in warranty costs.

Bank of America Corp said its board authorized another $25 billion stock repurchase program.

Whirlpool Corp, the owner of Maytag, lowered its full-year earnings forecast, as consumers continued to shy away from big-ticket appliance purchases amid a weakening housing market.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc’s limited-time offers and speedy service helped it beat expectations in the second quarter, but executives warned the burrito chain will face pressures to profitability.

ServiceNow Inc. reported better-than-expected sales and bookings in the second quarter, signaling strong customer demand for its broad suite of software tools.

Wall Street got a reality check after a disappointing start of the megacap earnings season fueled concern the artificial-intelligence frenzy that has powered the bull market might be overblown.A selloff in big tech sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since December 2022, ending the best stretch without a 2% drop since the start of the global financial crisis.Losses were more pronounced in the Nasdaq 100, which tumbled over 3.5%. Alphabet Inc. slid 5% after sinking more resources into its drive to outmatch rivals in AI, with spending higher than analysts expected. Tesla Inc.’s profit miss and the Robotaxi delay spurred a 12% stock plunge.“Investors are finally waking up to all that AI spend and realizing it is much more of an expense right now rather than a revenue generator,” said Peter Boockvar at The Boock Report.Wednesday’s session was another lesson in the “concentration risk” bears see as latent in a market whose upside has owed disproportionately to a narrow cohort of massive gainers. For a fourth straight session — and the 10th time in 11 days — the performance of smaller companies exceeded larger ones, evidence investor tastes have shifted from the megacap tech names that have come to dominate benchmark indexes.The Treasury curve steepened on bets the Federal Reserve is close to cutting rates. Former New York Fed President William Dudley called for lower borrowing costs — preferably at next week’s gathering. For many analysts, such a move would be worrisome as it would indicate officials rushing to avoid a recession.The loonie fell as the Bank of Canada cut rates, focused on “downside risks.” The yen hit the highest since May amid an unwind in carry trades.To Steve Clayton at Hargreaves Lansdown, this could be the year markets start talking about the “So-So Seven,” noting that results from Tesla and Alphabet are not enough to maintain their momentum.“The market is not impressed with the start of earnings season for the mega tech stocks,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. “There was a lot resting on these results and we don’t think that they give clear answers to questions about the effectiveness and profit potential for AI right now.”After driving the rally in stocks for most of 2024, big tech slammed into a wall. Traders rotated from megacaps to lagging parts of the market, spurred by bets on Fed rate cuts and concern AI still needs to pay off.“Tech’s problem isn’t just that earnings are less than perfect, but the group is still caught up in the violent rotation trade that kicked off with the June CPI,” said Vital Knowledge’s Adam Crisafulli. “Many assumed the anti-tech rotation would be ephemeral and the fact it’s proving durable is compounding anxiety toward the group and spurring additional selling pressure.”The drubbing in these stocks has seen some of the air come out of valuations. While that’s something that could argue in favor of dip buying, the earnings season is just getting started. Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Meta Platforms Inc are all due toTo Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers, the equity correction is far from over. “Yesterday we wrote that a 10% to 15% correction was in the cards this quarter, historically the worst period of the year,” Torres said. “This quarter, the valuation concerns are paired with front-loaded gains, irrational exuberance, a high bar for earnings estimates and a presidential election.”In fact, the second-quarter US earnings season is off to a weaker start than usual.Among S&P 500 companies that reported results, profits beat analyst estimates by the smallest margin since the end of 2022 — while sales surprises were the worst in at least two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“We are still looking for volatility to increase moving through the second half of 2024 - with the potential for a 10% to 15% correction in benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100,” said Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “Our work does not point to secular/structural downturn at this time, but rather a pause in the reflationary expansion cycle that began a few years ago.”Just as earnings roll in, a key technical indicator in the US stock market sat close to historic extremes — a crucial gauge that has foretold past selloffs.Known as the “the 200-DMA” — an abbreviation of 200-day moving average — the gauge measures how the S&P 500 is performing against that longer-term measure. At one point last week, the benchmark was trading as much as 15% above it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.While the gap has since narrowed — to 9% through Wednesday’s close — that kind of gulf above 12% still preceded declines for the index in 2011, 2018 and 2021. Although that does not necessarily mean the market is about to tank, it is a warning sign for investors concerned about lofty tech valuations and concentration risk.","A selloff in big tech sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since December 2022.

Stock traders in Asia are ramping up the Trump trade in preparation for a potential second term for the former US president, which will likely create winners and losers in the region.Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia from agriculture and farm equipment to textiles and weapons production.Asian companies’ momentum in the global race for electric vehicles and chips could slow should a Trump administration follow through on his pledges.China is seen as a clear loser given Trump’s call for higher tariffs and confrontational rhetoric against the world’s second largest economy. Taiwan and South Korea, which are heavily reliant on export revenues from semiconductor and other tech sectors, are also staring at an outlook downturn, market watchers say.India is deemed as a potential beneficiary should the former US president’s polling hold up and lead to his win in November. Southeast Asian economies, whose fortunes aren’t closely tied to exports, may be able to deflect much of the fallout from a change in the White House, investors say.Here is what market watchers are saying“India stands out as an economy that is relatively shielded from these shocks as the country has only a small share of global goods markets and is less exposed to China-related risks.”“It looks like India has a much better relationship with the US than China. At least from India’s side, the impact of Trump was not as bad as it was for many other emerging markets. It’s difficult to think it’ll be different this time.”“China’s obviously going to be one of the most affected if those tariffs really come in place and if Trump successfully can put enough pressure on the EU to also put some tariffs of their own on China.”Still, “a lot of companies are diversifying their markets or starting to diversify the supply chains and build manufacturing facilities outside of China. And even if a Trump presidency imposes high tariffs, Europe might decide not to follow it unless there is some really super strong political pressure.”“For Japan, we believe that risks are more balanced than China as the country’s sensitivity to global trade is a bit lower, and its relations with the US will likely remain solid even under the Trump administration.”“We also see the opportunity for the country to cement its semiconductor sector renaissance if Taiwan or South Korea end up bearing the brunt of the Trump team’s potentially consequential re-calibration of the US strategy for them.”“In Asia, the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Vietnam has been benefiting from the lower-end manufacturing, such as textile and wooden furniture, while Taiwan and Malaysia have been benefiting from electronic products supply chain shifts.”“Southeast Asia will be in a pretty good position because of what’s happening with China. So in that sense, Southeast Asia would be good. Thailand even, well, Vietnam may get into some trouble because they’re doing so much manufacturing of Chinese goods, but they’re also doing a lot of manufacturing for Korea.”“For Asia, it would really affect the tech-related ones more. It’s really whether the momentum trade of Taiwan, Korea is going to continue a bit longer, versus Asean being a bit more resilient, less tied to the tech sector, and having the China plus one strategy and secular themes playing out.”","Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
