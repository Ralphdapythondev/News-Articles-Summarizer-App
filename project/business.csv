GCCs offer higher salaries to freshers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gccs-offer-higher-salaries-to-freshers/articleshow/113437861.cms,"BENGALURU: Despite the pervasive impact of inflation on various aspects of our lives, the starting salaries for freshers in the IT sector have remained stagnant for more than a decade. The compensation for entry-level positions has been around Rs 3 lakh - Rs 4 lakh, showing no significant increase over the years.Even the pandemic has not altered the fresher salaries significantly.Companies did not increase their offers to fresh graduates despite hiring in large numbers to meet the demand post-Covid. As they now face the consequences of over-hiring during the 2021-2022 timeframe, companies have reduced fresher hiring due to a slow uptick in discretionary spending and subdued macroeconomic conditions.In contrast, the average salary for a fresher at a global capability centre (GCC) is Rs 5.2 lakh per annum. In GCCs, freshers employed as blockchain developers and data scientists command over Rs 8 lakh as annual compensation. At Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), GCCs hire over 50% of freshers.""Students prefer to work in GCCs because of faster career growth and the job profiles. They are also attractive because of the MNCs. There are over 1,600 GCCs that have set up their development centres in India and they have started to hire from the campuses,"" said Samuel Rajkumar, the director of the career development centre at VIT.Manish Goyal, MD of professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal, emphasised that GCCs prioritise aligning the skills of their workforce with the parent company's strategic road map, placing a greater emphasis on quality rather than cost reduction. ""Besides strong technical and functional skills, they need to possess strong communication, collaboration skills, as well as thought leadership to work independently and drive problem-solving. They are seeking value and expertise, not bulk hiring,"" Goyal said.According to Monica Jamwal, MD for talent solutions at ANSR, 5% to 10% of the hiring at GCCs is through campus placement. ""GCCs typically follow a dual campus hiring strategy: they recruit from premier institutions like IITs and IIMs, while also hiring from a second segment of colleges such as RV College of Engineering and others. This approach enables them to tap into a diverse pool of talent, blending top-tier academic excellence with fresh perspectives from emerging institutions,"" Jamwal said.Sunil Chemmankotil, the India country manager at Adecco, a workforce solutions company, cites several reasons for the lack of salary growth. These include an abundance of college graduates, economic recessions, restricted bargaining power, and the attractiveness of GCCs. Chemmankotil also highlights a crucial aspect contributing to this stagnation: the discrepancy between the educational curriculum provided by institutions and the practical skills demanded by employers in the job market.","The average salary for a fresher at a global capability centre (GCC) is Rs 5.2 lakh per annum.

India must build its own chip design cos: Cadence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-must-build-its-own-chip-design-cos-cadence/articleshow/113437853.cms,"Can you tell us about the work that Cadence does in semiconductor industry?

India has been pushing to get semiconductor companies come and invest here with a $10 billion incentive package. We have got investments from American Micron and homegrown

. Are we on right track?

Why are product companies important?

What is the proficiency of Indians in

chip design

?

Anirudh Devgan is India-born global president & CEO of California-headquartered Cadence Design, the technical software company behind chips designed by almost all the top semiconductor and tech companies in the world - from Nvidia , TSMC to Qualcomm , Apple, Tesla, Google and Meta. Devgan says India has come a long way in its quest for semiconductors . He tells TOI in an interview that instead of focusing just on manufacturing investments, the country should work on incentivising product companies , which build IP within the country.Excerpts.Semiconductors can be very advanced, like the latest chip has 100 billion transistors. It's probably the most difficult thing humans have built. So, there is no way they can be designed by hand. The chips are designed by computers, basically by software. That's what we do. Almost all chips designed in the world today use some form of Cadence software. Cadence is in all geographies, we are in all market segments. All the major companies in the world are our customers, whoever is designing chips. These include Qualcomm, Broadcom, TSMC, Nvidia, Intel, Apple, Tesla, Google and Meta.India is starting bottom up. People like manufacturing as it's easy to understand. But, that's not necessarily the only way, because when you go to manufacturing, you ask somebody else to set up plants here, like a Micron or a TSMC. And they're doing it, especially Micron. So, this is what I would call a bottom-up approach to semiconductors. But there's also a top-down approach, which I think can be even more effective. Because what you need is to control the product companies, not manufacturing. That's the head versus the tail, right? In my opinion, India should invest in product companies, design companies. The Indian market is huge. Rather than asking multinationals to come here, there should be a focus on building indigenous product/design companies. The Indian govt, by matter of policy, can help set up product companies, which design chips for cars, phones or AI. And, then as they get bigger and bigger, they can do their own manufacturing in India. This has happened in other countries too.The real IP lies in product companies and there is no reason that India shouldn't have product companies. All the multinationals are designing in India. What we would like to see is Indian companies designing in India. In the beginning, they can manufacture in India or wherever, like Taiwan and Korea. And over time, as they get bigger, you will control. India will control much more of its destiny and wealth. And, it does not require that much investment. Of the $10 billion that India has set aside for semiconductors, only around 20% ($2 billion) can easily fund like 5-10 companies for design. And, half of them would be successful. If there is fund to invest, part of it should be used to create product companies. That will create the biggest impact. Of course, you can complement that with the bottom of manufacturing-driven. Manufacturing is great for supply chain, resilience, for national security, for jobs. But semiconductor manufacturing creates some jobs. But, design will create much more wealth and jobs. It requires govt investment and policy support.A lot of chips are already being designed in India, but they are for companies like Qualcomm, Broadcom, Nvidia, and Google. India has great designers, but they are designing for multinationals. There should be more indigenous companies (product companies) designing chips specific to the Indian market or for the world market. The talent exists in India to create chips for the world market.",Anirudh Devgan is India-born global president & CEO of California-headquartered Cadence Design.

"US Fed to kick off rate cuts, signal next steps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-to-kick-off-rate-cuts-signal-next-steps/articleshow/113441724.cms,"‘Dots’ and Economic Forecasts

The Fed's June Dot Plot

FOMC Statement

“The Fed is all but sure to kick off the rate-cut cycle at its Sept. 17-18 meeting. Whether they start with a 25- or 50-basis-point cut remains a close call. In our view, forecast coherence and risk management point to 50 basis points as the right choice. The absence of a clear steer — so far — on the possibility of a jumbo move points toward the 25-basis-point option.” Anna Wong, chief US economist

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates this week after holding borrowing costs at a two-decade high for more than a year.By how much, however, remains an open question.Forecasters largely anticipate the Federal Open Market Committee will reduce rates by a quarter point to a range of 5% to 5.25%, though economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co.expect a bigger, half-point move. Investors see better-than-even odds of a half-point adjustment.Fresh quarterly projections released at the conclusion of the central bank’s two-day policy meeting will offer further insight into the path ahead for borrowing costs and the economy.Investors generally see a more aggressive path of reductions this year than the series of quarter-point cuts expected by economists. Financial markets have priced in more than a full percentage point of cuts before the year is out, implying at least one half-point cut.Fed Chair Jerome Powell will need to strike a balance in the press conference between his own views, those of the committee and the message sent by the so-called “dot plot” of individuals’ rate projections — something that could prove challenging if the narratives differ.The decision will be announced via a post-meeting statement at 2pm on Wednesday in Washington. Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later. Here’s what to look for:Each quarter the Fed publishes what’s known as the Summary of Economic Projections, a compilation of policymakers’ individual forecasts for the federal funds rate, unemployment, economic growth and inflation. This week’s SEP will include projections for 2024 through 2027.It will likely include a range of views for the path of interest rates this year. Several participants saw the case for lowering interest rates at the FOMC ’s July meeting amid a pickup in unemployment and easing inflation. Since then, the labor market has weakened further. On the other hand, consumer prices excluding food and energy unexpectedly firmed in August, strengthening the case for moving with caution.While the median dot may signal three quarter-point cuts this year, there are likely to be several officials who think the Fed should lower rates faster.“There are a number of people who think this cut should be 50 basis points, or there should be a 50-basis-point cut later this year,” said Derek Tang, economist at LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics. “The economy is softening quicker than they expected.”The economic forecasts for this year will also be revised. The unemployment rate has already surpassed the Fed’s June projection of 4%, and the central bank’s preferred inflation metric — at 2.5% — has already fallen below the committee’s most recent median forecast.The FOMC doesn’t vote on the forecasts, but they do vote on the statement. The document provides a qualitative description of how the committee as a whole sees the near-term outlook relative to their mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.There are several possibilities for how the wording may change, including language around the balance of risks between employment and inflation.The July statement said those risks “continue to move into better balance,” a line MacroPolicy Perspectives’ Julia Coronado and Laura Rosner-Warburton say is now out of step with recent comments from both Powell and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Coronado and Rosner-Warburton said the FOMC could instead adopt a line similar to what Waller said on Sept. 6: “The balance of risks has shifted toward the employment side of our dual mandate.”The committee may also choose to describe further weakening in the labor market as “unwelcome,” a Greenspan-era term Powell resurrected in a recent speech.Economists are divided on whether and how policymakers would signal future cuts in the statement. Some 44% of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said officials will acknowledge the possibility of further adjustments in the document, while 31% said they’d more explicitly state their intent to pursue a string of rate cuts and provide guidance on the pace.Press ConferenceThe press conference will offer insight into not only the committee’s thinking but also Powell’s. Fed watchers judge that the chair is more uncomfortable with recent job market softening than the median committee voter.Powell has grown increasingly encouraged the Fed can tame inflation with little cost to the economy and jobs. A jump in unemployment now would have high political and economic costs, a situation any central bank chief would want to avoid.If officials do choose to lower rates by a quarter point, Powell has the latitude to signal he aims to guard against further deterioration in the job market.“The message will be: We want extra ammunition on the table, but we aren’t going to use it today,” said Ellen Meade, a former senior adviser on policy and communication at the Fed Board who is now a research professor at Duke University.New VoterThis Fed meeting will also be the first for Beth Hammack, the new Cleveland Fed president. The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc veteran started in August and will cast a vote for the remaining policy decisions this year.",The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates this week after holding borrowing costs at a two-decade high for more than a year.

Traders shy away from Modi stocks in shift to defensives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/modi-stocks-sensex-nifty-clsa-mutual-funds/articleshow/113441426.cms,"Investors in India are shunning stocks that were expected to benefit from Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s re-election, and instead piling into defensive sectors .An index of the so-called Modi stocks , a term coined by CLSA , has climbed only 2% as the prime minister completed his first 100 days in office after winning a third term in early June. In contrast, consumer and software stocks have rallied 20% and 34%, respectively.A few recent policy reversals highlight the element of uncertainty that investors must grapple with after a decade of certainty, as Modi increasingly leans on coalition partners.That’s led to concerns stocks tied to government policies may continue to trail the broader market.There’s “a pronounced shift in focus from infrastructure to agriculture and consumer sectors,” said Sonam Srivastava, founder and fund manager at Wright Research and Capital Pvt. The rotation has been aided by the recent volatility in global markets and the election outcome, she said.The government last month withdrew a policy aimed at hiring market experts for senior government positions and deferred a bill on broadcasting services. Modi’s party has also announced cash handouts in some states ahead of regional polls later this year.The administration is “turning populist on the margin,” Mahesh Nandurkar, a strategist at Jefferies Financial Group Inc, wrote in a note. Nandurkar said he expects the government may miss its target on capital spending, a significant headwind for sectors like infrastructure that have been benefited from large investments in recent years.To be sure, Modi stocks are still on pace to outperform the nation’s main equity indexes for the fourth straight year. An index of such stocks had rallied 24% in the first five months of 2024, as the prime minister prioritized building infrastructure capacity while retaining focus on driving efficiencies at the nation’s state-run companies.That said, investors remain skeptical of stocks tied to government policies.Domestic mutual funds, the key drivers of local stocks this year, have cut their exposure to companies engaged in manufacturing capital goods in each of the three months since the June 4 election result, according to a note by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.Foreign funds have also turned net sellers in sectors like utilities, cement, metals and financials in August, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis.The “unreasonable expectations” about the Modi stocks are now being scaled back, said Sreeram Ramdas of Green Portfolio Pvt.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore. In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112317825,imgsize-144990,width-400,resizemode-4/112317825.jpg"

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

trade deficit

to near all-time high

NEW DELHI: India's trade deficit neared record level in Aug as a surge in gold shipments pushed up monthly imports by 3.4% to an all-time high of $64.4 billion, while exports fell 9.4% to $34.7 billion.As gold imports more than doubled to a new high of over $10 billion, the commerce department on Tuesday said total imports rose to $64.36 billion in August, marginally higher than the previous record of $64.35 billion in June 2022.Commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal attributed the increase to higher prices, a reduction in customs duty, stocking ahead of the festival season. The numbers indicate that some of the gold that was smuggled due to high tariffs are now coming via legal channels. As a result, the trade deficit widened to $29.7 billion, just a shade lower than the $30.4 billion gap between exports and imports recorded in last Oct.""It is not a matter of concern for an emerging market economy. There is huge consumption demand coming from an economy that is growing at double the rate of the world economy. As exports grow and you join the global value chain, you have to import certain things to export. To the extent that there is foreign exchange (reserves), these are perfectly normal numbers,"" Barthwal said.He said that exports had dropped largely due to a fall in oil prices (resulting in lower value realisation for petrol and diesel) as well as due to low demand for gems and jewellery and rice exports being checked by govt. The fall in exports is the sharpest since July 2023, when it had shrunk 9.9%.Lower crude oil prices meant that imports fell over 32% to $11 billion, while petroleum product exports were almost 38% lower at around $6 billion. ""There is a huge challenge for exports in the current global situation... Despite the dark clouds globally, India is a bright spot,"" Barthwal said.Barthwal said several countries had seen a decline in imports, which was impacting exports and demand remained weak in the US and Europe, while China was in the midst of a slowdown. Fieo president Ashwani Kumar said trade disruptions - led by logistical challenges, such as lack of shipping space, irregular shipping schedule, ships skipping Indian ports - and declining commodity prices have hit exports.Govt is drawing comfort from the services side, where exports rose 7% to $30.7 billion, while imports grew under 4% to $15.7 billion. ""Tech-intensive sectors, including electronics, pharma, and engineering goods, continue to demonstrate resilience as key contributors to export growth. In terms of destinations, exports to non-traditional markets, such as Kenya and Brazil registered strong growth,"" said India Exim Bank MD Deepali Agrawal.","India's trade deficit neared record level in Aug as a surge in gold shipments pushed up monthly imports by 3.4%.

New audit norms planned to check frauds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-audit-norms-planned-to-check-frauds/articleshow/113437313.cms,"NEW DELHI: Citing multiple accounting lapses, audit watchdog National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) on Tuesday proposed aligning a key accounting standard with global norms, which has been resisted by a powerful lobby of chartered accountants . NFRA has argued that it is important to converge SA600 , fixed 22 years ago, with the global standard to ensure that the interest of investors, particularly retail investors whose numbers are multiplying, are protected.While doing so, it has proposed to restrict it to the audit of listed private companies - which account for under 2% of the 17 lakh active companies in the country. In the process, it also sought to dismiss concerns of small audit firms being hit by the move.While the International AS 600 was revised in 2009 and 2023, a bunch of auditors have blocked a similar revision in India, despite RBI and Sebi backing the plan. ""We are still riding in a Santro car when the world has moved to modern vehicles,"" said an official.In its 35-page consultation paper, NFRA has highlighted how the gap - which does not let the principal auditor coordinate with other auditors of subsidiaries or even check paperwork - has led to multiple failures from Reliance Capital to Reliance Home Finance, Reliance Commercial Finance, DHFL, IL&FS, and Cafe Coffee Day.Analysing data, it pointed out how 100 listed companies (excluding banks and insurance companies) had multiple subsidiaries, associate companies, and joint ventures with at least 23 having over 50 such entities, while 76 had overseas entities. In several of these companies, over 50% of the net assets were from subsidiaries, associates, and JVs.Citing the increase in demat accounts, mutual fund SIPs and pension schemes, the paper said: ""The primary reason for proposing adoption of a revised atandard for group audits is to help safeguard public interest and investor protection , and the need for a standards framework that is robust enough to meet the challenges posed by complex financial systems today. The inherent complexity of group structures... cannot be handled by the 2002 version of SA 600 and the related provisions across other standards.""NFRA also said various panels have underlined the need to converge domestic and global standards.","Audit watchdog National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) has proposed aligning a key accounting standard with global norms.

How to watch lunar eclipse?

Skywatchers across the United States, Europe, most of Africa, western Asia, and parts of Antarctica on Tuesday evening will have the opportunity to witness a unique celestial event featuring a partial lunar eclipse and a super full Moon .This eclipse will take place during a ""supermoon,"" during which the Moon will appear brighter and will also be larger in size as it reaches its closest point to Earth, known as perigeeIn October, the Moon will be situated more than 222,000 miles from our planet at its nearest approach, Fox Weather reported.Lunal eclipse will appear because Earth will pass between the Sun and the Moon, a temporary shadow will be cast on our natural satellite, but the event is not expected to be as breathtaking as the total solar eclipse millions witnessed earlier in the year.This particular full Moon is known as the Harvest Moon due to its proximity to the autumnal equinox.The Farmer's Almanac also refers to it as the Corn Moon , a name derived from Native American traditions that utilized the extra light to harvest crops throughout the night. Late September and October are typically busy months for farmers as they work to gather their crops before the onset of cold weather.As a result of the increased gravitational pull from the Moon during this event, coastal communities may experience higher-than-normal water levels, a phenomenon known as King Tides.According to NASA , the lunar eclipse will commence around 8:41 pm EDT, with the shadow beginning to appear on the Moon's surface. The event will reach its peak just over two hours later at 10:44 pm EDT, with only eight percent of the Moon fully shadowed. The entire celestial occurrence is expected to conclude before 1 am on September 18.People in London can expect the eclipse’s peak at around 3:45 a.m. BST.Lunar eclipses are among the easiest skywatching events to observe. You can lookup in the sky and watch the eclipse.No special equipment like a telescope is necessary. However, binoculars or a small telescope can enhance the experience by revealing details on the moon's surface —moonwatching is just as captivating during an eclipse as at any other time.If the eclipse takes place in winter, be sure to dress warmly if you plan to stay outside for the entire event, as it can take a couple of hours to unfold.

Simplified Snapchat

LOS ANGELES: In one of the biggest tech launches this year, American multimedia company Snap Inc introduced its new cutting-edge AR ( augmented reality ) spectacles together with its new OS, which powers these see-through glasses.The fifth generation Snap spectacles , which the company says weigh 226 gram, sit lightly on the eyes and behave like usual glasses till you power it up and it conjures a screen that lets you have fun or get creative with a range of lenses.With big tech seeing the virtues of AR glasses, which are different from the opaque and chunkier VR headsets, Snap is first off the blocks in this new class of wearables. Meta is believed to be poised to introduce its own AR glasses too.The Snap spectacles, which are a standalone device and can be operated by pinch gestures of your right hand and a virtual console that opens on your left palm, work by projecting an overlapping AR image on your view and so don’t cut you off from reality.For example, if you are sitting in your living room, you can play a game of virtual chess on your real table wearing the spectacles – lifting pieces with pinch gestures and making your moves on the virtual board – while sipping on a (real) cup of coffee. The table, the chess board and pieces and the cup of coffee – you see all three clearly.Snap described the spectacles as “the result of a decade of research and development to introduce hardware that breaks the bounds of screens and brings people together in the real world”.The spectacles can also be paired with a phone through Snap’s ‘Spectacles’ app, which lets one use the phone as a game controller and also mirror the phone screen. The ‘spectator mode’ feature allows group activity with the spectacles. For example, two players can play that game of chess if both are wearing the spectacles.The new AR glasses were launched by Snap co-founder Evan Spiegel at the Santa Monica-based company’s main annual event, Snap Partner Summit , at the Barker Hangar in Los Angeles.“Tech can be way better than it is today. We can’t be bound by screens forever. We need something more intuitive, more human,” Spiegel said.Snap also announced a partnership with OpenAI that will open up artificial intelligence models to lens developers using the new AR glasses. As Spiegel put it, “no tech event in 2024 is complete without an OpenAI partnership”. Like image-generating AI tools, its Easy Lens can do the same to instantly generate lenses.At the summit, the company also announced Lego Games launching ‘Bricktacular’ for the spectacles, a partnership with Niantic, and a Star Wars Galaxy experience being crafted by ILM Immersive, Lucasfilm’s interactive studi0.The spectacles, the company said, will be available for now only to lens developers, including those from India, working with Snap for a $99 monthly subscription.The Snap AR glasses are equipped with four cameras that power Snap Spatial Engine and enable hand tracking. The Optical Engine has been designed to enable a see-through AR display.The glasses work through liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) micro-projectors that create vivid images and have waveguides that make it possible to see the images created by the LCoS projector without the need for calibrations or custom fittings. They have a 13 millisecond motion-to-photon latency that give, the company said, “incredible accuracy, integrating them naturally into your environment”.The Optical Engine delivers a 46-degree diagonal field of view with a 37 pixel per degree resolution – similar to a 100-inch display which is 10 feet away. The glasses tint automatically based on surrounding light and work indoor and outdoor.The dual system-on-a-chip architecture with two Snapdragon processors splits the compute workload on the spectacles while titanium vapour chambers dissipate heat. The company announced a runtime on a single charge of up to 45 minutes.“We want to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world and empower developers to invest in building amazing lenses,” the company said in a statement, while announcing that the spectacles would have no developer tax and would give developers new ways to build and share lenses. “Instead of a complicated compiling process, the newly rebuilt Lens Studio 5.0 lets developers quickly push their project to spectacles,” it said.Snap also announced at the summit it is testing “a new and simplified Snapchat that organises the app around communicating with friends, using the camera, and watching snaps from friends and the broader Snapchat community, including creators and publishers”.“We’ve been working on unifying Stories and Spotlight for some time. Now, with this new and simplified design, Snapchatters will have a more personal and relevant viewing experience,” it said.","Snap Inc introduced its new cutting-edge AR ( augmented reality ) spectacles together with its new OS, which powers these see-through glasses.

That would increase borrowing costs for Boeing, which already has a $60-billion debt pile.""We estimate the strike will pare sales by more than 2008's nearly $100 million per day since current volumes are higher,"" TD Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said.Boeing's finances are already under pressure due to negative free cash flow and poor margins. The planemaker needs to generate sufficient cash flow to meet payments on its debt.On Monday, Boeing said it was freezing hiring and weighing temporary furloughs to keep costs in check.Each revenue slip of more than $100 million per day will pare $60 million in cash, since the planemaker receives 60% of a plane's price upon delivery, TD's von Rumohr said.Jefferies analysts say the strike would amount to a hit of about $1.3 billion in monthly free cash flow.","Boeing could lose over $100 million in daily revenue until it reaches a settlement with its union.

'Our business is in a difficult period': Boeing considers layoffs amid workers' strike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/our-business-is-in-a-difficult-period-boeing-considers-layoffs-amid-workers-strike/articleshow/113409042.cms,"In response to the ongoing factory workers' strike that began last week, Boeing has announced a series of measures ""to preserve cash and safeguard future"".Chief financial officer (CFO) Brian West outlined 10 immediate cost-cutting initiatives in a memo to employees, including a company-wide hiring freeze, a pause on pay increases for promoted managers and executives, and a halt to all non-essential travel.West said the moves were necessary because “our business is in a difficult period.”West also mentioned the possibility of temporary layoffs. ""We are also considering the difficult step of temporary furloughs for many employees, managers and executives in the coming weeks,"" West said, adding, ""this strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way.""The company plans to reduce spending on suppliers and stop most supplier purchase orders related to the 737, 767, and 777 airplane models.The strike, which began early Friday, involves approximately 33,000 workers represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The walkout occurred after workers rejected a proposed 25 per cent pay increase over four years, with the union initially seeking a pay hike of at least 40 per cent.Striking workers are picketing at various locations in Washington state, Oregon, and California in the US.The bonuses, which workers say range from $3,000 to $5,000 a year, have become a point of contention. Boeing argues that it is difficult to calculate bonuses fairly for 33,000 employees with different roles and instead proposes replacing the payouts with automatic contributions of $4,160 per year to each employee's 401(k) retirement account. Workers are also frustrated that over the past 16 years, Boeing has ended its traditional pension plan and reduced health care benefits through contract extensions.Boeing has faced significant financial challenges, losing more than $25 billion since the start of 2019 and burning through $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 alone. The strike is expected to delay deliveries of new planes, which are a crucial source of cash for the company.Despite Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing's commercial-airplanes division, urging workers to accept the contract offer last week, workers rejected the recommendation of their own leaders for the first time since 1995.Additional cost-cutting measures outlined in the CFO's memo include eliminating first- and business-class service for critical travel and halting spending on outside consultants.","Boeing has announced a series of measures ""to preserve cash and safeguard future"" The company plans to reduce spending on suppliers and stop most supplier purchase orders related to the 737, 767, and 777 airplane models.

Yaccarino made the remark on the social media platform X shortly after Breton, who had pursued Elon Musk over content regulation, announced his abrupt resignation.Breton, who served as the EU’s internal market commissioner for five years from December 2019, had been instrumental in regulating the digital space, particularly with the introduction of the Digital Services Act (DSA).His tenure saw multiple confrontations with big tech firms, including Musk's X, over content moderation and regulatory compliance.In his resignation post on X, Breton expressed his thanks to colleagues and team members, saying, ""I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my colleagues in the College, Commission services, MEPs, Member States, and my team. Together, we have worked tirelessly to advance an ambitious EU agenda. It has been an honour & privilege to serve the common European interest.""Breton also issued a resignation letter addressed to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen , in which he detailed the reasons for his departure. In his letter, he wrote:""Dear President, On 24 July, you wrote to Member States asking them to nominate candidates for the 2024-2029 College of Commissioners, specifying that Member States that intend to suggest the incumbent Member of the Commission were not required to suggest two candidates. On 25 July, President Emmanuel Macron designated me as France's official candidate for a second mandate in the College of Commissioners - as he had already publicly announced on the margins of the European Council on 28 June. A few days ago, in the very final stretch of negotiations on the composition of the future College, you asked France to withdraw my name - for personal reasons that in no instance you have discussed directly with me - and offered, as a political trade-off, an allegedly more influential portfolio for France in the future College. You will now be proposed a different candidate.Over the past five years, I have relentlessly striven to uphold and advance the common European good, above national and party interests.

I am therefore resigning from my position as European Commissioner, effective immediately.""Breton’s abrupt resignation follows mounting tensions between tech giants and European regulators, with his strong stance on digital platform regulations often placing him at odds with figures like Elon Musk.

In terms of special cargo, we continually review the market, and we'll look to build facilities within the cargo to monitor the system,"" he said.About the company's expansion in India, Watts said Cathay Cargo has no immediate plans to operate cargo terminals around the world.""...I think all I would say is, never say, never. If an opportunity presents itself in India or anywhere in the world where there might be an investment for Cathay Cargo Terminal. Of course, we'd have to, we'd look at that,"" he said.""We certainly welcome all Indian airlines to come and use our facilities when they're flying in and out of Hong Kong.

They turn them into resin pellets, and that same plastic comes back to us in a new cover sheet. We are also looking at whether we should be using biodegradable plastics, and still something we continue to look at,"" he said.According to Watts, the company has done a lot of experimentation with different types of plastic mixed in different climate conditions.""...So monsoon in India, snowstorms in Anchorage (US), very hot weather down in Australia.

Majority of US voters support Trump's tariff plans for Chinese imports: Survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/majority-of-us-voters-support-trumps-tariff-plans-for-chinese-imports-survey/articleshow/113369193.cms,"A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll reveals that majority of US voters support Donald Trump's pledge to raise tariffs on imported goods, especially those from China, highlighting his economic edge over his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris The September 11-12 poll indicated that 56% of registered voters were more inclined to back a candidate who supports a new 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on imports from China, while 41% were less likely to support such a candidate.Both the Republican former president and his Democratic rival have pledged to implement tax cuts if they secure victory in the November 5 election. However, voters also perceive Trump as more likely to reduce the $35 trillion national debt , despite independent economic analysts predicting that his plans would have the contrary effect.The poll also revealed that one-third of Democrats were more likely to support a candidate who favors higher tariffs and steep levies on Chinese goods, while two-thirds were less likely to do so. Independent voters reflected the broader electorate.Polling expert Karlyn Bowman from the conservative American Enterprise Institute attributes Trump's advantage to the perception that the economy performed well during his 2017-2021 administration and his success in persuading voters that US economic issues stemmed from unfair economic competition from other nations, particularly China.Although Harris holds a 5-percentage-point lead over Trump nationally, the US presidential race will be largely determined in approximately seven battleground states where the contest is more competitive.The US economy performed well by many indicators During the Trump administration, until the COVID-19 pandemic devastated the global economy in 2020. Unemployment reached its lowest levels in decades, although the national debt was increasing and would surge during the pandemic.This year, Trump has pledged various tax cuts on the campaign trail, including eliminating income tax on tipped income, a proposal that Harris also supports. On Thursday, he promised to end taxes on overtime pay, with 70% of registered voters supporting the idea of exempting tips from taxes.During his presidency, Donald Trump referred to himself as a ""tariff man"" as he imposed tariffs on imports from China. However, economists, including those at Goldman Sachs, are skeptical of this approach, believing that Trump's policies would hinder economic growth.In the recent presidential debate, Kamala Harris cited Goldman Sachs' evaluation and pointed out that many independent economists think Trump's plans would increase the national debt. Despite this, the poll revealed that 37% of US voters believe Trump is more likely to prioritize debt reduction, while only 30% chose Harris. The remaining 30% believed neither candidate would address the issue.Several respected budget analysts project that Trump's tax proposals would add a minimum of $3 trillion to federal deficits over the next ten years. In contrast, the same analysts predict that Harris' plans would add less than $2 trillion or potentially even reduce the debt. When asked which candidate would prioritize creating a favorable business climate, 47% of polled voters selected Trump, compared to 37% who chose Harris.However, Harris held a slight 1-percentage-point lead (43% to 42%) when voters were asked which candidate would focus on creating ""an economic climate that is good for me and my family."" Voters also believed that Harris was more likely to prioritize making healthcare affordable and investing in infrastructure.Trump had an advantage regarding inflation, which experienced significant increases under Biden's administration in 2021 and 2022. The poll showed that 43% of voters believed Trump would be more likely to ""lower prices for everyday things like groceries and gas,"" while 36% chose Harris.The Reuters/Ipsos poll, which has a margin of error of approximately 3 percentage points, collected online responses from 1,405 registered voters.","A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll reveals that majority of US voters support Donald Trump's pledge to raise tariffs on imported goods, especially those from China.
