Setback for Musk's Neuralink: First human brain implant encounters technical glitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/setback-for-musks-neuralink-first-human-brain-implant-encounters-technical-glitch/articleshow/109995041.cms,"NEW DELHI: Elon Musk 's ambitious startup Neuralink has encountered a significant hiccup in its first human brain implant trial. The device, designed to help paralyzed individuals control technology through thought, began detaching from the skull of the test subject, 29-year-old Noland Arbaugh, reducing its data capture capability. This issue arose just weeks after the company showcased the device's functionalities in a live demonstration.Arbaugh, paralyzed from the shoulders down due to a diving accident eight years ago, was the first to undergo the implantation of Neuralink's brain-computer interface ( BCI ) in January.The interface includes 1,024 electrodes across 64 threads thinner than a human hair, intended to monitor neural activity and translate it into computer commands. However, complications arose as several threads retracted from Arbaugh's brain, leading to a decrease in the number of effective electrodes.""In response to this change, we modified the recording algorithm to be more sensitive to neural population signals, improved the techniques to translate these signals into cursor movements, and enhanced the user interface,"" Neuralink said, aiming to overcome the setback. The company noted that these refinements led to a ""rapid and sustained improvement"" in Arbaugh's performance, measured in bits per second (BPS), a standard metric for speed and accuracy in this technology.The incident has sparked concerns about the long-term viability and safety of such implants, though Neuralink confirmed that the malfunction has not posed a direct risk to Arbaugh's safety. Despite the possibility of removing the implant, the decision was made to keep it in place as adjustments appeared to rectify the issue effectively.This event marks a crucial phase in Neuralink’s journey, which began in 2016 and gained human trial approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last year after extensive animal testing. Arbaugh remains optimistic about the technology's impact, saying during a March livestream, ""Now I can literally just lie in bed and play to my heart’s content,"" until the battery of his rechargeable chip expires.Neuralink's efforts in pioneering brain-computer interface technology continue to draw global attention, balancing groundbreaking potential with the challenges of practical implementation.","Elon Musk's startup Neuralink has encountered a significant hiccup in its first human brain implant trial.

Meet the Apple executives who could succeed Tim Cook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-the-apple-executives-who-could-succeed-tim-cook/articleshow/109964254.cms,"Tim Cook picked up the mantle from Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple over a decade ago and grew it into a multi-trillion dollar company. Now, as Cook nears traditional retirement age, speculation abounds about who will succeed him.Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman joins host David Gura to discuss the challenges of replacing Cook, his potential successors and how that decision will impact one of the best-known brands in the world.Here is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:David Gura: Every year, the top executives at Apple – of course, one of the largest and most influential companies in the world – are whisked away to an idyllic retreat usually in Carmel Valley.That’s about 90 miles south of the company’s headquarters, in Cupertino, California. So, many of these execs travel by bus.Mark Gurman: They can't bring their family, they can't bring their assistants. These are the 100 most important people at Apple.Gura: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has covered Apple for almost 15 years, and he says this annual meeting is one of the most important dates on the company’s calendar.It’s something Steve Jobs started.Gurman: They sit in auditoriums, different rooms of this beautiful resort in Northern California. They are taught and shown all of the goodness that's to come from Apple in the years to come.Gura: It was at this retreat that Apple’s so-called “Top 100” got a first look at the original iPad, Mark says.They saw the MacBook Air and the Apple Watch. And got updates on the Apple Car project, which the company just scrapped.Gurman: This is where you go to learn about Apple's future.Gura: And while most of the focus is on product presentations – and prototypes, Apple’s senior leaders are also taking note of who among them has been picked to make these presentations.Gurman: I think the people at that event are probably always naturally trying to figure out who's next in line. Who's in charge?Gura: That is … who will eventually replace Tim Cook.Jobs’ hand-picked successor has been the CEO of Apple for nearly thirteen years. He was Jobs’ deputy before that.Gura: At Apple, succession planning is the elephant in the room, and even though Cook hasn’t indicated he plans to leave the company anytime soon, Mark says there is growing speculation about when that’ll happen who will be its next chief executive – and whether that person is in this group of Apple’s most important people.Gurman: We’re nearing sort of the end of Cook’s tenure at Apple, probably, right? He's going to turn 65 next year. He's older than most CEOs in the S&P 500. He's been at Apple for 25 years and Apple's at a precarious position because the executive team where they likely would choose their next CEO from most of the people on that executive team are all about 60 years old, or would probably be in their mid to late sixties by the time Tim Cook retires, leaving the company with very few reasonable options.Gura: Today on the show:The challenges of finding someone who could do one of the most demanding jobs in business.Who’s in the running, and how that decision will impact a $2.8 trillion company, and one of the best-known brands in the world.I’m David Gura, and this is The Big Take, from Bloomberg News.Gura: Tim Cook has been the CEO of Apple for more than a decade.And part of his job involves planning for who will succeed him. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says it's not the easiest job to fill.Gura: Is that job description really well fleshed out? In other words, what does an Apple CEO need to be able to do?Gurman: An Apple CEO needs to either be the visionary to bring new products to market. Or needs to be able to find who the visionary is and partner with that visionary to bring those new products to market.Gura: It’s a challenge that wasn’t lost on Steve Jobs when he tapped Cook for the job.Gurman: You know, the thing about Cook is that it is all consuming, and I think one of the reasons that Jobs made him the CEO, other than the fact that he was the most qualified, probably by a long shot, amongst the executive team at the time, is that Jobs knew how all consuming the next era of Apple would be, right?And Tim's entire life for the most part, based on everyone who knows him and everyone you speak to about him is Apple.Gura: Cook became Apple’s CEO in 2011, under intense scrutiny.He took over for Jobs, the company’s founder, who was battling pancreatic cancer.And in October of that year, Cook stepped into the spotlight, to unveil a new version of the iPhone :Tim Cook: Good morning. This is my first product launch since being named CEO. I'm sure you didn't know that.Gura: You can hear him cracking a joke to acknowledge what a big moment this was. He was under immense pressure – following in Jobs’ footsteps.Cook: I Love Apple. And I consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have worked here for almost 14 years.Gura: As Apple’s chief operating officer, Cook worked side-by-side with Jobs, during a period when Apple grew at breakneck speed. When it became much more than a computer company.Cook: Just ten years ago, we launched the original iPod here, and it went on to revolutionize the way we listen to music.Gura: Mark, you covered that transition in 2011. What can you tell us about the relationship between Steve Jobs and Tim Cook?Gurman: They were close. I wouldn't say that they were best friends. Uh, I would say in many ways they were, uh, partners. Steve Jobs was the design mind. He was the person dreaming up these new products, and Tim Cook was the execution guy. He was the person for all intents and purposes, who was able to bring these products to market, get them manufactured, get them into retail stores, and so forth. And then when Steve Jobs stepped down and then ultimately passed away, what Apple lost was sort of that visionary to dream up new types of product categories, new designs, new user experiencesGura: Jobs died on October 5th, 2011 – one day after Cook unveiled that new iPhone.And in the years that followed, Cook made sure Apple continued to build on the runaway success of that device.Gurman: The Apple watch for all intents and purposes is an accessory or an extension of the iPhone. Airpods are an extension to the iPhone, an accessory to the iPhone. What Tim Cook has done, he's taken the product lines that Steve Jobs created and envisioned, and supercharged them. When Steve Jobs passed, there was only one iPad model, the iPad 2.Today, there are five, or even more iPad models available right now. The iPhone went from one or two different models to several different models. So what Tim Cook has been able to do is squeeze so much juice out of the lemons that are those original Apple form factors.Gura: Under his leadership, Apple added products and services, along with new accessories.The company branched into movies and TV.It introduced an Apple credit card.Gurman: At its core, I think Apple is still very much a technology company, but they like to position themselves as well as a lifestyle company.Gura: Now, more than a decade into his tenure, do you see this company as Tim Cook's Apple, or is it still Steve Jobs’ Apple that, that Tim Cook is the steward of?Gurman: I think it's actually a mix of both. At its very core, Steve Jobs left Apple with something, you know, more than pretty good in the iPhone. And Tim Cook, I would say, has probably made the most of what he was left with. I don't think anyone could have done a better job following in the footsteps as legendary as someone like Steve Jobs.Gura: People worried Steve Jobs would be irreplaceable, but now, there’s a sense Tim Cook’s shoes will be hard to fill.Gurman: So The question is Apple moving forward, who was that new person to lead Apple into a new era with a new vision, with new types of products. And that's really what Apple needs to come up with to create its next 15 years.Gura: There are a handful of names that come up in conversations about CEO succession at Apple.But over the years, as Mark has reported on this, there’s been a clear frontrunner.Gurman: He can own the stage. He can talk the talk with government officials from China to Europe to the US. If something happened unexpectedly to Cook, I don't think Apple would miss a beat.Gura: So, who is Apple’s heir apparent? And who else is waiting in the wings, vying for the top job? That’s after the break.Gura: Before Tim Cook became Apple’s CEO, he was the chief operating officer under Steve Jobs.And when it comes to who will replace Cook, his current COO could easily be next in line:Cook: And to tell us about some progress in this area, I'd like to invite up Jeff Williams. Jeff?Gura: That’s Cook introducing Jeff Williams at a product launch in 2016:Williams: Last year, we introduced Research Kit. And our goal was to use technology to solve some of the biggest problemsGura: Williams has been C-O-O for almost a decade now. He joined the company in 1998.Gurman: Right now, he runs Apple's entire operations. He's in charge of the Apple supply chain.He's in charge of Apple's health care efforts. He's in charge of Apple watch hardware and software engineering. He was in charge of the Apple car. He's involved with the Apple vision pro headset, and he's in charge of Apple's hardware and software design organization. So he has so much in his portfolio already, and he would be able to be a shoo-in pretty easily for Cook if something were to happen.A lot of people have called him Tim Cook's Tim Cook.Gura: And like Cook, Williams grew up in the South, he got an MBA from Duke, and had a stint at IBM before joining Apple.But there’s something else these two have in common. They’re both in their early sixties.Gurman: He’s only two years younger than Cook.Gura: And that could make William’s path to succeeding Cook complicated.Gurman: If Cook retires in three to five years, you can't name a 66 year old Jeff Williams as CEO of Apple. Right? The Street, the market, the employees, the board, probably wouldn't be terribly fond of that idea. You can't set up someone for a two to five year tenure as a new CEO of a company as big and as important as Apple.Gura: This is not just an issue with Williams, though.When you go down the list of other potential candidates among Apple’s top management, a trend emerges.Mark says many members of the company’s leadership team are also hovering around retirement age.And turnover at the executive level is pretty rare.Gurman: When you're a Senior Vice President at Apple, you're essentially the CEO of a major division, right? You're at one of the most successful companies in the world. You're also getting paid $25 million per year as an Apple Senior Vice President. So from a financial standpoint, it's very worthwhile to stay around. But I think the people in Apple's executive team, they're motivated by more than money. I think there's a sense that a lot of these folks are very much motivated by the power that comes with being in that role. And so power is sometimes hard to give up.Gura: Mark says, if it’s not Williams, there are a few other candidates who are likely in the running.They’re all currently on the Apple payroll. Tim Cook himself has said he hopes the board taps someone from within the company. And they have their own trade-offs.Finding a single person who can do everything that an Apple CEO needs to do is a real challenge.One potential candidate is on his second stint at Apple:Gurman: Craig Federighi, who's in charge of software engineering.Gura: But, Mark says?Gurman: Federighi probably doesn't have the business acumen to run the whole company.Gura: There’s also Deirdre O'Brien, who oversees Apple’s sprawling retail operation worldwide.Gurman: And before that, Uh, she was one of the company's top executives on operations and sales.Gura: But according to Mark? ...Gurman: Apple probably wants to try something new for a new era and not go with another operations or an HR person.Gura: But Mark has identified another candidate. Who, with his age and experience, is a strong contender.Gurman: Everything that I have learned while reporting the story points to a guy named John Ternus.He is not even 50 years old. He's Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering.He joined Apple's executive team in 2021. He has quickly risen through the ranks. He used to be a VP in charge of Mac computer engineering. He eventually added the iPad, added AirPods. More recently, he added the iPhone and the Apple watch. And now he's in charge of basically all of the money making hardware for Apple.And he's become an increasingly important face at the company. He's been increasingly promoted in their marketing. He's dealing with regulators in terms of right to repair laws. So he's becoming a bigger part of the Apple story.Gura: Mark says Ternus had a marquee role this year, at that annual executive conference in Northern California.And just this week, Apple unveiled some new tech, and Cook called on Ternus at that event to introduce those new products to the public.Tim Cook: So here's John to tell you more. …John Ternus: Let's kick things off with iPad Air.Gura: Mark says Ternus’ prospects of becoming Apple’s next CEO get better the longer Cook sticks around.And there is no indication he plans to retire anytime soon.Executives are not under the same pressure they used to be, to retire in their mid-Sixties.Gura: Mark, I wonder if you could situate this conversation in kind of a broader cultural sea change we're seeing. Bob Iger back at Disney in his 70s. That must in some way sort of liberate Tim Cook to look perhaps at a longer tenure at Apple.Gurman: Yeah, that's a very good point. Certainly the next U. S. president is going to be in their 80s during their tenure. You have Pat Gelsinger, who's the CEO of Intel. He was named to that role three years ago when he was about 60. So certainly you do have some older statesmen there with Tim Cook, you know, one of the, the, the older ones and Apple appreciates, as some people tell me, the people with gray hair there, that means they have experience and wisdom, and they've been around the block a few times. There is nothing that Tim Cook hasn't seen, and wisdom goes a long way for being an Apple executive.Gura: For his part, Cook has a lot of unfinished business he’s attending to right now:Apple’s seen a slowdown in sales, the company is taking hits from regulators – in the US and the European Union, and after Apple’s adventure in automobile manufacturing came to a screeching halt, it’s under pressure to deliver something new.All of that, and more, is on Cook’s plate, and Mark says no one is pushing him to step aside.Gurman: There's no mandatory retirement age. And I would say that even if there was, uh, they'd rip that up or shred it or light it on fire to let Cook stay around as long as he wants to. Because he's been effective, Wall Street loves him. The stock price has surely been positively reflected by Cook's tenure.And so I think Tim Cook is going to be the CEO of Apple as long as he wants to be the CEO of Apple and he won't step down a day before that.",Tim Cook has been the CEO of Apple for more than a decade.

Akshaya Tritiya 2024 gold price: What is the outlook for gold investment? Here’s what experts recommend,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/akshaya-tritiya-2024-gold-price-what-is-the-outlook-for-gold-investment-heres-what-experts-recommend/articleshow/110005947.cms,"Gold Prices: Trend So far

Gold Prices: What’s the outlook?

Akshaya Tritiya Gold Price Outlook: Akshaya Tritiya is one of the biggest gold buying festivals in India. Gold has shown remarkable performance since the previous Akshaya Tritiya, which occurred on April 22, 2023, delivering a substantial 16% return. The cost of 10 grams of gold has increased by Rs 11,300, from Rs 59,845 to over Rs 71,100 currently.Although the price of 10 grams of gold is approximately Rs 3000 or 4% below its all-time highs, gold enthusiasts have the opportunity to purchase the precious metal on the auspicious occasion of Akshaya Tritiya, say experts.A study of gold price trends since 2014 reveals a varied performance of gold between one Akshaya Tritiya and the next. In 2015, the price decreased by 12% leading up to the following Akshaya Tritiya. Similarly, in 2017, there was a 3.23% decline.However, gold has yielded positive returns on eight occasions between two consecutive Akshaya Tritiya, with the highest returns of 32% in 2020. In 2023, the returns have once again reached double digits, making it an attractive time for investors to consider adding gold to their portfolios.Also Read | How is gold jewellery price calculated by jewellers? Check top points before buying gold on Akshaya Tritiya So where are gold prices headed and what should investors do? Here’s what experts have to sayNavneet Damani, Group Senior Vice President, Commodity and Currency Research, MOFS notes that just like last year, gold and silver has seen northward movement in Q1 2024 as well, matching or even outperforming other major asset classes. “As we enter the new FY, which starts with the auspicious occasion of Akshaya Tritiya, gold and silver have marked gains of 13% and 11% year-to-date, respectively. Two main factors are triggering volatility in the bullion market - geo-political tensions and US Federal Reserve monetary policy,” he tells TOI.Naveen Mathur, Director - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers says that gold prices are up almost 17–18 % since the last festival date. “Prices have continued to depict a strong trend in the first quarter of the year; a 3% increase in demand worldwide and an 8% increase in demand in India were noted as per estimates by the World Gold Council,” he tells TOI.According to Anand Rathi’s Mathur, gold prices have been rising due to the fact that investors have remained optimistic focusing on the long term value of their investments. “Although we may not expect new record highs in the near term, gold prices are still expected to remain steady this festival season. Jewellery demand may get impacted in rural India, while investment demand still remains firm leading to prices to consolidate in the range of Rs 69,800 – 72,900 in futures contract in MCX,” he said.Navneet Damani says comparing gold returns over the last 15 years for Akshaya Tritiya, gold has delivered a 10% CAGR. “There are both positives and negatives for gold prices at this juncture, lower than expected economic data points, rise in growth concerns, higher rate cut expectations in this year, geo-political tensions, concerns regarding rising debt, increase in demand and fall in US Yields could act as tailwinds for prices. Market participants always discount future events in advance, like an early rate cut by the US Fed, hence any black swan event could further support the prices in future,” he tells TOI.Also Read | What is 24 karat gold? Know difference between 999 vs 995 fineness gold “There are several platforms for market participants to invest in gold based on their risk profile. From a longer term horizon, it is advised to invest in Sovereign Gold Bonds which will help to capitalise the price rise in gold and an additional 2.5% p.a. interest to investors. Several other modes to invest could be in the form of ETF, exchange traded derivatives, Digital Gold and Physical bars and coins,” Damani said.“We continue to maintain a positive stance for Gold recommending buying on dips, with a target of Rs 75,000 for gold on domestic front and $2450 on Comex,” he adds.Anuj Gupta, Head Commodity & Currency at HDFC Securities told ET, “The recent correction is a good opportunity for investors who have a medium to long term term view on this bullion metal and one should look to invest in it in a staggered manner rather than in one shot”. He suggests Rs 69,000-Rs 69,500 levels as favourable entry points as sees room for further upside with prices expected to hit Rs 80,000-Rs 85,000 by next Akshaya Tritiya.","Gold has shown remarkable performance since the previous Akshaya Tritiya, which occurred on April 22, 2023, delivering a substantial 16% return.

Maternity Insurance: Rising cost of having baby pushes insurance demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rising-cost-of-having-baby-pushes-insurance-demand/articleshow/110021392.cms,"MUMBAI: The rising cost of having a baby in India is driving demand for health insurance plans with maternity benefits . The sale of such policies, which can be purchased up to 9 months before childbirth, is growing 80% annually, data from online distributor PolicyBazaar showed.Though claims are almost certain under such policies due to planned parenthood, insurers are viewing them as an acquisition tool for new customers, and some are offsetting costs by requiring long-term premium payments.“Most corporate policies limit maternity coverage to Rs 50,000 per policy. However, the cost can vary between Rs 50,000 and Rs 3 lakh, depending on the city and whether the delivery is a C-section one. This is prompting many young people to buy maternity cover,” said Amit Chhabra, PolicyBazaar’s chief business officer (health). According to him, rising costs are also pushing those without corporate coverage to look at maternity benefits.Currently, around 12% of health policies being sold include maternity benefits, PolicyBazaar data showed, which is significant considering that only those in the 25-35 age group typically buy this cover.“Maternity covers are generally provided as an add-on with a regular family health insurance plan. Maternity insurance typically has a waiting period that may range from 9 months to 3 years,” said Priya Deshmukh, head of health products, operations and services at ICICI Lombard General Insurance.Some insurers are seeing over half of the maternity claims involve C-section deliveries — more so in tier-1 cities.According to Deshmukh, women are opting for motherhood at a comparatively later age. “The average maternity age has increased from 26-27 years to 32-33 years in the last few years. The increased maternity age has caused an increase in complications during pregnancies,” she said. Deshmukh added that the rise in C-sections could be attributed to factors such as educated women living in urban areas, a falling pain threshold, higher compensation for C-sections from a patient’s perspective, and higher convenience from a doctor’s view.Reliance General Insurance cited studies that show C-section deliveries in India have increased to 21.5% in 2021 from 17.2% in 2016. Rakesh Jain, CEO, Reliance General Insurance said many customers are opting for its ‘Infinity + Mother & Child Care’ rider. “This feature provides a maternity cover with a standard waiting period of 2 years, but the customer can opt for a year too. It also covers vaccination expenses up to Rs 1 lakh, over and above the sum insured,” he said.According to PolicyBazaar, 78% of policies with maternity benefits are purchased by men for their spouses.","The sale of such policies is growing 80% annually, data from online distributor PolicyBazaar showed.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-focuses-on-youth-and-women-entrepreneurship/articleshow/107357923.cms,"By

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Govt needs to create a buffer of chana for market intervention to keep prices under check .The decision comes as the mandi prices are ruling high because of a dip in actual production as compared to govt’s estimates. The two agencies will procure chana from the farmers under the minimum assured procurement price (MAPP) mechanism or dynamic buffer procurement price derived based on average prices of last three days across all the three procuring states.The same formula was applied for tur procurement last year. Nafed and NCCF are likely to start procurement of chana under the price stabilisation fund (PSF) next week and MAPP is fixed across three states in the range of Rs 5,900– Rs 6,035 per quintal against the MSP of Rs 5,440 a quintal for the current season. The prices would be revised based on the prevalent market prices.Currently, these two agencies are unable to procure under price support scheme because of higher prevailing market prices of chana. Mandi prices are ruling in the range of Rs 5,800–Rs 6,000 per quintal.As per agriculture ministry estimate, chana production in 2023-24 crop year (July-June) is estimated at 122 lakh tonne, marginally lower than previous year.

In the crypto landscape, strategic partnerships and innovative technologies are setting new standards. Chainlink’s collaboration with RD Technologies aims to bolster the security and efficiency of the HKD stablecoin, making cross-border transactions more reliable and cost-effective.Meanwhile, Solana demonstrates robust market resilience, signalling the potential for a bullish surge.Amid these advancements, BlockDAG emerges as a game-changer with its hybrid technology blending Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and blockchain security. The introduction of the X1 Mobile Mining App not only simplifies crypto mining but also positions BlockDAG as one of the leaders in scalable and user-friendly crypto solutions.RD Technologies is set to boost the security and efficiency of its HKD-backed stablecoin, HKDR, through a new partnership with Chainlink. This collaboration will incorporate Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Proof of Reserve, enhancing the stablecoin’s reliability for cross-border transactions. This strategic move is expected to reduce transaction costs and times, which are typically high with conventional payment methods due to exchange rates and processing delays. Businesses using HKDR will benefit from stable and predictable transactions, avoiding potential losses from currency fluctuations. Chainlink’s recent performance has shown promise, with a 9% increase in value over the past week, despite short-term market fluctuations, highlighting its potential as a solid long-term investment in the crypto landscape.Solana is on the brink of a bullish breakout after a recent price correction. Despite a 9% drop and failing to breach the $160 resistance, investor confidence remains high, as evidenced by an increase in staked SOL, totalling around $490 million. This significant staking activity suggests a strong belief in Solana’s upward potential, reducing sell pressure and setting the stage for potential price gains.Technical indicators are optimistic, predicting that Solana Price might soon surpass $200, with a chance to hit $258 if it breaks key resistance levels.

Wall Street in turmoil: Banker’s sudden death at 35 sparks outrage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wall-street-in-turmoil-bankers-sudden-death-at-35-sparks-outrage/articleshow/110010517.cms,"NEW DELHI: The recent death of Leo Lukenas III , a Bank of America associate and former Green Beret, has ignited a firestorm of controversy over the grueling work conditions on Wall Street , particularly the long work weeks endured by many in the finance industry . Lukenas, who was involved in a $2 billion merger just days before his passing, reportedly worked approximately 100 hours per week leading up to the completion of the deal.His death from ""acute coronary artery thrombus"" at the age of 35 has sparked intense debate and anger among his peers and the wider community.The reaction on Wall Street has been swift and severe, with many pointing fingers at the demanding work culture prevalent in many financial institutions, including Bank of America. Discussions among employees about a potential walkout have been reported, as staff consider drastic measures to call for better working conditions. This potential action is underscored by a growing sentiment that the health and well-being of employees are being sacrificed for profit, a New York Post report said.Social media platforms and financial forums like Wall Street Oasis have become battlegrounds for discussions about the industry's work ethics. A post outlining demands for improved employee welfare, including capping work hours and guaranteeing weekends off, has gained significant traction with over 450 comments supporting the call for change.Despite the outcry, Bank of America has not announced any plans to investigate the circumstances leading to Lukenas’s death or to review its work policies. A spokesperson from the bank expressed condolences but noted that there would be no action taken against Gary Howe, Lukenas’s supervisor, nor any inquiries into the allegations of forced long work hours.As Wall Street faces renewed scrutiny over its work practices, the situation at Bank of America may serve as a pivotal moment for reform in the industry, echoing past instances where tragedies led to changes in workplace policies across financial institutions.","Leo Lukenas III, a Bank of America associate and former Green Beret, died from ""acute coronary artery thrombus"" at the age of 35.

From crypto king to prison inmate: Inside details of Sam Bankman-Fried's jail life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-crypto-king-to-prison-inmate-inside-details-of-sam-bankman-frieds-jail-life/articleshow/110010145.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sam Bankman-Fried , the former cryptocurrency mogul and founder of the now-defunct FTX exchange , has opened up about his daily life and legal battles in his first detailed interview since his imprisonment. Conducted from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he is serving a 25-year sentence , Bankman-Fried revealed to Puck News' William D Cohan that he lives in a large, dormitory-style room with 35 other inmates, surviving mainly on beans and rice from the commissary.This staple diet has turned rice into an unexpected form of currency within the prison walls, with inmates using it to barter for other goods.During the interview, which had to be conducted without the aid of recording devices or notes due to prison regulations, Bankman-Fried discussed his adaptation to prison life. He described a routine that includes less engagement with the available television sets and more time spent on a tablet playing games or watching movies. Notably thinner, having lost approximately 25 pounds, he commented on the vegan meals provided, which he and other inmates find inedible, even comparing their smell to ""shit."" Despite the harsh conditions, he said he has not experienced abuse and does not fear for his personal safety, though he did mention being pestered by other inmates for his rice at night, an Insider report said.Bankman-Fried also reiterated his stance on the legal proceedings, insisting on his innocence and expressing his intentions to appeal his conviction on several counts including wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy. These charges stem from allegations that he misappropriated billions of dollars of FTX customer funds—a scandal that US Attorney Damian Williams labeled as one of the largest financial frauds in American history. As Bankman-Fried navigates these challenges, he remains a central figure in ongoing discussions about the regulation and risks associated with cryptocurrency markets.","Sam Bankman-Fried has opened up about his daily life and legal battles in his first detailed interview since his imprisonment.

Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is one of the hottest cryptocurrencies of May 2024.The multichain meme coin has become a sensation in a brief time. In less than a month of the presale launch, Dogeverse has secured more than $13M. The presale gained strength after its Solana integration .The final stage of the presale is now live. Dogeverse is hosting one of the most successful presales of 2024 now.Due to the escalating demand for the token, the presale is expected to sell out ahead of schedule.Investors and traders are pouring millions into the presale. In fact, the soft cap allocation of 200 billion tokens was sold out instantly. Within days of its launch, the multichain meme coin was viral. It showed resilience even during the broader market downturns of April.The large growth potential of the project is further made evident by the Dogeverse Twitter community that was launched just last month. It has now grown to 13.9K members.What’s behind the growing interest in the project?Much of Dogeverse’s viral growth has to do with its multichain foundation. The largely unexplored feature sets the project apart from dog coins.Dogeverse is launching on six top blockchains – Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, and Base.Once the presale ends, investors will have to acquire the token from popular crypto exchanges. But if the presale FOMO is any indication, a turbocharged debut launch is awaiting the token. Waiting until the exchange launches might prove expensive for investors.Both degens and whales are securing $DOGEVERSE tokens in large numbers now to avoid the hefty price tag later.The meme coin market is teeming with hundreds of different projects.But they are often knockoffs of popular ones like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe. While this quick strategy helps them gain immediate attention, it doesn’t serve projects aiming for long-term relevance.That explains why most meme coins are short-living. The lack of focus on building a robust meme coin foundation renders them fleeting.Establishing relevance is crucial for long-term sustainability in a crowded space.This understanding is at the core of Dogeverse.It stands out due to its deep-rooted multichain infrastructure that is building an interconnected universe for doge enthusiasts. It blends community, rewards, and creativity.Dogeverse is a logical investment from a speculative standpoint as well.Given that four of the top five meme coins are dog-themed, there is growing hype around Dogeverse Celebrities like Elon Musk, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and musicians Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg are fans of dog coins, which adds to the buzz.Cosmo the Doge is journeying across Dogeverse.Cosmo’s goal is to help meme coin investors tap into the unique advantages of different blockchains. For example, the project's availability on the world's top six blockchains offers high flexibility, as users can access the token on any of these networks.Cosmo's ability to ""hyperjump"" between blockchains facilitates seamless transactions with minimal fees, enabling investors to optimise returns.Dogeverse also unlocks hot crypto trends like Solana meme coins with its multichain infrastructure. Solana's robust digital economy with a massive total value locked (TVL) and a large user base is behind the craze.Trending meme coins such as Dogwifhat, Bonk, MEW, and Slerf climbed the charts in 2024, capitalising on their Solana label.The presence on six hot networks aligns Dogeverse with more blockchain-based meme coin trends.The Dogeverse presale has raised $13M+ so far. The final presale stage is now underway, offering investors the last chance to buy the token for a fixed discounted price of $0.00031 per unit.Staking rewards with up to 71% APY accompany presale investments.Market forces will dictate the token price after the presale. Dogeverse has introduced staking on Ethereum to encourage early backers. The promise of passive income helps reduce early sell-offs and supports the token's long-term price stability.The growing hype surrounding the chain-hopping Cosmo indicates that Dogeverse is moving toward a turbocharged launch. The technical prowess and strong community backing, on the other hand, strengthen its sustainability.The multichain token’s growing popularity shows that it has the potential to make the list of top meme coins this year.","Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is one of the hottest cryptocurrencies of May 2024.

Chinese tech executive fired after endorsing toxic work culture on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-tech-executive-fired-after-endorsing-toxic-work-culture-on-social-media/articleshow/110002210.cms,"NEW DELHI: Qu Jing , the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, China's counterpart to Google, has been ousted following a backlash over her public endorsement of a rigorous workplace culture. Her remarks, which sparked widespread outrage among young workers in China, highlighted deep-seated issues within the tech industry regarding work-life balance and employee treatment .As per a CNN report, Qu Jing came under fire after a series of videos posted on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, revealed her stringent management style and lack of empathy towards employees' personal circumstances. In one notable video, Qu rebuked an employee for not wanting to undertake a 50-day business trip during strict Covid-19 travel restrictions, stating, ""Why should I take my employee’s family into consideration? I’m not her mother-in-law.""Her blunt comments about her personal sacrifices, such as forgetting her elder son's birthday due to work commitments, and demanding employees to be available 24/7, intensified the public outcry. ""If you work in public relations, don’t expect weekends off,"" she asserted in another video, emphasizing the relentless demands placed on her team.The backlash was swift and fierce, with netizens and media pundits criticizing Qu for promoting an unhealthy work environment synonymous with the controversial ""996"" working hour system—9 am to 9 pm, six days a week—previously endorsed by figures like Alibaba’s Jack Ma. Ivy Yang, a tech analyst, observed, ""A lot of what she said really struck a nerve, because people feel that in their own workplaces very often. The fact that she said it in a way that’s so direct and in your face, it just generated this kind of emotional response.""Following the controversy, Qu was compelled to remove her executive title from her Douyin account and issued an apology on WeChat, acknowledging the insensitivity of her remarks: “I have carefully read all the opinions and comments from various platforms, and many criticisms are very pertinent. I deeply reflect on and humbly accept them.”The incident has reignited discussions about work culture in China's tech industry, which has been notorious for its demanding expectations and the glorification of overwork. This sector has faced increasing scrutiny as employees push back against the long-standing norms of excessive work hours and the lack of work-life balance.Baidu has not made an official statement regarding Qu's departure, and efforts to get comments from the company remained unanswered as of Thursday night. Qu’s videos have since been removed from Douyin, reflecting the severity of the backlash and the ongoing debate over corporate culture in one of the world's most dynamic technological hubs.","Qu Jing, the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, China's counterpart to Google, has been ousted following a backlash over her public endorsement of a rigorous workplace culture.

It would also mark a third consecutive quarter of profit growth ""Foxconn obviously is putting a lot of effort into its AI servers. Targeted clients include HP and Dell,"" said Allen Huang, a vice president at Mega International Investment Service.Analysts at KGI Securities wrote in a client note that they expected the first quarter to be Foxconn's sales trough for the year, with AI cloud server sales continuing to see huge demand.""As for 2025, we expect cloud sales to remain the major sales and earnings growth driver,"" they added.Underscoring Foxconn's rosy prospects, April sales hit a record high for the month and the company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry, has said it expects second-quarter revenue to grow year on year.

South Korea's Kospi declined 1.1% to 2,715.95.Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1% to 18,504.56, while the Shanghai Composite surged 0.7% to 3,150.51.Price data expected Saturday are being watched to see if the economy might be regaining momentum.""Despite efforts, China has grappled with consumer deflation for about a year, presenting a formidable challenge that Beijing has yet to overcome,"" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 0.5% to 5,214.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8% to 39,387.76, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.3%, to 16,346.26.A report showing a pickup in layoffs helped to support the market . The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.That could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation.Equinix jumped 11.5% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. Earlier, an investment firm had accused it of ""major accounting manipulation.""Yeti Holdings rose 12.8% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected thanks to stronger sales for its drinkware and coolers and equipment.Cheesecake Factory gained 6.2% after topping expectations for profit. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings by big food and drink companies about how much pressure their customers, particularly lower-income ones, are feeling.Airbnb sank 6.9% despite topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of what analysts expected. It said an earlier Easter pulled more of its business this year into the first quarter from the second quarter.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.45% from 4.50% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.81% from 4.84% late Wednesday.A smooth auction of 30-year Treasury bonds helped to keep yields stable.Treasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could manage to avoid being either too hot or too cold.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 56 cents to $79.82 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Tim Cook can't run Apple forever. Who's next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tim-cook-cant-run-apple-forever-whos-next/articleshow/109990265.cms,"Tim Cook has transformed Apple since taking over as CEO from Steve Jobs in 2011, introducing new product categories (the smartwatch), pushing into new businesses (streaming video), and making an audacious attempt to take a new type of computing (mixed reality) mainstream. He's served for far longer than the average Fortune 500 CEO, and, at 63, is older than many of his peers.But if it seems like a logical time for Cook to start planning for someone else to shape Apple's next chapter, the situation is complicated by the lack of someone who's both ready immediately and likely to be a long-term successor.Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein who's covered Apple for two decades, says succession has become a topic among investors. ""You look down the list of executives, and it's really not clear how this all pans out,"" he says. ""You wonder why there hasn't been more transparency and exposure for the next leaders. It raises a broader question: Does Apple have a comprehensive and deliberate set of succession plans?""Several people familiar with Apple's inner workings recently discussed the issue with Bloomberg Businessweek, requesting anonymity to speak about the sensitive subject. If Cook were to step down soon, these people say, he would almost assuredly be replaced by COO Jeff Williams , who emerged as the top candidate to be Cook's successor a few years ago. In 2015, Cook named Williams Apple's first COO since Cook himself held that role under Jobs. That same year, Williams shepherded the first major new product in the Cook era, the Apple Watch, to market. And, four years later, he replaced Ive as the head of hardware and software design. But Williams, who's 61 this year, is only two years Cook's junior, and company insiders say they think it's now unlikely he'll be the new long-term chief.People within Apple say the most likely successor would be John Ternus , the hardware engineering chief. In a company whose success has always come from building category-defining gadgets, the ascension of a hardware engineering expert to the CEO job would seem logical. Ternus, who's not yet 50, would also be more likely than other members of the executive team to stick around for a long time, potentially providing another decade or more of Cook-esque stability.""He has a lot of managerial characteristics like Tim."" Christopher Stringer, a former top Apple hardware designer, called Ternus a ""trustworthy hand"" who's ""never failed with any role he's been elevated to."" Eddy Cue, the Apple executive known as Cook's closest confidant, has privately told colleagues that Ternus should be the next CEO, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Other names that come up include Craig Federighi, head of software engineering, a recognizable face among Apple's biggest fans who's known internally to be conversant on corporate issues well outside of his purview, and Deirdre O'Brien, its head of retail and a Cook confidant, according to one former executive. People close to the company consider them unlikely successors.","Tim Cook has transformed Apple since taking over as CEO from Steve Jobs in 2011.

Maruti Suzuki to stay focused on hatchbacks alongside SUVs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/maruti-suzuki-to-stay-focused-on-hatchbacks-alongside-suvs/articleshow/109985479.cms,"KOLKATA: Even as other automakers shift their entire focus on the fast-expanding sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment, Maruti Suzuki on Thursday reiterated its commitment to the hatchback segment as well and said this segment would continue to grow in absolute numbers as India advances towards becoming a developed economy by 2047.Arguing in favour of hatchbacks when every automaker has turned away from introducing hatchbacks and is launching only SUVs, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd managing director and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi said small cars would remain relevant in India as the market expands and more people purchase cars.Takeuchi was speaking at the launch of the fourth generation Swift, a premium hatchback that the company introduced in 2005 and is still going strong. Since then, 6.5 million units of Swift has been sold in 169 countries with India contributing to 46% or 3 million sales followed by 1.2 million in Europe and 70,000 in Japan.Takeuchi also pointed to the shift within the hatchback segment with premium hatchbacks grabbing a dominant share of the pie. ""At present, 60% of hatchbacks sold in the country are premium ones. Maruti's market share in the premium hatchback segment is 62%,"" he said.While Maruti has multiple offerings in the premium hatch segment including Baleno, Fronx (that is is another iteration of Baleno), Swift and Ignis, only Hyundai Motor with i20, Tata Motors with Altroz and Toyota Kirloskar with Glanza and Taizor are present in this segment. Of these, the Toyota cars are rebadged Maruti Suzuki products.Takeuchi said the company had invested Rs 1,450 crore in the 4th generation Swift, including engine and sheet metal dice at Suzuki Motors Gujarat plant where it will be manufactured for both India and overseas markets.""The first million Swift cars were sold in eight years. It took five years to sell the second million. The car has not only stood the test of time but shaped a better legacy,"" said Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (marketing and sales) at Maruti Suzuki.The Swift had killed the Hyundai Getz, a premium hatch launched by the Korean company just before Maruti Suzuki launched the Swift inspired by the legendary Hayabusa motorcycle. Though several automakers had tried to launch competing products, none other than Hyundai i20 had succeeded in raking in the numbers.","Maruti Suzuki India Ltd managing director and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi said small cars would remain relevant in India. 6.5 million units of Swift has been sold in 169 countries with India contributing to 46% or 3 million sales.

This led to the leak of the personal data records of more than 300,000 Line users and others.Although the guidance from Japan's internal affairs and communications ministry about the data leak did not explicitly mention a sell-down, it did direct LY Corp to ""review the relationship where the outsourced company has a significant degree of capital control"" referring to Naver.LY Corp is also terminating outsourcing to Naver in response to Japan's guidance, SoftBank said in a presentation.South Korea's government said last month it is consulting with Naver and there should be no discriminatory measures against Korean companies. Historical tensions had led to trade disputes between Japan and South Korea from 2019 until last year, but the current administrations are mending ties.Japan lifted export curbs on high-tech materials to South Korea in March 2023 and South Korea's industry minister met his Japanese counterpart for the first time in six years last month.After merging Line with Yahoo Japan in 2019, Naver and SoftBank now hold 50% each in the joint venture which controls LY Corp, through a 65% stake, SoftBank documents show.LY Corp said on its website that more than 95 million monthly active users used Line in Japan as of March last year, and it had another 83 million users in Thailand, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Line was launched in 2011.LY Corp's market capitalization was about 2.77 trillion yen ($17.77 billion) on Thursday.","SoftBank CEO Junichi Miyakawa said on Thursday that the Japanese telecommunications firm is in talks with South Korea's Naver.
