"Model heat action plan calls for medium, long-term measures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/model-heat-action-plan-calls-for-medium-long-term-measures/articleshow/109351564.cms,"Hyperlocal warning systems , vulnerability mapping of cities, and climate-resilient housing policies are some of the measures recommended by a “model heat action plan” commissioned by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Researchers recently submitted the model plan which aims to guide states and cities in formulating local action plans in the face of rising extreme heat.Such heat action plans (HAPs) have proliferated in recent years, however assessments have found they vary widely in quality and implementation.Yet these plans will become more important with climate change expected to increase the number and duration of heatwaves in the coming decades.Studies project heatwaves in India could reach the survivability limit by 2050, with significant impacts on labour productivity and health. Cities are especially at risk as heat-absorbing concrete buildings and roads raise local temperatures.“Urban areas have become warmer and more complex,” says model plan author Rajashree Kotharkar, professor of architecture and planning at VNIT in Nagpur who has been studying urban heat for a decade. She adds, “We have a lot of traditional knowledge on how to live with heat, but our lifestyles have changed, and so has our environment.”Kotharkar’s model plan seeks to fill some of the gaps in existing HAPs. Globally and in India, Kotharkar found most plans are crisis-oriented and driven by public health, with less focus on long-term planning or integrating heat action with policies around water or housing.“When we talk about extreme heat, there is no quick fix,” says Kotharkar. “Emergency response is important, but when you have good medium- and long-term policies, the burden on emergency response will reduce.”Many existing plans also treat the city as a “single entity”, however microclimates and socio-economic conditions can vary widely within a large urban area, she notes. In addition, monitoring and evaluation of measures were often missing from these plans.The model plan recommends measures across sectors—public health, epidemiology, meteorology and urban planning—and over different time frames. “Heat has an impact on economy, energy, health, housing. So the response also has to be multisectoral,”says Kotharkar.An important consideration is to ensure solutions do not have a negative impact on environment. Air conditioners, for instance, add to the carbon emissions that are causing global warming. Their use is expected to rise nine-fold in India by mid-century.In the immediate to short-term, the plan recommends that cities implement emergency response measures including planning heat warning and public communication systems, and preparing health and civic infrastructure for the impact of heatwaves on people.One key recommendation is that urban bodies conduct rapid vulnerability assessments to identify ward-level risk. For instance, areas with high population density, low vegetation, or slum housing are more at risk. “If you live in a tin-roof home, you are more exposed to heat stress,” Kotharkar says, adding cities should do more extensive risk mapping exercises over time.In the medium-term, the plan urges cities to identify local heat thresholds to improve alert systems. The current heat alert system is based on broad temperature thresholds—37°C for coastal areas and 40°C for plains, for example. But some cities have begun to set their own thresholds based on local mortality data. Ahmedabad, for instance, issues its first alert at 41°C—the point at which deaths begin to climb, as per data. For coastal cities, humidity might be as important a factor as temperature, and needs to be factored into the heat thresholds.“Studies have to be conducted by local or regional epidemiologists and meteorological departments to identify local thresholds and customise alerts,” says Kotharkar, adding that while mortality data is often used to set heat risk thresholds, morbidity or illness data would be better to use, if available.In the long-run, combating heat is about better urban planning, the model suggests. That means investing in buildings that are designed to reduce energy consumption, as well as in expanding public transport and urban greenery, says Kotharkar. While some cities already have tree planting programmes, they are often not carried out scientifically in terms of planting the right trees and in the right places, she notes.“Urban planning matters because it is the built environment that directly affects the microclimate of the city,” she says.","Cities are especially at risk as heat-absorbing concrete buildings and roads raise local temperatures. Heatwaves in India could reach the survivability limit by 2050. Air conditioners, for instance, add to the carbon emissions that are causing global warming.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109351649,imgsize-932248,width-400,resizemode-4/109351649.jpg"

'Over a fifth of our flyers to & from India; crucial market for us': Abu Dhabi's Zayed International Airport CEO Elena Sorlini,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-a-fifth-of-our-flyers-to-from-india-crucial-market-for-us-abu-dhabi-airport-ceo-elena-sorlini/articleshow/109350800.cms,"What is the current outlook for the Indian market in terms of passenger traffic at Zayed International Airport?

Given the strength of Emirates and Dubai’s DXB, how do you plan to attract more India travellers?

What is the direct connectivity between India and AUH like? How is it growing?

How has Zayed International Airport sustained its growth trajectory, particularly in terms of passenger throughput, amidst industry dynamics and changing market conditions?

Are there any plans to attract more Indian tourists and strengthen economic bonds between India and the United Arab Emirates through strategic partnerships ensuring seamless travel experiences and competitive pricing?

NEW DELHI: Over the years, Emirates and its hub Dubai International Airport (DXB) have emerged as the single biggest transit point for Indian globetrotters outside of India. Now Dubai’s neighbouring Abu Dhabi is also drawing up major plans for its Zayed International Airport (AUH) as its home airline Etihad also firms up growth plans.Being the only airport in the region to offer US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) pre-clearance, it can be a big draw to attract America-bound flyers as Etihad ramps up operations.Zayed International Airport CEO Elena Sorlini told TOI traffic to and from India accounts for over a fifth (21%) of all footfalls at AUH. While 48 lakh people travelled to and from India last year, this number is expected to rise to 52 lakh in 2024. In a conversation with TOI, Sorlini details the plans AUH to attract more Indian flyers. Excerpts:That is very promising, supported by significant developments and projections. With the latest improvements Zayed International Airport that is capable of accommodating up to 4.5 crore passengers annually has a substantial opportunity to attract more passengers, particularly from high-growth markets like India.Notably, in 2023, approximately 48 lakh passengers traveled to and from India, highlighting the market’s significance, with this number expected to increase to 52 lakh in 2024.We are committed to re-imagining the airport experience to meet the growing tourism demand in Abu Dhabi and solidify its status as a key hub for trade and commerce.Key features such as state-of-the-art technology for expedited screenings, expansive retail and food & beverage offerings, premium services, and curated cultural experiences underscore our dedication to enhancing the traveller experience. Given that India constitutes 21% of all passengers traveling to or from Abu Dhabi, it remains a crucial market for us. As we continue to prioritise the needs of Indian travelers and invest in infrastructure and services tailored to their preferences, we anticipate sustained growth and further consolidation of our position as a preferred hub for Indian passengers traveling to and from Abu Dhabi.Over recent years, there has been notable progress in traveler activity between Abu Dhabi and India, underscoring a burgeoning connection between the two regions. In 2023, approximately 48 lakh passengers traveled to and from India, constituting 21% of all travelers at Abu Dhabi Airport and solidifying India’s position as our primary market. Looking forward to 2024, we anticipate further growth, with projected passenger numbers reaching 52 lakh, indicative of a flourishing exchange between the two locations. To sustain this momentum and enhance traveler convenience, we have actively expanded direct flight connections to various Indian metropolises, ensuring greater accessibility and streamlined transit procedures for our valued passengers.There has been a significant expansion in direct flight connections linking major Indian metropolitan centers with Abu Dhabi, aimed at facilitating smoother transit processes and reducing inconveniences associated with layovers.In 2023, we introduced new direct links to Goa, Kolkata, and Lucknow, enhancing accessibility for passengers traveling between India and Abu Dhabi.Looking ahead to 2024, we are delighted to announce the launch of a new route to Jaipur, operated by Etihad Airways, commencing in June with four weekly flights. These expansions not only improve connectivity but also contribute to a more seamless travel experience for our valued passengers. Additionally, to further enhance the layover experience, Zayed International Airport provides access to amenities such as an airside hotel with 138 rooms, 5 lounges and 163 outlets for passengers to shop and eat. Finally, Zayed International Airport distinguishes itself from the competition as the only airport in the region - and one of only 15 airports worldwide- to provide US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Preclearance, allowing travelers to bypass inspection lines upon arrival in the U.S. and further ensuring a hassle-free journey for travelers.Zayed International Airport has sustained its growth trajectory, especially in terms of passenger throughput, by implementing strategic initiatives amidst evolving industry dynamics and changing market conditions.

SC hears pleas on 100% verification of votes: Petitioners submit three suggestions to ensure secure VVPAT system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-can-go-back-to-paper-ballots-supreme-court-discusses-issues-with-vvpat-system/articleshow/109343118.cms,"'European examples don't work here'

Three suggestions

Why the hearing is significant

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday began hearing on a bunch of petitions seeking 100% verification by the voters of votes cast by them in Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT).VVPAT is a system that allows voters to verify if their vote has been cast correctly and counted towards the candidate they intended to support.The VVPAT produces a paper slip that is securely stored and can be accessed in case of any disputes or discrepancies. In light of the concerns and doubts raised by the opposition regarding EVM , petitions were filed demanding the cross-verification of each vote cast.The top court heard arguments by the petitioners who highlighted concerns regarding EVMs and VVPAT system .Prashant Bhushan, counsel for one of the petitioners, contended that the flash memory chip inside an EVM is programmable and a malicious programme can be installed on the machine. ""We aren’t saying they are manipulated or have been. We are saying they can be manipulated as both EVM and VVPAT has two kinds of chips,"" he said.Bhushan then contended that most European countries had gone back to paper ballot after trying out EVMs. ""In fact, a German court has said that EVMs cannot be trusted ... even the Indian top court said there must be a paper trail because EVM cannot be trusted, which is why we have VVPAT,"" said the advocate.The court, however, took exception to the argument.""The population of my home state of West Bengal is more than that of Germany ... European examples don't work here. We need to trust someone. Don't try to bring down the system like this,"" Justice Dipankar Datta said.Justice Sanjiv Khanna, meanwhile, said India has 97 registered voters. ""We are in our 60s. We all know what happened when there were ballot papers. You may have, but we have not forgotten,"" Justice Khanna said.Asked by the court what the petitioners want to ensure fair elections, Bhushan said: ""Everything that can protect the system. First paper slip, and then give VVPAT slips to the voter to see it is exactly as he voted for and he can put in the ballot box. In 2017, the redesigned the VVPAT machines, which should have a transparent glass. In 2017, it was changed to opaque mirrored glass, where you can’t see unless a light is lit inside the box, you can’t even see the slip cut and go inside the box. We want the glass to be made transparent.""Bhushan also highlighted that random verification as is being done currently is ""meaningless"".""Only 5 machines per assembly constituency are being scrutinised. The percentage of VVPAT scrutiny is 0.00185%. Not even 1% ... it must be close to 50% scrutiny,"" the senior advocate said, adding: ""At least 50% verification is needed to restore the confidence"".Currently, the VVPAT paper slips of only five randomly selected EVMs in each assembly constituency or assembly segment within a parliamentary constituency undergo physical verification. However, the petitions filed by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and activist Arun Kumar Agarwal seek to change this practice. Agarwal's petition specifically calls for the counting of all VVPAT slips to ensure the integrity of the voting process.On April 1, the court had requested responses from both the Election Commission of India and the Centre regarding Agarwal's petition. The outcome of these petitions could potentially lead to significant changes in the way votes are verified and counted in future elections, with the aim of enhancing transparency and addressing the concerns raised by various political parties and activists.The next hearing on the matter will be on Thursday.",The Supreme Court on Tuesday began hearing on a bunch of petitions seeking 100% verification by the voters of votes cast by them.

Isro achieves breakthrough with lightweight carbon-carbon rocket engine nozzle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-achieves-breakthrough-with-lightweight-carbon-carbon-rocket-engine-nozzle/articleshow/109339599.cms,"BENGALURU: In what it describes as a significant advancement, the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) Tuesday said it has successfully developed a lightweight Carbon-Carbon (C-C) nozzle for rocket engines, marking a breakthrough in rocket engine technology.This innovation, accomplished by the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), promises to enhance the vital parameters of rocket engines, including thrust levels, specific impulse, and thrust-to-weight ratios, thereby boosting the payload capacity of launch vehicles.VSSC has leveraged advanced materials like Carbon-Carbon (C-C) Composites to create a nozzle divergent that offers exceptional properties, Isro said.""...Utilising processes such as carbonisation of green composites, chemical vapour infiltration, and high-temperature treatment, VSSC has produced a nozzle with low density, high specific strength, and excellent stiffness, capable of retaining mechanical properties even at elevated temperatures,"" Isro said.A key feature of the C-C nozzle is its special anti-oxidation coating of silicon carbide, which extends its operational limits in oxidising environments. This innovation not only reduces thermally induced stresses but also enhances corrosion resistance, allowing for extended operational temperature limits in hostile environments.The potential impact of this development is significant, particularly for Isro's workhorse launcher, the PolarSatellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).The PS4, the fourth stage of the PSLV, currently employs twin engines with nozzles made from Columbium alloy. However, by replacing these metallic divergent nozzles with C-C counterparts, a mass reduction of approximately 67% can be achieved.This substitution is projected to increase the payload capability of the PSLV by 15kg, a notable enhancement for space missions.The successful testing of the C-C nozzle divergent marked a major milestone for Isro.""On March 19, a 60-second hot test was conducted at the High-Altitude Test (HAT) facility in ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Mahendragiri, confirming the system's performance and hardware integrity. Subsequent tests, including a 200-second hot test on April 2, 2024, further validated the nozzle's capabilities, with temperatures reaching 1216K, matching predictions,"" Isro added.The collaborative effort involved the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) at Valiamala, which designed and configured the test, and IPRC, Mahendragiri, which conducted the instrumentation and execution of the tests at their HAT facility.","Isro has successfully developed a lightweight Carbon-Carbon (C-C) nozzle for rocket engines.

'Dry promotion': New job trend causing concern among employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dry-promotion-new-job-trend-causing-concern-among-employees/articleshow/109314178.cms,"NEW DELHI: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the post-pandemic years, has pushed big multinationals and startups to rejig their work structure in accordance with the evolving trends, one such step being the ever-despised layoffs.While layoffs continue to serve as grim reminders about the flaky global job market, a new phenomenon called "" dry promotion "" has become a part of corporate corridor discussions.Dry promotion means elevating an employee's position in the company without a monetary hike. This implies a change in title, more workload, and increased responsibility without a raise in salary.Compensation consultant Pearl Meyer 's recent report has revealed that more than 13% of employers chose to give their employees new job titles instead of money. This number was only 8% in 2018, reported the Wall Street Journal.Also, a recent survey conducted by Mercer, a benefits-advisory firm, involving 900 companies revealed a shift in the allocation of salary budgets for promotions in 2024 compared to the previous year.The data indicates a decreasing trend in promotion-related hikes, signaling a potential impact on employee satisfaction.Experts see this change as a reflection of the weakening bargaining power of the average worker. The current scenario, characterized bycost-cutting measures , has led to a rise in dry promotions, where employees are given added responsibilities without a corresponding increase in compensation.This shift contrasts with past practices of offering raises to retain staff during labor shortages.""A promotion with no salary increase in not a promotion. It is actually a demotion because you are being required to do more or have more responsibility without getting compensated for it. If your company is doing this, it's time to look for another job,"" wrote a user on Reddit.In the first two months of 2024, the technology industry has grappled with a wave of layoffs as companies prioritize efficiency over growth in response to challenging market conditions.The job cuts, which began in 2023 with over 250,000 positions eliminated, have continued into the new year. Till March the industry saw around 50,000 roles eliminated across significant tech giants, according to tracking site layoffs.","Dry promotion means elevating an employee's position in the company without a monetary hike.

In an interaction with PTI editors at its headquarters on Monday, Baniwal, a 1989 batch IPS officer, said that he is happy to see inmates, who get employed after spending their jail term.Beniwal, who had a stint of Chandigarh DGP, has been posted as Tihar DG since November 2022.Replying to a question over jail reforms during his tenure in Tihar, Baniwal said, ""We have started skill development programme with the help of Urban Development Ministry inside the prisons. Under this programme, around 700 inmates have got the job in hotel industry and 1,200 are getting training to get the job in hospitals.""According to jail officials, an infrastructure is provided inside the prisons for training under-trial prisoners (UTP). The programme was launched in early 2023.Baniwal said skilling and empowering inmates is something that makes them worth.""I saw the smile and twinkle in their eyes when they got their certificates and offer letters to work outside,"" he said.Replying to a question on overcrowding in Tihar jail, which has been witnessing 20,000 inmates against its sanctioned strength of 10,000, Baniwal said that making more jail is not a solution.Delhi has three prison complexes -- Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli -- and all of them comprise central jails.May be we can look for other options or better ways of punishing, at least who are delinquent, he said.Citing an example, he said that a young man was recently caught for stealing Rs 300 in pick pocketing and was brought to Tihar. He stayed here for five months before getting bail.""I am spending Rs 800 per inmate/per day which costs us around Rs 24,000 per month. For that 300 rupees theft punishment I spent your money (exchequer) costing about Rs 1,20,000 in five months. Is it right? That is the question we need to ask,"" Baniwal said.The proposed jail in Narela, Delhi, will cost us about Rs 170 crore for odd 250 inmates, which is an expensive affair, he said.The Tihar prisons chief said the current model provision act of jail does provide the power to put the anklets for tracking the movements of those inmates who are released on furlough.""Why can't we do for those who are sent to Tihar like Arnesh Kumar judgement does speak about not to arrest people for certain offences. You can certainly, geofence their movement within their home, court or work places. That way you are keeping the person more productive and less burdened. But this is my personal view, may be I am wrong,"" he said.On privatising the jail like in foreign counties, Baniwal said that despite privatisation, the US jails are pretty overcrowded.""The number of arrest per lakh people in the US is far more than in India. Privatising the jail is all depends on the situation of the country and how it is governed,"" he said.Talking about facilities and infrastructure in jail, Baniwal said under ""correctional administration"", the officials work very hard to change inmate's emotional footprint and mental vibrations.""We run spirituality courses, meditation and targetted exercises for inmates, where they are dragged by force but by end with guilts what the did in the past. There are various examples I have where they write about their mistakes and say they will never commit any crime whenever go out of jail,"" he said.""I am planning to start an 'after release care centre' where we will follow them up after they come out,"" he said.Baniwal said the inmates do celebrate every festival and participate in national events inside the prisons so that they can't go away from reality.""We try to normalise their life as much as possible. Many people have no visitor as their family members live far, we have a facility called 'sparsh scheme' where we hug them and give gifts on occasions,"" he said.Baniwal said that he meets the inmates and listens to their problems and also tries to solve them.","Around 700 inmates are employed and 12,00 more are getting training to work in various sectors after coming out of jail, Tihar's Director General (prisons) Sanjay Baniwal said.

"Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex closes below 73,000; Nifty50 near 22,150",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-crash-today-bse-sensex-nifty50-april-16-2024-dalal-street-indian-equities-us-federal-reserve-iran-israel-war-earnings-season-top-reasons/articleshow/109331297.cms,"The investor worries, already influenced by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, were further compounded by the anticipation of a possible postponement in U.S. rate cuts.

Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 are in bear grip: Top 5 reasons

Geopolitical concerns: Global markets were rattled by escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly after Israel's military chief stated, ""there will be a response to Iran's attack on Israel,"" increasing the likelihood of further conflict in the region. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, noted that the uncertainty surrounding the timing and nature of Israel's response could keep markets weak in the near term. Secondly, rising U.S. bond yields are causing concern among investors, as they diminish the chances of the Federal Reserve cutting rates this year. High bond yields are unfavorable for risky assets like equities and may accelerate foreign institutional investor (FII) selling in emerging markets, including India. Furthermore, global markets experienced significant declines, with European stocks plunging in line with selloffs in Asia and on Wall Street. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell over 1.3%, on track for its biggest single-day drop since October. U.S. equity futures also declined following the S&P 500's lowest point in more than a month, driven by strong retail sales data indicating a possible delay in Federal Reserve policy easing. FIIs were net sellers, offloading shares worth Rs 3,268 crore on April 15, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought stocks worth Rs 4,762.93 crore, according to provisional NSE data. DIIs have been net buyers for five consecutive sessions. Lastly, oil prices increased on Tuesday amidst heightened tensions in the Middle East following Israel's military chief's statement that his country would respond to Iran's weekend missile and drone attack, despite calls for restraint from allies. Brent futures for June delivery rose 46 cents, or 0.5%, to $90.56 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures for May delivery increased by 43 cents, or 0.5%, to $85.84 a barrel.

Stock market crash today: Indian equity indices BSE Sensex and Nifty50 experienced a decline for the third day in a row on Tuesday, following the lead of Asian markets. BSE Sensex closed the day at 72,943.68, below the 73,000 level, down 456 points or 0.62%. Nifty50 ended the day at 22,147.90, down 125 points or 0.56%.The investor worries, already influenced by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, were further compounded by the anticipation of a possible postponement in U.S.rate cuts. The BSE Sensex witnessed a decrease of 700 points, with Nifty50 falling below the 22,100 mark. Earlier in the day, total market capitalisation of listed companies on BSE dropped by Rs 1.08 lakh crore to reach Rs 393.4 lakh crore, according to an ET report.In terms of sectors, Nifty IT and Nifty Media experienced the most significant decline, with a decrease ranging between 1-2%.The following are the primary reasons for the selloff:","BSE Sensex and Nifty50 experienced a decline for the third day in a row on Tuesday.

"Model heat action plan calls for medium, long-term measures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/model-heat-action-plan-calls-for-medium-long-term-measures/india/model-heat-action-plan-calls-for-medium-long-term-measures/articleshow/109351564.cms,"Hyperlocal warning systems , vulnerability mapping of cities, and climate-resilient housing policies are some of the measures recommended by a “model heat action plan” commissioned by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Researchers recently submitted the model plan which aims to guide states and cities in formulating local action plans in the face of rising extreme heat.Such heat action plans (HAPs) have proliferated in recent years, however assessments have found they vary widely in quality and implementation.Yet these plans will become more important with climate change expected to increase the number and duration of heatwaves in the coming decades.Studies project heatwaves in India could reach the survivability limit by 2050, with significant impacts on labour productivity and health. Cities are especially at risk as heat-absorbing concrete buildings and roads raise local temperatures.“Urban areas have become warmer and more complex,” says model plan author Rajashree Kotharkar, professor of architecture and planning at VNIT in Nagpur who has been studying urban heat for a decade. She adds, “We have a lot of traditional knowledge on how to live with heat, but our lifestyles have changed, and so has our environment.”Kotharkar’s model plan seeks to fill some of the gaps in existing HAPs. Globally and in India, Kotharkar found most plans are crisis-oriented and driven by public health, with less focus on long-term planning or integrating heat action with policies around water or housing.“When we talk about extreme heat, there is no quick fix,” says Kotharkar. “Emergency response is important, but when you have good medium- and long-term policies, the burden on emergency response will reduce.”Many existing plans also treat the city as a “single entity”, however microclimates and socio-economic conditions can vary widely within a large urban area, she notes. In addition, monitoring and evaluation of measures were often missing from these plans.The model plan recommends measures across sectors—public health, epidemiology, meteorology and urban planning—and over different time frames. “Heat has an impact on economy, energy, health, housing. So the response also has to be multisectoral,”says Kotharkar.An important consideration is to ensure solutions do not have a negative impact on environment. Air conditioners, for instance, add to the carbon emissions that are causing global warming. Their use is expected to rise nine-fold in India by mid-century.In the immediate to short-term, the plan recommends that cities implement emergency response measures including planning heat warning and public communication systems, and preparing health and civic infrastructure for the impact of heatwaves on people.One key recommendation is that urban bodies conduct rapid vulnerability assessments to identify ward-level risk. For instance, areas with high population density, low vegetation, or slum housing are more at risk. “If you live in a tin-roof home, you are more exposed to heat stress,” Kotharkar says, adding cities should do more extensive risk mapping exercises over time.In the medium-term, the plan urges cities to identify local heat thresholds to improve alert systems. The current heat alert system is based on broad temperature thresholds—37°C for coastal areas and 40°C for plains, for example. But some cities have begun to set their own thresholds based on local mortality data. Ahmedabad, for instance, issues its first alert at 41°C—the point at which deaths begin to climb, as per data. For coastal cities, humidity might be as important a factor as temperature, and needs to be factored into the heat thresholds.“Studies have to be conducted by local or regional epidemiologists and meteorological departments to identify local thresholds and customise alerts,” says Kotharkar, adding that while mortality data is often used to set heat risk thresholds, morbidity or illness data would be better to use, if available.In the long-run, combating heat is about better urban planning, the model suggests. That means investing in buildings that are designed to reduce energy consumption, as well as in expanding public transport and urban greenery, says Kotharkar. While some cities already have tree planting programmes, they are often not carried out scientifically in terms of planting the right trees and in the right places, she notes.“Urban planning matters because it is the built environment that directly affects the microclimate of the city,” she says.","Cities are especially at risk as heat-absorbing concrete buildings and roads raise local temperatures. Heatwaves in India could reach the survivability limit by 2050. Air conditioners, for instance, add to the carbon emissions that are causing global warming.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109351649,imgsize-932248,width-400,resizemode-4/109351649.jpg"

"Facing financial pressure, Nasa calls for innovative proposals to bring Mars rocks back sooner, cheaper",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/facing-financial-pressure-nasa-calls-for-innovative-proposals-to-bring-mars-rocks-back-sooner-cheaper/articleshow/109346568.cms,"NEW DELHI: In response to budget cuts and escalating costs, Nasa is reevaluating its ambitious Mars sample return mission , aiming to develop a more feasible and cost-effective approach. The US space agency announced on Monday that it will issue a formal request for proposals to simplify the current project, which has been challenged by technical difficulties and financial overruns.Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson highlighted the urgent need for innovation during a press conference, saying, ""The bottom line is that $11 billion is too expensive, and a 2040 return date is too far away."" He emphasized the importance of finding affordable and timely solutions to bring back the rock samples collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars.The rover, which landed at Mars’ Jezero Crater in 2021, has already collected 24 core samples. These samples are crucial for the search for signs of ancient life on Mars. The original plan, in partnership with the European Space Agency, involved sending a secondary robotic lander to retrieve these samples and launch them into orbit around Mars for a transfer back to Earth. However, an independent review last September criticized the mission for its ""unrealistic budget and schedule expectations.""Facing a reduced budget that prompted significant layoffs at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which oversees the mission, Nelson is now soliciting fresh ideas from across Nasa centers and the aerospace industry. The goal is to ensure that some of the 30-plus expected samples are returned to Earth by the early 2030s for a budget not exceeding $7 billion.Associate Administrator Nicky Fox underscored the technical challenge, saying, ""We’ve never launched from another planet, and that’s actually what makes Mars sample return such a challenging and interesting mission."" She refrained from speculating on how many samples might eventually be returned under the revised plan.This initiative comes as Nasa seeks to balance its budget while maintaining its scientific objectives, including missions to Venus and an exploration of Saturn's moon, Titan. The revamped Mars sample return strategy is expected to be more distributed across the agency to foster a broader range of innovative solutions.As Nasa works to redefine its approach, international competition looms, with China advancing towards its own Mars sample return mission by 2030, potentially positioning it as the first nation to achieve such a feat.(With inputs from agencies)",Nasa is reevaluating its ambitious Mars sample return mission.

Michael Platt: The enigmatic billionaire you've never heard of,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/michael-platt-the-enigmatic-billionaire-youve-never-heard-of/articleshow/109346229.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the bustling heart of London, not far from Victoria Station, stands the unassuming headquarters of BlueCrest Capital Management , the base of operations for Britain's richest man, Michael Platt . Yet, despite his staggering fortune of £14.3 billion, Platt remains a mystery, even to the receptionist at his company's front desk.Michael Platt, 56, has crafted a career that any financier would envy, yet he maintains a level of secrecy that makes him nearly invisible in the public eye.His wealth surpasses well-known British magnates such as petrochemicals titan Sir Jim Ratcliffe (£13.1 billion) and inventor James Dyson (£10.8 billion), placing him at the pinnacle of the UK 's wealth league, a Daily Mail report claimed.Platt's journey began in a middle-class family in Preston, Lancashire, and has led him to an extraordinary level of success. His fortune allows him luxuries such as a Chelsea penthouse with panoramic views of the London Eye and the Shard, a sprawling apartment overlooking Central Park in New York, and even a £120 million superyacht. Despite these lavish assets, Platt's life is one of contrasts, far removed from his humble beginnings.Unlike many hedge funds that thrive on external investments, Platt has turned BlueCrest into a personal investment vehicle primarily for himself, his senior partners, and employees. This unique business model means there are no outside clients to appease, allowing Platt greater freedom in his investment strategies. ""Essentially, we have one client, which is Mike,"" said a former BlueCrest portfolio manager.Platt's aversion to the spotlight is as legendary as his financial acumen. His last major public engagement was over a decade ago, to promote an art show featuring a life-size wax gorilla nailed to a wooden cross. Since then, he has avoided the media, only surfacing inadvertently, such as in a viral taxi video where he jokingly claimed to be the highest-earning person in finance after a night out in New York, the Daily Mail report said.Despite his penchant for privacy , Platt has had his share of regulatory scuffles. BlueCrest has faced significant fines from both the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority over conflicts of interest and other regulatory issues. However, these setbacks have done little to affect his financial or reputational standing, primarily because BlueCrest operates without external clients.Platt's personal life, marked by a quiet divorce and philanthropic gestures, reflects his complex character. He has donated significant sums to the Conservative Party and has invested millions into a private art collection, showcasing his appreciation for contemporary art.In an industry where flamboyance is often the norm, Michael Platt stands out by his absence. He operates on the fringes of financial visibility, embodying the ethos that true power is wielded quietly. As Britain's richest man, he navigates the world in a way that few can – above the fray yet directly in the center of the financial universe.","Michael Platt, 56, has crafted a career that any financier would envy.

Fuel prices in Pakistan likely to hit PKR 8.50 per litre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fuel-prices-in-pakistan-likely-to-hit-pkr-8-50-per-litre/articleshow/109303425.cms,"ISLAMABAD: As the situation in the Middle East continues to unfold, the higher international market is estimated to push up the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel by about Pakistani currency (PKR) 2.50 and PKR 8.50 per litre , respectively, Dawn reported.According to sources, petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) prices experienced a rise of approximately USD 4 and USD 4.50 per barrel, respectively, during the last fortnight, prior to the recent escalation.As a result, projections suggest that petrol prices could increase by PKR 2.50 to PKR 2.80 per litre, while HSD prices may rise by PKR 8 to PKR 8.50 per litre, pending final calculations, as per Dawn.The import premium on petrol has dropped by almost 21 per cent to USD 10.7 per barrel over the last fortnight when compared to USD 13.50 in last few days of March and the rupee strengthened by about 40 paisa against a dollar to USD 278.20.According to Dawn, the net impact is estimated to be about USD 2.80 per litre increase in petrol price from the existing rate of USD 289.41.The HSD price, on the other hand, was up in the international market and its import premium paid by the benchmark Pakistan State Oil remained unchanged at USD 6.50 per barrel.HSD rate was thus estimated to be higher by PKR 8 to PKR 8.50 per litre, subject to a final exchange rate adjustment in pricing, from the current rate of PKR 282.24 per litre at the depot stage.For the purpose of price calculations, officials said the petrol price had gone up by about USD 4 per barrel to USD 98.5 last week, while the HSD price went up by USD 4.50 per barrel to USD 102.9.Nearly two weeks ago, the government implemented a price hike of PKR 9.66 per litre for petrol and a reduction of PKR 3.32 per litre for high-speed diesel (HSD), effective until April 15.The government has also reached the maximum permissible limit of PKR 60 per litre in petroleum levy, as mandated by law, for both petrol and HSD.Under the commitments made with the International Monetary Fund, the government had set a budget target to collect PKR 869bn as a petroleum levy on petroleum products during the current fiscal year. It has already collected about PKR 475bn in the first half (July-December) of the fiscal year, though the government is expected to mop up about PKR 970bn by the end of the year, despite the revised target of PKR 920bn by the end of June.Currently, the government is charging about PKR 82 per litre in taxes on both petrol and HSD.","The higher international market is estimated to push up the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel by about Pakistani currency (PKR) 2.50 and PKR 8.50 per litre, respectively.

Donald Trump denies falling asleep during historic criminal trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-denies-falling-asleep-during-historic-criminal-trial/articleshow/109346300.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a significant legal event, former US President Donald Trump has vehemently denied allegations that he fell asleep during the first day of his historic criminal trial in New York. Trump's trial, which sees him facing 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels, has drawn considerable attention and speculation.The trial began under the scrutiny of both supporters and protesters, with the courtroom atmosphere further charged by reports and social media nicknames such as “Sleepy Don” and “Don Snoreleone,” referencing the infamous mafia kingpin from The Godfather series.These reports claim that Trump appeared to struggle to keep his eyes open during the proceedings, an Independent report claimed.The charges against Trump, initially misdemeanors, have been elevated to felonies by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, asserting they were committed to violate state or federal election laws. Trump has consistently denied the affair with Daniels, which allegedly took place in 2006, and pleaded not guilty to the charges.As jury selection continued into Tuesday, the trial has not only become a focal point for media coverage but also a significant strain on Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign efforts. He faces multiple legal battles this year, which include both criminal and civil trials, while also navigating the primary elections.Trump's legal team has employed a variety of defense strategies to delay or dismiss the charges, none of which have proven successful so far. Outside the courtroom, the atmosphere reflects a divisive political climate, with dwindling yet fervent crowds showing up to support the embattled former president.This trial marks the first time a former American president has stood trial on criminal charges, setting a precedent in U.S. legal and political history. As the proceedings continue, all eyes will remain on how this trial could potentially influence Trump's future political prospects and the broader implications for presidential accountability.","Former US President Donald Trump has vehemently denied allegations that he fell asleep during the first day of his criminal trial. Trump's trial, which sees him facing 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels, has drawn considerable attention and speculation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109346295,imgsize-717808,width-400,resizemode-4/109346295.jpg"
Trump to return to New York criminal court for jury selection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-to-return-to-new-york-criminal-court-for-jury-selection/articleshow/109344237.cms,"No Supreme Court visit

NEW YORK: Donald Trump 's historic hush-money trial enters a second day on Tuesday, as lawyers try to select 12 New York City jurors to consider the guilt or innocence of the first former U.S. president to face criminal charges.The first day on Monday underscored the challenges of the task.Roughly half of 100 potential jurors questioned were dismissed after saying they could not impartially judge the polarizing businessman-turned-politician, who is mounting a comeback White House bid while battling four separate criminal cases.A New York native who now lives in Florida, Trump was a fixture in the city's tabloid press for decades before he won the presidency as a Republican in 2016. But as a politician, he has never been able to count on the heavily Democratic city for votes.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, has charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Daniels says she had a sexual relationship with Trump about a decade beforehand.Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies an encounter took place. To prove a felony, prosecutors must show that Trump covered up the payment to conceal a crime like an illegal campaign contribution.Trump has said that the payment was personal and intended to spare himself and his family embarrassment.In other jurisdictions, he stands accused of mishandling classified information and trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. But the hush-money case may be the only one to go to trial before Trump faces Biden again in the Nov. 5 election.If convicted, Trump would still be able to run for office and serve as president if he won. But a Reuters/Ipsos poll found that half of independents and a quarter of his fellow Republicans would not vote for him if he is found guilty.Trump has pleaded not guilty in all four criminal cases and says they are a plot by Biden's Democrats to neutralize him politically.Though the New York case is centered on events that took place more than seven years ago, prosecutors are trying to hold Trump accountable for more recent conduct as well.On Monday, they asked Justice Juan Merchan to fine Trump $1,000 for each of three social media posts this month that criticized Daniels and Michael Cohen , Trump's former fixer who is expected to be a prominent witness in the trial.Under a gag order imposed by Merchan, Trump is barred from making statements about witnesses, court staff and family members that are meant to interfere with the case. Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche said the former president was only responding to their criticism of him.Merchan said he will consider the fines on April 23.Jury selection is expected to consume the rest of the week, and the trial is scheduled to last through May. Trump is required to be in court throughout, and on Monday Merchan denied a request for him to miss a session so he could attend a hearing at the U.S. Supreme Court, where his lawyers will argue that Trump should not be prosecuted for actions he took as president.""He thinks he's superior, I guess, to the Supreme Court. We've got a real problem with this judge,"" Trump said after Monday's session.The 12 jurors selected for the trial, along with six alternates, will hear testimony from Daniels and Cohen, who has said he made the payments to buy her silence.Other expected witnesses include David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid, who prosecutors say ran stories to boost Trump's 2016 campaign.Also due up is Karen McDougal, a former nude model for Playboy magazine who prosecutors say was paid by the National Enquirer to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump.",Donald Trump is the first former U.S. president to face criminal charges. He is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies an encounter took place.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109344457,imgsize-717808,width-400,resizemode-4/109344457.jpg"

Democrats seek to seize control of deadlocked Michigan House in special elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democrats-seek-to-seize-control-of-deadlocked-michigan-house-in-special-elections/articleshow/109334026.cms,"LANSING: Democratic lawmakers are hoping to win back a majority in the deadlocked Michigan House and regain control of the state government in two special elections on Tuesday. Democrat Mai Xiong is taking on Republican Ronald Singer in District 13, while Peter Herzberg, a Democrat, faces Republican Josh Powell in District 25. Both districts are located just outside Detroit and are heavily Democratic, with the previous Democratic incumbents each having won by over 25 percentage points in 2022.The lower chamber has been tied 54-54 between Democratic and Republican lawmakers since November, when two Democratic representatives vacated their seats after winning mayoral races in their hometowns. Democrats previously held a majority in both chambers along with control of the governor's office.""These special elections will determine who controls the House here in Michigan and set the tone for November, when we will decide whether Democrats hold on to the state House,"" said Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes.Democrats flipped both chambers in the 2022 midterms while maintaining control of the governor's office to win a trifecta for the first time in 40 years. They moved quickly to roll back decades of Republican measures and implement the party's agenda in their first year, including overhauling the state's gun laws.Since the House deadlocked, Republicans have pushed to pass legislation they say is bipartisan, such as a government transparency package, which would open the Legislature and governor's office up to public record requests. But very little legislation has been passed. Democrats have been unwilling to accept a joint power-sharing agreement proposed multiple times by Republican House Leader Matt Hall over the past few months.If both Democratic candidates win Tuesday, the party will regain control through the end of the year, with each seat in the House up for reelection in November. Either party would need to win both seats to gain a majority.Xiong is a Macomb County commissioner who was endorsed in the primary by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Her opponent, Singer, ran for the seat in 2022 and lost to former state Rep. Lori Stone by 34 percentage points.In the 25th, Herzberg, a Westland City Council member, will take on Powell, a veteran who has said in his campaign that he would support less government, less regulation and lower taxes. Former Rep. Kevin Coleman, a Democrat, won the district by 26 percentage points in 2022.Michigan Republican Party Chair Pete Hoekstra said Republicans still ""forced the candidates and Democrat committees to spend money to protect these seats.""""Win or lose, I'm more convinced than ever that Republicans are motivated and the Democrats are not,"" Hoekstra said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.After Tuesday's special elections, lawmakers are expected to turn their focus to a state budget with a self-imposed July 1 deadline. Whitmer used her January State of the State speech to propose an $81 billion budget that would provide free community college for all high school graduates and preschool for 4-year-olds.In recent months, Democrats have also considered expanding the state's hate crime law and enacting a comprehensive school safety package spurred by the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School. A majority in the House would let them more easily move those proposals.But lawmakers will be working against the clock if the deadlock ends Tuesday. They are set to take a summer break at the end of June and representatives will soon begin campaigning for reelection this fall in their districts.","The lower chamber has been tied 54-54 between Democratic and Republican lawmakers since November.

Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.The government did not announce the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO). Kerosene is mostly used by unscrupulous elements to mix with petrol and, to some extent, for lighting in very remote areas, while LDO is consumed by flour mills and a couple of power plants.Earlier, informed sources said the prices of petrol and HSD had increased in the international market by about USD 4 and USD 4.50 per barrel, respectively, during the last fortnight, before the latest escalation. The price of petrol was projected to be higher by PKR 2.50 to PKR 2.80 and that of HSD to go up by PKR 8 to PKR 8.50 per litre, Dawn reported.Interestingly, the import premium on petrol has dropped by almost 21 per cent to USD 10.7 per barrel over the last fortnight when compared to $13.50 in last few days of March and the rupee strengthened by about PKR 0.40 against a dollar to PKR 278.20. The net impact is estimated to be about PKR 2.80 per litre increase in petrol price from the existing rate of PKR 289.41.The HSD price, on the other hand, was up in the international market and its import premium paid by the benchmark Pakistan State Oil remained unchanged at 6.50 per barrel.Dawn reported that although the general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, the government charges PKR 60 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on both products. The government also charges about PKR 19-20 per litre customs duty on petrol and high-speed diesel.The PKR 60 per litre PDL on petrol and HSD is the maximum permissible limit under the law.The government set a budget target to collect PKR 869 billion as a levy on petroleum products during the current fiscal year under the commitments made with the International Monetary Fund.",Petrol price increased to PKR 293.94 per litre from PKR 289.41. HSD price was increased to. PKR 290.38 per litres for the next 15 days.

NEW DELHI: In an attempt to woo Indian tourists back to Maldives, a major tourism body in the island nation has revealed plans to conduct road shows across several key Indian cities. The move comes as the number of Indian visitors to the Maldives has seen a decline in recent times.The Maldives Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (MATATO) disclosed its intention to hold discussions with India's high commissioner in the Maldives, Munu Mahawar, to explore ways to enhance travel and tourism cooperation between the two countries.The decision to ramp up efforts to draw Indian tourists follows a significant backlash against the Maldives triggered by derogatory remarks made against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media by three Maldivian officials. This backlash led to numerous cancellations of reservations and a drop in plans to visit the Maldives by Indian tourists, including several celebrities.According to statistics from the Maldives' ministry of tourism, India, which was previously one of the top visitor countries, has slipped to the sixth position in terms of tourist arrivals. China currently leads with the highest number of tourists, followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, and Germany.Following discussions held at the Indian high commission in Male, MATATO announced plans to collaborate closely with the Indian high commission to boost tourism initiatives. This includes launching comprehensive road shows across key Indian cities and organizing influencer and media familiarization trips to the Maldives in the coming months.MATATO emphasized the importance of India as a crucial tourist market for the Maldives and expressed its eagerness to partner with prominent travel associations and industry stakeholders in India to promote the Maldives as a premier travel destination.This initiative comes amid tensions between the Maldives and India, with Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu previously requesting the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the country, citing sovereignty concerns.

NEW DELHI: A Muslim student in a UK court lost a case against his school that had banned on-site prayer rituals.On the grounds of religious freedom , the student had challenged Michaela Community School 's decision, claiming it to be 'discriminatory', which 'uniquely' affected her faith due to its ritualised nature.She argued the school's prohibition of on-site prayer unlawfully breached her right to religious freedom and was ""the kind of discrimination which makes religious minorities feel alienated from society"".The school in northwest London, which is state-funded but independently run, is renowned for its academic achievement record and strict rules. The school authorities defended its policy imposed last year as justified.The high court in London hearing the case was told the ban introduced last year stemmed from several dozen students beginning to pray in the school's yard, using blazers to kneel on, reported the BBC.It then imposed the new rules due to concerns about a ""culture shift"" towards ""segregation between religious groups and intimidation within the group of Muslim pupils"", the court reportedly heard.In a written ruling, judge Thomas Linden dismissed the pupil's arguments and ruled that by enrolling at the school she had effectively accepted being subject to restrictions on manifesting her faith.He concluded that the prayer ritual policy was ""proportionate"" and that its aims and ability to achieve them ""outweighs"" any ""adverse effects"" on the rights of Muslim pupils at the school.Responding to the decision headteacher Katharine Birbalsingh said ""a school should be free to do what is right for the pupils it serves"".""The court's decision is therefore a victory for all schools,"" she added on X (formerly Twitter).""Schools should not be forced by one child and her mother to change its approach simply because they have decided they don't like something at the school.""Education Secretary Gillian Keegan also welcomed the ruling, saying ""headteachers are best placed to make decisions in their school"".""Michaela is an outstanding school and I hope this judgment gives all school leaders the confidence to make the right decisions for their pupils.""","Muslim student loses case against his school that had banned on-site prayer rituals.

Describing the error as being simply that of someone at Vardags “clicking the wrong button,” she applied to the high court to rescind the final divorce order but the court rejected the plea and said, “There is a strong public policy interest in respecting the certainty and finality that flows from a final divorce order and maintaining the status quo that it has established.”Judge McFarlane, the president of the family division, added that it was necessary to correct the impression that the online divorce portal would “deliver a final order of divorce where one was not wanted simply by ‘the click of a wrong button’”.“Like many similar online processes, an operator may only get to the final screen where the final click of the mouse is made after travelling through a series of earlier screens,” he said.McFarlane clarified that the legal team had initially intended to file for a divorce on behalf of a different client. However, due to an oversight, they mistakenly accessed the electronic case file for 'Williams v Williams' and proceeded to submit an application for a final order in that particular case, according to The Guardian.He explained that solicitors from Vardags, representing the wife, utilized the online portal without the explicit instruction or authorization from their client. McFarlane noted that the online system processed the request swiftly, as per its usual efficiency, granting the divorce order for the Williamses in a remarkably short span of 21 minutes.","A couple, who were married for 21 years, accidentally divorced when a law firm mixed up their information with another pair’s.

It's expected that he will schedule it for October or November, but legally, he can delay it until January at the latest.Surveys overwhelmingly indicate that Britons desire an end to the 14-year rule of the Tories, and nothing Sunak has done since assuming the role of Prime Minister 18 months ago seems to be altering their opinions.A recent YouGov poll revealed that the Conservatives would only secure 155 seats in the UK Parliament, a significant decrease from the 365 seats they won under Johnson in the last election in December 2019.The same survey found that Keir Starmer's opposition Labour Party would secure 403 seats, resulting in an impressive 154-seat majority.""Right now, it's very challenging to envision how the Conservatives could stay in government after the next election simply due to the magnitude of the shift they would require,"" remarked Keiran Pedley, director of politics at polling firm Ipsos.Sunak took over from Liz Truss in October 2022 after Tory MPs ousted her following a tumultuous 49 days in office. Truss's mini-budget caused turmoil in financial markets, leading to a decline in the pound and a surge in mortgage payments. Truss had succeeded Johnson, who was removed from office by his colleagues amid scandals, including allegations of illegal parties in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns.The chaos of the two preceding administrations has certainly hindered Sunak, but political analysts argue that he has also worsened his own situation by failing to fulfill promises and failing to resonate with voters.Despite pledging to do so, Sunak has not halted the influx of migrants arriving from France on small boats. NHS waiting lists have increased since he took office. Economic growth remains sluggish, although inflation has decreased by more than half.Rishi Sunak's efforts to steer leadership and policy changes have not gained traction, with some initiatives like relaxing carbon net zero goals to appease drivers and addressing extremism failing to resonate. Analysts believe Sunak is struggling to find a game-changing solution, with public sentiment towards the Conservative Party hitting a low point.A recent Ipsos poll disclosed that 58% of voters hold an unfavorable view of the Conservatives, marking a significant decline in popularity. Sunak's personal favorability rating also took a hit, with a net score of minus 38, the lowest among all politicians surveyed.Critics often point out Sunak's disconnect with the average citizen, labeling him as ""awkward and nerdy"" and quick to appear defensive when challenged. In an attempt to bolster the party's standing, Sunak has been actively engaging with voters across the country amid speculation of a potential leadership challenge following the upcoming local elections on May 2.However, setbacks continue to plague Sunak, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson publicly criticizing his proposal for a comprehensive smoking ban and rumors circulating about the PM's involvement in an AI fund post-election defeat, which Sunak's spokesperson promptly denied.Sunak found himself issuing a public apology to the Samba community after facing backlash for sporting Adidas trainers, leading to mocking headlines questioning his fashion choices. As political commentator Ford highlighted, the negative media coverage and public sentiment can create a detrimental cycle for unpopular politicians.Despite the challenges, observers anticipate a potential shift in polling trends closer to the election day, with some moderate Conservatives likely to rally behind the party to prevent a significant Labour victory and maintain a robust opposition force.With the focus now on minimizing damage and regaining public trust, Sunak faces a critical juncture in his leadership as he navigates through a period of heightened scrutiny and skepticism from both within and outside the party.(With inputs from agencies)","Britain's Conservative leader Rishi Sunak hasn't delivered on important promises, and his popularity in opinion polls has dropped.

Western media questions Indian democracy in string of op-eds on Lok Sabha elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/western-media-questions-indian-democracy-in-string-of-op-eds-on-lok-sabha-elections/articleshow/109276708.cms,"LONDON: Opinion pieces on the Indian elections have been appearing thick and fast in the Western press.On Monday, the Times ran a “leading article” saying: “Mr Modi is likely to be recognised as probably the most significant Indian leader since independence”, putting his popularity down to spectacular growth, new technology, and welfare policies.“Modi has cultivated the image of a strongman… thumbing his nose at Western liberals and telling Indians their turn in the global spotlight has come.This plays as well with the poor as the rich elites,” it said.But “there is a darker side to his popularity,” the editorial continued. “Modi embraces ‘Hindutva”, playing up a nationalist Hinduism and discriminating against and passing laws that “disadvantage India’s large Muslim minority”. It said Modi was “intolerant of the opposition”, referring to the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, and claimed that “heavy pressure has been imposed on India’s once lively press to toe the government line,” including occasional harassment of the BBC.The arrest of AAP ministers and freezing of Congress bank accounts have been frequently mentioned.Edward Luce, associate editor at the FT, asked on X: “Will this be India's last democratic election”, whilst Hannah Ellis-Petersen, the Guardian’s correspondent, wrote: “Analysts and opponents have warned this could be the most one-sided election in India’s history.”The FT’s editorial board penned an article titled “The ‘mother of democracy’ is not in good shape”, saying: “PM Modi has repeatedly called India the ‘mother of democracy’. If so, an intensifying clampdown on opposition parties suggests this matriarch of representative government is in ill health. Harassment, often by tax or legal authorities, has become common for government critics… The BJP ’s muscular Hindu nationalism has eroded India’s tradition of secular democracy.”Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee wrote that the ""more progressive and successful part of the country"" was ""drifting away from the poverty-ridden north"" and its ""majoritarian leader."" “A Hindu rashtra, or nation-state, will play well in the north. The very prospect of such an outcome fills the south with dread,” he claimed.In the FT, Ruchir Sharma argued that Modi had expanded his base, not because of Hindutva ideology, but because he was delivering economic progress, and that the people of India were prepared to “trade political freedom for perceived progress” in the same way countries such as Taiwan and South Korea put together long runs of rapid growth with low inflation under autocratic leaders.All the op-eds predicted BJP would win the election and Congress faced a wipeout. The Economist published a list of books on Hindutva, telling its readers that non-Indians needed to understand the origins and core ideas of the “dangerous ideology”.“The residual Congress ideology is a sort of English Fabian socialism left out too long in the sun. The Congress manifesto was a standard left-of-centre list of desirable state handouts.It said little about more inclusive growth. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that Congress deserves the obscurity to which it is headed because of its acute intellectual shortcomings,” Philip Collins wrote in the Times.","All the op-eds predicted BJP would win the election and Congress faced a wipeout.

Middle East crisis: Civil aviation ministry asks airlines to carry out risk assessment on flight ops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/middle-east-crisis-civil-aviation-ministry-asks-airlines-to-carry-out-risk-assessment-on-flight-ops/articleshow/109344727.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid escalating tensions in the Middle East, the civil aviation ministry has asked airlines to carry out their own risk assessment on international flight operations .Air India, Vistara, IndiGo and various international airlines have opted for alternative flight paths to the West and are avoiding the Iranian airspace against the backdrop of tensions flaring up between Iran and Israel.Civil Aviation Secretary Vumlunmang Vualnam on Tuesday told PTI that airlines have been asked to make their own risk assessment with respect to their flight operations.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) is handholding and interacting with the airlines, and also in touch with the external affairs ministry, he added.The secretary was responding to a query on whether there is an advisory by the ministry or the DGCA to airlines amid the crisis in the Middle East.Air India is operating some of its international flights on alternative flight paths to and from India, and Vistara has also made changes to flight paths for some of its flights due to the Middle East situation.Also, Air India has temporarily suspended its flights to Tel Aviv.The alternative flight paths have increased the duration of some of the international flights by around half an hour.About the Middle East crisis , Suprio Banerjee, Vice President & Sector Head, Corporate Ratings at ICRA, said commercial airlines may have to take a longer route in order to comply with no-fly regulations, leading to higher fuel expenses.""This will also impact international air travel to the directly affected and potentially affected nearby geographies during the upcoming summer holiday season if the issue persists,"" Banerjee said.Manan Bajoria, Group VP Growth at travel portal ixigo, said re-routing of flights due to the current geopolitical tensions can result in longer routes and higher expenses for airlines that run flights to and from Europe, Middle East, and Southeast Asia.""Lengthy diversions will add to airline fuel costs and may lead to an increase in airfares across these routes,"" Bajoria said.Banerjee also said the ongoing geopolitical developments in the Middle East region will continue to exert pressure on crude oil prices and, in turn, on ATF prices, which have been on an elevated level compared to the pre-Covid era.During the weekend, Iran launched dozens of drones and missiles at Israel in a retaliatory attack.

"On Himalayan hillsides in Nepal grows Japan's cold, hard cash",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/on-himalayan-hillsides-in-nepal-grows-japans-cold-hard-cash/articleshow/109328458.cms,"PUWAMAJHUWA: The views are spectacular in this corner of eastern Nepal , between the world's highest mountains and the tea estates of India's Darjeeling district, where rare orchids grow and red pandas play on lush hillsides.But life can be tough. Wild animals destroyed the corn and potato crops of Pasang Sherpa, a farmer born near Mt Everest. He gave up on those plants years ago and resorted to raising one that seemed to have little value: argeli, an evergreen, yellow-flowering shrub found wild in the Himalayas .Farmers grew it for fencing or firewood. Sherpa had no idea that bark stripped from his argeli would one day turn into pure money - the outgrowth of an unusual trade in which one of the poorest pockets of Asia supplies a primary ingredient for the economy in one of the richest.Japan 's currency is printed on special paper that can no longer be sourced at home. The Japanese love their old-fashioned yen notes, and this year they need mountains of fresh ones, so Sherpa and his neighbours have a lucrative reason to hang on to their hillsides.""I hadn't thought these raw materials would be exported to Japan or that I would make money from this plant,"" Sherpa said. ""I'm quite happy. This success came from nowhere.""Headquartered over 4,600 km away in Osaka, Kanpou Inc. produces paper for the Japanese govt. One of its charitable programmes is to help Nepali farmers in the Himalayas dig wells. Its agents eventually stumbled onto a solution for a Japanese problem.Japan's supply of mitsumata, the traditional paper used to print its bank notes, was running low. The paper starts with woody pulp from plants of the Thymelaeaceae family, which grow at high altitude with moderate sunshine and good drainage - tea-growing terrain. Shrinking rural populations and climate change were driving Japan's farmers to abandon their labour-intensive plots. Kanpou's president at the time knew mitsumata had its origins in the Himalayas. So, he wondered: Why not transplant it? After years of trial and error, the company discovered argeli, a hardier relative, was already growing wild in Nepal. Its farmers just needed tutoring to meet Japan's exacting standards. A quiet revolution got underway after earthquakes devastated Nepal in 2015. The Japanese sent specialists to Kathmandu to help farmers get serious about making the stuff of cold, hard yen.This year, Sherpa has hired 60 locals to help him process his harvest and expects to earn 8 million Nepali rupees ($60,000). Sherpa hopes to produce 20 of the 140 tons that Nepal will be shipping to Japan.It is an important moment for the yen. Every 20 years, the currency goes in for a redesign. The notes were first printed in 2004 - their replacements will hit cashiers in July.","Japan's currency is printed on special paper that can no longer be sourced at home.

Dangerous new reality: 'Zombie fires' from last year are still burning under layers of snow in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/dangerous-new-reality-zombie-fires-from-last-year-are-still-burning-under-layers-of-snow-in-canada/articleshow/109319871.cms,"As skiers glide down the slopes of British Columbia ’s Whistler Mountain and ice fishers drop their lines into frozen lakes in Alberta , dozens of the fires whose smoke darkened North America’s skies last year are still burning — with some smoldering beneath layers of snow.These so-called “zombie fires” are a sign of a grim new normal that’s wreaking havoc even in far northern countries like Canada : a fire season that almost never ends.The western province of BC had 90 zombie blazes still burning as of mid-March, holdovers from last year’s record fire season, while neighboring Alberta started the year with 64 fires carried over from 2023 — more than 10 times the five-year average. As spring temperatures melt snow and uncover land parched by drought, those fires and new ones are poised to flare up, posing a fresh threat to Canada’s forests, not to mention the world’s atmosphere.“We really don’t get out of wildfire season like we have historically,” said Rob de Pruis, director of consumer and industry relations at the Insurance Bureau of Canada. “They’re a real and present danger, and wildfires are happening right now.”The Statue of Liberty was shrouded in smoke from Canadian wildfires last June. Photographer: Victor J. Blue/BloombergThe worst fire season on record in Canada made global headlines last year when smoke from the blazes blotted out the skies above New York and other US cities, spawned a rare pyro-tornado and forced the evacuations of an estimated 232,000 people. The fires burned an area that was more than seven times the historic average — or about 4% of the country’s forests, according to a new study.The flames caused more than C$1 billion ($740 million) in insured damages, according to the insurance bureau. They also may have released emissions that are more than twice the annual carbon output of the nation’s economy, a top government scientist has estimated.This year, with 71% of Canada abnormally dry or in drought in February and swathes of the country as much as 5C (9F) warmer than normal, governments and companies are bracing for a repeat. Alberta declared a start to its wildfire season on Feb. 20 — the earliest in recent years — and a spokesman for Quebec’s forest-protection agency said the province’s season is poised to start as much as four weeks earlier than usual.Nationally, the federal government has invested C$170 million in a satellite mission to monitor fires, while the armed forces are training more soldiers as support firefighters.British Columbia’s provincial government created a permanent Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness in 2022 — the year after the town of Lytton burned to the ground in a record-breaking heatwave — to deal with the onslaught of fires and floods. That replaces the previous approach, where resources were mobilized temporarily in response to events. “I exist in a state of anxiety on behalf of the province,” the department’s minister, Bowinn Ma, said in a phone interview. “It has become apparent that that kind of response-focused model just wasn’t sufficient.”The province is upgrading firefighting equipment, working to get more access to aircraft, testing night-vision technology to extend fire suppression into the hours of darkness and looking at how to use artificial intelligence to predict fires.The province’s wildfire service also is shifting to operating year-round — rather than seasonally — and has increased its full-time staff more than 50% since 2022. British Columbia plans to almost triple the number of prescribed and cultural forest burns to pre-empt and curb wildfires this year: 61 are planned.The changing weather patterns are affecting how businesses operate, too. Telecom company Telus Corp. has ramped up clearing brush around its “million-dollar” cell towers in areas at risk of fires, so communities don’t get cut off, said Phil Moore, vice president of real estate and business continuity.The wireless provider has invested more than C$100 million in protecting infrastructure over the last five years, he said, and it’s helping fund a German startup called Dryad Networks GmbH, which uses sensors to detect wildfires earlier.Perhaps no industry has been more affected by fires in the past decade than Canada’s oil and gas sector, which was forced to shut down more than 1 million barrels of daily output during a devastating blaze in 2016. The fire razed sections of Fort McMurray — the largest city near most producers’ oil-sands operations — and caused about C$3.7 billion in insured losses, making it Canada’s costliest natural disaster.During last year’s fire season, energy producers including Chevron Corp., Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and Baytex Energy Corp. at times shut production equivalent to about 300,000 barrels of oil a day as blazes encroached on wells and processing infrastructure.The drought conditions that are spawning the fires can also hurt producers by cutting off the water they need for operating oil-sands mines and wells.The Alberta Energy Regulator in December warned energy companies to “plan accordingly” when applying for licenses to divert water from rivers and to prepare contingency plans. Average monthly precipitation from October to the end of February was the lowest in at least 10 years in five of Alberta’s production areas, including near Lac La Biche, Fort McMurray, Slave Lake, Peace River and Grande Prairie.The issue is front of mind for investors. Analysts asking executives from Suncor Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Ltd. and Canadian Natural about their preparations for the drought conditions on their recent earnings calls. “We’re going to continue to have to manage that carefully,” Imperial Chief Executive Officer Brad Corson said last month of the risks to water supply.There’s one consolation: 2023’s fires scorched such large swathes of forest that in some places, smaller fires won’t be able to merge with each other to create massive contiguous blazes, said Thomas Smith, an associate professor of environmental geography at the London School of Economics.“The connectivity is certainly going to slow down and stop the spread of some of these fires,” Smith said. “But I don’t expect it it to be a very quiet fire year.”","The western province of BC had 90 zombie blazes still burning as of mid-March.
