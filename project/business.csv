'War ties': Norway fund to sell Adani Ports stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/war-ties-norway-fund-to-sell-adani-ports-stake/articleshow/110187393.cms,"MUMBAI: Norges Bank , Norway's central bank, has decided to exclude Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone from its government pension fund over ethical concerns. This means the $1.7-trillion fund - the world's largest sovereign wealth fund by assets under management - will sell its remaining stake in Adani Ports.The Norwegian pension fund invests in equities and bonds across most countries and markets.In a statement, Norges Bank said it has decided to exclude Adani Ports due to ""unacceptable risk that the company contributes to serious violations of individuals' rights in situations of war or conflict"". The port operator, part of billionaire Gautam Adani's conglomerate, has been under its watch list since March 2022 and that ""observation now ends given the exclusion decision"".Adani Ports didn't respond to TOI's requests for comments on its exclusion from the Norwegian pension fund's portfolio. Norges Bank said its decision to exclude Adani Ports from the fund's portfolio was based on recommendations from Council On Ethics . COE is an independent body that makes recommendations to Norges Bank to either exclude companies from the pension fund or place them under observation. In a statement, the COE said that Adani Ports was under observation ""due to its business association with the armed forces in Myanmar "", which in Feb 2021 staged a military coup.The Indian company was involved with a port terminal in Myanmar, incurring an investment of $150 million. In May 2023, the company disclosed that it sold the Myanmar port to Solar Energy. The COE noted that no information on the buyer is available, and Adani Ports has stated that it cannot share any such information on the grounds of confidentiality. Lack of information means that the COE cannot establish whether Adani Ports still has links to the enterprise concerned.""In a situation in which extremely serious norm violations are taking place, this constitutes an unacceptable risk that the government pension fund's investments in Adani Ports may breach its ethical guidelines"". Norges Bank didn't mention the quantum of stake the government pension fund holds in Adani Ports. The fund has been paring its exposure in Adani Ports over the last several quarters. In Feb 2023, it held 0.3% in Adani Ports. Besides Adani Ports, it held 0.14% in Adani Green and 0.17% in Adani Total Gas. ts latest holding in all the three Adani Group companies couldn't be ascertained.","Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, has decided to exclude Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone from its government pension fund over ethical concerns.

"Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq end at records as US inflation cools",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dow-sp-500-nasdaq-end-at-records-as-us-inflation-cools/articleshow/110162061.cms,"Wall Street surged to new heights on Wednesday following encouraging signs of easing inflation, which has sparked anticipation of upcoming interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve . The release of US consumer price data for April showed a slight moderation in inflation rates, sending the three major stock indices to record levels.The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared by 0.9 percent, reaching 39,908.00 and nearing the monumental 40,000 mark.The S&P 500 increased by 1.2 percent to 5,308.15, and the Nasdaq Composite grew by 1.4 percent, ending the day at 16,742.39, marking consecutive record closes.This optimism was partly due to the monthly consumer price index indicating an annual inflation rate of 3.4 percent for April, a slight decrease from 3.5 percent in March. ""The reports together point to a cooling of inflation and economic growth, as well as an increase in the likelihood that the Fed will begin its rate-cutting cycle later this year,"" commented Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.Despite robust market performances, US retail sales in April were stagnant, missing the anticipated 0.4 percent growth. This could signal a deceleration in consumer spending, potentially impacting economic stability.In the bond market, the easing of Treasury yields alleviated some pressure, enhancing the appeal of stocks, especially those likely to benefit from lower interest rates. Homebuilders like Lennar, DR Horton, and PulteGroup all saw significant gains, driven by hopes that rate cuts could lower mortgage costs.Tech stocks also enjoyed a boost, with Nvidia rising by 3.6 percent, significantly contributing to the S&P 500's gains. Utility and real estate sectors likewise performed well, as lower bond yields made their dividends more attractive.Market sentiment was influenced by various corporate performances and economic indicators. Dell Technologies saw an 11.2 percent jump after an optimistic analyst upgrade from Morgan Stanley, while Boeing faced a 2.1 percent drop amid legal troubles. The fluctuating fortunes of 'meme stocks' such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment highlighted the volatile nature of these investments, with significant losses following recent gains.As traders now place a nearly 95 percent probability on the Fed cutting rates at least once this year, the market remains sensitive to economic signals and Federal Reserve policies. This delicate balance of slowing the economy to manage inflation without triggering a recession continues to be a central theme in market dynamics.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared by 0.9 percent, reaching 39,908.00 and nearing the monumental 40,000 mark.

What happened in the previous AIS feedback system?



Income Tax Return e-filing: Taxpayers facing inaccuracies in their Annual Information Statement (AIS) now have a solution at hand. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has revamped the AIS system, enabling individuals to track the status of their correction requests in real-time.The CBDT announced in a press release dated May 13, 2024, that they've added a new feature to the AIS.This feature will show if the taxpayer's feedback has been addressed by the source, either partially or fully, by accepting or rejecting it.As per an ET report, the AIS can be found on the compliance portal, which is accessible to all registered income taxpayers. You can't access the compliance portal directly. First, you need to log in to the e-filing ITR portal, then go to the 'Pending Actions' tab to access the compliance portal.CBDT stated in its press release that the Annual Information Statement is accessible to all registered Income Taxpayers via the compliance portal, which can be reached through the e-filing website (incometax.gov.in).According to the CBDT's press release, if the feedback is partially or fully accepted, the source needs to correct the information by filing a correction statement.The AIS will display the following details regarding feedback confirmation from the source:- Confirmation Status: Indicates if feedback has been shared with the reporting source.- Date of Feedback Sharing: Shows when feedback was sent to the reporting source.- Date of Source Response: Displays when the reporting source responded to the feedback.- Source Response: Indicates the response provided by the source based on the taxpayer's feedback (whether correction is needed or not).CBDT mentioned in the press release that this new feature is anticipated to enhance transparency by showing such information in AIS to the taxpayer.If there's incorrect AIS data, you need to give feedback for correction. But in the past, there have been issues when the reporting source didn't act promptly to fix this. As a result, taxpayers got income tax intimation notices because of discrepancies between AIS and ITR data.Mihir Tanna, an associate director-direct tax at S.K Patodia LLP, a CA firm, states that they have observed how incorrect information in AIS has caused distress to numerous legitimate taxpayers upon receiving intimation from the income tax department regarding data mismatches between AIS and filed ITR. In the past, some of their clients encountered issues where sale and purchase transactions of shares appeared in AIS, despite not being conducted by them. They provided feedback in the AIS tab but were uncertain if the reporting entity took necessary action.This new feature will make it clear if you need to do anything more after providing feedback on wrong AIS information. According to Tanna, if the reporting source doesn't accept the feedback, then the taxpayer only needs to take necessary action. This clarity and transparency are provided by the new functionality.Experts note that the CBDT's press release doesn't specify how the taxpayer will be informed about the feedback provided by the reporting source.Divya Jokhakar, a CA and Associate of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) in the United Kingdom (UK), explains that the new feature will now notify the taxpayer after they provide feedback on incorrect AIS data, including the date when the reporting source is informed and confirmation is sent. Similarly, the taxpayer will also be notified about the response and its date from the source. The press release doesn't mention how this communication will happen, but it's likely to be through SMS to the registered mobile number and email to the registered email ID.Experts also mention that the communication between the taxpayer and reporting source becomes simpler. According to Jokhakar, this change means that communication is no longer one-sided as it was before. This should provide taxpayers with some relief, knowing that their feedback is being addressed. Additionally, they can interact with sources like tax deductors , collectors, and SFT filers more easily.The AIS gathers financial data from various sources known as reporting entities. This data offers a snapshot of the taxpayer's financial transactions, forming the basis for filing income tax returns. Yet, since this information comes from third-party reports, there's a possibility of errors entering the AIS database due to reporting mistakes.To address this issue, CBDT implemented a feedback system within AIS.CBDT stated in the press release that within AIS, taxpayers can now give feedback on each displayed transaction. This feedback allows taxpayers to comment on the accuracy of the information provided by the source. If there's incorrect reporting, the system automatically follows up with the source for confirmation. Currently, this confirmation process is operational for information provided by Tax Deductors/Collectors and Reporting Entities.With the recent update, the feedback system has become more responsive, giving taxpayers the ability to take corrective actions and track the status of correction requests.","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has revamped the AIS system, enabling individuals to track the status of their correction requests in real-time.

""We are working on ways in which trade can be facilitated. But countries which no longer have any dollars cannot be left without trading. They also want to buy and sell goods. There are solutions we are working out,"" Sitharaman added.Sitharaman cautioned on the F&O segment after highlighting the shift that has taken place in household savings from the post office and bank deposits to mutual funds and capital markets. She said that these savings have provided a counterbalance to whimsical foreign portfolio flows.Last year, Sebi had come out with a study which showed that nine of 10 individual traders in the equity F&O segment incur net losses. Following the study, Sebi chairman Madhabi Puri Buch had expressed surprise at the number of investors continuing to participate in the segment despite knowing the odds were not in their favour. F&Os are considered very risky because of the potential for significant losses as investors can take big bets with small upfront amounts.""Stability of govt, policy (particularly taxation policy), predictability, and above all a soft touch regulatory framework... these are the high points with which markets become efficient... function without volatility. For a stable, vibrant, and deep Indian financial market, the prerequisites are a stable govt, a majority govt... and a govt with a visionary leader,"" said Sitharaman.In her speech, the finance minister said that there was no cause for volatility in the stock markets - as reflected in the India VIX or the volatility index - on account of political uncertainty. ""I want to make it clear to you, we are confident that PM Modi will be forming govt in his third term... a stable govt with high governance and low govt,"" she said, adding, ""This govt's route is to have an investment-led growth strategy, which includes policies for greater FDI flow, greater openness and transparency with technology infusion in the markets.""",Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has asked stock exchanges to work with markets regulator Sebi to prevent any 'explosion' in the retail futures & options segment.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107497505,imgsize-51586,width-400,resizemode-4/107497505.jpg"

We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-focuses-on-youth-and-women-entrepreneurship/articleshow/107357923.cms,"By

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Data risks rise with AI; here’s what firms must do to protect people’s data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/data-risks-rise-with-ai-heres-what-firms-must-do-to-protect-peoples-data/articleshow/110191545.cms,"Most of us today share a lot of our personal data with digital platforms. Often we do not even realise it’s being shared, because many websites we visit use cookies to extract data from our devices – data like our IP address, location, browser history. This is why when we browse for, say shoes, suddenly all the subsequent websites we visit show us ads of shoes.It’s the reason why we receive spam mails and calls.But those are among the less harmful things that happen. As Aju Sebastian, MD of technology consulting at Protiviti Global Business Consulting, said on our webinar last week, our data sharing can get us into dangerous situations as well. And these dangers are rising as cybercriminals get access to AI tools. “You could fall victim to phishing, or identity theft, where your identity is used by someone to masquerade as you and do some malicious activities,” Sebastian said. AI is even enabling cybercriminals to use your image, voice and video to serve their ends.“So it’s very important to guard your personal data, it’s also very important to know to whom you are handing over your personal data and how they plan to use it,” he said.Around the world, governments are coming up with regulations that companies must follow on how they handle people’s data. The European Union brought in the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in 2016. The Indian government passed the Digital Personal Data Protection Act last year, and that’s expected to come into force very soon. So, it’s critical now for companies to put in place data privacy frameworks.Pradeep Vasudevan, country leader for secu rity software at IBM India & South Asia, said it has to start with data discovery, primarily to find out which are sensitive data, what kind of data is live in which part of the organisation, and who has access to that. “If you don’t know what you’re going to control, you will not be able to even move forward from there,” he said.The next step is to protect the most sensitive data by implementing security policies and active monitoring controls. “Once these are in place, then we can apply advanced analytics on top of that to find out what the vulnerabilities are, and address them. After that, it’s about how fast you can respond to a threat when it comes. And finally, it’s about being compliant to the regulatory frameworks, and streamlining the auditing and reporting process,” he said.Sunil Nishankar, CISO of Future Generali India Life Insurance, noted that the company has over 8 million customers and whose personal information they collect. Since the company is part of a global organisation, it’s already compliant with GDPR. He said they start by making users aware of the purposes for which data is being taken, and consent is taken. Then they put in technical controls to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data, and its availability only to those who are supposed to have it. “Then we undergo audits, get accredited with certain international standards. We use data discovery tools to know which data is lying where, whether it’s being used as per the consent given. We have a 24x7 monitoring team that keeps monitoring all data flows. And we ensure that all third parties we work with follow all the regulations that apply to us,” he said.","Most of us today share a lot of our personal data with digital platforms.

The way a job actually works has evolved because the tasks and skills that are required to be successful in any job have changed.”This phenomenon, she said, isn’t new either. “Between 2015 and now, we have seen skills that are required to be successful in a particular job have shifted by about 30% in India. Globally it was 24%. And the skills that are required to be successful from now till about 2030 are going to shift by 68%.”Irina Ghose, MD for Microsoft India & South Asia, said that according to their new report, 75% of Indian leaders say they wouldn’t even hire someone without AI skills, while 80% of them say they would rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. “Basically, AI skills trump experience.”And that, Irina said, is because irrespective of the function, every employee stands to gain from AI. “Whether in creative roles, coding, data analysis, or departments like finance, marketing, or legal, AI tools set a new baseline.”","As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our work processes, adopting a skills-first mindset and gaining soft skills are more crucial than ever before.

New prompt for virtual retail: Ecommerce firms are using AI in a variety of ways to take on physical retail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-prompt-for-virtual-retail-ecommerce-firms-are-using-ai-in-a-variety-of-ways-to-take-on-physical-retail/articleshow/110191425.cms,"Understanding language

Completing the look

Some of you would have tried this on an ecommerce site – checking to see how a lipstick shade or a hair colour will actually look on you. Amazon, for instance, has both a live video option, and a picture option. In both, you can try out different shades virtually, and see if it suits your complexion. Myntra has similar virtual reality options when someone shops for cosmetics, apparel and shoes.Most such features are based on AI models, and are helping ecommerce companies make the customer experience exciting, and reduce returns of shipped products.Rahul Jain, AI consulting leader at Tiger Analytics, says such models involve using a combination of computer vision, deep learning, machine learning, and 3D modelling algorithms. He says the system is initially trained with publicly available data on sites like Google and Meta. This will be data on things like skin colour, body sizes, differentiation among brands. The user’s captured image or real-time video, he says, is typically processed using algorithms like Google TensorFlow pose detection for body scanning and measurement to identify key points/regions of the body. “Mathematical models render the customer with the digital version of the product. Finally, deep learning models (such as GAN-based or Diffusion-based approaches) enhance the scenes and context based on product attributes (texture, colour, fit, etc) before streaming the image back to the device, and enabling customers to visualise how the product fits or looks on them,” he says.Raghu Krishnananda, chief technology & product officer at Myntra, says their AI system also has an algorithm that links a person’s measurements with the measurements of each brand on the portal, after which suggestions are given. “The AI system can find the right measurement despite different brands having different measurements of a particular size,” he says.Ecommerce uses AI for a variety of other purposes too. If you find the homepage of your shopping app to be different from your friend’s, that’s because the AI systems are tracking users’ browsing history on the application, as also looking at users’ profile details – such as age and location – to provide customised recommendations.Dealing with vernacular languages and Indian speaking quirks is another major use case. Kishore Thota, head of product and marketing at Amazon India, says their AI algorithm allows customers to type in English the way they understand it, and if the spellings aren’t correct, the technology will modify the spellings based on the words that sound phonetically similar.“We’re constantly improving our search algorithms to help customers find the products they’re looking for. Our algorithms take into account query semantics, they identify phrases and brand mentions, correct spell errors, support transliterated and colloquial usages, and classify queries into product categories,” he says. The platform has trained its AI model to understand eight Indian languages. There’s also a facility for users to talk to the system and the algorithm at the backend will interpret to provide suggestions – for instance, users can just say, ‘Find me red shoes’. On the same lines, Flipkart has developed AI models to understand vernacular languages written in the English script. “We found that people are more comfortable with their local languages. For example, someone might say ‘Bachchon ke liye dress’ and not dresses for kids,” Mayur Datar, chief data scientist at Flipkart, says.Datar is also looking to replace the written word to explain what a user is shopping for, using AI. “Let’s say your favourite star has worn something. You like what that person is wearing but you might not want that exact dress. You can post a picture of it and get suggestions for clothes on the same lines,” Datar says.These platforms are also creating systems that can look at you and suggest what might be best for you. Flipkart has a feature that analyses people’s skin tones and points out blemishes on the skin and suggests cosmetics accordingly.Amazon has an outfit builder based on AI that assists customers in discovering fashion items and suggesting complementary products to complete their look. Flipkart is building a virtual assistant called Flippi, which hopes to replicate a physical store’s environment where a salesman is constantly in touch with the customer. Datar says Flippi will provide product assistance not only from the look perspective, but also the return or exchange policy associated with it.We asked Flippi how we could buy an iPhone, and it provided all the options of iPhones on Flipkart. It then asked us what colour we preferred – no prompting required there. Then it asked us if we wanted to try Samsung, OnePlus or Xiaomi phone options, and prompted us about our price range and RAM preferences.","Most such features are based on AI models, and are helping ecommerce companies make the customer experience exciting.

It can be a high-growth commercial insurance according to the chief of Howden, the largest non-US insurance broker.According to David Howden, CEO of insurance broking firm Howden, this is a major form of insurance of the future, offering protection from risks that are uninsurable by conventional insurance.According to him, if people are uninsurable, they are uninvestable. ""Most of the global South cannot buy insurance if we provide insurance that will bring investment,"" said Howden.Howden has arranged for parametric climate risk cover in Rwanda for subsistence level farmers . This cover helps farmers to plant all their seeds and increase productivity by 25%, while also providing protection against drought. The broker works with govts and NGOs to design covers for vulnerable populations. The premium gaps are filled in by the NGOs or govts or in the case of Rwanda, by Howden as a CSR activity.""An area where parametric insurance will take up heavily is energy transition, where covers are becoming very relevant because of the growth of renewable energy sources,"" said Howden. This includes areas like solar and wind energy where weather also plays a crucial role.In India, Howden has helped arrange insurance for 26,000 families in Gujarat who will receive Rs 2,000 each if the maximum temperature breaches the danger mark of 43.7 degrees. The cover was arranged by Mahila Housing Trust to cover livelihoods.","Parametric insurance pays out claims on the happening of a specific event, usually weather-related.

The city has not seen a heatwave day this season so far.The Met department defines a heatwave day when the maximum is 4.5 degrees and more above normal temperature and the maximum is at least 40 degrees Celsius.It is also considered a heatwave if the maximum temperature touches 45 degrees Celsius or above.IMD’s data shows that the heatwaves in Delhi are mostly recorded from the third week of April till the first 10 days of June.“Dry and hot westerly or north-westerly winds are blowing in the city. As no western disturbance is predicted to impact the region for the next few days, rain is unlikely in the city. Clear skies and lack of moisture are likely to cause mercury to rise in the city in the next few days,” said a Met official.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 41.2 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal, at Safdarjung, the city’s base station. Najafgarh was the warmest station, with the mercury rising to 43.8 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was recorded at 22.9 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal.The Met department’s data shows that the highest day temperature reported at any weather station so far this year was 44 degrees Celsius at Sports Complex station near Akshardham, on May 5.“The maximum temperature is likely to stay around 42 and 44 degrees Celsius on Thursday and Friday, respectively. It is likely to touch 45 degrees Celsius on Saturday, leading to heatwave conditions. A few stations in outer Delhi may see mercury surpassing 45 degrees Celsius by one to two degrees,” said a met official.In summer 2023, no heatwave was seen at Safdarjung. However, other parts were in the grip of a heatwave for three to five days. The year 2022 saw the longest streak of heatwaves -- nine days in April and four in May.Delhi’s air, meanwhile, continued to remain in the ‘poor’ category for the third consecutive day, with an AQI of 243. The air quality is likely to stay poor for the next few days.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), which reviewed the air quality, said, “Wind direction and speeds are rapidly changing due to high convection rates and absolute dry conditions, coupled with high temperatures, leading to continued suspension of dust over NCR. It was deliberated that higher instances of agricultural residue burning in and around NCR areas and the forest fires in nearby states could also be having an impact on the overall air quality of Delhi-NCR.”Deciding not to implement GRAP’s stage I, CAQM directed agencies to intensify dust abatement measures at hotspots, C&D sites and road construction or maintenance projects.“Keep a close watch on fire instances and open burning of municipal solid waste in and around NCR, and ensure all preventive measures.

Warren Buffett's latest bet: Berkshire reveals $6.7 billion investment in insurance giant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffetts-latest-bet-berkshire-reveals-6-7-billion-investment-in-insurance-giant/articleshow/110175706.cms,"NEW DELHI: Legendary investor Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a significant investment in the insurance giant Chubb , marking a major move that was kept confidential until now. The stake, amounting to nearly 26 million shares, was disclosed in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, representing a value of approximately $6.7 billion.This investment in Chubb highlights Buffett's ongoing strategy of investing heavily in financial firms. Berkshire Hathaway, under Buffett's leadership, has historically favored the insurance sector, owning companies such as Geico, National Indemnity, and General Re.Berkshire owns many other companies — including BNSF railroad, a number of utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies — but insurers, like Geico and General Reinsurance, have always been at the core of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. So it makes sense that another insurer like Zurich-based Chubb might appeal to Buffett.CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said in a note to investors that Chubb is now one of the 10 biggest holdings in Berkshire's portfolio. “We can’t speculate whether Berkshire would pursue an outright acquisition of CB, but we note their business mixes are highly complementary,"" Seifert wrote.Berkshire had previously requested ""confidential treatment"" from the SEC to keep the buildup of this position private. The disclosure of this substantial investment comes after Chubb recently made headlines for underwriting a nearly $92 million appeal bond for President Donald Trump in the defamation lawsuit filed by E Jean Carroll.Following the revelation of Berkshire's new stake, Chubb's stock experienced an 8% surge in after-hours trading, reflecting investor confidence boosted by Buffett’s involvement.This move is part of a broader trend where Berkshire Hathaway has been concentrating its investments in financial entities, including Ally Financial, American Express, and Bank of America, while reducing stakes in consumer products. Notably, Buffett’s firm scaled back its holdings in Apple and HP significantly in recent months.Berkshire sold off a little over 116 million Apple shares in the quarter — accounting for about 13% of its stake — to trim its biggest single investment. But it still holds nearly 790 million Apple shares, and Buffett told shareholders that he expected the iPhone maker to remain a long-term holding.The investment community closely watches Buffett's investment choices, often emulating his strategies, which underscores the significant market impact of his decisions.(With inputs from agencies)","Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a significant investment in the insurance giant Chubb.

Sutskever remained an OpenAI employee, but he never returned to work.""This is an emotional day for all of us,"" Altman said in an interview.

As a graduate student at the University of Toronto, he had been part of an AI breakthrough involving neural networks -- the technology that has driven the field's progress over the past decade.In late 2022, OpenAI wowed the world with the release of ChatGPT, an online chatbot that could answer questions, write poetry, generate computer code and chat a lot like people. The tech industry quickly embraced what is called generative artificial intelligence -- technologies that can generate text, images and other media on their own.The result of more than a decade of research inside companies like OpenAI and Google, generative AI is poised to remake everything from email programs to internet search engines and digital assistants.Altman became a spokesperson for the shift toward generative AI, testifying before Congress and meeting with lawmakers, regulators and investors around the world. In November, OpenAI's board of directors unexpectedly ousted him, saying he could no longer be trusted with the company's plan to eventually create artificial general intelligence.The OpenAI board had six people: three founders and three independent members. Sutskever voted with the three outsiders to remove Altman as CEO and chair of the board, saying -- without providing specifics -- that Altman had not been ""consistently candid in his communications.""Greg Brockman, OpenAI's chief operating officer and another co-founder, resigned from the company in protest. So did Pachocki.Days later, as hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Sutskever said he regretted his decision to remove Altman and effectively stepped down from the board, leaving three independent members in opposition to Altman.Altman returned as CEO after he and the board agreed to replace two members with Bret Taylor, a former Salesforce executive, and Lawrence Summers, a former U.S. Treasury secretary. Altman regained his board seat several months later, as the board expanded to seven people.Last year, Sutskever helped create a Super Alignment team inside OpenAI to explore ways of ensuring that future versions of the technology would not do harm. Like others in the field, he had grown increasingly concerned that AI could become dangerous and perhaps even destroy humanity.Jan Leike, who ran the Super Alignment team alongside Sutskever, has also resigned from OpenAI. His role will be taken by John Schulman , another company co-founder.In the weeks leading up to Altman's ouster, Pachocki, who helped oversee the creation of GPT-4, the technology at the heart of ChatGPT, was promoted to director of research at the company. After occupying a position below Sutskever, he was elevated to a position alongside him, two people familiar with the moves said.After Altman was reinstated, Sutskever did not return to work. Altman indicated that he was hoping to negotiate his return, but ultimately that was not possible.Pachocki has effectively served as chief scientist since November. After Sutskever recruited him and others to join OpenAI, he was among the key researchers on several of the company's most important projects, including, most notably, GPT-4.""I am grateful to Ilya,"" Pachocki said in an interview. ""We have different and in many ways complementary styles of leadership.""Altman said he talked with Sutskever on Tuesday. ""He has pushed us -- and will continue to push us -- to, as he says, feel the AGI,"" Altman said.","Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and chief scientist at OpenAI, is leaving the company. He joined three other board members to force out Sam Altman, the company's high-profile CEO. Altman returned to OpenAI just five days after he was ousted, reasserting his control. The company is valued at more than $80 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110130795,imgsize-953075,width-400,resizemode-4/110130795.jpg"
Fed's Powell downplays potential for a rate hike despite higher price pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/feds-powell-downplays-potential-for-a-rate-hike-despite-higher-price-pressures/articleshow/110125324.cms,"WASHINGTON: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the central bank is unlikely to raise its key interest rate in response to signs of stubborn inflation and underscored his view that price increases would soon start to cool again.Yet Powell, during a panel discussion in Amsterdam, said his confidence that inflation will ease ""is not as high as it was"" because price increases have been persistently hot in the first three months of this year.Powell stressed that the Fed's preferred approach was to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak rather than increase it.""I don't think that it's likely, based on the data that we have, that the next move that we make would be a rate hike ,"" Powell said. ""I think it's more likely that we'll be at a place where we hold the policy rate where it is.""Financial markets and economists have been hoping for signs that one or two Fed rate cuts might be coming this year, given that inflation is down sharply from its high in 2022. But with price pressures still elevated, Powell and other Fed officials have signaled that no rate cut is likely anytime soon.Powell spoke hours after a report on U.S. producer prices showed that wholesale inflation picked up in April. On Wednesday, the government will issue the latest monthly report on consumer inflation, which is expected to show that price growth cooled a bit last month.In his remarks Tuesday, Powell downplayed the wholesale price report, which also showed that some costs cooled last month, including for airfares, hospital visits and car insurance.""I wouldn't call it hot,"" he said of the wholesale inflation data. ""I would call it sort of mixed.""Economists are divided over whether the high inflation figures this year reflect a re-acceleration in price growth or are largely echoes of pandemic distortions. Auto insurance, for example, has soared 22% from a year ago, but that surge may reflect factors specific to the auto industry: New car prices jumped during the pandemic, and insurance companies are now seeking to offset the higher repair and replacement costs by raising their premiums.Other economists point to consistent consumer spending on restaurant meals, travel and entertainment, categories where in some cases price increases have also been elevated, possibly reflecting strong demand.Powell said that upcoming inflation reports will reveal whether such factors are keeping inflation high or whether inflation will soon fall back to the Fed's 2% target, as he said he expects. Inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in the summer of 2022, is forecast to slow to 3.4% in Wednesday's latest report.The Fed chair noted that rising rents are one key factor keeping inflation high. He called that ""a bit of a puzzle"" because measures of new apartment leases show new rents barely increasing. Such weaker data has apparently yet to flow into the government's measures, which cover all rents, including for tenants who renew their leases. Though rents are still growing faster for tenants who renew leases, Powell said the government's measures should eventually show rent growth easing.The Fed chair also acknowledged that the economy ""is different this time"" because so many Americans refinanced their mortgages at very low rates before the Fed began raising borrowing costs in March 2022. Many large businesses also locked in low rates at that time.""It may be,"" he said, that the Fed's rate policy ""is hitting the economy not quite as strongly as it would have if those two things were not the case.""Last week, Fed officials underscored that they were prepared to leave their key interest rate at 5.3%, the highest level in 23 years, as long as needed quell inflation.","Jerome Powell says the Fed's preferred approach is to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak.

""Elon is going to be the biggest loser here. A few years ago, I exchanged emails with him about the risks in China.I warned him they would rob him blind and urged him to consider moving manufacturing to India instead, where he would have dominated the market by now.""The entrepreneur quoted a post by the Director of Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies, Theresa Fallon which read, ""Why US & European Automakers Are Failing In China. The hubris of companies who only looked for short term gain while transferring tech, management techniques & know how to China. It was good while it lasted but that era is over.

Wrong to think Tesla is too pricey for India, look at how Apple is dominating once they got local in manuf and retail. India is set to be its third biggest market very soon.""Another wrote, ""India has sold cumulative of ~165K EV’s till date, most Indians can’t afford an EV, they aren’t practical On the contrary Tesla China itself sells about the same number of cars in ~2 months, excluding exports it would have been a disastrous decision to move India before China.""This comment came after Musk cancelled his planned visit to India last month and said that he has postponed it due to unforeseen tasks at Tesla but days after made a visit to China.There, the billionaire won concessions for Tesla where he was seen meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang. It was also reported that Elon Musk's visit helped Tesla make progress in rolling out its advanced driver assistance package in China.","Indian American entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa called billionaire Elon Musk's decision to choose China over India for Testla's manufacturing unit ""going to be the biggest loser"" ""I warned him they would rob him blind and urged him to consider moving manufacturing to India instead, where he would have dominated the market by now""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110120892,imgsize-36640,width-400,resizemode-4/110120892.jpg"

This utility distinguishes KangaMoon from the plethora of altcoins that are driven exclusively by hype. Another differentiator for KangaMoon is in its strategic distribution of free KANG tokens, which are given to the most active users on social media platforms such as X (Twitter), incentivising community engagement.Through this approach, the project has sparked a surge in users actively following and sharing social media content. Currently, the project is at the Bonus Stage of the presale, priced at $0.025, which also reflects a significant 400% increase from its initial valuation of $0.005 and putting it as one of the top altcoins in 2024.

Saudi Arabia concerns stall China-Arab free trade talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/saudi-arabia-concerns-stall-china-arab-free-trade-talks/articleshow/110117791.cms,"DUBAI: Negotiations between China and an Arab bloc for a free trade agreement have stalled over concerns by Saudi Arabia that cheap Chinese imports could undermine its ambitions to transform the kingdom into an industrial powerhouse, sources say.Saudi Arabia has backed renewed efforts over the past two years for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the Arab bloc which includes the kingdom, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, among others, to finally seal a long sought deal with China.But five sources briefed on the negotiations said the sides were at an impasse over Saudi reservations with a list of goods put forward by Beijing to be exempt from Gulf import duties.Saudi Arabia is worried that a wave of lower cost Chinese versions of products that it hopes to manufacture domestically would be damaging to its industrial agenda, the sources said.Saud Arabia's government communication office, the GCC Secretariat and China's commerce ministry did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the trade negotiations.The kingdom, the world's biggest oil exporter, has a nascent manufacturing industry that the government hopes will one day make everything from computer chips to tires as part of a wider economic transformation plan to create a vibrant private sector.Saudi Arabia is spending trillions of dollars developing its economy under that program, known as Vision 2030, driven by the country's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .Prince Mohammed wants Saudi Arabia to not only lessen its dependence on oil rents by creating a strong private sector but also to transform the kingdom into a major global business hub.The industrial part of that transformation plan faces challenges even without competing with lower cost Chinese goods. That includes finding skilled workers among its citzens in a country where about 60% of the 32 million population are Saudi nationals.To build its own manufacturing industry, Saudi Arabia is partnering with foreign firms, including from China, to develop local capabilities and manufacturing lines in the kingdom.The sources said a China-Gulf trade deal was not off the table but that the Saudis and the Chinese would likely have to settle on some sort of compromise to see the deal finalised.Gulf officials last October spoke of reaching a deal soon. China's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Chen Weiqing was quoted by local media in January as saying that although progress had been made, there were difficult issues that needed to be resolved.China and the GCC, which also includes Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain, started trade talks almost 20 years ago. But the loose political and economic Arab bloc has finalised very few deals. It signed a free trade agreement with South Korea in December.China is a massive buyer of Gulf energy and in 2023 bilateral trade between China and the Gulf stood at $286.9 billion, according to Chinese customs data, with Saudi Arabia accounting for nearly 40% of trade between the Gulf and China.China and the Gulf states have deepened economic cooperation in recent years, to the concern of the United States, which has long been the core security partner of the Gulf Arab states.US officials have increasingly sought to drive a wedge between the Gulf states and China, including issuing ultimatums to pick between American and Chinese technology.","Negotiations between China and an Arab bloc for a free trade agreement have stalled.
