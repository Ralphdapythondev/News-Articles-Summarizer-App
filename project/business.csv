"VinFast, Tesla’s rival, to soon drive into India with locally assembled electric vehicles; likely to sell cars in Rs 25-30 lakh range",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vinfast-teslas-rival-to-soon-drive-into-india-with-locally-assembled-electric-vehicles-likely-to-sell-cars-in-rs-25-30-lakh-range/articleshow/111445763.cms,"VinFast India Plans

VinFast, a Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer, has decided to enter the Indian market with locally assembled models, signaling a change from its initial plan of selling only imported EVs in the country. VinFast is widely seen as a rival to Elon Musk ’s Tesla in the EV space.The company's new factory in Tamil Nadu is expected to start operations in the first half of 2025, six months earlier than planned.According to an ET report, the first locally assembled car from VinFast is anticipated to be launched during the 2025 festive season, with prices ranging from Rs 25-30 lakh, positioning them in the premium affordable segment of India's rapidly growing EV market. The models are expected to offer a driving range of 300-500 kilometers.By opting for the completely knocked down (CKD) route, VinFast can avoid high import duties and offer its products at competitive prices in the Indian market. India imposes a 100% import duty on car models with a CIF value exceeding $40,000 and a 70% duty on models with a CIF value below $40,000. In contrast, CKD kits are subject to a 15% duty.VinFast anticipates that local assembly and competitive pricing will enable it to reach a peak capacity of 50,000 units in its first year of operations. The company expects India's nascent electric car market to conclude the current calendar year with 150,000 units, an increase from 90,000 units in 2023. VinFast is expected to reveal its plans for India at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo, which is scheduled to take place between January 17 and 22, 2025.The source was quoted as saying, ""The local assembly of models gives greater confidence to suppliers, dealers, and the buyers. The company will rather use what it saves on duties in brand building and marketing. As the plant is expected to be ready in the first quarter of next calendar year, it makes sense to take the CKD instead of CBU (completely built unit) route.""Although VinFast's Indian venture does not depend on the Indian government's new EV policy announced on March 15, the company eagerly awaits the policy guidelines to determine whether to take advantage of the incentives, according to the person mentioned earlier. The first meeting between EV companies and government officials to discuss the new EV policy occurred on April 19, with a VinFast official present among other industry executives.Also Read | China+1 strategy a success for smartphones?

The policy requires a minimum investment of $500 million and allows the import of up to 8,000 cars per year at a reduced import duty of 15% for models priced at least $35,000. This concession is valid for five years from the date of the government's approval letter.In line with this policy, VinFast has announced its intention to invest over Rs 4,150 crore ($500 million) in the next 5 years to construct a manufacturing facility near Chennai, in Thoothukudi.The factory, spread across 400 acres, will have an annual production capacity of 150,000 units.

Sebi sends Hindenburg notice on Adani report 'manipulation',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-sends-hindenburg-notice-on-adani-report-manipulation/articleshow/111444661.cms,"MUMBAI: Sebi has issued a show-cause notice to Hindenburg, asking why it should not act against the short-seller for violating norms related to the ""prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trading practices in the securities market"".The notice, dated June 26, was released online by Hindenburg , which took a defiant stand, charging Sebi with not acting on allegations in its Adani report.Hindenburg described the notice as ""nonsense"" and ""nebulous"" and alleged attempts to silence the firm. Hindenburg claimed it only made $4 million from the operation, which resulted in a $153 billion drop in Adani group's valuation.In a statement, Hindenburg said: ""Sebi has neglected its responsibility, seemingly doing more to protect those perpetrating fraud than to protect the investors being victimised by it.""The thrust of Sebi's notice is that the research firm colluded with its investor partner, misled the public, and used non-public information to manipulate prices and profit from its action. Sebi has alleged that the partner, Kingdon Capital, knew about Hindenburg's research on Adani group before the report was made public and there was a profit-sharing agreement between the two. As per Sebi, Kingdon agreed to share 30% of its net profits from trading securities related to Adani with Hindenburg in exchange for receiving the report two months in advance.In a fresh twist in the Hindenburg saga, the US short seller said that Kotak Mahindra International created the offshore fund structure used by its investor partner Kingdon Capital to short Adani stocks before its report was published in Jan 2023. Kotak Mahindra Bank informed stock exchanges late on Tuesday that Sebi's showcause notice to Hindenburg and Kingdon included a fund managed by Kotak Mahindra International (KMIL).""KMIL was informed by Kingdon that the transactions were made on a principal basis, i.e. for themselves.

This recent round of layoffs includes approximately 100 employees from crucial areas like business development and marketing, while the rest are from the sales department. The company confirmed that this move is part of efforts to streamline operations and enhance business efficiency to align with its goals and vision for the year.This marks Unacademy's third round of layoffs in three years.In March 2023, the company reduced its workforce by 12%, equivalent to around 380 employees. Prior to that, in April 2022, Unacademy had laid off approximately 1,000 contractual and full-time employees.“As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline operations and enhance business efficiency, we have recently undergone a restructuring exercise. This was necessary keeping in mind the company’s goals and vision for the year, as we focus all our efforts on sustainable growth and profitability. Consequently, some roles have been impacted,” the company stated. Unacademy counts Peak XV Partners and General Atlantic among its investors.Last month, Hemesh Singh, co-founder of Unacademy, stepped down as Chief Technology Officer, transitioning into an advisory role.On May 31, it was reported that after an initial surge in online business due to the pandemic, Unacademy experienced a slowdown. In response, the company has shifted focus towards expanding its offline presence in the test preparation segment. This move positions Unacademy to compete with companies such as Byju’s-owned Aakash, Bodhi Tree-backed Allen Career Institute, and GSV Ventures-backed PhysicsWallah.Unacademy began as a YouTube channel in 2010, created by Gaurav Munjal, Roman Saini, and Hemesh Singh. It evolved into a full-fledged edtech platform in 2015 and currently generates a significant portion of its revenue from its offline business.In December, CEO Gaurav Munjal informed employees that the company had Rs 1,800 crore (approximately $216 million) in reserves, providing a cash runway of four years. According to Munjal, Unacademy had reduced its cash burn by 60% in 2023 and aimed to extend its runway to eight years by 2024 through further reductions in burn.The startup's financials show that its losses narrowed 41% to Rs 1,678 crore in FY23, while revenue increased by 26% to Rs 907 crore during the same period.

'Union Budget to send India’s soaring stocks higher',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-sensex-nifty-indians-stocks/articleshow/111473513.cms,"India’s $5 trillion stock market stands to gain as much as 20% for the entire year, buoyed by government spending and continued momentum in corporate earnings, according to market watchers.The upcoming government budget will likely boost consumer spending and infrastructure building, which bode well for businesses, strategists and investors surveyed by Bloomberg said.More than half of the 24 respondents estimated that the NSE Nifty 50 Index may advance up to 26,000 points by the end of 2024, while one predicted the gauge can climb even more.The benchmark index has risen 12% so far this year to a record.A diminished majority for Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party in the recent elections has prompted investors to raise bets in the consumer sector on expectations the government will shift toward more populist measures to shore up support. An early monsoon also boosted the prospects for companies involved with crops such as rice, corn and soybeans.“Corporate earnings for the year gone by had been robust on the back of margin tailwinds and may grow above trend in financial year 2025, keeping India’s medium-term growth story intact,” said Bino Pathiparampil, head of research at Mumbai-based Elara Capital.Of those surveyed, 13 projected earnings growth for Nifty components to remain robust, while five others said optimism on future earnings was overdone.Analysts estimated earnings per share of MSCI India Index’s companies for all of calendar year 2024 to increase 15.6% on-year, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence showed. In comparison, Chinese firms are expected to post a 10% rise in their EPS for the same period.Investors are now turning their attention to the budget, due this month, which will lay out Modi’s policy priorities under a new coalition government. Half of the survey’s respondents expect the administration’s top priority would be a mix of incentives to support consumption while continuing with its capital expenditure push for infrastructure.But a quarter of them said the capex push would be the government’s main priority. Another quarter thought boosting consumer demand would be on top of their to-do list.The respondents’ views largely match their expectation that consumer discretionary stocks offered the most promising outlook. Financial and commodities shares were their next favorites.“The government can please everyone with higher capex, social spending and yet a tighter fiscal,” thanks to larger tax revenue and bumper dividend payout from the central bank, Jefferies Financial Group Inc strategists including Mahesh Nandurkar wrote in a note on June 24.The budget will be positive for the sectors related to affordable housing, capex plays, consumer and rate-sensitive businesses, they said.","More than half of the 24 respondents estimated that the NSE Nifty 50 Index may advance up to 26,000 points by the end of 2024.

"What to buy? Keep good company, go for large caps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-to-buy-keep-good-company-go-for-large-caps-sensex-80000/articleshow/111473162.cms,"MUMBAI: The sensex has recorded a new high. Should you sit back and wait for a correction? Well, as veteran investor Peter Lynch famously put it: ""Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves.""In the rear-view mirror, all past milestones like 50,000 and 75,000 look like buying opportunities (see top graphic).You would have earned double-digit returns even if you bought at earlier 'record high' levels.""The market has reached at least one new all-time high every calendar year for last 8 years straight. In 2024 itself, the sensex has closed at new life-time highs 25 times. It could be intimidating to invest when markets are trading at new highs... but one would have been left out if they kept waiting for the perfect opportunity,"" said Apurva Sheth, head (market perspectives & research) at Samco Securities.The 10,000-point jump from 70k to 80k translates to 14.4% growth. The 80k-90k journey will require just 12.5% gain. Investing consistently, irrespective of new highs, remains a sensible policy.The key question then is to what to invest in? ""Valuations for large caps are more favourable as mid & small-cap valuations are ahead of their long-term averages. In the current market environment, we prefer investments in flexi-cap strategies with a large-cap bias while still allocating tactically to mid and small-caps,"" said Virendra Somwanshi, head (wealth management & capital markets) at Bank of Baroda.He added that investors should invest with a horizon of more than 5 years and in a staggered approach.Stock prices shouldn't be seen in isolation. Their valuation, or the price that you pay for future earnings, is a key factor. ""Efficiently managed companies grow more than the sensex. If demand in an economy is growing then, then well-managed companies' profitability is likely to grow. And if profitability grows then stock prices will also grow,"" said Sheth.Another reason why investors should stay put is that the rally has global support - the S& has outperformed the sensex so far in this year.""Perhaps the most significant factor is that the rally has fundamental support. If we achieve above 7% GDP growth in FY25, India would have clocked 7% growth for 4 years in a row, making the country an outlier. Corporate earnings also are decent with FY24 Nifty earnings growing at an impressive 24%,"" said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.If you need reasons to worry, the major risk is high valuations in the broader market, Vijayakumar said.

Valuations are up... will profits keep pace?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/valuations-are-up-will-profits-keep-pace/articleshow/111473312.cms,"(The writer is head of equity, SBI MF)

The sensex hit 80,000 intraday on Wednesday, while Nifty is well over 24,000 points. Both flagship indices have returned nearly 25% over the last one year, creating wealth for investors and making India one of the hottest markets in the world. Keeping that on one side, the market is currently trading at 24.7x trailing earnings versus a 20-year average of 20.4x (at the 88th percentile).So, what has been driving the markets and more importantly, what's next?The superior returns were triggered by a stable macroeconomic profile, improving corporate profitability as well as strong liquidity. On the macro side, fiscal consolidation, a focus on capital spends and moderating inflation have boded well for India. The recent GDP growth print of 8.2% was also a positive surprise for market participants.From a corporate profitability point of view, from FY18's low of 1.3%, India's corporate profits as % of GDP have dramatically improved to 5.5% in FY23. Liquidity has been strong too, providing a cushion to the markets. In 2023, FIIs bought $21.4 billion, while domestic institutions bought $22.3 billion. The vast improvement seen in systematic investments into mutual funds is particularly heartening. SIPs - which stood at Rs 8,500 crore in FY20 - amounted to Rs 20,900 crore in May of 2024. Even as these numbers explain what has happened in recent years, the question still remains: what now? And what next?Equity market returns are a function of three factors: Fundamentals, valuations and sentiments.On corporate fundamentals, India is anchored by a strong combination of macro stability and improving corporate profitability. Key macro data points like electricity generation, bank credit, GST collections and steel consumption continue to point towards a healthy business cycle. Our reading point towards a recovery in the rural sector. Consumption has been the weak link in the macro composition. The consumer confidence index is currently hovering in the neutral territory, compared to it being negative over the last few years. This points to a gradual improvement in consumption demand.Earnings for Nifty companies are expected to grow at a CAGR of about 18% between FY23-26, pointing to a robust growth outlook. As against this positivity, one needs to consider the vitiated global geopolitical environment and the general low-growth environment prevailing in major economies.As such, valuations are the weakest link in the equation. At the current level of valuations, corporate earnings need to surprise us in the positive direction to provide comfort, which, in the near term, is questionable. A cushion for valuations can come in the form of a moderation in bond yields. The 10-year bond yield, which was approximately 7.5% at the peak of the current cycle, is at a level marginally below 7%.Sentiment is a contrarian factor. If the sentiment among market participants is robust, that's a trigger for investors to be cautious. And if the sentiment is pessimistic, that's when they would want to be more bullish. Current data from the 'equity sentiment indicator' shows that investor sentiment is very bullish. This warrants caution in the near term. While there's optimism over Indian corporates' growth prospects and their potential to deliver on earnings in the long term, current expensive valuations and elevated sentiments mean that one needs to be cautious in the near future.","The sensex hit 80,000 intraday on Wednesday, while Nifty is well over 24,000 points.

top sensex gainers since 40,000 pts

MUMBAI: The 30-scrip Bombay Stock Exchange sensex crossed the 80,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday, gaining 10,000 points in six and a half months, recording its fastest 10k rally in history.The country's stock market has seen a stratospheric rise, reaching new milestones with spectacular regularity driven by a surge in retail investors and middle class India flocking to the market and lending strength to the support from foreign investors.Some experts say the sensex is poised for much higher gains after the Union Budget later this month, with some predicting it could reach 87,000 levels by the end of the year.The rally was driven by HDFC Bank , which has the highest weightage in the sensex following the merger of HDFC with its banking arm. The NSE Nifty 50 closed with a gain of 0.7% at 24,286.5 points, while the sensex too increased by 0.7% to reach 79,986.8 points.Shares of HDFC Bank gained 2.2% following the publication of its shareholding for the quarter ended June 2024. The shareholding revealed foreign holding in the bank had dipped to 54.8%.Ironically, it was the sale of shares by foreign investors that triggered a re-rating of the stock.The dip in foreign holding below 55%, increases floating stock available for global investors to a threshold level where its weightage in the MSCI Emerging Market Index is increased.According to a research report, HDFC Bank's weightage in MSCI index could increase from 3.8% to around 7.5%. This could result in inflows of $3-$4 billion.Adani Ports was the top gainer in the sensex on Wednesday despite Hindenburg Research being in the news again after it repeated its allegations against the group in a reply to Sebi ’s showcause notice.Adani Ports share price rose 2.5% on Wednesday, driven by its inclusion in the benchmark index this week. The company on Tuesday had also reported a big jump in container traffic handled in its port.“Optimism in global equities weighed positively on Indian markets, which also propelled gains in other sectoral stocks, including the telecom counters. HDFC Bank led the recovery on the back of a potential increase in the bank’s weightage in the MSCI Emerging Markets index,” said Prashanth Tapse, senior VP, Mehta Equities.Over a 5-year period, since the sensex hit 40,000, the top sensex gainers have been Tata Motors & Mahindra, surging 426% and 358%, respectively.“The bulls have regained control from the bears, pushing the Nifty above 24,300. This shift in sentiment has once again favoured long trades in the market. Moving forward, the trend might remain strong in the near term as long as it stays above 24,000. On the higher end, the index might move towards 24,500. However, a fall below 24,000 could lead the index into consolidation,” said Rupak De, senior technical analyst, LKP Securities.","Bombay Stock Exchange sensex crossed the 80,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday.

Retail investors chant buy-buy amid FPIs’ buy & bye,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/retail-investors-chant-buy-buy-amid-fpis-buy-bye-stock-market-80k/articleshow/111473315.cms,"MUMBAI: In the five years that the sensex took to double to 80,000, retail investors have emerged as a counterbalance to deep-pocketed foreign funds who have held sway on Dalal Street for decades. A steady rise in investments by individuals, especially through mutual funds, has fed the bull rally that kicked off after the Covid crash in March 2020.Retail investors didn’t take their feet off the gas even as foreign fund managers grappled with the impact of global disruptions like the pandemic, wars & spikes in inflation and interest rates.In a way, individuals who invest their savings in stocks and mutual funds, often through mobile apps, are partly responsible for furthering the bull run that attracted them to equities in the first place.While the exact number of individual investors in India is difficult to ascertain, the surge in demat accounts & monthly mutual fund SIP amounts can help tell a story.Consider this: In May 2019, when the sensex hit 40,000 for the first time, the number of demat accounts stood at about 3.6 crore and monthly MF SIPs hovered around Rs 8,000 crore. In five years, demat accounts have more than quad rupled to 15.1 crore and MF SIP flows have nearly tripled to Rs 21,000 crore.“Even though foreign fund holdings in Indian markets are at historically low levels (16% as against a peak of 24% ownership), Indian markets are at all-time-high levels... and a leading factor for this is the enhancedmarket participation by retail investors,” said Vi rendra Somwanshi, head (wealth management & capital markets) at Bank of Baroda.Among the reasons for the surge in retail participation in Indian equity markets is improving financial literacy, and improved digital infra & platforms that allow seamless KYC, onboarding & transactions, Somwanshi said.With surging SIP flows and stock prices , the value of assets managed (AUM) by the mutual fund industry has more than doubled to Rs 59 lakh crore from 26 lakh crore in five years. “This is a testament of investors’ wealth creation when following a long-term investment approach. MFs have aided in financialisation of Indian households even though the journey is still in the initial stages,” said Swarup Mohanty, vicechairman & CEO, Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India).The SIP-driven rise of individual investors has provided mutual fund companies with ammunition, which they deployed effectively amid bouts of foreign fund selloffs. “Domestic investors in India, through direct and indirect investments, have ensured that ‘Sell in May and go away’ remains an adage, despite the sustained FPI selling in May after April, with nearly $2.8 billion of outflows,” NSE chief economist Tirthankar Patnaik wrote in a report.The share of the number of companies with over 50,000 individual shareholders has more than doubled in the last 10 years to 45.1%, NSE data showed. While there are currently 55 companies that have over 10 lakh individual shareholders, this number was just 7 a decade ago, the report showed.Even after this wave of individuals entering the stock market, the share of retail stock market investors at around 10% of India’s population pales when compared to the nearly 60% share in the US.","Retail investors have emerged as a counterbalance to deep-pocketed foreign funds.

Global agencies expect India’s growth rate to be around 7% for at least the next three years, driven by strong domestic demand. It is anticipated that a robust monsoon will help in the revival of rural demand, adding to overall optimism. Policy stability and expectations that reforms will continue after the swearing in of the new govt have also helped in boosting sentiment. China’s economic woes have prompted investors to look at India as a safe bet too.“India has emerged as the fastest-growing large economy with healthy medium-term prospects.

They are detailed as follows:

In the labour market, to strike a balance between employee security and flexibility through labour laws, formalisation of employment, and compliance measures.

Continue providing impetus to the private sector by promoting the ease of doing business through reduction of regulatory bottlenecks and bureaucratic hurdles by simplifying regulations, expediting permits and approvals, and promoting digitalisation.

Boost financial markets by promoting innovation and competition, address concerns related to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), and improve corporate governance guidelines.

Hasten infrastructure development through increased Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and strategic investments, with special emphasis being placed on sectors such as transportation, energy, water supply and digital infrastructure to ensure comprehensive development.

Place emphasis on agricultural reforms such as contact farming, investment in agri-infrastructure, crop diversification and easy incorporation into the value-chain - thereby enhancing productivity, diversifying potential income streams and increasing access to the market.

Simplify and make efficient the tax regime to increase investments, enhance compliance, and broaden the tax base - through reduced corporate tax rates and decreased tax exemptions.

Address climate-related matters and enhance sustainability, encourage adoption of green technologies and renewable sources of energy, along with incentivising clean practices across sectors.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July. Like every year, salaried individuals are looking at FM Sitharaman to provide tax relief in the form of reduced tax rates, changed income tax slabs and even higher deductions.One such relief that is sought is to include more non-metro cities in the 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption list.HRA is a common component of employee compensation packages provided by many employers.Employees receiving HRA and paying rent for their accommodation can claim a tax exemption on the allowance under the old income tax regime. The exemption amount depends on whether the employee resides in a metro city or not for tax purposes. However, if an employee receiving HRA does not live in a rented house, the entire allowance becomes fully taxable.According to an ET report quoting Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, the Income-tax Act, 1961, under Section 10(13A), provides tax exemption for HRA. The amount of HRA that can be claimed as tax exempt is the lowest of the following:1. Actual HRA received;2. Actual Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary;3. 50% of basic salary (for metro cities)/40% of basic salary (for non-metro cities).Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report - top 5 points Currently, rented houses in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for a 50% exemption from HRA, while those in other locations fall under the 40% category. It is important to note that this classification was established over three decades ago, according to Viswanathan.As cities have expanded in terms of population and economic growth, it has become necessary to re-evaluate the way we define metro and non-metro cities.Interestingly, the Constitution (seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, also recognizes the National Capital Region (NCR), Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad as metro cities. Despite this, the HRA tax exemption for salaried individuals in these cities remains at 40% due to outdated tax laws.Also Read | Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime Residing outside of metro cities can result in a higher proportion of one's income being paid in taxes. For instance, an individual living in Bengaluru may have to pay a higher average rent compared to someone residing in Kolkata or Chennai, which are classified as metro cities for tax purposes.Those living in rapidly developing non-metro cities, as defined by the Income-tax Act, may pay higher rents due to rapid urbanization. But, they receive lower tax benefits for house rent compared to metro cities. With an increasing number of people relocating to these non-metro cities for employment, it is crucial for the government to reassess the regulations for claiming rent exemptions to alleviate the financial strain on taxpayers, feel experts.",Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

Industry needs to boost capital investments to capitalise on growth opportunities: Anand Mahindra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/industry-needs-to-boost-capital-investments-to-capitalise-on-growth-opportunities-anand-mahindra/articleshow/111465064.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian companies need to enhance capital investment in order to take advantage of the growth opportunities available in India and abroad, according to Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra .Addressing shareholders in the company's annual report for 2023-24, the leading industrialist noted that the interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-Covid era has seen India's position strengthen.India's emerging role as one of the vital nodes in future-proofed supply chains across industries opens the door for growth within the country and expansion beyond, he stated.""How can we, in private industry , ensure that we ride this upsurging tide? ..In the spirit of 'ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country', I would argue that the most important thing industry can do at this critical juncture is to increase private investment ,"" Mahindra said.Private capital investment is the key to capitalising on this opportunity as it is a key driver of growth, jobs, and demand, he stated.After the economic reforms of the 1990s, private investment rose from around 10 per cent to around 27 per cent of GDP, however, from 2011-12 onwards, private investment as a percentage of GDP has been falling to a worrisome level, Mahindra stated.""We need to remedy that situation,"" he added.Mahindra noted that the problem is not one of resources—rather, it is one of mindset.Particularly after Covid, Indian companies have become increasingly risk averse, sticking to the tried and true rather than blazing new trails, he said.""To some extent, this is understandable. But when opportunity beckons, when private industry can make a significant difference, it is time to set aside our fear of failure and take a leap of faith and self-belief,"" he noted.It is undoubtedly a good time to be an Indian company, Mahindra said.""The interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-COVID era has seen India's position strengthen. A new multi-polar manufacturing world is emerging, as nations and companies rush to reconfigure their supply chains to be more resilient and diversified. India has emerged as a key beneficiary,"" he added.For private industry, particularly manufacturing, this confluence of factors translates into an excellent chance to be a serious player in this new, multi-polar world, Mahindra stated.He noted that India has been heavily investing in infrastructure and logistics and the country has become the cheapest manufacturing destination in the world.""Externally too, conditions are working in our favour. It's time to seize the day,"" he stated.Elaborating on the Mahindra Group, he said, ""On the back of this rising tide, we are stepping up our investments. We have already announced an investment of Rs 37,000 crore across our auto, farm and services businesses (excluding Tech Mahindra) in FY25, FY26 and FY27.""These investments will, to a large extent, go towards building capacity, with a pipeline of 26 new models/facelifts in the next 5 years, he said.The valuation of the company's growth gems increased over fourfold in the last four years, Mahindra said.The contribution of services businesses (Mahindra Finance, Tech Mahindra and growth gems) to M&M's net cash generation was almost Rs 7,000 crore over the FY22-FY24 period, he said.Mahindra & Mahindra MD and CEO Anish Shah said the company recognises the fact that private capital investment plays a crucial role in maximising the opportunities in India.""By outlining a capex plan of Rs 37,000 crore for the next three years, we remain committed to our proven strategy of prudent capital allocation,"" he stated.The Mahindra Group draws confidence from the cash generation across businesses, low debt levels, and a robust balance sheet, he added.",The interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-Covid era has seen India's position strengthen.

Jayachandran Ramachandran: Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new coding benchmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/claude-3-5-sonnet-sets-new-coding-benchmarks/articleshow/111329656.cms,"Anthropic’s latest AI model , Claude 3.5 Sonnet , arrived seemingly out of nowhere last week, free to use for everyone, and is now setting new benchmarks in a number of metrics. Most notably, it aced the leader boards in key categories of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena , a benchmark used to measure large language model performance. Specifically, it secured the top position in the ‘Coding Arena’ and ‘Hard Prompts’ categories, beating industry behemoths like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro , all while being a lighter, faster model to run.Jayachandran Ramachandran , senior VP of Artificial Intelligence Labs for C5i, says the LMSYS Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced open benchmarking platform and that users perform various tasks in pair wise comparison of models and provide feedback on which models can satisfactorily provide the best response. “The ranking system is quite transparent, robust, and reliable. In recent times, the top position was occupied by frontier models such as GPT-4 series and Gemini-1.5 series. It is a significant development for Claude 3.5 Sonnet to outsmart other leading frontier models and occupy the top position, especially in coding tasks,” he says.Saurav Swaroop , co-founder & CTO of financing platform Velocity, which recently launched Vani AI , a GenAIled customer calling solution for financial institutions, says that while GPT-4 has been assisting developers with writing code for some time now, it has been prone to errors and hallucinations. “However, Claude can write production level deployable code now. This will boost developer productivity and the time to build software will keep coming down,” he says.With its advanced reasoning skills, it’s great at handling multi-step workflows too, which is essential for complex projects, says Sourabh Kumar, senior manager of experience engineering for Publicis Sapient. “Compared to other industry leaders like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers faster processing speeds and higher accuracy in complex coding and reasoning tasks. For industries such as finance, where accurate data analysis is critical, or retail, where trend prediction can drive success, integrating Claude 3.5 Sonnet can lead to significant efficiency gains and innovation,” he says.Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also offer alternative solutions that coders might not have even considered, says Bebi Negi, senior lead data scientist at the Analytics Centre of Excellence for Happiest Minds Technologies.However, Bebi says coders will still need to check the code created by the model. “While it can create code quickly, it is very important to understand the code and make sure it meets a project’s requirements and standards. Even though benchmarks rate the model at around 90%, the remaining 10% gap underscores the necessity for coders to review the outputs,” she says.Securing the top spot in the Hard Prompts category was also a big deal, says Bebi. “The Hard Prompts category was all about handling complex tasks and instructions. The model did a great job here too, showing it can understand and generate high-quality content, even when the instructions are quite tricky.”","Anthropic’s latest AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is now free to use for everyone.

GenAI: On-device AI is cheaper and faster than cloud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/on-device-ai-is-cheaper-and-faster-than-cloud/articleshow/111329501.cms,"As devices such as smartphones , laptops, tablets and cars become more intelligent and powerful with increased processing capabilities and sensors, the tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on-device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.And while AI may have started off as something very specific to image processing, it has over the past four to five years evolved and exploded, especially with GenAI coming into play, to include a lot more use cases around text processing, voice processing and multimodal use cases, said Rajesh Narayanan, vice president of engineering at Qualcomm .He was speaking on ₹AI on the Edge’ at the first edition of the ‘TechForward’ research seminar series launched by Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIITH). The series seeks to spark regular and deep academia-industry conversations around emerging technologies.Narayanan pointed out that on-device AI has evolved to offer advantages such as personalisation , privacy and security, and with lower energy consumption and costs, and better performance compared to AI on the cloud.“Today, smartphones, smartwatches, devices that are a part of home automation, devices in the car and industrial IoT are equipped with plenty of cameras and sensors and are becoming a lot more powerful with the ability to collect more data. They also have more processing capacities, leading to more context aware user experience that can lead to a much better day-to-day life for all of us,” he said.He said that for all this to become a reality, you need a very powerful AI engine, and the overall solution has to be extremely power efficient.Personalisation is a key selling point for on-device AI as all the data that was earlier being sent to the cloud, potentially compromising privacy and security, can be done on the device. On-device AI also brings down energy consumption significantly compared to running workloads on a much bigger infrastructure like the cloud.Performance too improves as processing on the device itself can enable low latency as opposed to sending the query to the cloud, as with devices like Alexa.Narayanan said on-device AI is also a lot more affordable compared to the cloud. “As we transition from traditional AI to GenAI, the cost per query is actually going up and cloud economics isn’t going to work as compared to doing it on the device,” he said.In his talk on Vision on the AI edge’, Anoop Namboodiri , who heads the Biometrics and Secure Identity Lab and is associated with the Centre for Visual Information Technology at IIITH, said computer vision is playing a key role in pushing AI, and now GenAI.","The tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on- device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.

Service bots get our lingo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/service-bots-get-our-lingo/articleshow/111329125.cms,"Moving to complex functions

Indic language capability

is a little expensive now

The other day I decided to check out an airline’s chatbot to see how it works. I keyed in: “I’m travelling with my 8-year-old son, recommend the best flight without disturbing his sleep”. It asked for my source and destination, which I gave as Chennai and Hyderabad. It asked for the date. I typed ₹Mon’ (for Monday), but it did not recognise what I meant.I typed ₹tom’, it correctly recognised it as tomorrow.The bot responded that there were no flights that “fully meet” my specified criteria and provided a bunch of options. I then asked for the cheapest flight, and non-stop flights. The options it provided were correct – I confirmed that on MakeMyTrip and Google Flights. It automatically filled the passenger list as 1 adult and 1 child for booking. It even clarified the availability of gluten free food for my fictional son.Customer support bots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs. These sophisticated generative AI-based tools are much better than their predecessors, though still far from perfect. Sometimes they ask silly questions even after being explicitly told. They struggle to recognise colloquial words, have woefully poor memory, unlike human agents. But at least you don’t have to listen to hold music for 15 minutes.The leap comes from GenAI ’s ability to understand conversations better, their ability to understand multilingual queries , and support for interfaces like voice and videos. As these systems improve, customer support will become a lot quicker and easier for users, and hugely cheaper for companies, since they won’t have to hire thousands of contact centre staff.Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, director of AI Research at Zoho Corp, says with GenAI, the next goal is to make customer assistant bots do more complex and autonomous functions. He says they could hand over the issue to human agents when it figures it can’t handle it. He says they may even be able to process warranty claims, for instance. “As soon as you reach out, the system will be able to cross-check the database for similar issues/ queries where warranty claims are applicable. A human agent will have to call a supervisor to do the same job,” he says.But these are still some time away. Even for basic customer support services, companies are being careful due to concerns around data privacy, and hallucination. Nobody, after all, wants to get into a situation like Air Canada did earlier this year when its chatbot offered a discount to a customer that it wasn’t supposed to.Chaitanya Chokkareddy, cofounder of Ozonetel, the Hyderabadbased customer experience tech provider, says the focus currently is on automating the most common, repetitive queries. Chatbots, he says, fail in non-common areas of work.He says a lot of work is happening with AI in the back-end like data analysis, summary, intent analysis, and quality control, focusing on efficiency and productivity of human customer agents and improving margins of companies. “We handle about 20 million calls per day which last about 3 to 5 minutes each, and a lot of that data is currently not accessible to managers to make better decisions on their product and services. Demand for back-end services is higher than customer facing applications,” he says.While AI assistants perform relatively well in English, their performance in Indic languages is not great. Ozonetel is building Telugu language tokenisation by working with a non-profit and 1 lakh student interns to build a Telugu database. But Indian languages, he says, cost around 5x to 10x more compared to English because of the complex tokenisation of Indian languages compared to the Roman alphabet. “AI models are charged based on usage and chatbots using Indic scripts have more tokens and hence have higher computational costs. In many cases, the costs are equivalent to a human being and so our customers don’t want to automate,” Chaitanya says.Ankush Sabharwal’s CoRover.ai also has a local language model called BharatGPT. The bot can respond to voice queries in Indian languages, and provide tailored information. It also has video chatbots with pre-generated videos and text-to-video conversion and lip sync, which can be used for purposes like internal training.Ankush says redundant workload should be automated first, and as the adoption increases, more clear use cases will emerge. He says problems like hallucination can be reduced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and use of domain-specific small models.Abhiroop Medhekar, founder & CEO of financing platform Velocity, says they have built text-to-speech and speech-to-text tech for AI-agent voice call automation. They initially used it internally and then started commercial offerings. “Some BFSI applications require an immediate response from customers, but customers frequently don’t respond to mails or WhatsApp reminders. The current robotic IVR calls are not effective either. But these GenAI-based voice calls are interactive and provide better results,” he says.","Chatbots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs.

'Overcrowding led to stampede'

NEW DELHI: In a horrifying incident, over 100 people were killed after a stampede broke out during a ' satsang ' (religious prayer meeting) in Uttar Pradesh 's Hathras .Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has taken note of the incident and formed a committee to investigate the incident.The satsang was reportedly being held by Sakar Vishwa Hari Bhole Baba , formerly known as Saurabh Kumar.According to Navbharat Times report, the baba had previously served in the intelligence department of Uttar Pradesh Police.After 17 years of service, he quit his job to embark on spiritual journey as a preacher. He is often seen giving lessons in white suit and tie.He organises satsang programs with his wife and is also known as 'Sakar Vishwa Hari Baba of Patiali'. Hundreds of people usually attend his events.While his following extends beyond UP to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, both the preacher and his acolytes maintain a distance from the media.According to a devotee, Bhole Baba had no religious mentor and soon after he took voluntary retirement from service, he had a 'vision' of the deity and since then he became inclined to spiritual pursuits. He used to hold his satsangs every Tuesday and before Hathras, he held a similar event in Mainpuri district last week.He courted controversy during the Covid pandemic period when he sought permission for a satsang in Farrukhabad district in May 2022 to be attended by only 50 people. However, the congregation grew to over 50,000, causing a major headache for the local administration.As per reports, the stampede in the Hathras event on Tuesday broke out as servitors of Bhole Baba stopped people from leaving the venue amid the heat and humidity, so that the preacher and his retinue could leave first. As permission was given to people to leave, chaos broke out, leading to the stampede.Victims, dead or unconscious, were brought to the Sikandara Rao Trauma Centre in trucks and other vehicles. The bodies were laid outside the health centre as people milled around them.One video clip showed a woman crying, sitting among five or six bodies in a truck. Another picture showed a man and a woman lying lifeless in another vehicle.Eyewitness Shakuntala Devi told PTI Videos that the stampede took place while people were leaving the venue at the end of the satsang. They fell atop each other, she said.The stampede apparently occurred due to overcrowding, Sikandra Rao police station SHO Ashish Kumar said.According to officials, a team comprising the Agra additional director general of police and the divisional commissioner of Aligarh will probe the incident.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed condolences to the families of those killed in the stampede and instructed officials to reach the accident site and carry out relief measures. He announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh ex gratia for the families of the dead and Rs 50,000 each for the injured.","The satsang was reportedly being held by Sakar Vishwa Hari Bhole Baba.

It was en route to Singapore from London.And this week, some 40 passengers were injured when an Air Europa flight hit severe turbulence on its way from Madrid to Montevideo, Uruguay.Severe Turbulence on Singapore Airline Flight | Incident left one person dead and dozens injured. Plane diverted to Bangkok for emergency landingWhile the most turbulent flights of all connect Santiago in Chile to Santa Cruz in Bolivia, there are similarly bumpy rides across the world, according to the turbli database. Flights leaving Tokyo dominate the list of the roughest long-haul services.Strong turbulence is produced when air streams traveling at significantly different speeds come together. This is typically encountered at the boundaries of jet streams, over mountains and in certain cloud storms, according to the turbli website.For instance, turbulence on the Santiago-Santa Cruz route is generated by winds from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean flowing almost perpendicular to the Andes. The equator is also a well-known region for turbulence because of strong upward currents and thunderstorm activity, turbli said. Japan has high levels of mountain- and ocean-induced turbulence.The turbli website produced its rankings by analyzing 150,000 routes using data from UK and US government meteorological agencies.","Singapore Air Flight SQ321 encountered severe turbulence as it entered Thai airspace in late May, triggering an emergency landing in Bangkok.

The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.More than 90% of Ballmer’s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.Gates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett , Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.Since they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world’s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills.

"Under pressure on plane safety, Boeing is buying stressed supplier Spirit for $4.7 billion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/under-pressure-on-plane-safety-boeing-is-buying-stressed-supplier-spirit-for-4-7-billion/articleshow/111403727.cms,"Boeing announced plans to acquire key supplier Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion, a move that it says will improve plane quality and safety amid increasing scrutiny by Congress, airlines and the Department of Justice.Boeing previously owned Spirit, and the purchase would reverse a longtime Boeing strategy of outsourcing key work on its passenger planes.That approach has been criticized as problems at Spirit disrupted production and delivery of popular Boeing jetliners including 737s and 787s.""We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly,"" Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said in a statement late Sunday.Concerns about safety came to a head after the Jan. 5 blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 at 16,000 feet (4,876 meters) over Oregon. The Federal Aviation Administration soon after announced increased oversight of Boeing and Spirit, which supplied the fuselage for the plane.No one was seriously injured in the Alaska Airlines door incident, which terrified passengers, but Boeing is under pressure from the US Justice Department to plead guilty to criminal fraud in connection with two deadly plane crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners more than five years ago.Boeing has until the end of the week to accept or reject the offer, which includes the giant aerospace company agreeing to an independent monitor who would oversee its compliance with anti-fraud laws, according to several people who heard federal prosecutors detail a proposed offer Sunday.The Justice Department said in a May court filing that Boeing violated terms of a 2021 settlement allowing the company to avoid prosecution for actions leading up to the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, which killed 346 people.Those crashes were blamed on a faulty sensor in a flight-control system and the investigation is separate from the probe of the more recent Alaska Airlines blowout, which involved Spirit.Boeing spun off Spirit, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, and not related to Spirit Airlines, in 2005. In recent years, quality problems have mounted, including fuselage panels that didn't fit together precisely enough and holes that were improperly drilled.Spirit removed its CEO in October and replaced him with Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who served as acting defense secretary in the Trump administration.Things seemed to be going more smoothly until the Alaska Airlines incident. Investigators said a panel used in place of an extra emergency door had been removed at a Boeing factory to let Spirit workers fix damaged rivets, and bolts that help hold the panel in place were missing after the repair job. It is not clear who removed the bolts and failed to put them back.Spirit said in May that it was laying off about 450 workers at its Wichita plant because of a production slowdown since the January incident. Its total workforce was just over 13,000 people.""Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies' manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems,"" Shanahan said.The acquisition 's equity value of $4.7 billion is $37.25 per share, while the total value of the deal is around $8.3 billion, which includes Spirit's last reported net debt, the aerospace company said.Boeing common stock will be exchanged for Spirit shares according to a variable formula that depends on a weighted average of the share price over a 15-trading-day period ending on the second day before the deal closes, Boeing said.The companies also announced an agreement with Airbus to negotiate the purchase of Spirit assets involved with programs operated by the European aerospace firm. The Airbus agreement is set to commence when Boeing's acquisition of Spirit is completed, the two US companies said.",Boeing announced plans to acquire key supplier Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion.
