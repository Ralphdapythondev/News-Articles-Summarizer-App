"Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What can the salaried, individual taxpayers expect? Top points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/income-tax-expectations-budget-2024-what-can-the-salaried-individual-taxpayers-expect-top-points/articleshow/111827692.cms,"By Surabhi Marwah

Increase in the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime – One key change expected from the upcoming budget is the increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3,00,000 to Rs 5,00,000.

Reduction in tax rates under new tax regime – It is expected to have reduced tax rates / rejig in tax slabs under the new tax regime.

Increase in standard deduction – It is expected that the standard deduction is increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,00,000 as this limit has remained the same for the last 5 years.

Increase in deduction for interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property – It is expected that the limit for deduction towards interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property will be increased from Rs 2,00,000 to Rs 3,00,000. This may also help promote home ownership and help the government in its mission of ‘Housing for All’.

Overhaul of the capital gains tax structure – Currently there are various tax rates and holding periods for different types of instruments and also the indexation benefit differs in different situations for the purpose of computation of capital gains tax. It is expected that the government may bring about some amendments such as changes in tax rates, method of computation, period of holding etc. to have a more unified and simplified capital gains tax regime. One specific wish from a capital gains taxation standpoint would be the increase in the tax-free ceiling limit on long-term capital gains from sale of equity shares (listed) / equity oriented mutual funds from Rs 1,00,000 to Rs 2,00,000.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : The government is set to table its first full budget after elections and the wish list of taxpayers is as long as ever. This is especially so as the government did not make any key changes in the interim budget as it was a Vote on Account budget. Over the years, the government has been taking steps to make the concessional tax regime or the new tax regime more attractive for individual taxpayers.Few changes which were introduced in the last year’s budget i.e., Budget 2023 were:a) Increase in the basic exemption limit to Rs 3,00,000 from Rs 2,50,000b) Capping of maximum surcharge at 25%c) Introduction of standard deduction of Rs 50,000d) Rejig of the tax slabs.Keeping in view the government’s intent to simplify/ rationalise tax laws and enhance compliance, one may expect a few changes in the upcoming Union Budget 2024 to make the new income tax regime more attractive.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why 50% HRA exemption should include cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad At present, for individuals with gross income above Rs 15,50,000, if their total deductions and exemptions exceed Rs 3,75,000* (excluding standard deduction), the old regime is more beneficial as compared to the new one.Further, the increased cost of housing and increased awareness towards various investment instruments has led to higher claim of HRA exemptions and higher investment-based deductions (eligible under sections 80C, 80D of the Income-tax Act, interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property etc.) among salaried taxpayers and in many cases such limit of Rs 3,75,000 is easily breached resulting in taxpayers opting for existing / old tax regime.Therefore, in order to make the new tax regime more attractive and to keep up with the government’s intent of having a unified tax regime with fewer deductions / exemptions, one may expect few changes in the new regime as below:*This limit is for deductions and exemptions not available under the new tax regimeAlso Read | Income Tax expectations Budget 2024: Tax exempt limit for savings account interest to be raised to Rs 25,000?

However, analysts anticipate a change in this trend once the US Federal Reserve lowers interest rates and the outcome of the country's election is determined.","Infosys announced its financial results for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25 on Thursday.

Banks offer special FD rates to attract deposits: In an effort to attract retail deposits, banks have launched special schemes offering savers an additional 25-30 basis points for term deposits above current commitments for similar tenures. This move suggests that policy interest rates are likely to remain high in the near future.According to an ET report, several major banks, including SBI , Bank of Baroda , Indian Overseas Bank , Union Bank of India , and Bank of Maharashtra, have introduced deposit plans with interest rates ranging from 7.25% to 7.30% for investments spanning 399 to 444 days.Senior citizens are eligible for an extra 50 basis points on these rates.For example, SBI's Amrit Vrishti scheme provides an interest rate of 7.25% for deposits with a tenure of 444 days. Similarly, Bank of Baroda's Monsoon Dhamaka plan offers the same rate of 7.25% for deposits spanning 399 days.Indian Overseas Bank has set its interest rate at 7.30% for deposits lasting 444 days. Bank of Maharashtra, on the other hand, is offering 6.90% for deposits with a duration of 200 days and 7.10% for those extending to 400 days.Lenders are struggling to raise retail deposits and have therefore introduced limited-period schemes, according to a treasury head from a commercial bank. Bankers believe that if credit growth continues at 14-16%, they will need to offer more attractive interest rates to mobilize deposits.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2023-24: What is the penalty for late filing of income tax return? Check penalties for misreporting tax & other mistakes The decision to increase deposit rates follows a recent interaction between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and bank CEOs, where the regulator instructed banks to close the gap between deposit and credit growth. As of June 28, bank credit had risen by 14% year-on-year, while deposits had only increased by 11%.Industry experts believe that banks are offering these peak rates on shorter tenures because they anticipate the rate cycle, which was previously expected to shift in the latter half of this calendar year, will eventually start to reverse as inflation remains consistently within the central bank's legally mandated limits.Anil Gupta, senior vice president of the financial sector at ICRA Ratings, said, ""Banks are offering higher rates for less than two years tenure. So when the interest rate cycle turns, banks would not want to be stuck with high-cost liabilities.""However, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das recently indicated that rates would remain elevated for some time, saying, ""The overall economic environment globally and in India is so uncertain... I think it is too early to talk about an interest rate cut.""",Banks have launched special schemes offering savers an additional 25-30 basis points for term deposits.

IDBI Bank: IDBI Bank Disinvestment: Govt's Next Move After RBI's 'Fit & Proper' Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/idbi-bank-disinvestment-govts-next-move-after-rbis-fit-proper-report/articleshow/111819164.cms,"NEW DELHI: With RBI giving its “fit and proper” report on bidders for IDBI Bank , all eyes are now on govt and the Budget as the market awaits for a signal on disinvestment .IDBI Bank has been up for privatisation for several years, and govt had been awaiting an RBI’s assessment on bidders meeting the “fit and proper” norms — or are compliant with regulations and are not under the scanner of other regulators — to move to the next stage of the process.RBI has given its report on all but one bidder, a foreign player, which did not share information and the overseas regulator too has not provided data. Govt holds 45.5% in the erstwhile development financial institution that became a bank, with LIC being the largest shareholder with over 49% stake.The plan envisages the sale of 60.7% in the bank, including govt’s 30.5% and LIC’s 30.2%. Based on the current market cap of almost Rs 95,000 crore, the Centre can hope to realise almost Rs 29,000 crore from the disinvestment, although several observers have said that the terms of the transaction are not very attractive.While the Modi govt had lined up an ambitious privatisation agenda, including public sector companies such as BPCL, Concor, BEML, Shipping Corporation, IDBI Bank, state-run lenders and an insurance company, it has failed to report any progress with a virtual freeze on the exercise for the last 18 months as the general elections were due.While there were expectations that things will move post-polls, but the verdict has put a question mark over the fate of disinvestment, especially with petroleum minister Hardeep Puri recently stating that BPCL privatisation has been shelved.Modi govt stance on privatisation is eagerly awaited, given that this time it is dependent on coalition partners and the Budget is likely to provide cues.Given the recent rise in PSU stocks, the govt can hope to meet its disinvestment target of Rs 50,000 crore during the current financial year.While the govt has repeatedly spoken about getting out of sectors that are “non-strategic”, in the last 10 years, it only has the Air India disinvestment to count as a success.Market observers see IDBI Bank as an easier entity to divest, given that it is a private lender for all practical purposes with govt stake rising due to massive capital infusion to help the bank deal with bad debt-driven losses.","RBI has given its report on all but one bidder, a foreign player, which did not share information.

Inland Cruise Shipping: Growth Opportunities and Policy Impetus

(The author is Partner (Infrastructure), EY India. Jasdeep Sahni, Director, EY India also contributed to the article. Views are personal)

Budget 2024 expectations for infrastructure: As India marches towards becoming an economic powerhouse, given the significant allocation of Rs 11.11 lakh crore (representing 3.4% of the GDP) in the interim budget for 2024, the infrastructure sector being a cornerstone of India's growth narrative, is expected to continue receiving considerable attention.While much of the attention was earlier focused on highways, a holistic approach to the infrastructure sector will not only facilitate efficient connectivity but also play a vital role in job creation and improving the standard of living. A robust infrastructure framework can also reduce the overall logistics cost of transportation, which is one of the key objectives of the National Logistics Policy, 2022. With the shipping sector being a major emitter, green shipping initiatives are gaining momentum as India seeks to align with global standards and contribute to the fight against climate change.The Indian government has launched the National Maritime Development Programme , which includes provisions for eco-friendly shipbuilding and recycling. Since vessels running on clean fuel require higher capex, the upcoming Budget should consider incentivising ship buyers to invest in green vessels, which would facilitate the maritime industry's shift towards more environmentally friendly operations.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman give income tax relief, bring changes in new tax regime? In addition, the Maritime Amrit Kaal vision underscores the government's commitment to establishing green hydrogen hub facilities at all Indian ports. By extending the sunset clause for production of sustainable fuels and manufacturing of hydrogen fuel cells, India can simultaneously attract investment in green shipping technologies and make strides towards its ambitious net-zero emissions target. Such policy measures would not only foster innovation in the maritime sector but also contribute to the global movement towards a sustainable and resilient shipping industry.The burgeoning inland cruise shipping sector also presents an opportunity for growth as there is a need to develop ports to accommodate large cruise vessels and build terminals with modern infrastructure to enhance passenger experience. While the Cruise Shipping Policy of 2008 aims to make India an attractive cruise tourism destination, significant funds are needed to develop infrastructural facilities at various ports of the country. Further, permitting companies to carry out ‘domestic cruising’ from the GIFT City and extending the benefit of 10 years’ tax holiday may encourage cruising companies to register their units in the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). This strategic move would stimulate the domestic cruising industry, leading to increased tourism revenue and broader economic benefits.The National Rail Plan is a step towards building a state-of-the-art railway system and increasing the share of freight traffic to 45% by 2030. In the 2024 interim Budget, the Finance Minister had announced implementation of economic corridor programmes aimed at fostering multi-modal connectivity, improving logistics efficiency and accelerating GDP growth. The upcoming Budget is expected to build on this momentum, with industry experts anticipating weighted tax deductions in connection with research & development activities. These tax deductions, if announced, would be in line with the Indian Railway Innovation Policy and are likely to stimulate investment in critical areas such as safety equipment, rail infrastructure enhancement, and the integration of cutting-edge technologies.Also Read | Union Budget 2024: What Modi government can do to promote sustainable & affordable living through green housing Another major segment of infrastructure development in India is aviation, which is currently experiencing a significant upswing, as demonstrated by the remarkable order of over 1,100 aircraft by Indian carriers within a mere 15-month period, all slated for delivery within the next five years. This surge in acquisitions underscores the rapid advancement of the industry. To sustain and amplify this growth, it is imperative that the government fortifies the necessary ecosystem and infrastructure. A key component to support this expansion is the development of comprehensive Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facilities within the country. Enhanced MRO capabilities will ensure minimal aircraft downtime, thereby optimizing operational efficiency. Considering these developments, the government should consider introducing fiscal incentives to encourage the establishment of state-of-the-art MRO services capable of accommodating large aircraft fleets in India.While the upcoming Budget is an opportunity for the government to reaffirm its commitment towards infrastructure development, the anticipation surrounding the Budget is palpable among various stakeholders, who are eager to see a continuation and expansion of supportive measures. In addition to incentive-based programmes like the PLI scheme and reduction in corporate tax rates, the Budget strategy must continue to focus on financial and regulatory incentives including substantial investments in infrastructure.With continued investment in infrastructure, policy reforms, digitalization, skill development, and green logistics, governments and businesses can further enhance the resilience and competitiveness of the sector. The above is a wish list of expectations which if accepted shall have the potential to significantly provide further impetus to the infrastructure sector. The right mix of financial allocations and policy reforms can help unlock the sector’s potential and drive the nation towards the vision of Viksit Bharat.","The infrastructure sector being a cornerstone of India's growth narrative, is expected to continue receiving considerable attention.

Budget 2024 expectations : The inaugural Budget by the new NDA administration led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to continue the focus on manufacturing and self-reliance that were outlined in the Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat programmes, while also ensuring that climate goals are not short changed and emission reduction targets are met.India will almost certainly become the third-largest economy before the end of this decade and Prime Minister Modi has set the goal for India to join the ranks of developed nations by 2047. In addition to incentivising investments and implementing PLI schemes to drive ‘local value addition’ in the manufacturing ecosystem across supply chains, a comprehensive revamp of import tariffs will have a deep impact on India’s manufacturing capabilities and overall competitiveness.Following the success of PLI schemes, there is a need to introduce sectoral incentives on a continuous basis. We may see the government move away from the traditional PLIs and bring in incentives for specific sectors where domestic production and value addition are imperative to make them a part of global value chains. We may also see other types of incentives – such as design based incentives linked to R&D and design in the country. Streamlining Customs duties and tariffs will also go a long way in supporting manufacturing. Given the multiple exemptions and effective tariff rates of various goods, coupled with the various Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), the structure of Customs duty has got distorted, with an increasing number of cases of inverted duty structures. Similarly, rationalising import tariffs on specific inputs will also support ‘Make in India’ in different sectors.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman give income tax relief, bring changes in new tax regime? A strategic roadmap is needed to shift duty slabs to competitive levels such as maintaining low or nil duty on raw materials, lower slabs for intermediates, and standard slabs for final products. Additionally, the current tariff framework requires importers to navigate both the Customs tariff and numerous exemption notifications for duty rates – and these need to be rationalised and harmonised so that importers do not have to spend excess time in availing these benefits. These steps would be in line with what has been a key agenda for the government – pruning the list of existing Customs exemption notifications and simplifying the tax structure.Ease of doing business has always been of high priority for the government and, though strictly not a part of the Budget exercise, along with the tax rationalisation in imports can have a significant impact on the manufacturing sector. Two other issues – again not strictly a part of the Union Budget – can help significantly boost the manufacturing sector and Finance Minister can look at them as well. The first is an announcement about a policy or proposal to reduce the large number of pending litigation cases pertaining to Customs and allied Acts. An amnesty scheme or any other step to settle many of the ongoing disputes will reduce the backlog of cases and improve the overall ease of doing business in the country. Reducing pending litigations in other corporate tax disputes will also have a big impact.Also Read | Union Budget 2024: What Modi government can do to promote sustainable & affordable living through green housing It would be useful to devise a roadmap of different measures that improve doing business. Among other steps, it could include digitization and auto-renewal of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status, which is an international mark of quality and compliant Customs. Time-bound completion of Special Valuation Branch processes (for related party imports) and online modules for Bill of Entry amendments, which includes procedural errors when goods are first imported, could also be included. Similarly, issues arising on account of determining rules of origin of goods to ascertain the right Customs duty can be resolved to avoid unnecessary delays at the ports/ airports.Similarly, while GST is not part of Union Budget, the Union Finance Minister has a significant voice in the GST Council. Therefore, it makes sense to mention GST here. The proposed introduction of Section 65A to the Customs Act, 1962, which mandates IGST payment on goods imported into MOOWR units including special warehouse units (in-bond manufacturing in warehouses, under Manufacturing and Other Operations in Warehouse Regulations) would impact the working capital of taxpayers thus reducing the scheme’s viability.The Finance Minister can also propose GST-related changes in the Budget speech, though most decisions regarding GST are announced post the GST Council meetings. The 53rd GST Council meeting has brought in a new Section to give benefits to as-is-where-is practices in the industry. Section 11A empowers the government to regularize non/short levies due to industry practices. A similar Section existed in the Central Excise and Service Tax laws but was not introduced in the GST Acts. Accordingly, given the new law with its own complexities, the GST Council has been promising as-is-where-is basis benefits to industry in a number of cases. However, those decisions lack legal backing. If the Parliament and state governments pass the amendment, Section 11A will empower the Council to debate and consciously allow such benefits in the law.Also Read | Budget 2024 expectations: Power sector decarbonisation hinges on renewables Another significant amendment is expected in Section 16(4) of the CGST Act to extend the time limits for claiming input tax credit for the initial years of GST implementation, providing substantial relief to taxpayers.Boosting manufacturing is an imperative for India, and so is meeting climate goals. India has set ambitious targets for reducing carbon footprint and finance and taxation also play a major role in meeting these targets. With EU introducing the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), it is time India looks at its internal explicit carbon pricing mechanisms to counter the impact of tariff barriers which may get created by other countries to prevent leakage while pricing carbon. The industry is looking forward to measures that bring in explicit carbon pricing mechanisms or initiate the debate on taxing carbon footprint to allow India’s exports to remain competitive.The government has always supported the Indian industry in the past and is confident that this government will table a cogent and enabling Budget in the Parliament, laying down policy imperatives as well as a blueprint for the future.",The inaugural Budget by the new NDA administration led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to continue the focus on manufacturing and self- reliance.

Budget 2024 expectations for housing: As the world increasingly focuses on environmental conservation and sustainable development, India's budget 2024 is expected to make a strong commitment to promote innovative green housing . With the rapid expansion of cities and loss of green spaces, there is a growing awareness of environmental concerns.In the upcoming 2024 budget, the government is expected to introduce a range of incentives aimed at promoting affordable and sustainable living . These measures will encourage the adoption of eco-friendly technologies within the real estate sector, making green homes and buildings more accessible to a wider population.Budget 2024 is expected to focus on providing financial incentives and subsidies to promote the development and purchase of environment-friendly homes and buildings.This may include offering tax deductions for homeowners who invest in green homes – whether they are building from scratch or investing in energy-efficient upgrades in an existing property. Additionally, grants may be provided for builders and developers who use sustainable materials, and low-interest loans may be offered for green housing projects. These monetary incentives help to offset higher upfront costs associated with green building technologies, making sustainable housing more affordable for consumers.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman give income tax relief, bring changes in new tax regime? To enhance the efficiency of financing for environment-friendly housing , the budget is expected to expand the existing green home loan programs. This may involve reducing interest rates and extending repayment terms, aiming to incentivize people to opt for eco-friendly housing options. By broadening the scope and reach of these loans, the government hopes to reduce financial barriers and encourage the adoption of green housing.It goes without saying that builders and developers have a substantial role to play in the construction of green housing projects. Budget 2024 is likely to introduce incentives specifically tailored to encourage their involvement in such projects. Possible measures could include tax credits for appropriate use of renewable energy sources, discounts or rebates for integrating sustainable building practices, as well as fast-track approval of green building projects.This year, the budget aims to boost regulatory framework in order to support the development of green housing. This could include implementing stricter energy efficiency standards for new green building projects, allowing the use of sustainable materials and enforcing regulations that promote environmental conservation. By establishing a robust regulatory framework the government can aim towards green housing becoming a standard practice rather than an exception.Also Check | Union Budget 2024: Reintroduce tax holiday for affordable housing with a tweak In response to an ever-increasing awareness for environmental conservation, organisations across sectors have been actively working towards promoting sustainability. One such initiative is the introduction and promotion of green home loans . In order to boost green housing projects, financial institutions and banks have introduced green home loans into their product category.Green home loans are individually designed financing options aimed at promoting the construction of green buildings – whether commercial or residential purposes. These loans usually offer favourable terms such as lower interest rates and longer repayment periods to incentivize eco-friendly practices. Such loans support investments in energy-efficient appliances, renewable energy systems, solar panels and sustainable construction materials. By doing so, they contribute to helping reduce environmental impact and nurturing green living.Green home loans set themselves apart from traditional home loans by offering privileged terms and conditions that encourage eco-friendly upgrades and constructions. Buyers can avail a host of benefits including extended repayment tenure to subsidised interest rates. They prioritise investments in energy-efficient buildings and renewable products that are targeted at promoting reduced environmental impact.When it comes to buyers, they can benefit a lot from green residential spaces. These include substantially reduced utility costs, improved indoor air quality leading to a healthier lifestyle and enhanced comfort. Additionally, they promote long-term financial savings for homeowners.Support for green housing in India has been gaining momentum in recent years with both government and private players prioritising sustainability. This growing trend echoes a strong commitment towards reducing environmental impact, nurturing sustainable development and at the same time ensuring a healthier living environment for our future generations.Discussions regarding the impact of climate change have been intensifying globally for quite some time now.Undoubtedly, in light of the current era where climate change is an undeniable reality, embracing green homes and buildings can serve as a liberating force and contribute to larger causes such as sustainability and energy conservation, ultimately leading to the creation of more resilient communities.","Budget 2024 is expected to focus on providing financial incentives and subsidies to promote the development and purchase of environment-friendly homes and buildings.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : With the government’s 3.0 Budget round the corner, taxpayers are optimistic that the finance minister will introduce measures aimed at revitalizing the economy and alleviate the financial burden on individuals. Expectations are particularly high for policies that can stimulate growth while ensuring equitable distribution of benefits, and impact positively every household and business in the country.Foremost among the anticipated reforms is the rationalization of the basic exemption limit under the simplified and old tax regimes.Currently, the limit is set at Rs 3 lakhs and 2.5 lakhs respectively, leading to confusion amongst taxpayers. It is therefore suggested for a uniform increase of the basic exemption limit to Rs 5 lakhs under both the tax regimes. This measure aims to reduce compliance burden on the taxpayers while giving them greater financial flexibility.With the new tax regime made a default regime effective 1 April 2023, it has gained popularity among taxpayers at large, due to its additional benefits to different income groups. For example, resident taxpayers with income below Rs 7 Lakhs and high net-worth individual taxpayers earning above Rs 5 crores are benefitted with nil and reduced tax liability respectively. However, middle-income taxpayers have to choose between the regimes due to common exemptions like HRA, LTA and Chapter VI-A deductions. To further enhance attractiveness of simplified tax regime, there is the expectation to tweak the tax slab rates by increasing the 30% tax slab limit from Rs 15 lakhs to Rs 20 lakhs. Additionally, there is anticipation to enhance the standard deduction and the deduction for NPS contributions to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000.Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What can the salaried, individual taxpayers expect? Top points Off late, many taxpayers have chosen NPS owing to its market linked returns and tax-savings advantages besides being a retirement funding plan. Currently, central government employees enjoy a deduction of up to 14% of salary while private sector employees enjoy only up to 10%. Similar to the parity brought in for the leave encashment and gratuity deductions to both the sets of employees, extending the NPS deduction limit of 14% for private sector employees also, would level the playing field for all.While there are taxpayers who are looking for further benefits under the new tax regime, those who continue to remain under the old tax regime are also anticipating reforms. With concerns on rising health costs and property costs since the pandemic, there is a growing cause to enhance deductions under section 80C to Rs 2.5 lakhs, under section 80CCD(1B) for NPS to Rs 1 lakh, for home loan interest to Rs 3 lakhs and for Mediclaim premium to Rs 1 lakh. In addition, it is recommended to increase the limit under section 80TTA of Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 and to include interest from all types of deposits along with interest from savings bank account under its ambit. This move is aimed at reducing tax burden and promoting tax saving and small scheme investments.Senior citizens have also been urging for reforms that directly benefit them. They seek the extension of deductions under section 80TTB to cover interest income from small saving schemes, particularly post-office schemes, providing them fixed incomes. They also seek rationalization of lock-in periods for tax saving investments to facilitate funding medical emergencies and to rationalize tax burden on passive incomes such as rent, dividends, capital gains. This is essential for securing their financial stability amidst escalating living costs.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Are you paying excess tax?

This initiative is in line with the government's dedication to fostering renewable energy sources as seen in the interim budget released in February 2024, promoting the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem through development of more charging stations. In this context, another recommendation is to introduce specific perquisite valuation mechanism and rules for usage of hybrid and electric cars besides announcing sops towards adoption of solar-powered equipment.As the countdown to the Budget intensifies, stakeholders nationwide are eagerly awaiting these potential reforms. The reform expectations reflect a strategic approach towards balancing economic growth with individual financial empowerment, setting the stage for a Budget that could redefine the landscape of personal taxation in India besides catering to the overall welfare of taxpayers across the country.","Taxpayers are optimistic that the finance minister will introduce measures aimed at revitalizing the economy and alleviate the financial burden on individuals.

Budget 2024 expectations: For India to achieve its net-zero goal , the power sector will have to play a pivotal role as it is a significant contributor to emissions. According to The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) estimates, power generation accounted for ~45% of the country’s annual CO2 emissions , largely because coal-based generation continued to comprise 74% of overall power generation as of fiscal 2024.That is the reason the government’s agenda has been driven by power decarbonisation and renewable energy integration for some time now.As part of its UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP 26) Nationally Determined Contribution goals, India has committed to a five-pronged plan called Panchamrit, which includes a commitment to increase the share of power generation from clean fuels to 50% by 2030.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income tax relief for salaried taxpayers, railways capex in focus The main challenge is these Panchamrit goals need to be implemented against a backdrop of soaring power demand, which clocked a compound annual growth rate of 8.4% between fiscals 2021 and 2024. Instant surges in power requirement are also on the rise, as indicated by peak demand hitting an all-time high of 250 GW in fiscal 2025 (April – May) compared with ~184 GW in 2020.As of fiscal 2024, solar and wind technologies (the main clean fuel sources in India) accounted for 11% of total generation. Add hydropower capacity and the share would rise to 19%.Covering the gap between 19% renewable power generation and the 50% target is a tall order as efficiency levels of power generation through coal could be ~70%, while that of solar and wind are only 25-35% as on date.To wit, solar and wind capacity will have to increase by 3x to match the power generation of a single coal plant, leading to high land and transmission requirements. Hydropower has its own set of challenges such as long gestation timelines, a large social and environmental impact and usage of shared water resources.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 4 things FM Nirmala Sitharaman should do for agriculture That said, the Indian government has propelled growth in the renewable energy sector through agile policy making and critical routine interventions. For instance, the Production Linked Incentive scheme aims to foster the battery ecosystem and production of high-efficiency modules.The Viability Gap Funding scheme aims to support critical segments such as power storage and new areas such as offshore wind. The Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme, on its part, targets to improve the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of power distribution companies.Further, regulators are constantly updating bidding guidelines to resolve sectoral issues and providing extensions to key projects to sustain the sector’s momentum.Against this backdrop, CRISIL MI&A expects the power installed base to surge from ~442 GW as of fiscal 2024 to 715-720 GW by fiscal 2029. Solar, wind, storage and hydro will cumulatively account for ~60% of the total installed base, indicating a 2.7-fold increase in installed capacity compared with the combined base of 156 GW as of fiscal 2024 and a rise in the share renewables, including hydro and storage, to 35-40% of total generation by fiscal 2029.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Are you paying excess tax? You may be paying Rs 43,226 extra on Rs 10 lakh income - find out why Given escalating demand and the intermittent nature of power supply from clean energy sources such as solar and wind, regulators are planning to supplement renewable power generation with storage support. CRISIL expects 35-37 GW of storage support to be available by fiscal 2029 to maintain a stable power system, mainly through battery and pumped storage plant technologies.Cumulatively, this implies an investment of Rs 10-10.5 trillion on renewables (solar and wind), out of a total investment of Rs 17-17.5 trillion in the generation segment over fiscal 2025-2029, as other fuels continue to witness moderate additions considering demand dynamics.The clean energy push will impact not only generation but also transmission and distribution segments, as grid augmentation and grid stability support mechanisms have to be in place to ensure power systems are able to absorb such high levels of renewable capacity addition. These segments have to regularly upgrade and expand their capacity to cater to rising power needs. Consequently, investments of Rs 6.5-7 trillion are expected to be made on grid augmentation and grid stability support over fiscals 2025-2029.In the milieu, the Budget can look at providing support to specific segments.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 5 things FM Sitharaman should do for taxpayers - from tax slab changes to hiking standard deduction Within the clean energy spectrum, hydro is an important alternative being looked at, especially with multiple announcements on pumped storage projects. Government support is crucial to mitigate challenges in execution of hydro projects as it could pare high capital costs and pique the private sector’s interest.On the power distribution front, implementation of the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme could be enhanced by providing further financing support to utilities.Also Read | Budget 2024 needs to offer policies and incentives to rev up auto industry growth To provide interim relief to solar developers while domestic supply chains are stabilising, trade policy related nuances require a close look – especially for solar photovoltaics – in view of a significant shift in procurement dynamics in the recent past.Overall, policy push has been a key factor in the power segment’s clean energy transition. Spurred by renewables, this transformation is set to pick up pace over the rest of the decade. Continued investor interest and private sector participation, too, are critical levers to enhance this transition.","For India to achieve its net-zero goal, the power sector will have to play a pivotal role. India has committed to a five-pronged plan called Panchamrit, which includes a commitment to increase the share of power generation from clean fuels to 50% by 2030.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111833392,imgsize-154858,width-400,resizemode-4/111833392.jpg"

Colombia’s credit outlook was cut due to pressure on government accounts, while just this week Brazil’s president triggered a slide in its currency after raising doubts about fiscal targets.While Modi may raise some spending in the budget to address jobs creation and to alleviate rural distress, no one is expecting a blowout. A revenue windfall and a central government windfall is helping the government allot money to projects to mollify their new allies without increasing the deficit.Investors cheered the outgoing government’s prudent interim budget in February, when it outlined the 14.1 trillion-rupee borrowing target, sending the 10-year yield to a seven-month low. But news of Modi’s party losing its parliamentary majority, which raised the prospect of populist policies, triggered a spike in yields in June.

The company is also required to ""desist from future similar or other conduct/practices that do not meet nationally applicable standards.""Although Meta has not yet responded to the fine, the FCCPC stated that the company was informed about its 38-month investigation. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, has a population of around 200 million people, with nearly three-quarters of them under the age of 24 and highly connected to social media.According to data published on the National Communication Commission (NCC) website, Nigeria had approximately 164.3 million internet subscriptions as of March. Meta's platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, are among the most widely used social media in the country. Bosun Tijani, the minister for communication and the digital economy, reported in December that there were over 51 million WhatsApp users in Nigeria.Earlier this month, the European Union (EU) also accused Meta of violating the bloc's digital regulations, potentially leading to fines amounting to billions of euros. The EU claimed that Meta's new ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram ""forced millions of users"" in the bloc to either pay to avoid data collection or agree to share their data with the platforms to continue using them for free.","The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission ( FCCPC ) of Nigeria imposed a penalty of $220 million on Meta.

Using SIMBARA, the government would be able to track the nickel and tin from mines to domestic smelters .""Smelting companies have to register where they buy the nickel from and where the mines are,"" Septian Hario Seto, deputy coordinating minister for maritime and investment affairs, said in an interview.Smelters will not be allowed to unload ore shipments from mines that have not yet paid their royalties. The system successfully increased government revenue in the coal sector, Seto told Reuters, and hoped to see similar improvement in the nickel and tin sectors.The SIMBARA system will also be linked to the government's digital records of mining quotas , known as RKAB. It enables miners to track how much production quota a miner has left for the period and to alert authorities should there be discrepancies in output and sales data, he added.A senior official has said Jakarta will implement the system on other minerals such as bauxite and copper, but the timing would be decided later on, once the nickel and tin tracking system has run smoothly.","Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of nickel and one of its largest producers of tin.

Stock traders in Asia are ramping up the Trump trade in preparation for a potential second term for the former US president, which will likely create winners and losers in the region.Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia from agriculture and farm equipment to textiles and weapons production.Asian companies’ momentum in the global race for electric vehicles and chips could slow should a Trump administration follow through on his pledges.China is seen as a clear loser given Trump’s call for higher tariffs and confrontational rhetoric against the world’s second largest economy. Taiwan and South Korea, which are heavily reliant on export revenues from semiconductor and other tech sectors, are also staring at an outlook downturn, market watchers say.India is deemed as a potential beneficiary should the former US president’s polling hold up and lead to his win in November. Southeast Asian economies, whose fortunes aren’t closely tied to exports, may be able to deflect much of the fallout from a change in the White House, investors say.Here is what market watchers are saying“India stands out as an economy that is relatively shielded from these shocks as the country has only a small share of global goods markets and is less exposed to China-related risks.”“It looks like India has a much better relationship with the US than China. At least from India’s side, the impact of Trump was not as bad as it was for many other emerging markets. It’s difficult to think it’ll be different this time.”“China’s obviously going to be one of the most affected if those tariffs really come in place and if Trump successfully can put enough pressure on the EU to also put some tariffs of their own on China.”Still, “a lot of companies are diversifying their markets or starting to diversify the supply chains and build manufacturing facilities outside of China. And even if a Trump presidency imposes high tariffs, Europe might decide not to follow it unless there is some really super strong political pressure.”“For Japan, we believe that risks are more balanced than China as the country’s sensitivity to global trade is a bit lower, and its relations with the US will likely remain solid even under the Trump administration.”“We also see the opportunity for the country to cement its semiconductor sector renaissance if Taiwan or South Korea end up bearing the brunt of the Trump team’s potentially consequential re-calibration of the US strategy for them.”“In Asia, the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Vietnam has been benefiting from the lower-end manufacturing, such as textile and wooden furniture, while Taiwan and Malaysia have been benefiting from electronic products supply chain shifts.”“Southeast Asia will be in a pretty good position because of what’s happening with China. So in that sense, Southeast Asia would be good. Thailand even, well, Vietnam may get into some trouble because they’re doing so much manufacturing of Chinese goods, but they’re also doing a lot of manufacturing for Korea.”“For Asia, it would really affect the tech-related ones more. It’s really whether the momentum trade of Taiwan, Korea is going to continue a bit longer, versus Asean being a bit more resilient, less tied to the tech sector, and having the China plus one strategy and secular themes playing out.”","Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia.

He expects a sideways recovery followed by a new all-time high.Svenson highlights bullish divergence on the daily time frame for two momentum oscillator indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). With Bitcoin in oversold territory according to the daily RSI, the Bitcoin forecast appears promising for a potential upward reversal.BlockDAG is stirring the presale world, having raised an impressive $58.8 million and sold 12.1 billion coins as it progresses into its 20th batch.

The Reuters poll had pointed to a slightly weaker 5.6per cent increase.Sterling rose against the dollar immediately after the data was published.The BoE - which has a target of consumer price inflation of 2 per cent - has expressed concern about the strength of services inflation, which largely reflects pressure from wage growth in a labour market short of candidates to fill jobs.Data due on Thursday is expected to show wages growing slightly less strongly than in data published a month ago but still rising by almost 6per cent - roughly double the rate that would be compatible with keeping inflation at 2per cent.The BoE is due to announce its next decision on interest rates on Aug. 1 and investors see a roughly 50per cent chance of a first cut to borrowing costs since 2020.A rate cut next month would give an early boost to new Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his finance minister Rachel Reeves who have said they will speed up the slow-moving British economy after winning power in a landslide election two weeks ago.But last week the BoE's Chief Economist, Huw Pill, said he was focused on persistently strong price pressures and said the timing of the first rate cut was an open question.Core inflation - excluding volatile food and energy prices - held at 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to June, the ONS said, matching the median forecast in the Reuters poll.The BoE had expected headline inflation of 2.0 per cent in June and services inflation of 5.1per cent, according to forecasts it published two months ago. The BoE also expected headline inflation to rise back above its target later this year and through 2025.","Inflation for services was much stronger at 5.7 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said.

The 160 year old lender has traditionally appointed its CEO from within.Since 2020, Elhedery has been the co head of the Global banking and markets business, the division that houses HSBC's trading and investment banking advisory businesses.Lebanon born Elhedery, who began his career in banking as a rates trader before joining HSBC in 2005, was named the surprise successor to Ewen Stevenson as CFO in October 2022, just weeks after returning from a sabbatical.He also led HSBC's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkiye region as the CEO of that division between July 2016 and February 2019.""Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory,"" he said in the bank's statement announcing his appointment.Quinn, who led the global lender for five years, will remain CEO until his successor starts in the role.His surprise departure was announced in April, and at that time he had said he wanted a better work life balance and planned to pursue a portfolio career.Quinn oversaw a raft of asset sales, navigated a global pandemic and a push by rebel investors to break up the 160 year bank, and guided the lender to record profit.The move comes at a time when HSBC, Europe's largest lender by assets with a balance sheet of $3 trillion, is betting on its historic Asian ties to ramp up profit.Since the financial crisis of 2008, HSBC has already shrunk its global footprint by around a quarter, exiting low growth markets to plough capital and resources into Asia.The bank's shares have risen 7% this year, against an 18% gain in the STOXX Europe banks index.HSBC said it will announce Elhedery's successor as Group CFO in due course. Ahead of the announcement, the bank was exploring financial incentives and reallocating key projects to retain those who miss out on the top job, two people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.HSBC will report its annual results on July 31.The lender's shares in Hong Kong were trading mostly flat after the announcement.","Georges Elhedery, 50, becomes HSBC's third CEO in less than eight years.

"Dow soars to fresh record high, small caps surge on rate cut bets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dow-soars-to-fresh-record-high-small-caps-surge-on-rate-cut-bets/articleshow/111797044.cms,"The US stock market surged to new heights on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a record closing level. This rally was fueled by expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024, which could boost the economy and corporate profits. The positive sentiment was further supported by strong earnings reports from major companies like Bank of America and UnitedHealth Group.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 742.76 points, or 1.85%, to 40,954.48, the S&P 500 gained 35.98 points, or 0.64%, at 5,667.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.77 points, or 0.2%, at 18,509.34.Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, industrials enjoyed the largest percentage gains, while technology and communication services were the only two sectors to end in negative territory.Economically sensitive small caps extended their rally. The Russell 2000 scored a fifth straight day of gains greater than 1%, its longest winning streak since April 2000. The index gained 3.5%, touching its highest level since January 2022.Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler's comments about the possibility of lowering interest rates sooner if the job market cools ""too much"" added to the optimism on Wall Street. Analysts believe that the current market environment assumes a perfect scenario where the Fed cuts rates while inflation slows down without pushing the economy into a recession. Additionally, rising expectations of a Donald Trump victory in the 2024 US presidential election, which could lead to tax cuts and deregulation, further contributed to the bullish sentiment.In contrast to the US market, European bourses experienced declines, with German investor confidence falling for the first time in a year. The International Monetary Fund maintained its global growth forecast for this year at 3.2% but trimmed its projections for the United States and Japan while warning of ongoing inflation risks and trade tensions.Gold prices also reached a new record, jumping 1.9% to $2,450.07 per ounce, driven by shifting expectations regarding the Fed's monetary policy. In Asia, markets were mixed, with Hong Kong experiencing losses in the tech sector, while other major indices saw modest gains or declines. Traders in China awaited policy measures from the country's leaders as they held a key economic meeting during the week.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 742.76 points, or 1.85%, to 40,954.48.
