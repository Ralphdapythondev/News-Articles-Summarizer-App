Key provisions of CAA may violate certain Articles of the Indian Constitution: Congressional report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/key-provisions-of-caa-may-violate-certain-articles-of-the-indian-constitution-congressional-report/articleshow/109491845.cms,"WASHINGTON: Key provisions of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which came into law this year may violate certain provisions of India's Constitution, a report issued by an independent research wing of the US Congress has claimed.

Tragedy strikes IIT Kharagpur: Student found deceased in hostel room

To mark 50 years of association, Nandan Nilekani gives IIT-Bombay highest ever grant in India of Rs 315 crore

MUMBAI/DELHI: The pursuit of high-paying jobs has hit a roadblock this placement season at the premium Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). With companies scaling back on hiring and offering lower salary packages , students at the tail-end are being offered annual packages below Rs 10 lakh.Organisations that would usually pick half-a-dozen students have picked one or two at best, forcing colleges to reach out to more companies.And many of those are offering annual compensation of Rs 10-15 lakh. Students who have bagged campus jobs at what they believe is a lower pay scale, are still in the market looking for better prospects on job portals and travelling cities to attend job fairs and interviews.""The global economic slowdown has significantly impacted the campus placements for the 2024 graduating batch of IIT Indore. The reduced hiring numbers of recruiters compared to the previous year have resulted in a challenging placement season. To offset the impact, IIT Indore has taken early steps by tapping into alumni networks and has broadened its pool of potential employers, including PSUs,"" said Professor Suhas Joshi, director, IIT Indore.A student at IIT Bombay said, ""Companies that till last year picked 5 to 8 students are picking 1 or 2 this year. Several are still not yet hired. From coaching classes to start-ups, some have recently been picked for salary packages of Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000 in phase 2.""Another student from an IIT-Kharagpur said, ""Spectrum Technologies offered Rs 3.6 lakh for trainee engineers and Rs 6 lakh for trainee design engineers. Startoon Labs and Gem Machinery offered Rs 5.5 lakh annually. Skyroot offered Rs 5 lakh. Sri Chaitanya and Next Education offer Rs 4.8 to 6 lakh per annum.""""The scenario now is that many students are taking up jobs offering the bare minimum threshold salary of Rs 6 lakh a year but are looking for other jobs,"" a source said. Students and placement office staff are trying to attract more companies, negotiating packages with NGOs, reaching out to job portals, and providing guidance to final-year students. Praveen Tyagi, owner of IITians' Pace, a tutorial for entrance tests, said, ""While AI has reduced jobs and international FANG companies did not come to the campus, we saw this as an opportunity to pick up talent. We conducted tests to hire IITians, and hundreds of them took our test. Students conducted mock online lectures, and those who had good communication skills were picked. We have offered 25 students Rs 12 lakh per annum.""At IIT Delhi, a significant number are still seeking employment through the Office of Career Services (OCS). As of April 5, out of 1,814 students registered with OCS, 1,083 have secured jobs, leaving approximately 40% yet to find employment.However, the situation appears more favorable for those in undergraduate programs (BTech+dual degree), with 81% of the 903 participants having received job offers. R Ayothiraman, professor-in-charge of OCS, mentioned plans to conduct separate placement drives specifically for PhD candidates.During recent placements, students at IIT-D were introduced to a variety of job roles. Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd proposed an annual package of Rs 19.5 lakh, while HCL Software offered Rs 21.9 lakh, Tata Consultancy Services and Larsen & Toubro presented annual packages of Rs 9 lakh and Rs 7 lakh respectively.The placement process at IIT Delhi is rigorous, with each phase lasting about 15 days. Students diligently prepare for interviews. ""We are mentally prepared for a set pattern of questions, but this time the companies were more demanding, seeking fewer candidates with specialized skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning for annual packages ranging from Rs 10-50 lakh,"" a student said, adding that he lacked the skills required because his interest lay in software development.","The pursuit of high-paying jobs has hit a roadblock at the premium Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) With companies scaling back on hiring and offering lower salary packages, students at the tail-end are being offered annual packages below Rs 10 lakh.

Congress plans to redistribute wealth to ‘infiltrators’: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-plans-to-redistribute-wealth-to-infiltrators-pm-modi/articleshow/109482926.cms,"JAIPUR/BANSWARA: Congress is in the grip of “urban Naxals” determined to execute their beliefs and convictions through the party, PM Narendra Modi said on Sunday while drawing a link between opposition party’s pitch for distribution of wealth in its manifesto and his predecessor Manmohan Singh’s Dec 2006 statement that minorities have first right to the country’s resources.“Just look at their manifesto. What they have said is of grave concern and reflects their plan to implement their Maoist vision on the ground. They have said that if Congress gets to form govt, they would conduct a survey of everyone’s assets: how much gold our mothers and sisters have and their value would be computed, including the silver ornaments of our tribal sisters, the assets of govt employees, everything. They don’t stop at that. They go on to say that the assets will be equitably redistributed. Is it acceptable to you? Does govt have the right to expropriate your hard-earned assets? Should the govt seize your assets?” PM said, adding that for women, their gold is not just an ornament but something that is intrinsically linked to their aspiration and self-respect.He connected Congress’s manifesto to Dr Manmohan Singh’s statement about minorities having the first right claim on national resources. “Does this tell you whom the assets are going to be distributed among? It is going to be distributed among those who have more children, among the infiltrators?” Modi said to a loud “no” from the big crowd.“Should the assets you have acquired through your toil go to infiltrators? Is this acceptable to you? This is what Congress has proposed through their manifesto. They would conduct a survey of your assets, seize them and then redistribute them. I must caution you that even the mangal sutras of our mothers and sisters are not safe from this urban Naxal thinking,” he said.Modi had earlier attacked Congress manifesto for its “Mughal mindset”.The PM’s broadsides at Congress came at an election rally in Rajasthan’s Banswara, where Rahul Gandhi had announced five of the party’s “guarantees” on the sidelines of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on March 7.He reiterated his charge about Congress now being in the group of “urban Naxals”. “One of my friends asked those leaving Congress why they were exiting. They said the party was in the clutches of Leftists,” Modi said.He said Congress’s catchphrase “mohabbat ki dukaan” was part of an elaborate subterfuge for the reality of “fear, hunger and corruption being sold in Congress shops”.“I am more like a family member to you. You have known me for the last 23 years. You also know the work my govt has done in the last 10 years. How can you hand over the nation to someone with no track record?” he said, accusing Congress of depriving Rajasthan’s Vagad area of roads, rail and other connectivity during its tenure.“It is Modi’s guarantee to provide you with all these facilities. We have started work to connect Banswara via the Dungarpur-Ratlam railway line. Congress govt left these projects in the doldrums. After June 4, these tasks will be taken up at a faster pace,” he said.He also accused Congress of intimidating Dalits and tribals and spreading fear among minorities. “They are spreading all kinds of lies about democracy, the Constitution and reservation. But India has moved ahead of fear; hence their lies will not work,” Modi said.",Modi draws link between opposition party’s pitch for distribution of wealth in its manifesto. “Does this tell you whom the assets are going to be distributed among?” Modi said to a loud “no” from the big crowd.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109483173,imgsize-929508,width-400,resizemode-4/109483173.jpg"
Deepfakes of Bollywood stars spark worries of AI meddling in India election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deepfakes-of-bollywood-stars-spark-worries-of-ai-meddling-in-india-election/articleshow/109488973.cms,"Police probe

AI video of dead father

MUMBAI: In fake videos that have gone viral online, two of India's A-lister Bollywood actors are seen criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asking people to vote for the opposition Congress party in the country's ongoing general election.In a 30-second video that shows Aamir Khan and another 41-second clip of Ranveer Singh, the two Bollywood actors purportedly say Modi failed to keep campaign promises and failed to address critical economic issues during his two terms as prime minister.Both AI-generated videos end with the Congress election symbol and slogan: ""Vote for Justice, Vote for Congress"".The two videos have been viewed on social media more than half a million times since last week, a Reuters review shows.Their spread underlines the potential role such AI (artificial intelligence)-generated content can play in the mammoth Indian election that started on Friday and will continue until June. AI and AI-generated fakes, or deepfakes , are being increasingly used in elections elsewhere in the world, including in the U.S., Pakistan and Indonesia.Campaigning in India has long focused on door-to-door outreach and public rallies, but extensive use of WhatsApp and Facebook as campaigning tools started in 2019. This year's general election - in which Modi is expected to secure a rare third term - is the first in which AI is being used.A Congress spokesperson, Sujata Paul, shared actor Singh's video with her 16,000 followers on X on April 17 and by Saturday afternoon, her post had been reshared 2,900 times, liked 8,700 times and received 438,000 views.Paul told Reuters by telephone she was aware the video was marked ""manipulated media"" by X, but she did not want to delete it as, while posting, she thought the person was a look alike of Singh and ""it has creativity for sure"".The post was no longer visible on X on Sunday, hours after Reuters sent a request for comment to Congress' head of social media cell, who did not respond.Both actors have said the videos are fake. Facebook, X and at least eight fact-checking websites have said they are altered or manipulated, which the Reuters digital verification unit has also confirmed.Reuters could not ascertain who created the videos. Khan was ""alarmed"" by the viral ""fake"" video and Singh's team was looking into the matter, according to a spokesperson for both actors. Singh wrote on X on Friday: ""Beware of deepfakes, friends"".Modi's office, and the IT head of his Bharatiya Janata Party, did not respond to requests for comment.Nearly 900 million people in India have access to the Internet and a survey conducted by research organization Esya Centre and the Indian Institute of Management business school showed an average Indian spends over three hours a day on social media. The country has nearly one billion voters.Some versions of the videos have been blocked on social media but at least 14 were still visible on X on Saturday. Facebook deleted two videos Reuters flagged to the company but one other was still visible.Facebook in a statement said it has ""removed the videos"" for violation of its policies. X did not respond to Reuters queries.The videos have sparked one police investigation with Khan registering a case in Mumbai against unnamed persons on April 17 for alleged impersonation and cheating for creating the fake video.Mumbai police did not return a request for comment, but two officers working on Khan's case, who declined to be named, said they wrote to Facebook and X to take down the video and the companies had said it was done.The officers said they were up until 2 am on Friday, refreshing pages to check if Khan's online videos were removed. Asked about progress in the case, one of them said: ""Such technical investigations take time.""In this year's election, politicians are using AI in other ways.In southern India, Congress leader Vijay Vasanth's spokesperson said his team has created a 2-minute audio-video clip using AI that was shared on social media platforms and shows his now dead but more popular politician father, H. Vasanthakumar, seeking votes for him.The late politician is seen saying ""even though my body left you all, my soul is still around.""In videos put out on YouTube by the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM), Samata, an AI-generated anchor dressed in a traditional saree and speaking in a style that mimics regular news channels, criticizes the ruling party in West Bengal state.In one clip, the anchor alleges the party does not care about the environment as many water bodies have vanished due to illegal construction.A spokesperson for the ruling party denied the allegation and said the state government has ensured no such construction takes place. The CPM did not respond to requests for comment.In the video, which has been seen 12,000 times, anchor Samata declares: ""These are questions that we the citizens of this city need to ponder over.""",Two fake videos that have gone viral online criticize Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two videos have been viewed on social media more than half a million times. The spread underlines the potential role such AI (artificial intelligence)-generated content can play in the mammoth Indian election.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109489168,imgsize-33946,width-400,resizemode-4/109489168.jpg"

Murdoch partner helps Asia’s richest man build a media empire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/murdoch-partner-helps-asias-richest-man-build-a-media-empire/articleshow/109487861.cms,"On a breezy April evening some 45,000 Indian Premier League cricket fans are packed into Wankhede Stadium to watch the hometown Mumbai Indians battle the Rajasthan Royals.Elsewhere in the city, hundreds of employees of Viacom18 Media Pvt. are on different mission, transmitting the match in 12 languages and 20 camera angles across the world’s most-populous country.“We are targeting over 600 million people to come and watch,” said Uday Shankar , the executive behind the effort.once an underdog dwarfed by foreign behemoths, Viacom18 and its JioCinema streaming service are poised to become the most powerful player in the $28 billion Indian media and entertainment industry. Reliance Industries Ltd., Viacom18’s largest shareholder, has plans to merge the business with Walt Disney Co.’s India operations, adding dozens of cable TV channels and tens of millions of streaming subscribers in a deal valuing the combined enterprise at $8.5 billion.With everything from local news to big Hollywood films, the new company aims to capture not just a bigger share of TV ad sales, but the growing digital revenue now going to tech giants like YouTube and Meta Platforms Inc. Viacom18 could also become a broader rival to Amazon.com Inc. if it follows through on plans to integrate e-commerce into its streaming platform.Shankar, the 61-year-old executive who’s going to lead Viacom18 as vice chairman, is a media veteran. A former journalist, he helped turn Star India into a prized asset for the Murdoch family, which then sold their entertainment assets to Disney in 2019. Now he’s overseeing the group buying back that business. His role as a bridge between Hollywood and Bollywood will make him a key player in the media strategy being implemented by Reliance, a company with interests from energy to telecommunications.“He’s one of the most talented media executives in the world, not just in India,” said James Murdoch, who partnered with Shankar in Bodhi Tree Systems, an investment firm that owns a piece of Viacom18. “Uday has a great track record of being able to move businesses forward, and we’re excited to see it continue.”India isn’t a market where others have been able to move forward so easily, despite the country’s economic growth.Disney, for example, acquired a large business there when it bought 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets in 2019. But pricey bidding wars for cricket rights and a paltry $1.28-a-month in revenue per streaming subscriber has made profitability hard to come by. In a bid to bulk up, Sony Group sought to merge its Indian business with local rival Zee Entertainment, only to see the deal fall apart earlier this year.With the backing of Mukesh Ambani, Reliance’s chairman and Asia’s richest person, Shankar thinks he can achieve a different outcome, building a profitable streaming business in large part by offering ad-supported programing. It helps, he said, that he was born and raised in the country.“India is like a continent,” he said in an interview at his office in the southern port area of Mumbai. “Many people have come in and found it difficult to build a big business, but for us, we are from India.”Among his boldest bets, letting cricket fans stream the premier league for free on JioCinema, a move that attracted 449 million viewers and more than 17 billion views last season. Shankar is offering free IPL live streaming again this year.The goal is to develop the market for mobile streaming in India and particularly the associated advertising, since most of the company’s customers subscribe to the ad-supported version. Digital ad revenue will come not only from the English- and Hindi-speaking population, but also from regions that have their own languages and purchasing habits.Sports streams garnered 70% of their viewership from small towns last year, and most of viewers were in the 18-to-44-year-old demographic most coveted by advertisers, according to a report from the consulting firm EY. And while advertising in India’s $4 billion traditional TV market is shrinking, the digital advertising market is projected to more than double to about $20 billion in the next five years, Shankar said.“You need to make sure that digital offerings are available to smallest of the small advertisers,” he said. “That’s the model that we believe in.”All of this takes work of course. Back at Viacom18’s newly opened production hub, engineers in a massive control room monitor screens on multiple platforms to spot glitches and fix them in seconds. Separate screens receive live feeds of viewer consumption. On top of the studios, a giant data center supports the video feeds, all part of Shankar’s obsession with the product.“He spent 80% of the time on tech just to ensure that we have a service which doesn’t crash,” said Prateek Garg, managing director at Marigold Park Capital, an affiliate of Bodhi Tree.rowing up in a small rural town in India, Shankar studied economic history with a goal of learning how to influence Indian society. He found journalism the closest answer to his career goal and joined the Times of India as a political reporter. He later became one of the founding editors of New Delhi-based environmental magazine, Down to Earth. In 1991, he was shocked by CNN’s live broadcasting of the first Gulf War.“It blew my mind,” Shankar said. “My wife got frustrated with my obsession with TV and told me, ‘Instead of watching it, why don’t you go and do something?’”He managed to get his first TV job at a network and spent more than four years building a 24-hour live news channel called Aaj Tak before joining the Murdoch family’s Star News as chief executive officer in 2004.“One thing I knew as a journalist was I knew who was a good expert and how to go to that person to ask the right questions,” Shankar said.The journalism skills helped him turn around Star News, and his work stood out. In 2007, he took over as CEO of Star India, the choice of Chairman Rupert Murdoch to the lead the company’s entire operation in that country.“He gave me the license to make mistakes because I was untested,” Shankar said. The corporate DNA of Fox was “go create the market and then you make money in the market.”India was just beginning to roll out 3G wireless service and had almost no Wi-Fi or broadband access. Shankar’s team started building a streaming platform called Hotstar and he went to every telecom company, begging for partnerships.“They all rejected the idea and it was one of the most humiliating experiences I’ve ever had,” he said.The efforts finally paid off after Hotstar offered the International Cricket Council World Cup for free in 2015, with a catchphrase “get over TV.”It was a beginning of a digital revolution, with Ambani’s Reliance Jio telecom business launching 4G service with free data plans. The two Indian businessmen teamed up to jointly market Hotstar and Reliance Jio, which has since become the largest wireless carrier in India with 471 million subscribers.Shankar rose to president of 21st Century Fox’s Asia business in 2017, overseeing all of the company’s operations in the region. By the time Fox sold its assets to Disney two years later, Star India’s value had soared to around $15 billion. Disney CEO Bob Iger gave Shankar the top job in Asia, leading the launch of its Disney+ streaming service in the region.Shankar felt more comfortable in an entrepreneurial setting and joined James Murdoch, his old boss at Star India, to form Bodhi Tree. They raised $1.5 billion from the Qatar Investment Authority and others to invest in media deals including Viacom18 and an education technology startup.Under Shankar’s guidance, JioCinema has been licensing films and TV programing from major Hollywood studios including Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal and Paramount Global, which is selling its 13% stake in Viacom18 to Reliance.Disney’s lucrative library will be soon onboard with the merger. The new company will have more than 100 TV channels and two streaming services, capturing about 35% of India’s total TV viewership and 45% of the premium video-streaming business, excluding YouTube and Facebook.It’s not just movies and TV coming from Disney. The merged entity will also have IPL rights, along with the TV and digital rights to the International Cricket Council’s Cricket World Cup, part of a package of sports that will cost about $2 billion annually, according to a person familiar with the matter.The research firm Media Partners Asia estimated that the combined businesses lost about $200 million on sales of $2.8 billion in the fiscal year ended in March. Profitability in the traditional TV entertainment business was overtaken by the red ink in sports and streaming.“The overall business will be loss-making but if you bring the combined cost structure together, they’ll have more synergies and bargaining power,” said Media Partners founder Vivek Couto. The digital advertising revenue will continue to grow along with the growth of India’s economy over the next five years. “After the hard work’s done, let’s say in 12 to 24 months, they should become a pretty profitable scale business,” he said.Besides capturing multilanguage sub markets, JioCinema aims to build its business around the cricket experience, starting with selling mobile emoji packs featuring IPL cricket stars. It’s a first step to getting consumers accustomed to digital wallets, Marigold executive Garg said. Viacom18 hired Google veteran Kiran Mani to build out the mobile business.Its content strategy is opposite that of Amazon and Netflix, which pump out big-budget series in India. Shankar’s strategy is to produce inexpensive 30-minute soap operas every day to capture the audience and boost the number of daily active users, a key metric in digital advertising. Eventually, that online viewing will replace traditional TV.“I’m a big believer in change,” Shankar said. “Sometimes it can be unnerving, it can be difficult, but eventually, I believe it leads all of us to a better place.”","Viacom18 and its JioCinema streaming service are poised to become the most powerful player in the $28 billion Indian media and entertainment industry.

"WHO panel re-defines term airborne, 4 years after Covid controversy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-panel-re-defines-term-airborne-4-years-after-covid-controversy/articleshow/109487265.cms,"NEW DELHI: When the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2019, there was a lot of confusion over whether the viral infection was airborne or not.That’s because, the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) then said, for an infection to be declared as airborne it was important that the microbes (in this case the SARS-CoV-2 virus) within the droplet nuclei stayed viable in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 metre.This is all set to change now as a global technical consultation carried led by the UN health agency has proposed to do away with all terms and conditions and suggests that the descriptor ‘through the air’ can be used in an overarching way to characterise an infectious disease when transmission involves the pathogen or disease-causing organism travelling through or being suspended in the air – regardless of the size of the infectious respiratory particle or distance travelled.A similar approach is followed for other public health descriptors of infectious diseases, such as ‘waterborne’ and ‘bloodborne’, that refer to the main medium through which a specific disease is transmitted.According to the WHO update, two descriptors can be used under the umbrella of the ‘through the air’: airborne transmission/inhalation and direct deposition.Airborne transmission or inhalation, the WHO says, occurs when infectious respiratory particles or IRPs expelled into the air enter, through inhalation, the respiratory tract of another person and may potentially cause infection.Director deposition occurs when IRPs are expelled into the air following a short-range semi-ballistic trajectory and then directly deposited on the mouth, nose or eyes of another person leading to infection.“This global technical consultation process was a concerted effort of many influential and experienced experts,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India who is a Co-Chair of the WHO Technical Working Group. “Reaching consensus on these terminologies bringing stakeholders in an unprecedented way was no small feat. Completing this consultation gives us a new opportunity and starting point to move forward with a better understanding and agreed principles for diseases that transmit through the air,” added Dr Yuguo Li from the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR (China), who also co-chaired the Technical Working Group.This consultation was the first phase of global scientific discussions. Next steps, the WHO says, include further technical and multidisciplinary research and exploration of the wider implementation implications of the updated descriptors.Dr Neeraj Nischal, additional professor, department of medicine at AIIMS Delhi said the WHO update enables clearer information to the public health experts and public at large regarding pathogen transmission and methods to mitigate risks. “Prior to this clarification, misconceptions about the airborne transmission of infectious diseases spread and how individuals could best protect themselves added to the confusion among the general public leading to irrational behaviour and actions,” Dr Nischal said.","The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) then said, for an infection to be declared as airborne it was important that the microbes (in this case the SARS-CoV-2 virus) stayed viable in the air for long periods of time.

Uttarakhand starts work to make Dehradun international airport starting with Kathmandu flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-starts-work-to-make-dehradun-international-airport-starting-with-kathmandu-flights/articleshow/109485622.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a serious push to promote inbound tourism from abroad , the Uttarakhand government has started the process of making Dehradun an international airport . It has invited request for proposal (RFP) from airlines to operate subsidised direct flights between the capital’s Jolly Grant Airport and Kathmandu. Sources say the Union government is backing this move to unlock India’s true potential to emerge as an international destination for foreign tourists — and not just NRIs.While post covid domestic travel has staged new highs, international inbound is yet to recover fully.Foreign tourist arrivals (FTA) in 2019 were about 1.1 crore. In 2022 that figure was 62 lakh and last year it rose to 92.4 lakh. The industry is deliberating how to get FTAs not just back to 2019 levels but exceed the same. Increased direct international connectivity; more new tourism circuits and ease of visas have been the steps suggested by the industry to improve India’s FTAs.“Aviation is a priority sector and will continue to get top notch attention from the next government that will be sworn in within next two months. Big plans are in the works to make India a global aviation hub with its own mega airlines (IndiGo and Tata Group Air India) and big hubs. India has doubled the number of airport since 2014 and many of them will increasingly get international status to have direct flights at least from nearby catchment countries,” say people in the know.The state government’s RFP states as much: “In a progressive stride towards international connectivity and tourism, the government of Uttarakhand has extended an invitation for proposals to establish flight operations between Kathmandu and Dehradun. By connecting the capital cities of Nepal and Uttarakhand, this endeavour not only fortifies historical ties but also unlocks new avenues for tourism, commerce, and cultural exchange.”Willing parties will bid on the basis of viability gap funding per seat with the state providing this financial support. There will be no cap on airfares and bidders can charge fares depending on market factors for the three round trips they will need to operate every week. The contract period is a year, extendable by another year as per mutual agreement, to operate minimum 70-seater planes which will most likely be Airbus A320 or Boeing 737s. The bids will be opened on April 25 and the selected airline will need to start this flight within 60 days from the issuance of letter of award.Established players with good operational track record seeking lowest VGF will be awarded the route. Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami is reportedly very keen to see Dehradun as an international airport connected to several nearby places. A start is being made with Kathmandu due to lot of mutual interest in travel between the two places that are, among other things, bound by religious ties too.",The Uttarakhand government has started the process of making Dehradun an international airport.

"First time in 77 years, polling booth will come to Burudmal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-time-in-77-years-polling-booth-will-come-to-burudmal/articleshow/109485374.cms,"Village in Pune’s

Baramati constituency

didn’t have

road link

until Feb, so people had to walk 12km to

polling station

in neighbouring Sanghvi

For the first time in more than 60 years, 89-year-old Baburao Ramchandra Akhade won’t make the 3-hour trek to Sanghvi village to cast his vote. A polling booth will be set up in his village, Burudmal , which is part of Maharashtra’s Baramati constituency – long synonymous with Sharad Pawar but now the stage for a contest between his daughter Supriya Sule and his nephew’s wife Sunetra Pawar.Akhade’s poll day routine has changed thanks to a 3km link road that was built just before polls were announced in March, enabling Election Commission to plan a polling booth in Burudmal’s zilla parishad primary school. So, the village’s 40-odd voters, including Akhade’s 73-year-old wife Savitribai, will be able to vote in comfort on May 7.Burudmal has the smallest voter population in Pune district. Its residents belong to a nomadic tribe where education has been scarce. Savitribai, who can’t read or write, never misses a poll but says she “clicks on a symbol” per the advice of her husband and sons.Akhade, who is Burudmal’s oldest voter, also says, “None of us knows who is contesting, which leaders have changed parties, or who has missed the ticket. They do not even know we exist.”So why do they vote re ligiously? “We’ve been voting for decades simply because everyone says it would help in the village’s development. There is no choice,” says Savitribai.And change has crept in over the years. The road is one example, the village school where they’ll vote is another. Savitribai says her kids studied in an ashramshala in Pangari vil lage, 10km away, but “my grandson does not have to go that far. We now have a school in our village.”Three years ago, Burudmal also got electricity. So, yes, while the village youth have to move to Mumbai and Pune for jobs, they can come back to vote. And everybody in Burudmul votes. Chandrabhaga Akhade, a resident, says the new road will make it easier for people to come home this time on polling day: “Some have even booked private cars for the occasion.”Bhausaheb Turkunde, a teacher at the zilla parishad school, travels 60km daily from Bhor. He recalls how visiting Burudmal or bringing goods to it was a laborious task until a few weeks ago. “We faced challenges even in getting the mid-day meal ration to our school, as the terrain was dangerous for vehicles. From the main road, we had to carry sacks of rice and pulses to the school on our backs.”Gram panchayat member Mahesh Gore says a tourist died last year when he tried to drive his car through the treacherous route despite being told to park and walk. “The others in the car got off while he tried to navigate a very dangerous ‘S’ bend. He lost control, and the car plunged into the deep valley. A rescue team from the village found him dead.”But with the new road, Burudmal residents are hopeful more visitors, tourists and land buyers will arrive. “It will help us earn some money,” Gore says.Bhor taluka’s tehsildar Sachin Patil says, “Burudmal’s villagers have shown their determination to vote. It’s a testament to the value they place on their democratic right and civic responsibility.”","Baburao Ramchandra Akhade, 89, won’t make the 3-hour trek to Sanghvi village to cast his vote.

TCS links variable pay to work from office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcs-links-variable-pay-to-work-from-office/articleshow/109482497.cms,"BENGALURU: TCS has updated its variable pay policy to include work from office as a crucial factor. The revised policy, which was implemented shortly after the company's quarterly results, has four attendance slabs that determine the variable pay for employees.According to the new policy, employees who work from office for less than 60% of the time will not receive any variable pay for the quarter.Those with an office attendance between 60-75% will receive 50% of the variable pay, while employees who come to the office 75-85% of the time will be eligible for 75% of the variable pay. Only those with office compliance levels above 85% will receive the full variable pay for the quarter.TOI had reported in Feb about TCS linking variable payout to complying with its recent return-to-work mandate. Business unit heads have written to their respective teams that assigning grades, which are a prerequisite for rolling out promotions, will depend on their track record of working from office.The policy also warns that persistent non-compliance with the 85% work from office requirement will result in disciplinary action. ""Employees' compliance to work from home will be reviewed every quarter. In the event an employee is found to be in violation of the laid down policies, there will be implications on the annual performance review, compensation, and career progression of the employee,"" the policy stated. An email sent to TCS on the updated policy didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press.In their notes to employees after the March quarter results, CEO K Krithivasan and CHRO Milind Lakkad mentioned the importance of returning to office. Krithivasan said, ""The last quarter has seen most of you return to the workplace, creating shared experiences, nurturing greater learning, collaboration, and camaraderie.""Other Indian IT companies, such as Infosys and Wipro, have not linked variable payouts to the return to office mandate. Wipro has distributed an average variable payout of 85% for the March quarter of the FY24, according to the company's CHRO, Saurabh Govil. This is consistent with the 85% variable pay given to junior employees in the Dec quarter.TCS employees are expected to work from office all five days of the week. The company is the first among India's major IT firms to take action against employees who do not comply with this requirement. It has already begun reducing the city allowance for those who do not come to office on all five days.","TCS employees are expected to work from office all five days of the week.

The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has instructed all regulated payment companies to monitor high-value or suspicious transactions during the general elections , as per multiple senior executives familiar with the matter. In a letter dated April 15, the central bank directed payment system operators (PSOs) to prevent any potential misuse of electronic fund transfer mechanisms that could influence voters or indirectly fund candidates participating in the elections.According to one of the executives quoted by ET, ""The regulator wants payment companies to track high-value merchant payments specifically.Also recurring person-to-person payments can be brought under scrutiny.""The directive applies to fintech companies such as Razorpay, Cashfree, CCAvenue, and Mswipe, which are all regulated payment aggregators, as well as mobile wallet licence holders like PhonePe and MobiKwik.The RBI's directive cites concerns raised by the Election Commission of India, the apex body conducting the elections. Payment companies have been asked to track dubious transactions and report them to the relevant authorities.Historically, cash in circulation has increased during elections, and the RBI has typically instructed banks to monitor the movement of cash. However, industry insiders noted that this is one of the first instances where the regulator has specifically called out payment companies and asked them to track digital payment movement, given the widespread adoption of digital payments and the popularity of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and card payments.","The Reserve Bank of India has instructed all regulated payment companies to monitor high-value or suspicious transactions during the general elections.

Why are foreigners choosing Greater Noida to set up meth labs?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/why-are-foreigners-choosing-greater-noida-to-set-up-meth-labs/articleshow/109491978.cms,"(With inputs from PTI)

NOIDA: Over the past year, Greater Noida police have uncovered three meth labs operated by foreign nationals within rented properties, seizing over 100 kg of drugs valued at hundreds of crores. The most recent raid occurred on April 17, resulting in the arrest of four Nigerian citizens and the confiscation of 26.67 kg of MDMA, worth Rs 100 crore.In two connected raids on May 16 and May 30 of the previous year, police seized more than 75 kg of MDMA, also referred to as ecstasy or molly, and arrested around a dozen foreigners from residential properties where fully equipped labs were established for producing meth.According to police, the cooked meth from these two incidents had a combined value of over Rs 350 crore.Police suspect that these seizures may only represent the ""tip of the iceberg"" of an international drug syndicate. In all of these cases, they discovered that foreigners working in the lower levels of the syndicate cooked meth in its ""pure form.""This meth was then delivered to their contact in Delhi and subsequently transported to Europe through channels that have yet to be investigated, according to an officer involved in the investigation.""Using the raw material which was provided to them by their contacts in Delhi, the accused in Greater Noida cooked the meth. It was dried inside the houses and then given the form of a solid brick of six inch by one inch before being parcelled out to their networks in Delhi who met them on need-to-know basis,"" the officer said.At least three of the several police personnel concurred that Greater Noida, because of its less-dense residential facilities and easy connectivity to Delhi, served as an ideal place for manufacturing the drug.""In all three cases, the houses rented by the foreigners were in isolated locations and had open area on at least three-sides so that the pungent smell emanating due to meth cooking does not catch attention of people living close by,"" an officer said.What also made Greater Noida a perfect place for the activity was availability of some raw materials, which are difficult to procure abroad.For instance, the availability of Ephedrine, a medication and stimulant which is prohibited under the NDPS Act and whose sale is also banned by the government.Ephedrine, although available for pharmaceutical purposes, comes with a lot of regulation.A police officer stated that the drug is priced at Rs 80,000 to Rs 90,000 per kg but fetches Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh per kg on the black market. Procuring it in Europe is challenging, and if available, it could cost Rs 8 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per kg.""The profit margin by operating here is more than double. Also, the meth is second most expensive to cocaine and what they cooked here in Greater Noida was not meant for local supply but was to be exported,"" the officer added.Police are now investigating how the foreigners procured Ephedrine locally.During their recent raid, the police discovered that drug suppliers were utilizing lesser-known shopping apps to ship cooked meth. Their associates, whether within India or abroad, ordered a product and provided a foreign address for delivery.""Once the meth reached Delhi, it was concealed in the sole of shoes, or creatively concealed inside hair extensions, or neatly ticked inside bales of textile clothes that are exported in bulk. It's difficult to detect the drugs, though agencies have thwarted many such attempts with the use of intelligence and insider network,"" he said.According to police, all persons arrested in the three cases are currently in jail.","Greater Noida police have uncovered three meth labs operated by foreign nationals.

Hinjewadi residents rally to draw attention to Mula river’s plight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hinjewadi-residents-rally-to-draw-attention-to-mula-rivers-plight/articleshow/109492473.cms,"Hinjewadi residents held a march this weekend highlighting the importance of taking urgent steps to conserve the Mula river , after recent reports of bloodworms being found in drinking water sourced from this water body spurred them into action to address several existing issues.Residents of the Blue Ridge Township organised the rally under the ‘ Save Mula River Initiative ’.Their goal was to raise awareness about the condition of the river as well as encourage people in and around Hinjewadi to be more conscious of the waste they generate and where it lands up.“Saving the river is important as our survival depends on it,” said Dr Nisha Arora, a member of the initiative. She added, “Our rivers are already in a dire state and two months ago, it was a wakeup call when we found bloodworms in the water here. It made many of us think and realise that it’s only going to get worse in the years to come if not addressed now. We need to find ways to mitigate the pollution entering the river. Our march was one small step in this direction.”Besides drawing attention to the pollution piling up on the riverbanks and in the river, the march also appealed to residents to take responsibility for protecting this vital resource. Participants said they believe it is time to show collective concern and support to save the Mula.A volunteer at the march, Shoyeb Pathan, said this gathering would allow people to see the reality of the river, which would urge them to care for it. “Finding bloodworms in our water was extremely scary. Many of us are still using bottled water for drinking and think twice before using tap water for other purposes too. Our rivers are dying — we must act now or there will be nothing left,” he said.Organisers also said that while peo ple tend to offer virtual support for such causes, a river runs clean only through relentless action. The march on Saturday saw a good turnout, with one section of participants going for a walk along the riverbank to witness its condition, while the children sat for a painting competition.Namrata Naik, a resident of the township, said, “The march united us all, whether joining in as online voices or part of the riverside action. We also saw the need to move beyond virtual support and walk the talk, showcasing the true state of the river to inspire our community to join the fight for a cleaner Mula. This was our main reason for organising the march.”Ravindra Sinha from Mission Groundwater, who was a speaker at the event, said such citizen-led initiatives are the need of the hour. “The Mula river at the Hinjewadi-Mhalunge section is plagued with severe problems like untreated sewage discharge, water hyacinth, sand mining and rampant dumping of debris.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

"Climate Change Blamed for Dubai Floods, Not Cloud Seeding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/climate-change-blamed-for-dubai-floods-not-cloud-seeding/articleshow/109408915.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: Many wondered whether it was cloud seeding - a weather modification technique to induce rains - that led to flooding of Dubai, but scientists involved in such projects in India categorically dismissed any link, and meteorologists and climatologists rather blamed climate change for the record precipitation in arid West Asia.Since parched UAE periodically conducts cloud seeding to increase level of its dwindling groundwater, extreme rainfall between Monday night and Tuesday evening raised questions on the artificial rain mechanism.The country received a record 255 mm of rain in less than 24 hours, flooding Dubai.Though it rained heavily in neighbouring Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well, Dubai in UAE faced the maximum impact.IIT Kanpur professor Sachchida Nand Tripathi, who is closely involved with the cloud seeding project in India said, there was no connection between cloud seeding and the floods in Dubai. “Seeding is tried at an early stage of storm development. In this case when the system progressed from the Gulf of Oman it was already an intensified storm. It is highly unlikely and unsafe to seed such systems. Seeding can at max contribute to 25% enhancement in rainfall. In this case the total rainfall was 25 cm. So even without seeding 20 cm of rainfall would have happened,” Tripathi toldEven distinguished climate scientist and former secretary in the ministry of earth science (MoES), Madhavan Rajeevan, dismissed the possibility of any link, saying cloud seeding cannot trigger such heavy rainfall and floods.Asked about likely reasons, he said, “This is absolutely a clear signal of climate change. It was a huge thunderstorm caused by a synoptic system which was moving across the Gulf region. With global warming there is now a tendency that if it rains, it rains very heavily. We should expect this kind of events more frequently in any part of the world and at any time.”Former chief of India Meteorological Department (IMD), K J Ramesh, too believed that cloud seeding was not the primary cause for the downpour. “Western disturbance-triggered extreme rainfall event development is the primary cause of the floods in the region,""he said.On its link with climate change, Ramesh said, “It is well known that any rain bearing system will become stronger under changing climate - global warming regime as warming enables atmospheric clouds to hold extra moisture and grow bigger and bigger leading to enhanced intensity of rain bearing systems.”Elaborating on the weather phenomena, he said, “Southward extension of passing westerly wave trough, supported by additional moisture feed from Arabian Sea, basically caused extreme weather events, causing unprecedented quantum of rainfall over not only UAE but also over Oman, north Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar.""Prior to this, a similar westerly wave gave heavy rainfall spells for two days over Afghanistan, leading to floods, thunderstorms and lightning over Pakistan”.On the UAE’s cloud seeding project, Ramesh said the country through its Rainfall Enhancing Experiment, launched in 2002, has been trying to carry out aircraft based cloud seeding as and when rain bearing weather systems develop over the surrounding regions. “Through such efforts, the cloud seeding team was able to enhance the quantum of rainfall up to 15% over and above the rainfall otherwise occurring any way naturally.”","The country received a record 255 mm of rain in less than 24 hours, flooding Dubai.

H5N1 bird flu strain detected in milk: WHO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h5n1-bird-flu-strain-detected-in-milk-who/articleshow/109438308.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday announced that the H5N1 bird flu virus strain had been found in significant quantities in raw milk from infected animals , though the duration of the virus's survival in milk remains unknown.Earlier in 1996, Avian influenza A(H5N1) initially surfaced, but since 2020, there has been a remarkable surge in outbreaks among birds, with an increasing number of mammals also falling victim to the disease.This has resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, along with infections in wild birds, as well as land and marine mammals.Last month, cows and goats were added to the list of affected animals, surprising experts who previously didn't consider them susceptible to this strain of influenza. The outbreak of bird flu in cow has affected at least 13 herds in six states, as per the New York Times.The reports of sick cows began to emerge in Texas and New Mexico. Dead birds were also found on some of these farms, and laboratory testing confirmed that some cows were infected with bird flu.Earlier this month, US authorities reported a case of a person recovering from bird flu after exposure to infected cattle on a Texas dairy farm.""The case in Texas is the first case of a human infected by avian influenza by a cow,"" said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization.""Bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow and cow-to-bird transmission have also been registered during these current outbreaks, which suggest that the virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood,"" she told a media briefing in Geneva.This incident marks only the second case of human infection with bird flu in the United States, following illnesses in herds apparently exposed to wild birds.""Now we see multiple herds of cows affected in an increasing number of US states, which shows a further step of the virus spillover to mammals,"" Zhang said.""The virus has also been detected in milk from infected animals.""Zhang said there was a ""very high virus concentration in raw milk"", but experts were still investigating exactly how long the virus is able to survive in milk.The Texas health department assured that infected cattle do not pose a threat to the commercial milk supply since dairies are mandated to discard milk from sick cows, and pasteurization effectively kills the virus.""It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming only pasteurised milk and milk products,"" said Zhang.(With inputs from agency)","The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday announced that the H5N1 bird flu virus strain had been found in significant quantities in raw milk from infected animals.

Indian-origin men involved in Canada's largest-ever gold and money heist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indian-origin-men-involved-in-canadas-largest-ever-gold-and-money-heist/articleshow/109415390.cms,"It was a brazen theft: thousands of gold bars and millions of dollars in bank notes stolen a year ago from Toronto's international airport.Canadian and US authorities said on Wednesday six people, including two Indian-origin men , have been arrested and three more are being sought in connection with what they called the largest gold heist in Canadian history - a cargo of over C$22 million ($16 million) in gold and currency.The arrests were announced after a long-year investigation under Project 24K. The suspects, including two Air Canada employees, forged an airway bill to steal a cargo arriving from Switzerland of C$20 million-worth 6,600 gold bars weighing 400 kg and C$2.5 million in foreign currency, police officials said. The gold was melted down and used to purchase illegal firearms. ""This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,"" said Nishan Duraiappah, chief of Peel police, responsible for law enforcement at Toronto airport .The gold theft appeared to be remarkably simple. The gold and cash arrived at the Toronto airport in a special container aboard an Air Canada flight from Switzerland on April 17, 2023, and it was moved to one of the airline's warehouses. The container held gold bars that were destined for a Toronto-based bank and bank notes bound for a currency exchange. About two hours later, a truck driven by a man who was arrested in Pennsylvania pulled up at the warehouse. The man carried a waybill - a document usually issued by a carrier with details about a shipment - that gave him access to the warehouse. It was actually a duplicate of a waybill, printed on an Air Canada printer, for a shipment of seafood that had been picked up a day earlier. The container with the gold bars and bank notes was loaded into the truck. Video recordings showed the truck travelling down Canada's busiest highway before eventually disappearing from sight in a rural area west of the city.Peel police officers were called early the next morning after an armoured truck of Brinks, an American cash handling company, arrived with the actual waybill for the shipment of gold and bank notes. Canada police said Wednesday that they believe the gold bars, which had serial numbers, were all melted down and that they had seized smelting pots. The only gold recovered, police said, was six bracelets made out of C$89,000 worth of gold.Air Canada employee Parmpal Sidhu, 54, from Brampton, Ontario, jewellery store owner Ali Raza, 37, from Toronto, Amit Jalota, 40, an Oakville, Ontario resident, Ammad Chaudhary, 43, from Georgetown, Ontario and Prasath Paramalingam, 35, from Brampton are among those that have been arrested. According to a PTI report, Sidhu and Jalota are of Indian origin. Police are searching for former Air Canada manager Simran Preet Panesar, 31, from Brampton as well as Archit Grover, 36, from Brampton and Arsalan Chaudhary, 42, from Ontario.Peel detective sergeant Mike Mavity said the truck driver that allegedly picked up the gold, Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old from Brampton, is currently in custody in the US. Sixty-five illegal firearms were found in his possession, two of which had been modified to have fully automatic capabilities.They were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada.

Floating fortresses: US navy to convert oil rigs into mobile military bases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/floating-fortresses-us-navy-to-convert-oil-rigs-into-mobile-military-bases/articleshow/109476009.cms,"NEW DELHI: The US Navy has embarked on an innovative yet contentious project to transform surplus oil rigs into mobile missile defense and resupply bases in response to escalating missile threats in the Pacific, particularly from China. This initiative, developed by Gibbs & Cox, a Leidos company, was unveiled at the Sea Air Space 2024 expo in Washington DC.The Mobile Defense/Depot Platform (MODEP) concept is designed to convert oil platforms into large floating island bases that can operate independently for over 12 months, positioned at an ideal distance from shore.The converted platforms will potentially play a dual role in enhancing US air defense capabilities or aiding in strike missions, with the capacity to hold up to 512 vertical launch system (VLS) cells or 100 large missile launchers. This capability is about five times that of an existing Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, according to Naval News.Heruningtyas Desi Purnamasari, an official at the US Navy, outlined the strategic importance of these floating bases, noting, ""The platforms could conceivably lead to a substantial reduction in risks and costs associated with land-based defense systems.""The concept also includes plans for these mobile platforms to support the sustainment of the US Navy’s surface combatants and nuclear submarines through an Afloat Forward Staging Base configuration, offering a cost-effective solution at only 10% of the price of a new build Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system.However, the feasibility of such floating bases has been a topic of debate. In 2018, experts Jose Delgado and Eviya Vitola discussed the political and security challenges of creating semi-permanent offshore military bases, noting their high costs, vulnerability to missile attacks, and relative ineffectiveness compared to conventional capabilities.More recently, Sam Tangredi of the Foreign Policy Research Institute highlighted the strategic advantages of sea bases, which include enhanced joint command capabilities and rapid strike potential. Tangredi also questioned whether new sea-basing technologies could keep pace with evolving anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) threats, suggesting that while improvements in air and missile defenses might mitigate some risks, the practicality of investing heavily in sea bases remains uncertain.This ambitious project reflects a shift in military strategy as the US adapts to new geopolitical realities and technological advancements in warfare, aiming to bridge the gap between sea and land-based BMD capabilities effectively.","The US Navy has embarked on an innovative yet contentious project to transform surplus oil rigs into mobile missile defense and resupply bases.

Trump's Save America Group spends big on legal fees; falls behind Biden at fundraising,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-group-spends-big-on-legal-fees-biden-leads-at-fundraising/articleshow/109473387.cms,"with input from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Donald Trump's political campaign group, disclosed spending 3.6 million US dollars on lawyer fees in February. Trump, currently facing four criminal trials, is aggressively campaigning to challenge Biden in the upcoming presidential election on November 5. The Save America group , which handles Trump's legal expenses and reported the expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, relies heavily on contributions from small donors .Although Save America managed to cover its expenses through a 5 million US dollar refund from a super PAC linked to Trump's campaign, it has now retrieved over $52 million out of the $60 million previously allocated to the PAC. This retrieval reportedly has significantly reduced the amount of funds available for television advertisements supporting Trump's campaign.Trump's legal battles include charges related to falsifying business records to conceal payments to a porn star, attempting to overturn his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election, mishandling classified documents post-presidency, and appealing a substantial civil fraud judgment. Moreover, financial challenges are looming over Trump's political operations, as shown in recent disclosures to the Federal Election Commission.Despite raising $15 million in March, Trump's campaign continues to trail Biden in fundraising, with Biden's campaign amassing over $43 million and holding $85 million in reserves, compared to Trump's $45 million.While campaign contributions are crucial for activities such as advertisements, staffing, and rallies, they do not solely determine the election outcome.Trump, who was outpaced by Hillary Clinton in fundraising during the 2016 election, still emerged victorious. Despite a decline in contributions from small donors, Trump has intensified efforts to attract major donors in recent weeks, aiding the Republican Party in raising over $20 million in March.MAGA Inc, the super PAC supporting Trump, closed March with $33 million in reserves, while Future Forward, the primary Democratic super PAC backing Biden, reported over $41 million in funds.","Donald Trump's political campaign group, disclosed spending 3.6 million US dollars on lawyer fees in February.

Will there be a 'superbloom' this year in California?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-there-be-a-superbloom-this-year-in-california/articleshow/109473197.cms,"NEW DELHI: The vast deserts of Southern California , the dramatic bluffs of the Bay Area, and even the areas near Los Angeles International Airport are starting to be covered in carpets of yellow, orange, and gold flowers However, the question remains: do these blooms qualify as a "" superbloom ""? The term lacks a single definition, and this year's blooms have not been as vibrant or abundant as those that blanketed parts of California last spring following drought-busting rains, despite the state receiving ample winter rains this year as well.After particularly wet winters, bursts of color may appear in the spring, attracting throngs of visitors to California and other parts of the Southwest to witness the flowering fields and capture photographs. Scientists do not agree on a single definition of a superbloom. In California and Arizona, there are areas of desert that can quickly transform into dense fields of wildflowers , as seeds lie dormant in the soil and then germinate and blossom at around the same time.According to Naomi Fraga , director of conservation programs at the California Botanic Garden , this year's blooms do not qualify as a superbloom due to the lack of huge diversity in the flowers that have blossomed in places like California's Death Valley. The wildflower display this year, while still beautiful, is not as large or dense as in past years. Evan Meyer, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Theodore Payne Foundation, believes that whether this year's blooms constitute a superbloom is ""really in the eye of the beholder.""April is typically the peak month for spring wildflowers, but in high-elevation places, they can continue to blossom later into the spring. Superblooms generally refer to low-elevation desert regions, and the timing is more geographic than seasonal. When temperatures rise in the desert, the flowers can quickly dry out. The effects of climate change on wildflowers could play out over decades or even centuries, as seeds stay dormant in the soil for long periods of time. Southern California's unusual heavy rain last summer and higher than average winter temperatures have contributed to an unusual bloom this year.","After particularly wet winters, bursts of color may appear in the spring.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Maldives, opposition parties are calling for an investigation and possible impeachment of President Mohamed Muizzu in response to a leaked report dating back to 2018 alleging corruption.The parliamentary elections for the Majlis are scheduled for Sunday, ahead of which, the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and President Muizzu 's People's National Congress (PNC) have engaged in trading barbs and accusations against each other.The political turmoil began when an anonymous individual using the handle 'Hassan Kurusee' shared leaked intelligence reports on social media, which included documents from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Maldives Monetary Authority and the Maldives Police Service. These reports purportedly linked President Muizzu to financial misconduct, citing irregularities in money transfers to his personal bank account and suggesting possible involvement with politically exposed individuals, embezzlement, structured transactions, and the use of corporate entities to conceal fund origins.The allegations sparked a firestorm of reactions on social media, with demands from the MDP and People's National Front (PNF) for an official investigation into the matter. Former vice president Dr Mohamed Jameel Ahmed went a step further, calling for President Muizzu's impeachment based on the leaked intelligence reports. Jameel emphasized the importance of accountability in governance and urged President Muizzu to cooperate with independent investigations into the allegations, including those related to the Ras Male' development project and alleged excessive spending on public relations.President Muizzu responded to the corruption allegations on Tuesday, asserting that the opposition's attempts to implicate him were baseless and driven by desperation. He denied any wrongdoing and accused the opposition of leaking the reports to tarnish his reputation.""The same allegations had been made during his campaigns for mayor and President,"" he said adding, the response would also be the same as before.""While you attempt to pin something on me like this, you couldn't do it before and you can't do it now.
