RBI's policy response

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday, marking the first cut in over four years. In its statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said, ""In light of progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4.75% to 5%.""This move signals the beginning of a policy shift to ease the restrictive conditions previously implemented to control inflation.The Fed's decision will lower the rates at which commercial banks lend to consumers and businesses, reducing the cost of borrowing across a range of financial products, including mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. This cut is expected to make borrowing more affordable, stimulating spending and investment.The ripple effects of the Fed rate cut will be felt globally, particularly in emerging markets like India.One of the most immediate likely effects of the rate cut is the potential increase in foreign investment in India. When US interest rates are high, investors tend to favor US Treasury securities for their relatively higher returns. However, with a rate cut, yields on these securities will decrease, prompting investors to seek better returns elsewhere, including in Indian equities and debt markets. This shift could lead to a substantial inflow of foreign capital into India, driving up demand for Indian stocks and bonds, which may subsequently increase their prices.The influx of foreign capital is also likely to affect the Indian Rupee (INR). As foreign investors convert their currencies into INR for investment purposes, demand for the rupee will rise, potentially leading to its appreciation against the US dollar. A stronger rupee can have mixed effects; while it may lower the cost of imports (especially crucial commodities like oil), it could also negatively impact Indian exporters by making their goods more expensive for foreign buyers.Globally lower interest rates typically lead to a rally in bond markets . In India, this could mean that existing bonds become more attractive as their yields appear favorable compared to new issues. Consequently, this dynamic may lower borrowing costs for both the government and corporations, encouraging more capital investments and stimulating economic growth .Certain sectors are poised to benefit directly from the Fed's rate cut. For instance, the information technology (IT) sector may see increased demand as US corporations expand their IT budgets due to reduced borrowing costs. Additionally, other sectors such as consumer goods and infrastructure could also experience growth as cheaper financing becomes available.The RBI's response to the Fed's actions will be crucial. Historically, Indian monetary policy has been influenced by US rates. However, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has already signaled that India is not compelled to follow suit and reduce its own rates.The governor emphasized that maintaining financial stability remains a top priority for the central bank. ""Financial stability is a prime consideration,"" Das said, highlighting the importance of ensuring a robust and resilient financial system.Das's comments suggest that the RBI will carefully assess the domestic economic conditions and potential risks before making any decisions on interest rates.","The ripple effects of the Fed rate cut will be felt globally, particularly in emerging markets like India.

Funding in; SpiceJet to clear employee dues & grow to fleet of 100 in 2 years: Ajay Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/funding-in-spicejet-to-clear-employee-dues-grow-to-fleet-of-100-in-2-years-ajay-singh/articleshow/113576615.cms,"NEW DELHI: SpiceJet is back from the brink once again after yet another near collapse by getting Rs 3,000-crore funding from investors including mutual funds and is now aiming to have a fleet of 100 aircraft before the end of 2026. The latest crisis, brewing for the last 5-6 years, had peaked in recent months and proved to be a bigger existential threat than anything this proverbial cat with nine lives had seen in its rollercoaster life.But like 2015, when he had acquired SpiceJet from the then owner Kalanithi Maran, airline CMD Ajay Singh has managed to prevent the airline from going the Kingfisher, Jet or GoAir way. His stake now diluted to 35% from earlier 48% after this QIP, Singh told TOI Sunday two valuable lessons have been learnt to be resilient going ahead: “Keep cash for the next black swan event. And never assume black swan event/s won’t recur.”“After acquiring SpiceJet in 2015, we had improved its operational and financial metrics in a very short time. With highest aircraft occupancy, there were profitable quarters on the trot. We ordered 200 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Everything was going just fine when two black swan events happened in quick succession: global grounding of the 737 MAX in March 2019 and then Covid in 2020,” he said.While the airline ventured into cargo in a big way during Covid, its payables to all stakeholders and liabilities kept mounting. PF and TDS of employees could not be paid for over two years. Engine & aircraft lessors dragged it to court for repossessing their assets. Things came to a head this summer when it nearly completely ran out of cash and SpiceJet obits were being written.So in this situation how did he convince investors to put money? “We just told them the truth about our airline. They saw what we had done after 2015. Investors were convinced of India’s aviation growth story and the fact that a duopoly in the skies (referring to IndiGo and Tata Group AI-led carriers) is not in consumer interest. They saw potential in us to grow. At no time did I feel that it is curtains for the airline. Eventually when most had written us off, the demand for our QIP was way more than the Rs 3,000 crore approved of by shareholders,” Singh said.The airline, which “refuses to die”, has its task cut out with these funds over for the next few weeks: clear all employee dues, including salaries & PF, latest by early next month; improve on time performance; get the 30-odd grounded planes back in the air & increase flights; clear all statutory dues. And most importantly keep some funds in reserve for the next black swan event/s.We have resumed dialogue with Boeing for getting delivery of MAX ordered by us. Since the last two we have been flooded with job applications. We will rededicate all efforts to be an efficient and on time airline,” he said.","SpiceJet is back from the brink once again after yet another near collapse.

Trade set for recast over security: Dimon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trade-set-for-recast-over-security-dimon/articleshow/113613688.cms,"Exactly a year ago, you spoke about the risks of interest rates rising to 7% and recession.

JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes too much attention is being placed on US Fed's rate cut's size, which he views as largely inconsequential. In an interview with TOI, Dimon said inflation and hard-landing risks persist. Excerpts.As a businessperson, you should be prepared for various scenarios.You can't just assume that the expected scenario will happen. I still think there's a chance rates could stay higher for longer. I'm talking about the 10-year rate, which is 3.8%, but could it go up? Yes. Could company borrowing costs rise due to credit spreads? Yes. So, as a business, you prepare for various outcomes. So far, it looks like we're heading for a soft landing , but you'll only know when it's over.Some people speculate that they made the cut because they're more worried about a downturn, but I don't know. You'll have to ask them. What we want is a strong economy. If they're reducing rates to keep the economy strong, that would be good for the dollar. If there's a recession, that's a whole different scenario. I can't predict the future. I'm hoping it's okay, but a year from now, you'll be telling me what happened. I don't know, you don't know, and (Jerome) Powell (Fed chief) doesn't know.If you look at stock and bond markets, credit default spreads seem to be pricing in a 70-80% chance of a soft landing. I think the odds are lower than that. I'm a bit more sceptical due to the extremely complex geopolitical situation and extreme fiscal spending globally. It seems to have had no consequences yet, but I hope the soft landing happens.They're coming down, but when I look at the future environment, certain things are almost guaranteed - more military spending worldwide, the cost of transitioning to a green economy, restructuring trade, ongoing fiscal deficits, and an ageing population. All of these are inflationary. It seems likely inflation could tick up over time. A recession would reduce it, while a boom would increase it. But those factors will still be there.The world is complex, and while China has become a big country, the concerning events are the war involving Russia and ongoing military action in the Middle East. China isn't involved in these conflicts but isn't aligned with the US either, which makes the situation more difficult. I don't think globalisation will disappear. You can come up with a schematic dividing the world into two major trading blocs, but that's not in anyone's interest, and it would take a long time. Instead, you're likely to see a restructuring of trade for national security reasons.Every country has different interests - India needs oil, America doesn't. So, each country will secure what it needs. For the US, that includes pharmaceutical ingredients and rare earths.The second restructuring will focus on fair trade. Some countries use state-owned enterprises to dominate global trade, and that is a beggar-thy-neighbour approach. I think countries will become more sensitive to what's fair.Digital technology has been around for a long time, and jobs have increased, not decreased. While certain types of jobs may be reduced, others will change. In our branches, we have more advisers and fewer in operational and teller roles. There's more in wealth management, small business banking, mortgages, etc. AI will make jobs more productive and, in the short term, create new jobs. In fact, we're hiring more people in AI and data science.I've always said no to a physical bank. If Chase came here, there's no real reason for you to bank with us. You don't know us, and there are very capable banks already here. Plus, we'd need to build a whole infrastructure - legal, risk, credit, compliance, audit systems. However, our Chase brand is building a digital-only bank somewhat successfully in the UK. We plan to roll it out in another country next year. If it's successful, it could expand into Europe, and eventually into Asia. But that's still many years away.The banks had two problems, and they were isolated to a handful of institutions. One was very concentrated deposits. Think of venture capital companies controlling many corporate accounts and asking them to move their money all at once. That was a new problem - billions of dollars left Silicon Valley Bank, and similar amounts at First Republic in days. The other issue was interest rate exposure, which was reported, isolated and transparent to both boards and regulators, but they took on too much of it, and it shouldn't have been allowed. That was a lesson for everyone. When First Republic failed, we knew it would be the last domino because of those issues. But, I was careful as this was provided we don't have a recession, and we had higher rates which put stress on some banks and leveraged companies.The movement of money electronically isn't new. The internet has been around for a long time, but banks didn't experience those kinds of runs before. Banks had certain problems, but they had a diversified clientele, which is why they didn't face the issues First Republic did.","JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes too much attention is being placed on US Fed's rate cut's size, which he views as largely inconsequential.

China unveils biggest package yet to boost property market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-unveils-biggest-package-yet-to-boost-property-market/articleshow/113615763.cms,"China unveiled its biggest package yet to shore up its beleaguered property market, lowering borrowing costs on as much as $5.3 trillion in mortgages and easing down-payment requirements for second home purchases to a historical low.The People’s Bank of China will cut outstanding mortgage rates for individual borrowers by an average of 0.5 percentage point, Governor Pan Gongsheng said at a press conference on Tuesday.The minimum down-payment ratio on second home purchases will be lowered to 15% from 25%.The plan, confirming earlier reports by Bloomberg News, underscores Beijing’s urgency to stem a housing-led slowdown in Asia’s largest economy as it faces the prospect of increasing protectionism and a shaky global outlook. The moves comes as economists at banks including UBS Group AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp. predicted that China will fall short of delivering on its growth target this year.A Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of Chinese property developer shares rose as much as 4.9% on Tuesday morning before paring the gain to 1.5% as of 10:10am. The index has slid 33% from this year’s high in mid-May.“This package is China’s biggest and widest supporting measures on home loans yet, as it covers both new home-buying and outstanding purchases,” said Yan Yuejin, vice president of Shanghai E-house’s research arm.Policymakers have taken forceful steps to lower financing costs this year including scrapping a central government-guided mortgage rate floor for first home purchases. But such moves have mostly benefited new property buyers, exacerbating the disparity with existing homeowners that has driven a wave of early mortgage repayments and strained lenders in recent years.Currently, existing mortgages carry an average interest rate of about 4%, compared with 3.2% on newly-issued loans for a first home and 3.5% for a second home, according to data compiled by China Real Estate Information Corp. in late August.The move will ease mortgage burdens an estimated 150 million people, cutting their annual interest expenses by about 150 billion yuan, Pan said. While China has pushed average mortgage costs to a record low this year, most households haven’t benefited because banks won’t reprice existing loans until next year.Still, it will likely add pressure on the nation’s biggest banks, which have been struggling with record low margins, sinking profits and rising bad loans.Pan said the new round of interest rate adjustments will have a neutral impact on bank profits and margins, given that more funding is freed up and deposit rates will follow suit. Officials also announced on Tuesday they would add capital to the largest lenders.Banks have resorted to multiple deposit rate cuts to mitigate the impact of lower loan rates. Combined profits at China’s commercial lenders rose 0.4% in the first half, the slowest pace since 2020, according to official data. The sector’s net interest margins have continued to decline, hitting a record low of 1.54% at the end of June, well below the 1.8% threshold regarded as necessary to maintain reasonable profitability.The reduction to the minimum down-payment ratio for second-home buyers follows a sizable cut to 25% in May. Top regulators have said China will support homebuyer demand to upgrade to bigger homes.China’s real estate crisis is now into its fourth year with no signs of letting up. The slump in home sales deepened in August as the impact of policy loosening measures waned and buyers were deterred by expectations for prices to keep falling.","The People’s Bank of China will cut outstanding mortgage rates for individual borrowers by an average of 0.5 percentage point. The minimum down-payment ratio on second home purchases will be lowered to 15% from 25%.

Why it’s time to explore bold & path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-its-time-to-explore-bold-path-breaking-alternatives-that-put-indian-railways-on-a-smooth-track/articleshow/112317406.cms,"By Ashutosh Bhandari

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 adopts multifaceted approach to bolstering manufacturing sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-adopts-multifaceted-approach-to-bolstering-manufacturing-sector/articleshow/112216383.cms,"By Saurabh Agarwal and Mohit Sharma

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month. There are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024. The tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112186146,imgsize-55630,width-400,resizemode-4/112186146.jpg"

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

This is a strictly national security action,” US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said in a call to reporters. “We are focused on the national security threat, very real threat, that connected vehicles pose to our country and the American people.”US and European officials allege that that the Chinese government and local automakers are unfairly subsidizing the industry, saying that it could lead to a flood of cheap imports that distort the market. That’s prompted both the US and EU to raise tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. China has denied its systems pose a security threat and has said the tariffs are an attempt to stifle competition.Connected vehicles are specifically a threat because they’re deeply embedded in US infrastructure, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said, including charging stations, storage systems and power generation.“Cars today have cameras, microphones, GPS tracking and other technologies connected to the internet. It doesn’t take much imagination to understand how a foreign adversary with access to this information could pose a serious risk to both our national security and the privacy of US citizens,” Raimondo said in a statement.Bloomberg reported on Saturday that the Biden administration planned to put the rule in place. The plan was first reported by Reuters.The proposal comes as a result of an investigation into whether Chinese-made vehicles threatened national security. The commerce department started the probe in February, citing the large influx of personal data that cars take in through their sensors and cameras.A software ban would go into effect for vehicles modeled in 2027, while the hardware rule would take effect for vehicles modeled in 2030. Units without a model year would be under the rule starting January 1, 2029.Senior administration officials said this is because most US market vehicles don’t have any Chinese- or Russian-made software, making that aspect of the rule a largely preventative measure. It may take longer to pivot away from Chinese-made hardware, however.It’s unclear how many vehicles currently have Chinese-made hardware or how the US auto industry’s supply chain will need to adapt to accommodate the potential rule.Once a rule is proposed, the Commerce Department invites public comments for 30 days after publication.Separately, the White House announced a series of commitments for small and medium-sized automakers on Monday, with a $9.1 million grant to launch an electric vehicle supply chain transition program in Michigan.As part of the US actions, Monroe Capital committed to raise up to $1 billion for small automakers to grow and diversify their business.","The Biden administration is proposing a rule to block the sale and import of Chinese- and Russian-made hardware and software for connected vehicles.

Norway's Equinor scraps plans to export blue hydrogen to Germany,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/norways-equinor-scraps-plans-to-export-blue-hydrogen-to-germany/articleshow/113558319.cms,"OSLO: Norway's Equinor has scrapped plans to export so-called blue hydrogen to Germany because it is too expensive and there is insufficient demand, a spokesperson for the energy company said on Friday.Equinor and Germany's RWE signed a memorandum of understanding in January 2022 to build a hydrogen supply chain for German power plants to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The plans included producing hydrogen from natural gas in combination with carbon capture and storage - known as blue hydrogen - in Norway and exporting it to hydrogen-ready gas power plants in Germany via the world's first offshore hydrogen pipeline .""The hydrogen pipeline hasn't proved to be viable. That also implies that hydrogen production plans are also put aside,"" Equinor spokesperson Magnus Frantzen Eidsvold told Reuters.""We have decided to discontinue this early-phase project,"" he added.The pipeline was not RWE's project, but required support from both Norway and Germany, the German company said in emailed comments.Last year, Equinor CEO Anders Opedal said the cost of the total supply chain could run into the ""tens of billion euros"", while the pipeline alone would cost some 3 billion euros ($3.35 billion).Eidsvold said Equinor also could not continue maturing the projects without firm long-term commitments from European buyers to import hydrogen.""We are not able to make this kind of investments when we don't have long-term agreements and the markets in place,"" Eidsvold said.Plans to develop hydrogen-ready gas power plants in Germany with RWE will go ahead but hydrogen for them will be procured on the continent, not exported from Norway, Eidsvold said.The German government has been in intensive talks on the issue with Norway, a German economy ministry official told Reuters on Saturday.The official said the new plan now includes converting Norwegian gas into blue hydrogen in the Netherlands and shipping the captured carbon dioxide back to Norway for storage.RWE said hydrogen-ready gas power plants could start production at earliest from 2030 provided the German government approves a support regime for such plants.Equinor will continue other early-phase hydrogen projects, such as in Britain and the Netherlands, as well, Eidsvold added.",Equinor and Germany's RWE signed a memorandum of understanding in January 2022 to build a hydrogen supply chain for German power plants.

WASHINGTON: The board of The Fund for responding to Loss and Damage to help countries ravaged by climate-driven disasters named Senegalese finance specialist Ibrahima Cheikh Diong as its first director, the World Bank announced on Saturday.The selection of Diong, a dual US citizen, marks a major milestone in the operationalization of the new World Bank-administered fund, whose creation in 2022 was a breakthrough for developing country negotiators at United Nations climate talks, overcoming years of resistance from wealthy nations.Now with the Philippines recently selected as the home of the fund and Diong appointed as director, the fund can begin turning the $800 million pledged to it at last year's COP28 climate summit in Dubai into ""tangible funding ready for disbursement,"" according to the presidency of the next round of climate talks starting in November in Baku, Azerbaijan, known as COP29. COP29 's president will call on countries to contribute more money.Loss and damage had long been a contentious issue in the U.N. climate talks, with less-developed countries calling for a new fund that specifically assists countries for the catastrophic losses they've incurred due to rising seas and turbo-charged storms and wealthier nations concerned this could become a form of ""compensation"" for the impact of their share of greenhouse gas emissions.""The Fund for responding to Loss and Damage will make a significant difference to those disproportionately affected, and I take this responsibility with humility and a full commitment to serve,"" said Diong in a statement.","The selection of Senegalese finance specialist Ibrahima Cheikh Diong marks a major milestone in the operationalization of the new World Bank-administered fund.

White House invests over $3 Billion to boost US electric vehicle battery production,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/white-house-invests-over-3-billion-to-boost-us-electric-vehicle-battery-production/articleshow/113521696.cms,"The White House on Friday allocated more than $3 billion to American companies to increase domestic production of advanced batteries and other materials used in electric vehicles The grants will support 25 projects across 14 states, including key battleground states such as Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, South Carolina, and Louisiana. This funding is part of an ongoing initiative to decrease China's global dominance in battery production for EVs and other electronic devices.This marks the second round of EV battery funding under the bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021, following an initial round that provided $1.8 billion for 14 ongoing projects. The total amounts are lower than those announced in October 2022, reflecting the withdrawal or rejection of some projects during the negotiation process between companies and US officials.The funding is a crucial component of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris's broader strategy to accelerate the production and adoption of electric vehicles, which they see as essential for mitigating climate change and strengthening US manufacturing. The companies receiving these awards are involved in processing lithium, graphite, and other battery materials, as well as manufacturing components used in EV batteries.""Today's awards move us closer to achieving the administration's goal of building an end-to-end supply chain for batteries and critical minerals here in America, from mining to processing to manufacturing and recycling, which is vital to reduce China's dominance of this critical sector,"" said White House economic adviser Lael Brainard.The Biden-Harris administration remains dedicated to producing batteries in the United States that will be essential for powering the nation's grid, homes, businesses, and the iconic American auto industry.Brainard further said that the US government has announced nearly $35 billion in investments to strengthen the country's critical minerals and battery supply chains. These investments span from lithium mines in Nevada and North Carolina to battery factories in Michigan and Ohio, as well as the production of rare earth elements and magnets in California and Texas.Brainard emphasized that the administration is utilizing various tools, including grants, loans, and allocated tax credits, to support these initiatives. She noted that the administration's approach has attracted over $100 billion in private sector investment since President Biden took office.In recent years, China has dominated the processing and refining of key minerals such as lithium, rare earth elements, and gallium, as well as battery production, leaving the US and its allies ""vulnerable"", according to Brainard. In response, the US has taken ""tough, targeted measures to enforce against unfair actions by China"", including higher tariffs on Chinese imports of critical minerals and restrictions on products from China and other adversaries labeled as foreign entities of concern by the US.""We're committed to making batteries in the United States of America,"" said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.The awards announced on Friday, if finalized, will support 25 projects, creating 8,000 construction jobs and over 4,000 permanent jobs. Companies receiving grants will be required to match the funding on a 50-50 basis, with a minimum investment of $50 million, according to the Energy Department.Matthew McDowell, an associate professor of engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, noted that while federal funding may not be crucial for all projects, the influx of cash from the infrastructure and climate laws has significantly transformed the US battery manufacturing sector in recent years. McDowell expressed excitement about the next generation of batteries for clean energy storage, including solid state batteries, which have the potential to hold more energy than lithium ion batteries.","The grants will support 25 projects across 14 states, including key battleground states such as Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, South Carolina, and Louisiana.

Declining sales and failure to evolve: How Tupperware found itself in crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/declining-sales-and-failure-to-evolve-how-tupperware-found-itself-in-crisis/articleshow/113489961.cms,"Tupperware Goes Bankrupt: How The Colourful Tiffin Box Maker Lost Its Vibe I Explained

Tupperware Brands , the company known for its iconic colourful food storage containers , filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Tuesday. The company has been reportedly struggling with mounting losses due to declining demand for its products in recent years.In the 1950s, Tupperware experienced a surge in popularity as women of the post-war generation held ""Tupperware parties"" at their homes to sell the containers, seeking empowerment and independence.However, the company has faced challenges in recent years as it struggled to place its products in retail stores and online sales platforms. Tupperware has traditionally relied on independent sales representatives to sell its products, but this strategy has failed to reach modern consumers, according to Brian Fox, Tupperware's chief restructuring officer, who said in a court filing, ""Nearly everyone now knows what Tupperware is, but fewer people know where to find it.""Financial analysts also criticized Tupperware in recent years for sticking with the direct sales model and failing to evolve with the times.Despite efforts to turn its business around, Tupperware has been facing challenges for years, reporting several quarters of falling sales. The post-Covid circumstances intensified these challenges. Initially, Tupperware saw a boost in sales as Americans turned to home cooking during the pandemic. Yet, as the world reopened, the company faced a sharp rise in labour, freight, and raw material costs—particularly for plastic resin. These increasing expenses, coupled with a failure to adapt its sales strategy, have resulted in several quarters of falling sales.Tupperware has been grappling with liquidity constraints and has raised doubts about its ability to remain in business. News agency Reuters reported that the company has $812 million in debt, much of which was purchased by distressed debt investors at a deep discount in July. These new lenders sought to use their debt position to seize Tupperware assets, including its intellectual property such as its brand, pushing the company to seek bankruptcy protection.Tupperware intends to continue operations and conduct a 30-day bidding process to find a buyer for the entire company.According to bankruptcy filings, Tupperware has estimated assets of $500 million to $1 billion and estimated liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion. The company has listed the number of creditors to be between 50,001 and 100,000. In 2023, Tupperware finalized an agreement with its lenders to restructure its debt obligations and engaged investment bank Moelis & Co to help explore strategic options.","Tupperware Brands, the company known for its iconic colourful food storage containers, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday.

US stocks dip despite larger Fed interest rate cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-dip-despite-larger-fed-interest-rate-cut/articleshow/113473355.cms,"On Wednesday, Wall Street stocks experienced a slight decline following the Federal Reserve's announcement of a half-percentage-point interest rate cut. The central bank's chair, Jerome Powell , assured a ""careful"" approach to lowering rates, acknowledging the progress made in combating inflation in the United States.The Federal Reserve's decision was supported by an 11-to-1 vote in favor of reducing the benchmark rate to a range between 4.75 percent and 5.00 percent.The larger-than-expected rate cut surprised some analysts who had anticipated a quarter-point decrease. Additionally, policymakers projected an extra half-point of cuts by the end of this year and a further percentage point of cuts in 2025.Meanwhile, major US stock indices fluctuated between positive and negative territory following the Fed's decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.08 points, or 0.25%, to 41,503.10, the S&P 500 lost 16.32 points, or 0.29%, to 5,618.26 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 54.76 points, or 0.31%, to 17,573.30. Briefing.com noted that the Fed's decision would be met ""with both elation and criticism,"" as the larger rate cut could appease those who believe the Fed is lagging in preventing a hard landing. However, it may also face criticism from those who think the more aggressive rate cut was unwarranted given broader economic trends, with concerns that it could reignite inflation.During a news conference, Powell described the US economy as being in ""good shape,"" highlighting lower inflation and robust growth. He emphasized the Fed's desire to maintain a strong labor market. The decision to implement a larger rate cut was based on various economic data points, leading policymakers to conclude that monetary decisions had been ""appropriately restrictive"" and that a ""more neutral"" approach was now necessary. Powell signaled that investors should expect more interest rate cuts in the future but cautioned that the central bank would proceed carefully and evaluate the matter ""meeting by meeting.""In Europe, stock markets in Paris and London closed lower, while Frankfurt ended the day flat. The dollar initially experienced a significant drop against the euro and other currencies but later recovered. The Fed now anticipates only a half-percentage point of cuts remaining in 2024, which is lower than the three-quarter percentage point that traders had been expecting. Traders are now focusing on the upcoming announcement by the Bank of England on Thursday. The central bank is expected to maintain its current stance following a regular meeting, as official data released on Wednesday showed that British annual inflation remained at 2.2 percent in August.(With inputs from agencies)","The Federal Reserve announced a half-percentage-point interest rate cut on Wednesday.
