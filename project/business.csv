China’s central bank unleashed an unprecedented blitz of policy support for the economy, as authorities made their boldest swing so far to hit this year’s annual growth target of about 5%, after a flurry of Wall Street banks downgraded their forecasts.People’s Bank of China governor Pan Gongsheng cut the amount of money banks must hold in reserve to the lowest level since at least 2020, and reduced a key policy rate at a rare briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.That marked the first time both measures were slashed on the same day in the past decade, underscoring the urgency of his task.The central bank chief also unveiled a package to shore up the nation’s troubled property sector, including lowering borrowing costs on as much as $5.3 trillion in mortgages and easing rules for second-home purchases.For the nation’s beleaguered equity market, China will unlock at least 800 billion yuan ($113 billion) of liquidity support, Pan added, noting officials were studying setting up a stock stabilization fund.Financial markets gave the package a thumbs-up. The CSI 300 Index rose for a fifth straight day, gaining as much as 1.3%, with over 200 of the companies in the gauge climbing. Commodities markets eked out small gains and the yuan was little changed against the dollar. Government bonds flipped to a loss on the stock gains. China’s 10-year bond yields rose 2 basis points to 2.05%, erasing an earlier decline to a record low.But while Pan’s policy barrage beat expectations, and likely put the growth target back in sight, analysts questioned whether it was enough to break China’s deflationary spiral and entrenched real estate crisis.“It’s hard to say what silver bullet can help resolve everything,” said Ken Wong, Asian equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments Hong Kong Ltd. “While it’s good to have monetary easing measures that are accommodative, more needs to be done in order to help solidify fourth quarter growth.”Chang Shu, China economistPresident Xi Jinping ’s government has been trying to give the economy a kick without resorting to bazooka stimulus packages of past years, but so far piecemeal efforts have failed to arrest the slowdown. That deterioration — growth has slowed to its worst pace in five quarters — is testing the leadership’s tolerance for missing a high-profile target for the second time in three years.“The purpose of today’s briefing is to inject confidence into the market, judging by the fact that the authorities revealed measures in one go,” said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Group Ltd. “The stimulus push will still need coordination from other policies — particularly follow-up policies from the fiscal side.”The Federal Reserve’s bigger-than-expected half-percentage point slash has given central banks across Asia more room to move. But making money cheaper won’t lift the economy if Chinese consumers don’t want to spend because layoffs are looming amid sliding corporate profits and property prices are still falling. New home prices clocked their biggest decline last month from the previous period since 2014.China's Government Spending Drops | Revenue is down because land sales fell, so spending is also down from last yearPan’s decisive display of ramped up monetary policy now sets the stage for the Finance Ministry to unveil its own bid to defend the growth target. A plunge in revenue from land sales has held back fiscal spending this year, leaving indebted local governments with little bandwidth to invest in growth-boosting projects.“It is too far from being a bazooka,” ANZ chief greater China economist Raymond Yeung said of the package. “We are not sure how much the mortgage rate cut will induce a property recovery.”China’s property rescue package unveiled in May has failed to turn around a years-long real estate slump. Only 29 cities out of 200 urged to participate are heeding Beijing’s call to help absorb an excess of housing.Details of Pan’s package:The central bank governor unveiled his big policy shift at his first high-profile press conference since March, appearing alongside securities regulator chief Wu Qing, and Li Yunze, head of the National Financial Regulatory Administration. The trio used their collective public debut to roll out steps to salvage investor sentiment and stem a selloff in the stock market.That included new financial tools to expand liquidity for the stock market, which would help listed companies and major shareholders buy back shares and raise holdings.The PBOC chief has displayed a more transparent approach to policy this year, in a bid to stabilize sentiment. Pan used a similar briefing in January to announce a RRR cut two weeks ahead of time, as authorities tried to halt a $6 trillion stock-market rout.“Monetary policy easing came in bolder than expected,” said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Plc. “We see room for bolder easing ahead in the coming quarters, following the Fed’s outsized rate cuts.”","The People’s Bank of China unleashed a barrage of measures, from cuts to interest rates and reserve requirements to making central bank funding available for investors to purchase stocks.

"India competitive, not dependent on China+1: Piyush Goyal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-competitive-not-dependent-on-china1-piyush-goyal/articleshow/113647832.cms,"It's been 10 years since Make in India was launched and one of the objectives was to increase the share of manufacturing to 25% of GDP...

When do you see share of manufacturing rise to 25%?

One of the major elements of manufacturing journey has been the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme but there have been some complaints of delayed payments. How are you addressing that?

What is the feedback that you are getting from investors in Singapore and Australia? How far has the China Plus One strategy helped India?

Ten years after PM Narendra Modi announced the ' Make in India ' initiative, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal says India has made tremendous progress in manufacturing and is poised to increase the share of the sector in overall GDP. In an interview with TOI over the phone from Australia, Goyal says there is massive interest in developed countries for a renewed thrust for offshoring and India will gain because of its own competitive advantage, and not because of the China Plus One strategy.Excerpts:In 2014, we inherited a broken economy, with poor investor mood, low GDP growth with high inflation, a weak currency and a series of corruption scandals. Confidence in the India story was abysmally low. PM Modi took the challenge and introduced the Make In India initiative, focused on ease of doing business and improving India's ranking, helped India move up in the innovation index, decriminalised laws, addressed tax concerns and initiated landmark reforms such as GST and insolvency law. It was a multi-pronged attack, which has helped us stay resilient, despite Covid and amid the pressure of the two wars that are being fought. Despite global inflation, high interest rates and a slowdown in several parts of the world, India has emerged as the fastest growing major economy. The Indian economy has expanded by 90% and the manufacturing sector has kept pace with the overall growth to retain its share.We are drawing up plans. It is a journey which requires us to step up the pace and double the growth in the sector to achieve that target. We must ensure that all our sectors remain competitive, be it labour intensive or the new and emerging areas.We have seen good investment through PLI. Once production starts and the targets are met, payments follow. Sectors such as mobiles, pharma and food processing, which are not long gestation, have helped increase production and exports and created jobs. The results are already visible. NITI Aayog is looking at demands for inclusion of other sectors.India stands on its own leg and has its own competitive advantage. It is not dependent on China Plus One strategy. During my discussions, it is clearly emerging that volume of production in several of the developed countries is meant to cater to their domestic needs and some export demand and the products are very highly priced. To corner a bigger share of the markets in Asia, Africa and Latina America, they will have to become more competitive and that will only be possible only if they manufacture products at scale and at competitive prices. India offers tremendous advantages in the form of four Ds - a decisive leadership, demographic dividend with highly skilled and talented youth, demand and democracy and rule of law, where there is safety of investment and non-discrimination."," commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal says India has made tremendous progress in manufacturing.

Kotak Institutional Equities estimates earnings for the benchmark Nifty 50 firms to grow at 8.4% in the current fiscal year ending March 2025, against 20% last year.Indian stocks have been hitting successive records, with both domestic and overseas investors betting on the nation’s rapid economic expansion. A risk-on sentiment in global markets following the Federal Reserve’s jumbo rate cut last week sent Nifty to a fresh peak on Tuesday.While market watchers debate whether the recent returns can be sustained, an investment shift appears to be underway. Some investors are moving to larger stocks, where valuations seem reasonable, while others are rotating funds to sectors like financials, which have trailed the broader market rally.As analysts revise their calls, more than two-third of the Nifty 200 stocks now carry a ‘hold’ recommendation, compared to an almost equal split between buy and hold a decade ago. The shift reflects a more cautious stance, even as India remains a bright spot globally despite concerns around expensive valuations. Notably, only five of the 196 stocks under review have a sell rating, little changed from 2015.“India being a growth market, analysts would try to have a buy or hold rating rather than a sell,” said Kapoor.Methodology: The study rates each analyst’s rating on a scale of five (buy) to one (sell) to find the average consensus rating. If the value is equal to or above four, the stock is counted a consensus buy, while an average rating of two or below considers it a consensus sell. Those falling in the middle are taken as a hold.",The number of stocks on the NSE Nifty 200 index with a consensus ‘buy’ rating totaled 61 as of Tuesday. A dimmer outlook for corporate earnings is making analysts skeptical of further gains in some of the shares that drove a years- long rally in Indian equities.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113649473,imgsize-82510,width-400,resizemode-4/113649473.jpg"

Why it’s time to explore bold & path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-its-time-to-explore-bold-path-breaking-alternatives-that-put-indian-railways-on-a-smooth-track/articleshow/112317406.cms,"By Ashutosh Bhandari

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024? Experts decode,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/are-nps-vatsalya-hiked-nps-deduction-limit-for-private-sector-employees-good-moves-from-budget-2024-experts-decode/articleshow/112108765.cms,"How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

However, the savings may not necessarily be accrued by households or corporates (by way of lower energy bills), and it is the government which can decide whether to pass on the gains, and how much to pass on, through lower prices, creating a trade-off between fiscal revenues and inflation,"" the report by Rahul Bajoria said.In rupee terms, the report estimated crude prices declining just under Rs 9/litre between September (2023) and March 2024. It said oil prices have fallen 20% since the last fuel price revision in April, leading to widening (marketing) margins for fuel retailers the government can tap into.""The government can look at a gain of almost Rs 110 billion in revenue/profits annually for the additional rupee oil companies make on petroleum products, thus making the gains potentially be close to Rs 1 trillion on an annualised basis, or 0.3% of GDP, if these numbers hold for another year or so,"" the report said. This gives the government room to recoup revenue it had foregone by reducing excise duty on petrol and diesel in the last two years to cushion consumers from flaring energy prices.If the government chooses not to absorb the savings, and pass it on to consumers, it will have an immediate impact on inflation and consumption over a longer period. On inflation, petrol has a weight of 2.19% in the CPI, while diesel, which is mostly used for industrial purposes, has a weight of only 0.15%. ""Together, a Rs 5 /litre reduction in retail fuel costs would imply a 5.5% reduction in fuel index, which will generate a 14 bp direct impact, and another 14-15 bp of indirect effect over a period of 2-4 months, bringing the total impact closer to 29 bp,"" the report said.Noting India meets 80% of oil requirement through imports, the report estimated the 20% decline in crude prices would result in savings of almost $13 billion for every $10/barrel decline annually. ""This translates into about 0.3% of GDP on the current account, which further boosts external finances, it said and pointed out the ""RBI has accrued about $67 billion of additional foreign reserves in 2024 itself"".Benchmark Brent crude dropped to $70/barrel earlier this month, the lowest since December 2021, and is hovering just below the $75/barrel, down 20% from a peak of $92 in April.

China unveils biggest package yet to boost property market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-unveils-biggest-package-yet-to-boost-property-market/articleshow/113615763.cms,"The move will ease mortgage burdens on around 150 million people.

China unveiled its biggest package yet to shore up its beleaguered property market, lowering borrowing costs on as much as $5.3 trillion in mortgages and easing down-payment requirements for second home purchases to a historical low.The People’s Bank of China will cut outstanding mortgage rates for individual borrowers by an average of 0.5 percentage point, Governor Pan Gongsheng said at a press conference on Tuesday.The minimum down-payment ratio on second home purchases will be lowered to 15% from 25%.The plan, confirming earlier reports by Bloomberg News, underscores Beijing’s urgency to stem a housing-led slowdown in Asia’s largest economy as it faces the prospect of increasing protectionism and a shaky global outlook. The moves comes as economists at banks including UBS Group AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp. predicted that China will fall short of delivering on its growth target this year.A Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of Chinese property developer shares rose as much as 4.9% on Tuesday morning before paring the gain to 1.5% as of 10:10am. The index has slid 33% from this year’s high in mid-May.“This package is China’s biggest and widest supporting measures on home loans yet, as it covers both new home-buying and outstanding purchases,” said Yan Yuejin, vice president of Shanghai E-house’s research arm.Policymakers have taken forceful steps to lower financing costs this year including scrapping a central government-guided mortgage rate floor for first home purchases. But such moves have mostly benefited new property buyers, exacerbating the disparity with existing homeowners that has driven a wave of early mortgage repayments and strained lenders in recent years.Currently, existing mortgages carry an average interest rate of about 4%, compared with 3.2% on newly-issued loans for a first home and 3.5% for a second home, according to data compiled by China Real Estate Information Corp. in late August.The move will ease mortgage burdens an estimated 150 million people, cutting their annual interest expenses by about 150 billion yuan, Pan said. While China has pushed average mortgage costs to a record low this year, most households haven’t benefited because banks won’t reprice existing loans until next year.Still, it will likely add pressure on the nation’s biggest banks, which have been struggling with record low margins, sinking profits and rising bad loans.Pan said the new round of interest rate adjustments will have a neutral impact on bank profits and margins, given that more funding is freed up and deposit rates will follow suit. Officials also announced on Tuesday they would add capital to the largest lenders.Banks have resorted to multiple deposit rate cuts to mitigate the impact of lower loan rates. Combined profits at China’s commercial lenders rose 0.4% in the first half, the slowest pace since 2020, according to official data. The sector’s net interest margins have continued to decline, hitting a record low of 1.54% at the end of June, well below the 1.8% threshold regarded as necessary to maintain reasonable profitability.The reduction to the minimum down-payment ratio for second-home buyers follows a sizable cut to 25% in May. Top regulators have said China will support homebuyer demand to upgrade to bigger homes.China’s real estate crisis is now into its fourth year with no signs of letting up. The slump in home sales deepened in August as the impact of policy loosening measures waned and buyers were deterred by expectations for prices to keep falling.","The People’s Bank of China will cut outstanding mortgage rates for individual borrowers by an average of 0.5 percentage point. The minimum down-payment ratio on second home purchases will be lowered to 15% from 25%.

That also implies that hydrogen production plans are also put aside,"" Equinor spokesperson Magnus Frantzen Eidsvold told Reuters.""We have decided to discontinue this early-phase project,"" he added.The pipeline was not RWE's project, but required support from both Norway and Germany, the German company said in emailed comments.Last year, Equinor CEO Anders Opedal said the cost of the total supply chain could run into the ""tens of billion euros"", while the pipeline alone would cost some 3 billion euros ($3.35 billion).Eidsvold said Equinor also could not continue maturing the projects without firm long-term commitments from European buyers to import hydrogen.""We are not able to make this kind of investments when we don't have long-term agreements and the markets in place,"" Eidsvold said.Plans to develop hydrogen-ready gas power plants in Germany with RWE will go ahead but hydrogen for them will be procured on the continent, not exported from Norway, Eidsvold said.The German government has been in intensive talks on the issue with Norway, a German economy ministry official told Reuters on Saturday.The official said the new plan now includes converting Norwegian gas into blue hydrogen in the Netherlands and shipping the captured carbon dioxide back to Norway for storage.RWE said hydrogen-ready gas power plants could start production at earliest from 2030 provided the German government approves a support regime for such plants.Equinor will continue other early-phase hydrogen projects, such as in Britain and the Netherlands, as well, Eidsvold added.",Equinor and Germany's RWE signed a memorandum of understanding in January 2022 to build a hydrogen supply chain for German power plants.

White House invests over $3 Billion to boost US electric vehicle battery production,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/white-house-invests-over-3-billion-to-boost-us-electric-vehicle-battery-production/articleshow/113521696.cms,"The White House on Friday allocated more than $3 billion to American companies to increase domestic production of advanced batteries and other materials used in electric vehicles The grants will support 25 projects across 14 states, including key battleground states such as Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, South Carolina, and Louisiana. This funding is part of an ongoing initiative to decrease China's global dominance in battery production for EVs and other electronic devices.This marks the second round of EV battery funding under the bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021, following an initial round that provided $1.8 billion for 14 ongoing projects. The total amounts are lower than those announced in October 2022, reflecting the withdrawal or rejection of some projects during the negotiation process between companies and US officials.The funding is a crucial component of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris's broader strategy to accelerate the production and adoption of electric vehicles, which they see as essential for mitigating climate change and strengthening US manufacturing. The companies receiving these awards are involved in processing lithium, graphite, and other battery materials, as well as manufacturing components used in EV batteries.""Today's awards move us closer to achieving the administration's goal of building an end-to-end supply chain for batteries and critical minerals here in America, from mining to processing to manufacturing and recycling, which is vital to reduce China's dominance of this critical sector,"" said White House economic adviser Lael Brainard.The Biden-Harris administration remains dedicated to producing batteries in the United States that will be essential for powering the nation's grid, homes, businesses, and the iconic American auto industry.Brainard further said that the US government has announced nearly $35 billion in investments to strengthen the country's critical minerals and battery supply chains. These investments span from lithium mines in Nevada and North Carolina to battery factories in Michigan and Ohio, as well as the production of rare earth elements and magnets in California and Texas.Brainard emphasized that the administration is utilizing various tools, including grants, loans, and allocated tax credits, to support these initiatives. She noted that the administration's approach has attracted over $100 billion in private sector investment since President Biden took office.In recent years, China has dominated the processing and refining of key minerals such as lithium, rare earth elements, and gallium, as well as battery production, leaving the US and its allies ""vulnerable"", according to Brainard. In response, the US has taken ""tough, targeted measures to enforce against unfair actions by China"", including higher tariffs on Chinese imports of critical minerals and restrictions on products from China and other adversaries labeled as foreign entities of concern by the US.""We're committed to making batteries in the United States of America,"" said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.The awards announced on Friday, if finalized, will support 25 projects, creating 8,000 construction jobs and over 4,000 permanent jobs. Companies receiving grants will be required to match the funding on a 50-50 basis, with a minimum investment of $50 million, according to the Energy Department.Matthew McDowell, an associate professor of engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, noted that while federal funding may not be crucial for all projects, the influx of cash from the infrastructure and climate laws has significantly transformed the US battery manufacturing sector in recent years. McDowell expressed excitement about the next generation of batteries for clean energy storage, including solid state batteries, which have the potential to hold more energy than lithium ion batteries.","The grants will support 25 projects across 14 states, including key battleground states such as Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, South Carolina, and Louisiana.

Declining sales and failure to evolve: How Tupperware found itself in crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/declining-sales-and-failure-to-evolve-how-tupperware-found-itself-in-crisis/articleshow/113489961.cms,"Tupperware Goes Bankrupt: How The Colourful Tiffin Box Maker Lost Its Vibe I Explained

Tupperware Brands , the company known for its iconic colourful food storage containers , filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Tuesday. The company has been reportedly struggling with mounting losses due to declining demand for its products in recent years.In the 1950s, Tupperware experienced a surge in popularity as women of the post-war generation held ""Tupperware parties"" at their homes to sell the containers, seeking empowerment and independence.However, the company has faced challenges in recent years as it struggled to place its products in retail stores and online sales platforms. Tupperware has traditionally relied on independent sales representatives to sell its products, but this strategy has failed to reach modern consumers, according to Brian Fox, Tupperware's chief restructuring officer, who said in a court filing, ""Nearly everyone now knows what Tupperware is, but fewer people know where to find it.""Financial analysts also criticized Tupperware in recent years for sticking with the direct sales model and failing to evolve with the times.Despite efforts to turn its business around, Tupperware has been facing challenges for years, reporting several quarters of falling sales. The post-Covid circumstances intensified these challenges. Initially, Tupperware saw a boost in sales as Americans turned to home cooking during the pandemic. Yet, as the world reopened, the company faced a sharp rise in labour, freight, and raw material costs—particularly for plastic resin. These increasing expenses, coupled with a failure to adapt its sales strategy, have resulted in several quarters of falling sales.Tupperware has been grappling with liquidity constraints and has raised doubts about its ability to remain in business. News agency Reuters reported that the company has $812 million in debt, much of which was purchased by distressed debt investors at a deep discount in July. These new lenders sought to use their debt position to seize Tupperware assets, including its intellectual property such as its brand, pushing the company to seek bankruptcy protection.Tupperware intends to continue operations and conduct a 30-day bidding process to find a buyer for the entire company.According to bankruptcy filings, Tupperware has estimated assets of $500 million to $1 billion and estimated liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion.
