Sensex at 1 lakh milestone this term? BSE Sensex jumped 93% during Nirmala Sitharaman’s first stint as FM!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-at-1-lakh-milestone-this-term-bse-sensex-jumped-93-during-nirmala-sitharamans-first-stint-as-fm/articleshow/110931816.cms,"When will BSE Sensex hit the 1 lakh milestone? Market analysts and experts are optimistic about the Indian equity markets scaling new highs with the Narendra Modi-led NDA government retaining Nirmala Sitharaman as the Finance Minister. During her first tenure as India’s Finance Minister, the Sensex experienced a remarkable 93% jump!According to an ET analysis by Nikhil Agarwal, when Sitharaman initially assumed the role of Finance Minister on May 31, 2019, taking over from Arun Jaitley, the Sensex was hovering around the 39,700 level. On Monday, before the portfolio allocation was announced, the index reached a lifetime high above the 77,000 mark.Market experts have now set their sights on the much-anticipated 1 lakh milestone for the Sensex. Anand Rathi's predictions suggest that this target could be achieved by the end of FY28. Additionally, market guru Raamdeo Agrawal recently forecasted a level of 1.5 lakh by 2029, which appears attainable if the Sensex maintains a 15% annual compounding rate and earnings growth supports the current P/E levels of 25x.Also Read | Railway stocks in focus: How Titagarh Wagons, RVNL, other rail stocks gave up to 1,800% returns under Ashwini Vaishnaw Incidentally, Mark Mobius , the renowned billionaire investor, maintains a positive outlook on the Indian stock market 's potential for growth, irrespective of the Narendra Modi-led NDA's weaker mandate in the Lok Sabha election results of 2024.During an interview with ET, Mobius was questioned about his previous forecast of the Sensex reaching the 1 lakh mark within the next five years. He reaffirmed his position, stating, ""We are still on that upward trajectory. There will always be corrections, but we are still in that direction. We will hit that (1 lakh mark for Sensex). Maybe even before five years. India may be an exception in terms of moving faster.""Mobius's confidence in the Indian market's ability to reach new milestones remains unwavering, even suggesting that the Sensex could potentially hit the 1 lakh mark earlier than initially predicted, given India's remarkable growth rate.Under Sitharaman's leadership, the stock market achieved several significant milestones, including surpassing the $5 trillion market capitalization mark and witnessing the number of demat accounts exceed 15 crore. Notably, retail investors demonstrated their strength by absorbing most of the selling pressure from foreign institutional investors (FIIs).The continuity of key ministries such as Defence, Home Affairs, Road Transport, Finance, and External Affairs, with the same BJP faces as in the previous term, has been positively received by analysts.Nomura analysts believe that with Sitharaman's reappointment, the emphasis on infrastructure and ongoing fiscal consolidation should persist. They noted that following the election outcome, investors were primarily concerned about political stability and policy continuity. However, over the past week, these concerns have diminished, and the cabinet composition suggests policy continuity at present. Nomura anticipates an improvement in FII flows as policy continuity is established.Also Read | India big gainer from China plus one strategy!

The brokerage anticipates the likelihood of incrementally positive/strong FII flows alongside robust domestic flows, given the experienced individuals leading key ministries in the coalition's third term.The Union Budget, expected to be presented in July, will be the next significant event for investors.

Why did RBI bring 100 tonnes of gold reserves back to India? RBI governor Shaktikanta Das explains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-did-rbi-bring-100-tonnes-of-gold-reserves-back-to-india-rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-explains/articleshow/110867282.cms,"Why did RBI move 100 tonnes of India’s gold reserves back into the country? TOI was the first to report about the central bank’s decision to bring back such big amount of gold back into India from the UK.Shaktikanta Das , the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has now explained the rationale behind the decision to bring 100 tonnes of gold back to the country. He has said that the amount of gold held outside India had increased due to RBI's purchases, and since there was available storage capacity within the country, a portion of the gold was decided to be stored domestically.Das said that the quantity of gold held by RBI had remained unchanged for an extended period. However, as RBI continued to purchase gold as part of its reserves management strategy, the amount of gold stored outside the country kept increasing. Given the domestic storage capacity, it was deemed appropriate to store a portion of the gold within India.Also See | Top 10 Countries With Highest Foreign Exchange Reserves Including Gold: Where do India, China, US stand? Check list “The quantum of gold held by RBI was static for a long time. As data shows, RBI was buying gold as part of its reserves management, and the quantum of gold held outside was going up. We have domestic capacity, and we felt part of the gold should be stored within the country. There is nothing more to it,” Das said.When asked about the Rangarajan committee's recommendation from 1993, which suggested that at least 25% of the gold reserves should be held overseas, Das pointed out that significant changes have occurred since then. He mentioned that a high-level committee is currently responsible for managing such matters.Das expressed astonishment that only one media outlet had reported on the relocation of 100 tonnes of gold from the UK to RBI's vaults in India, which was first reported by TOI on May 31, 2024. Now, approximately half of the gold is stored in vaults within the country.In an unprecedented move since early 1991, RBI has added a substantial quantity of precious metal to its domestic stock. Sources had told TOI that a similar amount of gold may be transferred to locations within the country in the coming months for logistical reasons and diversified storage.Also See | Top 10 Countries Receiving Highest Remittances: India tops list with new world record! Where do Pakistan, China stand? Check list RBI's latest data shows that as of March-end, it held 822.1 tonnes of gold, with 413.8 tonnes stored overseas. The central bank has been among those that have purchased gold in recent years, adding 27.5 tonnes during the last financial year. Traditionally, the Bank of England has been the storehouse for many central banks, including India, with some of the yellow metal stocks dating back to pre-Independence days.The transfer of 100 tonnes of gold, nearly a fourth of the country's stock at the end of March, was a complex logistical undertaking that required months of meticulous planning and execution. It involved close coordination between various government entities, including the finance ministry, RBI, and local authorities, the TOI report said.To facilitate the shipment, the Centre granted RBI a customs duty exemption, foregoing revenue on this sovereign asset. However, integrated GST, which is shared with the states, was still levied on the imports.A special aircraft was used to transport the large quantities of gold, with extensive security arrangements in place. The move is expected to help RBI save on some of the storage costs paid to the Bank of England, although the amount is not significant.Within India, gold is stored in vaults located in RBI's old office building on Mint Road in Mumbai and in Nagpur.","Shaktikanta Das, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has explained the rationale behind the decision to bring 100 tonnes of gold back to the country.

IT majors scout for engineering firms! IT companies are acquiring engineering services firms to expand their range of competencies and compete with pureplay engineering services companies backed by well-funded private equity firms. Cognizant recently made its largest acquisition in the engineering space, purchasing US-based Belcan for $1.3 billion. This marks Cognizant's second engineering acquisition under new CEO Ravi Kumar's leadership.According to an ET report, other IT companies have also made notable acquisitions in the engineering services sector.In April, Infosys made a significant acquisition by purchasing in-tech, a German company specializing in ER&D, for a sum of $480 million. This move was preceded by another notable acquisition in January, where Infosys acquired InSemi, a provider of semiconductor design and embedded services, for Rs 280 crore ($33 million).HCLTech acquired German automotive engineering firm ASAP last year for $280 million.

Rajib Kumar Mishra , the NBFC 's current non-executive chairman and also the CMD of PTC India, faces the same curbs, but for six months. Both the executives have also been slapped with penalties.

In its 111-page order, Sebi found Singh - who was asked to go on leave - to have ""grossly misused"" his position as the MD and CEO of PFS to prevent an NTPC executive, Ratnesh, from joining as the CFO of the company, with Mishra acting as a willing accomplice.

Three independent directors on the board of PFS - Santosh B Nayar, Thomas Mathews and Kamlesh Shivji Vikamsey - had quit, citing multiple lapses. Singh made a delayed disclosure of the Forensic Audit Report on loans to NSL Nagapatnam Power and Infratech to the board of PFS - two years after completion of the forensic audit.

Also, there was a considerable delay on the part of Singh in providing information in respect of the loan account to the committee of independent directors, formed by the board to examine non-disclosure-related issues of the loan account. Further, despite clear direction from the PFS board to report about the loan account as suspected fraud, there was a significant delay, Sebi noted.

NEW DELHI: Your phone operator may soon charge a fee for the number of your smartphone and the landline if a proposal by telecom regulator Trai gets implemented. Trai feels that phone number ""represents an exceedingly valuable public resource which is not infinite"" and charges may be imposed on mobile operators, who may subsequently recover them from users.It is also considering whether to impose penalties on operators, who are holding on to number resources with low utilisation. For example, a subscriber with dual SIMs not using one for a long time but the operator is not cancelling this number in fear of losing user base.""...Simply adhering to strict criteria for assigning numbering resources might not ensure judicious and efficient use of freely allotted numbering resources by service providers. One way of ensuring judicious and efficient use of any finite public resource is by imposing charges, while allocating it. Efficient utilisation can be further ensured by introducing penal provision for those holding numbering resources with low utilisation.""Trai said just like spectrum, ownership of the numbering space resides with govt, which only grants mobile operators usage rights over the designated number resource during the tenure of licences. The new Telecom Law, which was passed in December last year, also has an enabling provision to charge for numbers, technically known as 'telecom identifiers'.To make a stronger case for fixing a charge on mobile operators, Trai cited several countries where a fee is levied for telephone numbers, either on the mobile operator or on subscribers. These include countries such as Australia, Singapore, Belgium, Finland, the UK, Lithuania, Greece, Hongkong, Bulgaria, Kuwait, Netherlands, Switzerland, Poland, Nigeria, South Africa, and Denmark.Talking about the possible methods of charging, Trai said govt can look at either imposing a one-time charge per number, or seek an annual recurring charge for each numbering resource allocated to the service provider, or allocate numbering series, with govt conducting centralised auctions for the vanity numbers.Trai, which has to submit recommendations to govt that will also cover the aspect of ever-shrinking numbering resources in the era of 5G, machine-to-machine communications and internet of things, is also taking a leaf out of the several auctions that mobile operators carry out for 'vanity/fancy/premium numbers'.","Trai feels that phone number ""represents an exceedingly valuable public resource which is not infinite"" It is also considering whether to impose penalties on operators, who are holding on to number resources with low utilisation.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Mix of old hands and new faces

Full list of the new council of ministers:

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the oath of office for a historic third consecutive term at 7.15pm on Sunday along with his council of ministers in an over 3-hour-long grand ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan .As per media reports, the new Cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting on Monday evening at the Prime Minister's Lok Kalyan Marg residence.Ahead of the swearing-in ceremony , PM Modi had hosted a high tea for the 71 would-be council of ministers (which include 30 Cabinet ministers, 5 Ministers of State-Independent Charge, and 36 Ministers of State). The portfolios of the ministers have not yet been announced.The PM Modi 3.0 council of ministers include representation from all corners of the country as well as social groups. It has 27 ministers from Other Backward Classes, 10 from Scheduled Castes, 5 from Scheduled Tribes and 5 from minorities. A record 18 senior Ministers will be heading ministries.Modi Cabinet 3.0 includes 43 ministers who have served 3 terms or higher in Parliament, with 39 having been ministers in central government before. The list includes multiple former chief ministers and 34 ministers who have served in state legislatures and 23 having worked as ministers in states.There are also 33 first-timers in the ranks. Seven first-time ministers in the Modi government belong to the allies: TDP's K Rammohan Naidu and Chandrasekhar Pemmasani; JDU's Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur, RLD's Jayant Chaudhary, LJP's Chirag Paswan and HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S).The new faces also include Suresh Gopi, the actor-turned-politician who scripted history by becoming the first BJP MP from Kerala.The first-timers from the BJP are Kamlesh Paswan (Uttar Pradesh), Sukanta Majumder (West Bengal), Durga Das Uikey (Madhya Pradesh), Raj Bhushan Chaudhary (Bihar), Satish Dubey (Bihar), Sanjay Seth (Jharkhand), C R Paatil (Gujarat), Bhagirath Chaudhary (Rajasthan), Harsh Malhotra (Delhi), V Somanna (Karnataka), Savitri Thakur (UP).

BJP had won 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and 282 seats in the 2014 general elections.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) unanimously passed a resolution to elect Narendra Modi as their leader on June 5.Several leaders and State heads of neighbourhood region and Indian Ocean region were invited for PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony as distinguished guests.After the last reshuffling of portfolios in the previous Modi government, the council of ministers had comprised the PM and 78 ministers, including 29 Cabinet Ministers, 3 Ministers of State (Independent Charge) and 47 Ministers of State.","PM Narendra Modi takes oath of office for historic third consecutive term, equals Jawaharlal Nehru's record.

Even Bangladesh-based garment exporters are using Delhi airport, with DIAL open to allow more freighters to transport cargo faster.While cargo headed to Europe and North America is not just moreredexpensive because ships are now taking a longer route, around the Cape of Good Hope, but the time taken to send the goods has also increased, prompting exporters to look at newer options, especially where the buyers are demanding faster delivery of goods. Shipping goods takes at least 30 days extra, said a large exporter.""Many exporters are using sea and air transport to save both on time and cost, particularly of footwear, apparel, electronics and high-value low-volume engineering goods,"" said an official at Fieo, the lobby group representing exporters. Even earlier, gems and jewellery were transported by air with some large buyers using freighters to collect their goods.But the higher cost of goods and the time taken has made the deal more favourable for air cargo, although exporters claimed that the cost has increased due to more demand.Exporters led by Apparel Export Promotion Council have also complained that garments from Bangladesh were eating into a part of the space in freighters and aircraft and urged the customs authorities to reverse the decision to allow these shipments from Delhi airport.Govt officials said that around 20% of this type of cargo goes in the belly of the aircraft, while around 80% goes via freighters. At Delhi airport, the monthly capacity available in the belly of the aircraft was estimated at 95,000 tonnes with an estimated 20-25% used during Jan-March. While capacity utilisation may have gone up, cargo originating from Bangladesh was estimated to be using around 4% of the capacity available at IGI airport.""It is possible that there is more pressure in planes that are headed to Europe and the capacity utilised on those aircraft is much higher. Govt has suggested that exporters could pool in resources to hire freighters and DIAL is willing to provide slots for that,"" said a source familiar with the discussions.","Tension around the Red Sea has prompted several exporters to take the air route to deliver goods to the US and Europe.

"Market crash worse than the 2008 recession, warns Economist Harvey Dent",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-crash-worse-than-the-2008-recession-warns-economist-harvey-dent/articleshow/110947932.cms,"Economist Harvey Dent (Photo: X handle)

NEW DELHI: Financial author and economist predicted another "" crash of a lifetime ,"" which could be worse than the 2008 crash. In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Dent warned that the ""everything"" bubble has not yet burst, and the resulting crash could be more severe than the Great Recession.

Dent highlighted the unique nature of the current situation, stating, ""In 1925 to '29, it was a natural bubble. There was no stimulus behind that, artificial stimulus per se. So this is new. This has never happened."" He likened the government's response to attempting to cure a hangover by drinking more alcohol. Dent suggested that the long-term effects of continuously pumping money into the economy remain to be seen, but he expects a larger crash than the one experienced in 2008-2009 due to the prolonged duration of the current bubble.

Despite the strong performance of US stocks in May, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones all posting gains, Dent predicts significant decline. ""I think we're going to see the S&P go down 86% from the top, and the Nasdaq 92%. A hero stock like Nvidia, as good as it is, and it is a great company, [goes] down 98%. Boy, this is over,"" said the economist.

Dent has slightly adjusted the timing of his prediction, now expecting market bottoms to occur between early and mid-2025. He identifies the real estate market as the epicenter of the bubble, claiming that US homes have already increased in value by double or more than their future worth. Dent points to the widespread ownership of homes and the prevalence of speculative second and third home purchases as contributing factors.

In response to critics who label his hypotheses as ""crazy"" or accuse him of fearmongering, Dent said ""I just say what I see and, frankly, don't give a damn if people don't like it, because you [have] got to choose: are you going to tell the truth, or are you going to make people happy?"" He rejects the ""perma-bear"" label, arguing that his predictions are based on historical analysis and the unprecedented power of central banks to create money out of thin air.

Dent advises investors to seek safety in the most secure bonds, emphasizing the United States' position as the world's largest economy and its ability to endure the anticipated downturn. He expects the upcoming crash to be more severe than the one experienced in 2009, as the previous crash was mitigated by stimulus measures. Dent believes this crash will purge excess from the markets, allowing the millennial generation to benefit from a healthier boom in the future.","Economist Harvey Dent predicts another "" crash of a lifetime,"" which could be worse than the 2008 crash.

Speaking to Melker, Scott, the CEO of VanEck said that traditional finance can help push Bitcoin market capitalization to half of that of Gold, which presently stands at $15.7 trillion. Thus, this half implies that the market capitalization of Bitcoin would increase to $7.85 trillion.Thus, the market cap of Bitcoin must increase by 5.7x to reach this milestone. If this happens, the market cap of top crypto coins could increase as well.Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency today and has set the trend for other cryptocurrencies in the market that have mimicked its price trend in the past. Below are 5 top crypto coins that may follow the same trend in the next few months.Based on the outlook heading into the bull market, below are the top altcoins investors can buy for more than 5x returns;1.The newest meme coin project that will lead the Solana market to more gains is Angry Pepe Fork (APORK) . Angry Pepe Fork has started a presale for its native token, APORK, which is currently priced at $0.014 per token. Analysts have predicted that in the coming weeks, there will be a 200% price surge and a 100x surge after its launch and listing on top centralized exchanges.Analysts are positive that APORK is the best coin that can mirror Bitcoin’s price movement because of the unique use case it introduces. Another reason is that APORK has enough room for its market cap to grow compared to the best altcoins, whose market cap has already crossed $1 billion.To achieve this, Angry Pepe Fork is forming a community of rebels who have surprised the entire meme coin space. Their focus is mainly to crush the zombie meme coins that are a problem to the market. The interesting part about this is that the community members can earn free APORK tokens as they crush zombies.Angry Pepe Fork also has a staking feature which its users can benefit from. APORK holders can stake their tokens for 30, 60, or 90 days. The good part is that presale investors can start benefiting from Angry Pepe Fork’s staking option right from the presale stage without having to wait for the project to launch.2.Notcoin (NOT) has evolved from a “tapping token” to one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. The altcoin price recently registered a 400% price surge, which sent it to a new all-time high of $0.02896 outperforming the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.Less than a month after listing, Notcoin has grown to be one of the top 50 cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of over $2 billion. Analysts have predicted bigger increases in the upcoming months and think there is still more rise ahead. They have predicted a market capitalization of more than $5 billion and a price of $0.04536.3.Injective is an AI-based token that is known as Injective and this token market cap may also rise by five times this year. At the moment, its market capitalization is ranging between $2 billion. Though the upward price trend that was witnessed in the latter part of the previous year for injective has faded away, experts do expect another price rally for the AI-based coins in the next couple of months.Besides, there has been a large increase in AI-based projects in the past few months. It is anticipated that the price will hit $45 in the next few months and a market cap of $5 billion or more before this year ends.4.Kaspa (KAS), the proof-of-work cryptocurrency which uses the GHOSTDAG protocol is one of the altcoins that could benefit from Bitcoin’s market cap surge. It is currently going in the upward direction and has been able to fetch double-digit gains on weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly charts.On the yearly timeframes, the price of Kaspa has increased by approximately 900%. Though the current market cap stands at more than $4 billion, it is estimated that within the next few months it is likely to soaring high to $20 billion.5.Bonk is another memecoin that was once the largest on Solana; it is now slowly recovering from the bear market. Bonk has skyrocketed by over 7000 % in the past year and is among the top meme coins that one should invest in at the moment.Experts are quite hopeful about the Bonk memecoin and the future that this token has in the next few months. Its market cap is currently above the $2 billion mark. An increase of 5x would see this value increase to over $10 billion.Since the US SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs, several price predictions have emerged about the future of Bitcoin. Some of the analysts have put their bar at $80k while the more aggressive ones have put it at $150k.Whether the first event happens or the second, it is apparent that the price of the coins would rise, and so would the market capitalization. From the article, speculations have it that the market capitalization of the above-mentioned altcoins, namely the Angry Pepe Fork, Notcoin, Injective, Kaspa, and Bonk, can emulate that of Bitcoin.",Angry Pepe Fork (APORK) is a memecoin built on the Solana blockchain that allows its holders to earn free tokens by defeating Zombie memecoins. Notcoin (NOT) is the native currency for a telegram-based game of a clicker kind which was released in the year 2023. Injective (INJ) is an Artificial Intelligence token that has been able to attract the eyes of the market.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110941446,imgsize-55900,width-838,resizemode-4/110941446.jpg"
Zero growth: UK economy slows to halt in April ahead of general elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/zero-growth-uk-economy-slows-to-halt-in-april-ahead-of-general-elections/articleshow/110936566.cms,"File photo: AFP

NEW DELHI: Ahead of general elections scheduled for July 4 in UK, the British economy recorded zero growth in April , official figures showed on Wednesday. The stagnation came after the economy recorded 0.4% growth in March.

Criticising British PM Rishi Sunak over the state of economy, Labour Party leader Rachel Reeves said, ""Rishi Sunak claims we have turned a corner, but the economy has stalled and there is no growth.""

""The stagnation in GDP in April doesn't mean the economic recovery has been extinguished, but it's hardly great news for the prime minister three weeks ahead of the election,"" UK economist Paul Dales said, AFP reported.

In April, service industries saw a modest growth of 0.2%, whereas production experienced a decline of 0.9% and construction faced a 1.4% reduction.

Earlier this year, Britain rebounded from a brief recession, witnessing growth in the first quarter.

The UK economy faced a mild contraction for two consecutive quarters in the latter part of 2023, satisfying the technical criteria for a recession, driven by heightened inflation.

The meme market has been on fire all year, and this week is no different! The popular dog-themed Shiba Inu leads the pack with a gravity-defying skyrocketing SHIB burn rate. Although Floki price faces a downward spiral, a new red-hot meme coin, Raboo, has rekindled optimism amid the rollercoaster ride in the meme market. This new upstart is burning up the meme market with an astonishing $1.6M raise and thousands of investors flocking in daily. Is the meme frenzy just getting started? Let's get into the specifics.Shiba Inu’s commitment to providing and improving value for its community is noteworthy, and the recent increase in burn rate is solid proof. According to the Shibburn tracker, the SHIB burn rate saw a remarkable 348% upswing that hints at a potential breakout. The effect is a bullish uprise that took its price from the tight-bounded range at $0.000024 to $0.00002511 within 24 hours.On the fundamental front, Shiba Inu (SHIB) went above and beyond. In addition to the surge in the Shib burn rate, there has been a considerable uptick in ecosystem development and on-chain metrics. While the increasing Shib burn rate looks like the much-needed push Shiba Inu (SHIB) needs to get out of the $0.000022 and $0.000025 resistance range, its price still grapples with bear pressure. Currently, its price is milling around $0.000025 with a 3.48% intraday decline. Inspired by Shiba Inu's success, Floki (FLOKI)'s rise to the top of the meme game is solely because of its enormous backing from its supportive community and meme enthusiasts. Floki leaped above a $2B valuation in no time, and the rest is history.Despite the brilliant start and visionary four core roadmap activities, Floki price struggles to maintain its momentum and value . Its 7-day gains, standing at an impressive 16.2%, have been hit by a short-term 0.80% decline that took its price down a peg. Trading volume decreased within the same period, filling investors with foreboding. However, analysts think Floki price will still recover, especially after the recent alliance and massive $12M investment from DWF Labs.Shiba Inu and Floki (FLOKI) have proven that getting in on a blue-chip asset is key to successful crypto investment. However, getting in on a huge potential asset at its presale is even better. While Shiba Inu and Floki (FLOKI) seem to have maxed out their potential, Raboo keeps the game alive with a unique twist.Savvy investors are flocking to secure their stake in its ingenuity. Its record-breaking presale surged 60% to $0.0048 in Stage 4, with over $1.6M raised already. Central to this ingenuity is a mission to build the world's first inclusive AI-powered social-fi meme ecosystem. Anyone can leverage its AI backing to hone meme-hunting skills and connect with like-minded meme enthusiasts.While at it, Raboo will introduce the post-to-earn program for anyone to monetize user-generated content from its proprietary Rabooscan tool. Besides, it will offer a fun-filled contest for token holders to earn passive income in addition to staking rewards, an upcoming NFT collection, exclusive content, and incentivized participation.Unlike many pump-and-dump meme projects, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), and Raboo have proven to be the face of sustainable and viable meme culture. However, Raboo still stands out in stark contrast to the dwindling price of Shiba Inu and Floki. Its security audit, deflationary tokenomics, and meticulously crafted roadmap hint at a revolution that will remain forever. You can participate in the Raboo presale here.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the world's largest cryptocurrencies. They are considered the blue-chip cryptos, although they have experienced their fair share of ups and downs. New investors often confine their portfolios to BTC and ETH to keep things simple.But the crypto market is fast evolving. More projects are emerging with market-relevant utilities and interesting narratives. If these projects take off as envisioned, they stand to gain more than BTC and ETH. Thanks to their low initial market cap, they have larger rooms for returns.PlayDoge (PLAY) is on top of this list. While meme coins are hardly considered robust cryptocurrencies, PlayDoge ($PLAY) is one of the rare exceptions. As the name implies, it is a meme coin and a play-to-earn coin. It combines both to power one of the most promising cryptocurrencies this yearPlayDoge adopts a Tamagotchi style and gives a new twist to the 90s craze with meme coin packaging. The platform brings a wide range of 2D min games in its 8-bit universe, where players can adopt, nurture, and interact with their virtual pet Doges. Players who successfully navigate the game levels and climb up the leaderboards stand to earn attractive rewards in $PLAY tokens.In less than two weeks of going live, PlayDoge is closing in on the $3M milestone. The buying frenzy is driven by its engaging gameplay that taps into 90s nostalgia. PlayDoge offers gamers an exciting way to earn a side income. But what about those not interested in gaming? Then investing is the way to go. To further motivate investors (long-term investors, in particular), PlayDoge has implemented a compelling staking system with attractive APYs.The project looks robust on the technical side as well. To ensure minimal gas fees and seamless transactions, PlayDoge is building its kennel on the BNB Smart Chain. Being a play-to-earn project with viral potential, PlayDoge could replicate the success of projects like Floki Inu. Powered by the hype around the Valhalla play-to-earn game, FLOKI has grown to a staggering $2.5 billion market cap over the years.WienerAI (WAI) is next. The project gives the impression of a meme coin, and it is a meme coin, but also much more than that.WienerAI is an advanced trading bot that functions similarly to a personal trading guru. All you need to do to get WienerAI’s assistance is type in your question, and the bot takes care of the rest. It scours the market for the latest opportunities, hidden market gems, and research-backed insights that can change the game.For WienerAI, the meme coin packaging inspired by the popular dog coin trends is a means to draw viral attention.

The project helps users with seamless swaps, zero fees, and MEV protection.Through this powerful and playful branding, WienerAI provides a fresh take on trading solutions. The solutions are tailored for both novice and experienced traders. The real-time insights help users sharpen their market strategies.At the time of writing, the presale raise of $WAI stood at $4.9M. In the presale, the token is available for purchase at heavily discounted prices. But the discounts and staking APY decrease as the presale progresses, favouring early investors.Learn-to-earn platform 99Bitcoins (99BTC) just recently launched the presale of its native token, $99BTC. It is on its way to the $2M milestone now.99Bitcoins is one of the hottest crypto education hubs in the market, with over 709K followers, 2845K subscribers, and 79 hours of crypto courses. Investors looking for utility coins with high market relevance are behind the rapid progress of the $99BTC presale. In addition, 99Bitcoins uses the BRC-20 standard to pioneer the L2E model on the Bitcoin blockchain . With Bitcoin predicted to take off toward the end of the year, 99Bitcoins capitalises on the optimistic outlook.Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is a meme coin built on the Base blockchain. Base meme coins are all the craze this season. So it comes as no surprise why DAWGZ is trending. It is predicted to be the next meme coin on the Base blockchain to explode.Although the token doesn’t have any utility, the speculative FOMO around the meme coin substantiates its growth potential. Base blockchain is one of the fastest-growing crypto hubs of 2024.Brett (BRETT) and Degen are good examples of the Base frenzy in the meme coin market. The blockchain lays a robust foundation for sensational projects.Another element that adds to the Base Dawgz craze is its unique mascot – an animated Shiba Inu dog in a base-jumping suit and goggles. On the technical side, DAWGZ features a multichain infrastructure. It allows investors to smoothly transfer their tokens between networks like Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Avalanche. At the same time, the token taps into the Base craze.Base Dawgz also has a staking protocol to help investors grow their holdings, in addition to market value appreciation. The project has launched a campaign to push Base into the limelight. This share-to-earn campaign encourages investors to share Base Dawgz memes on social media to earn attractive rewards. More community reward programmes are in the pipeline, although specifics have yet to be announced.DAWGZ has no team allocation and the project has undergone a security audit by Solidproof, thus mitigating concerns for early investors. The ongoing presale opens the cheapest gateway to the meme coin. Investors can now grab $DAWGZ before the debut exchange listings for low prices at the presale.",PlayDoge (PLAY) is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies this year.

Microsoft took an early lead in the race to commercialise AI through its bet on OpenAI. But shares of the iPhone maker were down nearly 2% in afternoon trading as investors sought more AI announcements.The AI features were unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference and Apple also showed its latest operating system for its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset and iPhone.The company said the new AI features will come with the latest software for its devices and allow users to summarize text and generate other content, such as personalized animations to wish a friend happy birthday. Apple said the ChatGPT integration would be available later this year and that other AI features will follow, adding that the chatbot could be accessed for free and that users' information will not be logged.As part of the updates, a revamped Siri will also tap in to ChatGPT's expertise and seek permission from users before querying the OpenAI service.While its AI rivals are targeting enterprises, Apple plans to stand out by making the technology relevant to its more than 1 billion users - most of whom are not tech aficionados. Apple said iOS 18, the software powering its flagship device, makes the iPhone home screen more customizable and includes improved versions of its in-house apps.The new software will also come with a ""lock an app"" feature that will help people protect sensitive information. Users can opt to lock specific apps and keep data more tightly controlled in the OS.Apple also said it would group messages in its email client starting later this year, categorizing them in a primary folder, a transactions folder, a promotions folder and other more specific groupings, for instance communications by an airline. The high-level categorizations are similar to a now-old feature in Gmail.

PEPE Coin has recently seen a surge in value following its listing on Coinbase International Exchange despite facing market volatility.

The 1000PEPE-PERP offering has increased liquidity and speculation, although the meme coin has faced some volatility. PEPE trades at $0.00001446, showing a 70% gain over the past month despite a recent 4% dip. This fluctuation was partly due to a major sell-off by a whale who offloaded $5.3 million worth of PEPE, creating mixed market signals. As traders watch the whale activity closely, the question remains whether PEPE can sustain its upward trajectory.Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen its value drop by nearly 3%, trading at $0.000024. The decline has pushed SHIB below its daily SMA 50, raising investor concerns. Bulls and bears are in a tug-of-war, trying to sustain SHIB above key resistance levels. The cryptocurrency's performance in the $0.000025 to $0.00003 range is critical, with 92.2 trillion SHIB bought in this range. For SHIB to rally, it must overcome significant selling pressure and stabilise above crucial support levels, making its future uncertain.BlockDAG has surged to the top of CoinSniper, creating a significant buzz in the crypto community. This achievement is underscored by a remarkable boost count of 3,269, placing BlockDAG ahead of competitors like Playdoge and Sealana.
