When will Sensex hit the 1 lakh mark? Soon! Benchmark index gives returns of 850 times in 45 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/when-will-sensex-hit-the-1-lakh-mark-soon-benchmark-index-gives-returns-of-850-times-in-45-years/articleshow/113690232.cms,"Having recently surpassed the 85,000 mark, the Sensex is now edging closer to the highly anticipated 1 lakh milestone. (AI image)

The Sensex, India's primary stock market index, has delivered remarkable returns of 850 times to investors over the past 45 years, compounding wealth at an impressive CAGR of around 16%. To put it in perspective, an investment of Rs 1 lakh made at the inception of the Sensex in April 1979 would now be worth an astounding Rs 8.5 crore.Having recently surpassed the 85,000 mark, the Sensex is now edging closer to the highly anticipated 1 lakh milestone.According to an ET report, some of the most optimistic bulls on Dalal Street expect this feat to be achieved as early as FY25.However, if the Sensex maintains its historical average CAGR of 16%, the 1 lakh mark is more likely to be reached around December 2025. To hit this magical level, the Sensex needs to rise another 17.5%.While retail flows have been significant, they may not be sufficient to propel the Sensex to 1 lakh. The next leg of the rally in blue chips is expected to be driven by banks and foreign investors .Vaibhav Porwal, co-founder of Dezerv, states, ""The current market levels are a reflection of market fundamentals and liquidity flows. Fundamentally, the market should deliver 12-15% returns per annum and therefore we expect 18-24 months for markets to get to these levels. However, there is a strong buying momentum in the market that is fueled by strong liquidity. In such a scenario, markets can overextend. Which means that we may see the 1 lakh number shortly.""Seshadri Sen of Emkay Global believes that foreign investors, who have largely missed the bus so far, are now willing to overlook elevated valuations and increase their exposure to India. FIIs have invested approximately Rs 92,000 crore in the current calendar year, compared to Rs 1.7 lakh crore (1.2% of Nifty market cap) in CY23, suggesting room for further acceleration.However, there is also a risk of a decline in FII inflow and a shift of funds to other emerging markets due to their relatively cheaper valuations.Despite this, Dipan Mehta, Director of Elixir Equities, remains optimistic, stating, ""I cannot make out a case for even a 5% or 10% type of correction because whenever there is bad news, there is so much money waiting on the sidelines to buy that it quickly absorbs any correction. Despite the flow of IPOs and QIPs and management selling, the money flow is just too strong.""Last month, mutual funds were found to be holding a cash pile of Rs 1.86 lakh crore. Mehta further adds, ""Portfolio managers also have got a lot of cash to invest and then there are retail investors, small ones from all over the country, wanting to invest in equities. So it is like a waterfall of investors and a huge gush of liquidity coming in.""","The Sensex, India's primary stock market index, has delivered remarkable returns of 850 times to investors over the past 45 years.

Foxconn, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer, is considering investing approximately $1 billion in establishing a smartphone display module assembly unit in Tamil Nadu, according to informed sources. This facility will be the first of its kind for Foxconn in India, with the primary goal of serving Apple 's iconic iPhone.Foxconn is set to establish the new display module assembly unit in India, alongside its plans to assemble Google Pixel phones in the country.This strategic move is seen as a step towards streamlining Foxconn's expanding smartphone business in India, while also aiming to dominate in various sectors such as ICT, EVs, batteries, and semiconductors.Industry experts believe that Foxconn's proposed unit will undoubtedly elevate India's position in the electronic assembly and manufacturing value chain. Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint, said, ""While phone assembly gives you a local value add of about 5%, display assembly will give additional value add of 2-3%. It all boils down to (how much of) the value addition will happen in India.""The company's model, however, will allow other contract manufacturers, such as Pegatron or Tata Electronics, to utilize components from this unit instead of importing modules assembled in China, as mentioned by the sources.

By setting up local assembly operations, manufacturers can reduce their time to market and supply cycles for brands, thereby reducing lead times and costs.Some of the key players in the display module industry include Samsung Display (South Korea), BOE Technology (China), LG Display (South Korea), Tianma Microelectronics (China), AU Optronics (Taiwan), and Japan Display Inc (Japan).

India keeps markets guessing over MPC members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-monetary-policy-committee-new-mpc-members-rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-repo-rate/articleshow/113722783.cms,"The RBI’s policy committee is made up of three external members.

MPC doves

India’s central bank watchers are getting anxious about who will decide interest rates in two week’s time, a crucial meeting as a wave of global easing kicks off.The contracts of three external members of the Reserve Bank of India ’s monetary policy committee will expire on October 4, just days before the MPC is expected to meet and make its rate decision on October 9. A government-appointed selection panel hasn’t disclosed who the likely candidates are or when they will release the names of the new MPC members.A delay in the appointments risks a repeat of 2020, when the RBI had to postpone its rate decision because the new committee members hadn’t been appointed in time. Looming in the background is also uncertainty over who will lead the RBI from next year, with the contracts of both Governor Shaktikanta Das and his deputy in charge of monetary policy, Michael Patra, coming to an end in coming months.“Extensions and reappointments should be concluded and announced well ahead avoiding last minute delays. Unwarranted suspense in critical appointments is unsettling and distracting,” said Shubhada M Rao, founder of QuantEco Research, based in Mumbai. “This becomes relevant especially for the financial markets that seek signals around policy continuity,” she said.The RBI’s policy committee is made up of three external members — usually well-known economists from the academic or finance worlds — and three RBI officials, comprising the governor, the deputy governor in charge of the monetary policy, and another official, typically the executive director of the monetary policy department.Das’s contract — already extended once by three years — comes to an end on December 9 and Patra finishes his term on January 14. Neither the government nor the RBI have signaled if they will remain in their posts.The external MPC members who end their terms next month have been more dovish than their RBI counterparts in recent rate meetings. Both Goyal and Varma voted for rate cuts in the past two meetings. Bhide raised concerns about the impact of high rates on economic growth, even though he voted in line with RBI officials.Analysts say India should follow other central banks in having a more transparent process in selecting key candidates. At the Bank of England, for example, four external MPC members are appointed through an open and public process where the applicants are known before the selection is made.“Why would there be so much of secrecy” about the appointments at the RBI, asked Amol Agrawal, who teaches economics at Ahmedabad University. “They are external members, they cannot be appointed like insiders. What is the big deal in not naming the members, and not following an open, transparent process?”A selection panel — led by Das, Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan and economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth — chooses the external MPC members. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office has final sign-off on the positions.The RBI and prime minister’s office didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking further information.Appointments of key RBI officials are typically made ahead of time, aside from the 2020 debacle, which was partly due to disruptions over the pandemic period.“While clarity is always welcome, I think as long as candidates are being vetted properly and being announced with a reasonable window, we do not feel there is any material impact on decision making,” said Rahul Bajoria, an economist at Bank of America Corp.Before the MPC was appointed in 2016, interest rates were decided by the governor alone. While policymaking is more consensus-based now, the governor still has veto power to break a deadlock in the six-member MPC.Change in the leadership of the RBI can bring sweeping monetary policy shifts. Urjit Patel , who was RBI governor before Das took over in December 2018, was a policy hawk, rejecting calls to cut interest rates even when inflation tumbled to a record low of 1.46% in June 2017. In Das’s first MPC meeting in February 2019, he promptly cut rates in a surprise move.Das is now facing calls to cut interest rates as global central banks pivot and the economy shows signs of moderating. The governor has repeatedly said he’s not considering a cut yet and wants to see inflation easing to the 4% target and staying there.If the new MPC members are appointed before the October MPC meeting, analysts don’t expect they will have enough time to acquaint themselves with the issues to call for a rate cut. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the RBI will likely ease in December.“The MPC is unlikely to make a sharp pivot in October as the internal RBI members remain the same for now and Governor Das has the casting vote in case of any tie,” said Shumita Sharma Deveshwar, an economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard.","The contracts of three external members of the Reserve Bank of India ’s monetary policy committee will expire on October 4.

NEW DELHI: Sebi on Thursday decided to reduce the timeline for listing of public issue of debt securities to three working days from six days at present, to facilitate faster access to funds. This new timeline will be optional for the first year and mandatory thereafter.“It has been decided to reduce the listing timeline in case of public issue of debt securities and NCRPS to T+3 working days from the existing timeline of T+6 working days,” the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a circular.The move would help in enabling faster access to funds for issuers.Also, the move would align the listing timeline in case of the public issue of debt securities and non-convertible redeemable preference shares (NCRPS) with that of non-convertible securities issued on a private placement basis and specified securities.Further, to ensure ease of compliance for issuers, the listing timeline of T+3 working days will be applicable on a voluntary basis to public issues of debt securities and NCRPS opening on or after Nov 1, 2024, and on a mandatory basis from Nov 1, 2025.Earlier this week, Sebi streamlined the application process for public issues of debt securities by asking individual investors applying for amounts up to Rs 5 lakh through intermediaries to use only UPI to block funds.Further, investors will continue to have the choice of availing other methods like applying through Self-Certified Syndicate Banks or the stock exchange platform for making applications.

NEW DELHI: Recent developments indicate strong foundation of macroeconomic stability in India with steady growth, investment, employment, and inflation trends , and a strong and stable financial sector , a finance ministry report said on Thursday. However, it cautioned that the challenge is in navigating the continuing uncertainty in global economic prospects.""We will likely encounter a cycle of policy rate cuts globally, amid fears of a recession in advanced economies and continuing geopolitical conflicts,"" said the finance ministry's monthly economic report for Aug.The report also flagged worries over surging stock markets globally and the risks linked to a possible correction. ""Stock markets around the world are booming, reinforced by recent policy announcements in a few countries. Consequently, the risk of an eventual correction has risen. If the risk materialises, the spillover effect may be felt globally as well. Amidst these concerns, low oil prices are a bright spot for the economy,"" said the report.It also said that for the remaining part of the financial year, the expectation is that public expenditure will pick up, providing added growth and investment impetus. In the farm sector, higher kharif acreage is already visible. Adequately replenished reservoir levels will potentially give a fillip to the upcoming rabi crops as well.""On balance, the GDP growth of 6.7% in Q1FY25 and the movements in high-frequency indicators till Aug fit well with the real GDP growth projection of 6.5-7% for FY25 provided by the Economic Survey 2023-24,"" the report added. It said the outlook for the inflation trajectory is positive as benign core inflation, a good monsoon, and healthy sowing progress of kharif crops are likely to keep inflation under control.""Headline retail inflation remained benign in Aug 2024 at 3.7%, with softening food inflation and steady core inflation. While replenished reservoir levels and higher kharif sowing acreage augur well for the food price outlook, the effect of the skewed spatial distribution of the monsoon warrants monitoring,"" said the report.","The finance ministry's monthly economic report for Aug. flagged worries over surging stock markets globally.

Why it’s time to explore bold & path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-its-time-to-explore-bold-path-breaking-alternatives-that-put-indian-railways-on-a-smooth-track/articleshow/112317406.cms,"By Ashutosh Bhandari

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Gradual Change in LTCG Regime?

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

The last Budget presented by the Manmohan Singh government in 2014 was of Rs 16 lakh crore. Ten years later, the Union Budget 2024 presented by us a few days ago is Rs 48 lakh crore, which is three times, Modi said.Modi also said that the capital expenditure allocation under his governments has grown manifold.""Capital expenditure is called the biggest productive medium of resource investment,"" he said at the ‘Journey Towards Viksit Bharat: A Post Union Budget 2024-25' conference. In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government. PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Accenture to hire more in India: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/accenture-to-hire-more-in-india-ceo/articleshow/113719885.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: Accenture continues to bet big on Indian talent and is expected to hire more in the country. “We are hiring primarily in India, as we are hiring more in technology. This also addresses our pyramid structure. We hire all over the world and in technology, which is a big driver for growth as we see for FY25. We will be hiring more in India,” Accenture CEO Julie Sweet told analysts in an investor call.Accenture has over 3 lakh employees in India out of the 7.7 lakh globally. The company made a net addition of 41,484 people in the 2024 financial year. In the August quarter, the company added over 24,000 people. Accenture follows a September-August financial year.The company’s board has approved $4 billion in share buyback , bringing Accenture’s total outstanding authority to approximately $6.7 billion. Accenture has raised its revenue forecast to 3% to 6% for the 2025 financial year, which is an improvement from its previous forecast. This is attributed to two primary factors -- a more favorable macroeconomic climate and the recent decision by the US Fed to lower interest rates.The IT firm expects revenues for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal to be in the range of $16.8 billion to $17.4 billion, an increase of 2% to 6%. For the full year, Accenture’s revenue grew 2% to $64.9 billion. In the August quarter, its revenue was $16.4 billion, a 5% increase compared to the same period last year.For the 2024 fiscal year, new bookings reached a record $81.2 billion, a 13% increase from the previous year, and bookings for the quarter were $20.1 billion, up 21% compared to the corresponding period last year. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Accenture bagged GenAI bookings worth $1 billion.“We delivered full-fiscal year new bookings of $81 billion, including a record 125 quarterly client bookings of more than $100 million, and now have 310 Diamond clients, our largest relationships. We continue to accelerate our leadership inGenerative AI , which we believe is the most transformative technology of the next decade, delivering $3 billion in new bookings for the year. Our successful strategy to lead reinvention for clients and continued investments in our business have positioned Accenture for strong growth,” Sweet added.“The magnitude of this achievement is seen in comparison to FY23, when we had approximately $300 million in sales and roughly $100 million in revenue from GenAI,” she said in an email to employees. She also told employees that smaller deals convert to revenue faster, so the decrease in client spending on smaller deals impacted its growth this year.","Accenture has over 3 lakh employees in India out of the 7.7 lakh globally.

(Picture credit: AP)

New York City Mayor Eric L Adams, who was elected nearly three years ago on promises to tackle crime, has been indicted following a federal corruption investigation, reported the New York Times citing sources familiar with the case.The indictment, which remained sealed as of Wednesday, is expected to bring criminal charges against Adams, marking the first time a sitting NYC mayor faces such charges.Adams has claimed that he was being persecuted by the federal government for speaking about the city’s migrant crisis.Details of the charges have not been made public, but Adams’ indictment is expected to shake New York City’s political landscape , coming just months before a competitive mayoral primary . Representatives for Adams and his legal team, including Brendan R McGuire and Boyd M Johnson III of WilmerHale , have declined to comment as of now.In a statement, Adams, 64, maintained his innocence: ""If I am charged, I am innocent and I will fight this with every ounce of my strength and spirit."" He acknowledged the scrutiny he faced as mayor, saying he became a target for standing his ground for New Yorkers.Adams is a former police captain and state senator who rose to prominence by advocating for police reform, particularly for Black officers. His career shift to politics culminated in his election as mayor, a dream he pursued for years. As mayor, Adams vowed to restore ""swagger"" to New York City and embraced various communities, but his administration has faced scrutiny for involving friends and associates with checkered pasts.Federal investigations have been looking into Adams’ inner circle, with some close aides under scrutiny by the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan. It remains unclear when Adams will surrender to authorities, as is common practice for white-collar defendants.Adams' indictment raises serious concerns about his future in office and his chances of securing a second term. Political figures such as Brad Lander, the city comptroller, have called for Adams to step down, saying, ""The most appropriate path forward is for him to step down so that New York City can get the full focus its leadership demands.""Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also reacted to Eric's indictment. Taking the matter to social media platform X, she wrote, ""I do not see how Mayor Adams can continue governing New York City. The flood of resignations and vacancies are threatening gov function. Nonstop investigations will make it impossible to recruit and retain a qualified administration. For the good of the city, he should resign.""Maya Wiley, who ran against Adams in the 2021 mayoral race, expressed her disappointment at the federal probe: ""I can’t say how devastating I think it is where our city is today.""With New York City facing numerous challenges, Adams’ legal troubles are likely to become a significant issue as the city grapples with leadership uncertainties.","New York City Mayor Eric L Adams has been indicted following a federal corruption investigation.

Winter Action Plan: 21 Areas In Focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/winter-action-plan-21-areas-in-focus/articleshow/113676840.cms,"NEW DELHI: On the day Delhi's air quality index turned ‘poor' after almost three months, govt released its 21-point winter action plan to deal with high pollution levels during the upcoming season.Among the areas in focus in the plan, launched by environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday, are the real-time monitoring of pollution sources using drones, giving Harit Ratna awards to individuals or agencies combating air pollution, constitution of a six-member special task force, and emergency measures like the odd-even scheme and artificial rain .The theme of this year's plan is ‘Milkar Chalein aur Pradushan se Ladein' with a focus on public participation and campaigns like Harit Kalash Yatra, e-vehicle parade, anti-pollution march and Red light on, gaadi off. This will be the first time when drones will be used to deal with pollution. ""Last year, we had manually prepared an inventory of sources of pollution at hotspots. We will use drones this year to identify real-time sources of pollution,"" said Rai, adding that the six-member special task force will monitor air quality and take action.Delhi has 13 pollution hotspots, which were identified in 2019. A senior official said they would soon float a tender for procuring drones for monitoring hotspots.Rai claimed there had been a reduction of almost 35% in the number of polluted days. ""In 2016, we had 243 days of high pollution, but it dropped to 159 in 2023,"" he said.Under an anti-dust campaign, which will begin on Oct 7, 523 teams will inspect construction sites, and 85 road sweeping machines, 500 water sprinkling machines and over 200 anti-smog guns in three shifts will also be deployed. To control open waste burning, 588 teams have been formed.To reduce vehicular pollution, 360 teams will monitor both pollution under control certificates and over-age vehicles. Traffic police teams will be deployed on 134 congested roads to free them up. Like previous years, govt will spray bio-decomposer on over 5,000 acres of both basmati and non-basmati paddy farmland in Delhi for free to tackle stubble burning.Rai said the odd-even scheme and artificial rain would be the emergency measures, which were likely to be enforced in case of very high pollution levels. He said they were exploring the possibility of conducting artificial rain from Nov 1 to 15 when Delhi witnesses high pollution. ""We will encourage people in govt and private sectors to work from home. An advisory will be issued to encourage voluntary vehicle restriction,"" said Rai, adding that firecrackers will be completely banned.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""Annually, winter pollution action is drawn up to identify sectors of pollution. What is more important is to indicate the scope and scale of interventions planned in each sector to make a difference to the air quality. This needs to be detailed out municipal ward-wise.""Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said it was regrettable that Rai kept making announcements instead of taking serious anti-pollution steps. Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav said it was strange that Rai had blamed the rising pollution levels in the rest of NCR for the toxic air in Delhi, without admitting the gross failure of AAP govt over the past 10 years.","The theme of this year's plan is ‘Milkar Chalein aur Pradushan se Ladein' with a focus on public participation and campaigns like Harit Kalash Yatra, e-vehicle parade, anti-pollution march and Red light on, gaadi off.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113685874,imgsize-42274,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/113685874.jpg"

EY has been given seven days to respond to this lapse. Non-compliance could lead to imprisonment for up to six months or fines up to Rs 5,00,000, or both.EY India did not respond immediately to Reuters’ request for comment but has previously emphasized its commitment to employee well-being, stating it is taking the family's concerns seriously.

Three top technical leaders at Microsoft-backed OpenAI quit on Wednesday, the latest in a string of executive departures this year coming at a time of flux for the ChatGPT maker. Chief technology officer Mira Murati , VP research Barret Zoph and chief research officer Bob McGrew announced their departures via X on Wednesday afternoon.The San Francisco-based AI startup is negotiating a new $6.5 billion financing round valuing the company at $150 billion, contingent on the company upending its corporate structure.The company plans to restructure to a for-profit benefit corporation and will give CEO Sam Altman an equity stake, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Currently, a non-profit board controls the for-profit entity, an unusual structure which led to members of the non-profit board ousting Altman in Nov 2023 over a breakdown in communication and loss of trust. He was reinstated after five days. The funding round has not closed yet and the company is in the process of finalising it.It was unclear whether the executives' departure could affect the ongoing fundraise. Some fundraising documents contain a ""material adverse change"" clause which allows investors to withdraw from a deal if the company encounters anything that could have a significant negative impact.Murati is still working at OpenAI while she negotiates her exit from the company, according to a source close to her. She's been part of the firm for 6.5 years, and briefly served as CEO in Nov when Altman was ousted.","Chief technology officer Mira Murati, VP research Barret Zoph and chief research officer Bob McGrew announced their departures via X on Wednesday afternoon.

Export constraints

Economic appeal

MOSCOW: Russia, the world's leading wheat exporter, is expanding its Baltic Sea ports as it aims to boost agricultural exports by 50% by 2030 while reducing dependence on traditional Black Sea routes , officials and executives said.The country, which exported at least 72 million metric tons of grain in the 2023/24 season, is looking at new markets in Latin America and Africa to diversify from its traditional grain markets in North Africa and the Middle East.It has relied on its Black Sea ports to handle booming agricultural exports for the past decades but the conflict with Ukraine has made the area risky for shipping with both sides regularly striking each other's facilities and infrastructure.""Last year with its record harvest showed that with the pace of loadings for exports, we do not have enough capacity,"" Ksenia Bolomatova, deputy head of state-controlled agricultural conglomerate OZK, which owns several Black Sea terminals, told an industry gathering in Sochi in southern Russia.In the last 18 months, Russia has launched two major ports, Vysotsky and Lugaport, in the Gulf of Finland, not far from St. Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin's hometown.Vysotsky shipped its first grain in April 2023, while Lugaport began operations in June this year and capacity is expected to reach 7 million tons by early 2025, according to its owner Novaport.Dmitry Rylko from the IKAR agricultural consultancy said the two ports will be able to handle up to 15 million tons of agricultural exports, including grain, per year.That would account for a quarter of Russia's 60 million tons of grain exports forecast for the 2024/25 season.Private firm Primorsky UPK is also planning a grain terminal at Primorsky port with capacity of up to 5 million tons.Putin set out a goal to increase agricultural exports by 50% by 2030 as part of a strategy to cement the country's position as an agriculture superpower along with Brazil, the United States and China.Russia has become the world's biggest exporter of wheat, corn, barley, and peas in the last decade, but further growth could be constrained by shipping capacity bottlenecks.Many Russian ports announced plans to boost capacity after record harvests in the last two years. The Baltic Sea terminals are expected to expand at a faster rate.""The expansion of the Baltic Sea terminals' capacity is a question of economic and transport security and sovereignty,"" Novotrans said in an emailed comment.Russian trade flows and shipments have so far seen no major disruptions in the Baltic, where 96% of the coastline belongs to NATO members, including Finland and Sweden.By contrast, disruptions are rising in the Black sea and could reduce global grain supplies, according to a report by the World Bank. Two weeks ago, a Ukrainian vessel carrying grain to Egypt was hit by a missile.In August, Russian local authorities said Ukraine sank a ferry carrying fuel tanks in Port Kavkaz, which is also used for transshipment of grain.Russian exported 62 million tons of grain by sea in the 2023/24 season with 90% of supplies going via the Black Sea, mostly to markets in the Middle East and North Africa. This share is set to fall as Baltic Sea infrastructure grows.Baltic Sea ports loaded 1.5 million tons of grain last season, a three-fold increase from the previous season but still just 2.4% of overall Russian exports, according to Reuters calculations based on publicly available data.""Logistically, the Baltic has many advantages for grains exports,"" said Darya Snitko, vice president for Gazprombank, one of Russia's largest banks and one of the biggest lenders to farmers.She said the ability of Baltic terminals to handle bigger ships should help reduce overall costs.""Supplies from the Baltic Sea beat (economics of) shipments from the Azov-Black Sea area when trading with countries in Africa outside the Mediterranean as well as Asia,"" she added.Vysotsky has been sending grain to Algeria, Brazil, Cuba, Mali, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria and Tunisia, according to data from logistics company Rusagrotrans.",Russia is expanding its Baltic Sea ports as it aims to boost agricultural exports by 50% by 2030. The country is looking at new markets in Latin America and Africa to diversify from its traditional grain markets.

Jamie Dimon backs Trump policy

MUMBAI: JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimon , who was in India this week to host the company's India Investor Summit , spoke in support of a proposal by US Presidential candidate Donald Trump to have an efficiency commission headed by Elon Musk .""This idea about having an efficiency commission, I actually like the idea. I think govts have to become more efficient, more competent and look at when they take money, what do they get for it?"" Dimon said in an interview to CNBC TV18.Donald Trump has proposed establishing a govt efficiency commission, led by Elon Musk, if he wins the Nov 5 election.The commission would focus on eliminating fraud and improving govt performance, aiming to complete a full financial audit within six months.Dimon's name has been circulating for a senior position in the next US administration if Trump returns to power, after the former president initially mentioned he would consider Dimon for Treasury secretary - a statement Trump later retracted. There has also been speculation that Dimon would take up public service after laying out a succession plan.In response to a question from TOI on whether he would take up public office, Dimon said, ""I never spoke about holding public office. When asked about serving my country, I said what I'm doing now serves my country."" He added said that he would probably be around in his current role next year too.""I can do a great job by building JPMorgan Chase. It is helping our employees, customers, and new businesses. I think it serves your country. When I first came to India in 2005, we banked only 20 companies directly and supported around 100 multinationals. Today, we bank 150 companies and support 850 multinationals,"" he said.",JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimon backs Donald Trump's proposal for an efficiency commission.

Global debt hit a record high of $312 trillion at the end of the second quarter, driven by borrowing in the United States and China, while a key debt ratio in emerging markets also scaled a fresh peak, data from a banking trade group showed.The Institute of International Finance (IIF), a financial services trade group, said on Wednesday that global debt rose by 2.1 trillion in the first half to $312 trillion - a new high point after previous data was revised lower.The IIF flashed warning signs on the trend of ever-increasing government borrowing in its latest Global Debt Monitor report, forecasting global government borrowing would rise from its current level of $92 trillion to $145 trillion by 2030 and top $440 trillion by 2050.""With the Fed's new easing cycle expected to accelerate the pace of global debt buildup, a significant concern is the apparent lack of political will to address rising sovereign debt levels in both mature and emerging market economies,"" the IIF report said.A big chunk of the borrowing was driven by energy transition in the face of climate change which was expected to account for over a third of the projected rise by 2050.""This poses significant challenges, as many governments are already allocating a growing share of their revenue to interest expenses,"" the report said.The $2.1 trillion increase this year through June compares to $8.4 trillion in the first half of 2023, IIF data showed.Apart from China and the U.S., India, Russia and Sweden also increased their debt, while other European countries and Japan saw a notable decline, the report said.The global debt-to-GDP ratio - an indicator on the ability to repay debt by comparing to what is being produced - has stabilized around 327%-328%, with output numbers partly buoyed by above-target inflation in major economies.In developed markets, that ratio reached its lowest level since 2018 driven by declines in household and non-financial corporate sectors borrowing.In contrast, emerging markets saw their debt ratio reach a new high of over 245% of output, more than 25 percentage points higher than before the COVID-related lockdowns.",Global debt hit a record high of $312 trillion at the end of the second quarter.

US fiscal health is expected to deteriorate further as political polarization makes it hard for any new presidential administration to negotiate steps needed to reduce the national debt burden, according to ratings agency Moody's .The US sovereign fiscal profile is likely to weaken under either of the candidates in the Nov. 5 presidential election - Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, the agency said in a report issued on Tuesday.""The incoming administration will face a deteriorating US fiscal outlook, as declining debt affordability will gradually weaken US fiscal strength,"" the report stated. ""In the absence of policy measures that can curb these trends and help limit fiscal deficits , deteriorating fiscal strength will increasingly weigh on the US sovereign credit profile.""Moody's lowered the outlook on its triple-A US credit rating to ""negative"" from ""stable"" in November 2023.That came months after a rating downgrade of the sovereign credit profile by another ratings agency, Fitch, following political brinkmanship around raising the US debt ceiling.Moody's remains the last of the three major rating agencies to maintain a top rating for the US government. Fitch changed its rating from triple-A to AA+ in August 2023, joining S&P, which has had an AA+ rating since 2011.Moody's said it expects the US government to run fiscal deficits of around 7 per cent of gross domestic product per year over the next five years, and that deficits could rise to 9 per cent by 2034, which would push the debt burden to 130 per cent of GDP by then from 97 per cent last year.""US fiscal strength will materially weaken in the absence of meaningful policy steps to reduce the fiscal deficit, rein in new borrowing to fund those deficits and slow the rise in interest expense that consumes an increasingly large share of government revenues,"" the agency said.""These debt dynamics would be increasingly unsustainable and inconsistent with an Aaa rating if no policy actions are taken to course correct,"" it added.Fitch said last month the US fiscal profile is likely to remain largely unchanged regardless of who wins in November.A decisive factor for the US sovereign fiscal outlook will be not only the outcome of the presidential race, but also the composition of Congress as determined in the November elections, as the balance of power in the legislature could limit an incoming administration's ability to secure passage of legislation, Moody's said.Congress is currently divided, with the House of Representatives narrowly controlled by Republicans and the Senate by Democrats.""We anticipate that the US government will remain divided, preventing sweeping fiscal reforms by the new administration. As a result, fiscal policy proposals by both candidates will likely require intense bipartisan negotiations and compromise,"" Moody's said.On the other hand, a potential sweep by either party could lead to material changes in policies that may have broader effects on the economic growth outlook and the credit profile of public and private sector entities.""Credit risks lie in the possibility of abrupt and disruptive changes to tax, trade and investment, immigration and climate policies among other areas,"" it said.Trump said last month that US presidents should have a say over decisions made by the Federal Reserve, indicating he could break with traditional policies toward the independence of the central bank.Moody's said political influence over monetary policy decisions would be ""credit negative"" and may have repercussions on investor confidence in the US financial markets.More broadly, an ""erosion of institutional strength can undermine confidence and impair the implementation of countercyclical policies, negatively affecting growth, financial markets and the operating environment for debt issuers,"" it said.","Moody's lowered the outlook on its triple-A US credit rating to ""negative"" from ""stable"" in November 2023. A decisive factor for the US sovereign fiscal outlook will be the outcome of the presidential race.
