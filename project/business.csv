"Stock market holiday today: Why are BSE Sensex, Nifty50 closed for trading on August 15, 2024?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-holiday-today-why-are-bse-sensex-nifty50-closed-for-trading-on-august-15-2024/articleshow/112539142.cms,"Stock market holiday today: On Thursday, August 15, equity markets will remain closed in observance of Independence Day , as per the BSE market holiday calendar . As a result, all segments, including the equity segment, derivative segment, and SLB segment, will not operate today.Similarly, the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) will be closed for both morning and evening sessions.In addition to Independence Day (August 15), the markets will be closed on several other occasions in 2024, including Id-E-Milad (September 16), Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti (October 2), Diwali (November 1), Gurunanak Jayanti (November 15), and Christmas (December 25). The exchanges reserve the right to modify these holidays and will issue a separate circular in advance if any changes are made, says an ET report.During Wednesday's trading session, the Indian benchmark indices BSE Sensex and Nifty50 experienced marginal gains, following global market trends. This upward movement was influenced by softer U.S. producer prices data, which strengthened expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September.Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, commented on the market scenario, saying, ""The PPI inflation numbers from the US indicate softening of inflation, and a confirmation of this declining trend is likely from the CPI numbers coming today. The US market moved up yesterday in anticipation of this and a rate cut by the Fed in September. If the rate cut is by 50bp, the US market will remain resilient lending support to global markets. This is the likely scenario. On the other hand, if the Fed disappoints with no rate cut, the market will sell off and this will have repercussions globally.""Vijayakumar further noted, ""In India, the pattern of FII selling on valuation concerns and DII buying supported by money flows continues. Some segments like defence-related stocks which have run far ahead of fundamentals are witnessing corrections. Financials continue to be under pressure on concerns arising from rising costs of deposits. For long-term investors, quality banking stocks offer value.""","On Thursday, August 15, equity markets will remain closed in observance of Independence Day.

Fastest manufacturing growth in 50 years? Apple’s India business surpasses Rs 2 lakh crore; tech giant India’s largest global value chain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fastest-manufacturing-growth-in-50-years-apples-india-business-surpasses-rs-2-lakh-crore-tech-giant-indias-largest-global-value-chain/articleshow/112513335.cms,"Apple's Growing Harvest

Apple’s India business grows in leaps! In FY24, Apple 's India operations witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching a value of over Rs 2 lakh crore ($23.5 billion), a significant increase from Rs 1.15 lakh crore in the previous year. A significant increase in iPhone production, along with strong domestic sales of MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, Watches, and AirPods, has boosted the value of Apple's operations in India.Top officials told ET that Apple's growth in production and exports in India over the last 50 years is likely the fastest and unparalleled by any other company, establishing the tech giant as the largest global value chain (GVC) operating within the country. Moreover, Apple is the first GVC in India to rapidly shift a portion of its supply chain away from China.The acceleration in Apple's operations in India can be attributed to the government's introduction of the smartphone production-linked incentive ( PLI ) scheme in 2020.In 2021, Apple began manufacturing iPhones in India, marking the first time the company produced iPhones outside of China. Since then, iPhone production in India has steadily increased through its three contract manufacturers – Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron – reaching Rs 1.20 lakh crore in FY24. The government provides incentives based on the freight on board (FOB) value at which the devices leave the factory, with market value or retail prices being 50-60% higher.The Economic Survey highlights India's contribution to Apple's overall production, which has risen to approximately 14%, positioning the country as a crucial hub for the company's global exports. In FY23, India's share was around 7%. iPhones constitute the majority of these figures, with exported iPhones valued at around Rs 1.35 lakh crore ($15 billion) in the last fiscal year, based on official data calculations.Domestic sales of Apple products in India reached approximately Rs 68,000 crore ($8 billion) in FY24. In FY23, Apple exported iPhones with a market value of Rs 66,000 crore. The company's market share in India, although steadily increasing from 2% in FY18, remains below 6% due to the dominance of the Android ecosystem, led by Chinese brands such as Vivo and Xiaomi. Additionally, India's revenue contribution to Apple's global revenue of $383 billion in FY23 was less than 2%.Also Read | Apple ecosystem becomes biggest blue-collar job creator in India! 1.5 lakh direct jobs created since PLI scheme India revenue figures of Apple do not include export numbers, but the increase in manufacturing by the Apple ecosystem has generated more than 150,000 direct jobs since 2021. The company's largest factory in India, operated by Foxconn, employs 41,000 individuals.During the third-quarter earnings call in August, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company had achieved ""quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.""Despite Apple's success, smartphone shipments in India experienced a 2% year-on-year decline in the June quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. The market tracker attributed this decline to factors such as the heatwave, a seasonal slump, and a sequential slowdown in demand compared to the previous quarter.Recognizing the significance of India in the current geopolitical landscape, Cook visited the country in April last year to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and inaugurate the first two company-owned retail stores in Delhi and Mumbai.During the earnings call in May, Cook emphasized the company's comprehensive approach to India, stating, ""the company was working on everything — from developers to markets and operations — in India. I see it as an incredibly exciting market and as a major focus for us.""","In FY24, Apple's India operations witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching a value of over Rs 2 lakh crore ($23.5 billion) A significant increase in iPhone production, along with strong domestic sales of MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, Watches, and AirPods, has boosted the value of Apple's operations in India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112514332,imgsize-127566,width-400,resizemode-4/112514332.jpg"

The current Banking Regulation Act permits single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit, items left in the custody of a bank, or a locker hired from a bank.In the event of the nominator's death, the nominee can access the deposit, articles, or locker.According to an ET report, the new Bill suggests allowing up to four nominees for these purposes. For deposits, nominees can be appointed either successively or simultaneously, while for other purposes, they can only be appointed successively.When there are multiple simultaneous nominees, the nomination will be effective in a predetermined proportion. In the case of successive nominations, priority will be given to the nominee named higher in the nomination order.""The Banking Regulation Act allows single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit.

Check List Nomination is a crucial aspect of opening lockers and savings accounts in India. The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) says, ""Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules 1985 permits banks to pay dues to nominees in the event of death of depositor(s) without asking for succession certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. This simplifies settlement. Of course, as Trustee the nominee is accountable to legal heirs.The IBA further clarifies that the nomination facility is available for bank deposits, safe deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. A single deposit account, whether held individually or jointly, can have only one nominee. However, a jointly held locker can have two nominees. In the case of a minor's account, a person legally empowered to operate the account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.The State Bank of India emphasizes the importance of availing the benefits of nomination facility and survivorship clause for locker-hirers. In the unfortunate event of the death of one of the joint locker-hirers, the contents of the locker do not automatically transfer to the surviving joint locker-hirer or nominee(s) unless there is a survivorship clause or nomination in place.When renting a locker, the bank charges a nominal annual rent based on the size of the locker and the location of the branch. The rent should be paid in advance for the financial year. The bank provides a copy of the signed Locker Agreement to the locker-hirer, outlining their rights and responsibilities.","The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four.

Growth push: FMCG companies chase middle class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/growth-push-fmcg-companies-chase-middle-class/articleshow/112553819.cms,"MUMBAI: The middle class with their growing aspirations and increasing ability to spend are becoming key to the strategy of consumer goods companies as they look to identify new growth spaces and expand their market share.The segment's inclination for trying new products and better choices are nudging companies to innovate, creating room for premiumisation.""A lot of the products that Daburs and Nestles of the world sell are mass products. The middle class segment is one which can afford as well as aspires to go premium and is a consumer for premiumisation at scale. If companies want to drive consumption at scale for the high margin categories, middle class becomes key,"" said Akshay D'souza, chief of growth and insights at retail intelligence platform Bizom which works with several FMCG companies .Firms are upgrading the proposition of their existing brands and rejigging the way they market them, keeping in line with the evolving consumer trends. Hindustan Unilever (HUL), for instance, relaunched its core brands Vim and Ponds during the June quarter. ""We dialled up levers of consumer preference that we think will strengthen brand relevance. The new India consumers are spearheaded by aspiration, seek higher order benefits and are increasingly embracing digital interventions at an accelerating rate,"" Ritesh Tiwari, CFO at HUL, said at the company's recent earnings call. The middle class mindset has shifted from saving to spending. The share of their expenditure has gone up and that is what FMCG players are eyeing, said Madhulika Tiwari, partner, retail and consumer goods at Technopak. ""The idea is while you save some, you also spend and spend not just on need-based categories but also discretionary items, both merchandise and services,"" Tiwari said.With the middle class becoming more discerning, thanks to rising disposable incomes, the demand for a variety of products- ranging from healthy food to organic products -is rising, helping brands premiumise and widening the opportunity for them. Parle Product's strategy is to push low unit packs of premium products into the market. ""Such low unit packs give consumers a scope to try products which they otherwise may not choose to buy. It is also a way to get more people within the fold of premium products,"" said the firm's vice president Mayank Shah. India's middle class is expected to grow from about 30% of the population to 50% by 2030; this translates into 300 million new people entering the consuming class which N. Chandrasekaran, chairman, t Tata Consumer Products, said is a ""huge opportunity.""Growing participation of women in the workforce is augmenting household incomes, fuelling middle class consumption. Besides, e-commerce expansion has also enabled better discovery of brands by consumers, broadening their shift to branded products. Adani Wilmar is focusing on regionalistaion in its attempt to cater to localised preferences. For instance, it has launched a variant of pickle oils in regions like Bihar and is pushing premium product variants in select markets.""The story of middle class consumption growth is here to stay,"" said MD & CEO Angshu Mallick. Brands can be expected to widen their product portfolios. Also, products that don't work will be withdrawn leading to compressed life cycles, said Anand Ramanathan, partner and consumer products and retail sector leader at Deloitte India.""The middle class looks for a balance between quality and affordability, appreciate new and innovative brands, and are influenced by online research and digital marketing.

""It will require the companies to file belated returns and then the authorities have to agree to the request,"" a tax official told TOI.In the case of Satyam, which underwent a similar resolution process, tax advisors said, restatement resulted in a lengthy legal battle, but a recent court order may come to rescue of IL&FS since the accounts were restated on NCLT's directions. Tax consultants said CBDT will have to offer a relief, given the ""unusual situation"" where govt had to step in and take control of the company and lenders are bearing the losses.Sources said based on NCLT order, IL&FS group is going to argue that the case is not time barred since the restated accounts have only been taken note of now. They also said the companies are working on the required reports for tax authorities before refund claims are filed, while acknowledging that the issue was complicated.Given that banks will lose money on the exposure and the govt's push to clean up, the company is hoping that an intervention by the tax authorities is possible. Sources in govt, however, indicated that the process is not going to be easy as it will also set a precedent for the future.The revised accounts also point to excess managerial remuneration being paid by the group, based on the earlier accounts, as also performance pay being doled out.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government.PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest. He also noted the time when India had been ranked among the ‘Fragile Five’ economies in the world.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Overall, home care products have grown at a steady clip, nearly 27% over the eight-year period (2015-23) and 80% over 20-year horizon, the analysis said. The average number of packs (NOP) under homecare grew from 94 to only 120.

"Core US inflation eases a fourth month, sealing Fed rate cut",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/core-us-inflation-eases-a-fourth-month-sealing-fed-rate-cut/articleshow/112529157.cms,"Underlying US inflation eased for a fourth month on an annual basis in July, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates next month.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 3.2% in July from a year ago, still the slowest pace since early 2021. The monthly measure rose 0.2%, a slight pickup from June’s surprisingly low reading, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday.Economists see the core gauge as a better indicator of underlying inflation than the overall CPI.That measure also climbed 0.2% from the prior month and 2.9% from a year ago. BLS said nearly 90% of the monthly advance was due to shelter, which accelerated from June.Inflation is still broadly on a downward trend as the economy slowly shifts into a lower gear. Combined with a softening job market, the Fed is widely expected to start lowering interest rates next month, while the size of the cut will likely be determined by more incoming data.“Investors and policymakers alike will find this report mostly good for markets and the economy,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. “As inflation decelerates, the Fed can legitimately cut rates yet keep policy restrictive overall.”Before their September meeting, officials will get more inflation readings plus another jobs report — which will be heavily scrutinized after the disappointing July figures helped spark a global market selloff and fanned recession fears.Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have recently said they’re focusing more on the labor side of their dual mandate, which they’re likely to stress at their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming next week.The S&P 500 fluctuated and two-year Treasury yields — the most sensitive to Fed policy — rose. Traders assigned a lower probability of a 50-basis-point cut in September.Though the figures are reported to one decimal point by the BLS, Fed officials and economists like to look further out for a better sense of the inflation trajectory. On a two-decimal basis, core CPI rose 0.17%. And to get a feel for the recent trend, the three-month annualized figure advanced 1.58%, the lowest since February 2021.The most disappointing part of the report was shelter prices, which economists and policymakers have been widely expecting to ease and help move inflation closer to the Fed’s target. Shelter, the largest category within services, jumped 0.4% after 0.2% in June, which was the lowest since 2021 and thought to be the start of the long-awaited slowdown.Within shelter, owners’ equivalent rent — the biggest individual component of the CPI — also rose 0.4%. Rent of primary residence climbed 0.5%, the most since February.Other categories were more encouraging, particularly for consumers. Prices fell last month for apparel, new and used cars and airfares. Hospital services declined by the most on record. Gasoline prices have mostly dropped in recent months.Meantime, subscription services for video games rose by the most ever after registering a steep decline in May.Excluding housing and energy, service prices were up 0.2%, the first increase in three months but still a tame pace, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the nation’s inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index, doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI does — and that’s part of the reason why the PCE gauge is trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.The PCE measure, released later this month, draws from the CPI as well as certain categories within the producer price index. Those parts of the PPI were fairly tame in July, and the headline figures rose by less than forecast, according to government data out Tuesday.Part of the lower PPI reading stemmed from weaker margins at wholesalers and retailers — corroborating companies’ assertion that they’re losing pricing power as well as recent discounting and promotional activity like Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Day. From restaurants to airlines, businesses recognize that consumers are growing more discerning in their spending, particularly for discretionary purchases.A sustained decline in the price of goods over most of the past year has largely been providing some relief to consumers. So-called core goods prices, which exclude food and energy commodities, fell by the most since the start of the year. On an annual basis, they dropped by the most since 2004.A separate report Wednesday that combines the inflation figures with recent wage data showed that real earnings growth decelerated in July from a year ago.","Core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 3.2% in July from a year ago.

"Starbucks up 25%, Chipotle down 7%: What a 'dream' CEO can do in a day",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starbucks-ceo-brian-niccol-starbuck-shares-laxman-narasimhan-chipotle/articleshow/112509431.cms,"Who is Brian Niccol, the new CEO of Starbucks?

Brian Niccol is the newly appointed CEO of Starbucks, previously serving as the CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill since 2018. He is credited with reviving Chipotle by doubling its sales and tripling its stock value.

Niccol has also held leadership roles at Taco Bell and Procter & Gamble. His experience in leading successful turnarounds and driving growth in the fast-food industry makes him a significant addition to Starbucks' leadership team.

Why did Starbucks choose Niccol as its new CEO?

Starbucks appointed Niccol in response to declining sales and increased pressure from activist investors like Elliott Investment Management. Niccol's proven ability to drive innovation and growth at Chipotle, along with his experience in overcoming operational challenges, positioned him as an ideal candidate to lead Starbucks through its current difficulties.

According to Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital, Niccol ""is going to turn the company around.""

""Oppenheimer & Co’s Brian Bittner said Niccol is a “dream hire” for Starbucks,"" a Bloomberg report said.

What challenges will Niccol face as CEO of Starbucks?

Niccol will have to address several key challenges at Starbucks, including declining sales in the US and China, competition from other coffee brands, and pressure from activist investors to improve the company’s performance.

Starbucks has also been struggling with a weakening store experience and a lack of innovation, which contributed to its recent downturn.

Additionally, Niccol will need to manage ongoing contract negotiations with unionized stores, a departure from Starbucks’ previous stance under former CEO Howard Schultz.

How has Wall Street reacted to Niccol's appointment?

The reaction from Wall Street has been overwhelmingly positive. Starbucks shares surged as much as 24.5% following the announcement, reflecting investor confidence in Niccol's ability to turn the company around.

In contrast, Chipotle's shares fell by about 7.5%, likely due to concerns about the impact of Niccol's departure.

Analysts have praised the move, with Andrew Charles of TD Cowen stating that Starbucks ""picks up a hall-of-fame restaurant CEO,"" signaling a new era for the company.

What impact did Niccol have at Chipotle?

During his tenure at Chipotle, Niccol was instrumental in doubling the company’s sales to approximately $10 billion in fiscal 2023 and more than tripling its stock value.

He also led a successful turnaround following a series of food safety issues by implementing new safety protocols and expanding the company’s digital and delivery capabilities.

His leadership in these areas is expected to bring valuable insights to Starbucks as it seeks to enhance its own operations and customer experience.

What does this leadership change mean for Starbucks' future?

Niccol’s appointment marks a significant shift for Starbucks, as the company looks to rejuvenate its brand and business operations.

With Niccol at the helm, there is optimism that Starbucks will regain its footing in the market. As analyst David Palmer noted, Niccol ""has the gravitas to address the Howard Schultz Founder 'overhang',"" suggesting that his leadership could help move the company beyond its recent struggles and into a period of renewed growth and innovation.

Starbucks on Tuesday made headlines with a surprising leadership change, announcing the appointment of Brian Niccol , the CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill, as its new CEO. This decision comes after Laxman Narasimhan's brief 18-month tenure , during which Starbucks faced declining sales and increasing pressure from activist investors. The move sent Starbucks' shares soaring, reflecting investor optimism about Niccol's potential to steer the company through its current challenges.Niccol is recognized for his successful turnaround of Chipotle, where he doubled the company's sales and significantly boosted its stock value.His track record of innovation and growth at Chipotle, particularly in overcoming significant reputational challenges, is seen as a major asset as he steps into his new role at Starbucks. With Starbucks facing declining demand in key markets and pressure to improve its business, Niccol's appointment is viewed as a ""transformational step forward"" by stakeholders, including activist investor Elliott Investment Management.(With inputs from agencies)","Brian Niccol is the newly appointed CEO of Starbucks, previously serving as the CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill since 2018.

Nathan Anderson: Who is Nathan Anderson? Financial sleuth behind Hindenburg research,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/who-is-nathan-anderson-financial-sleuth-behind-hindenburg-research/articleshow/112423390.cms,"Nathan Anderson is the founder of Hindenburg Research, a New York-based forensic financial research firm that specialises in exposing corporate fraud and malpractices. Founded in 2017, Hindenburg Research has gained prominence for its detailed reports on publicly traded companies, often leading to significant declines in their stock prices .Hindenburg Research’s methodology uses fundamental analysis to aid their investment decision-making .They investigate companies that have accounting irregularities, bad actors in management or key service provider roles, undisclosed related-party transactions, illegal/unethical business or financial reporting practices, and undisclosed regulatory, product, or financial issues.The firm is named after the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, symbolizing Anderson’s mission to expose financial “disasters” before they can harm investors.One of Anderson’s most notable reports targeted Nikola Corporation , an electric vehicle startup , in September 2020. Hindenburg accused Nikola of deceiving investors about its technology and capabilities. The report led to a sharp decline in Nikola’s stock value and investigations by federal authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Anderson’s work has drawn both praise and criticism. While many investors and market observers commend his efforts to bring transparency to the financial markets, critics argue that Hindenburg’s short-selling strategy, where the firm profits from a company’s stock price decline following a negative report, raises ethical concerns.Companies targeted by Hindenburg have sometimes responded with legal action, accusing the firm of defamation and market manipulation.Despite the controversies, Anderson continues to be a key figure in financial investigations. His reports have sparked regulatory scrutiny and prompted companies to improve their transparency and corporate governance. Through Hindenburg Research, Anderson has significantly influenced how corporate fraud is identified and addressed in the financial markets.Last year, Hindenburg published a report on the Adani group alleging that the group was involved in stock manipulation and accounting fraud, leading to a massive plunge in Adani’s stock value and triggering regulatory scrutiny across multiple jurisdictions.Meanwhile, Hindenburg on Saturday posted on social media platform X that, ‘Something big soon India’, which has again raised speculations in the Indian market.","Nathan Anderson is the founder of Hindenburg Research, a New York-based forensic financial research firm that specialises in exposing corporate fraud and malpractices.
