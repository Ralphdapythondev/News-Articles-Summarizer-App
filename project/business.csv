This section permits you to contribute up to 10% of your basic pay to NPS tax-free. Previously, only government employees were eligible for the 14% deduction, but now this benefit has been extended to the private sector as well.“It is proposed to increase the amount of deduction allowed to an employer in respect of his contribution to a pension scheme referred to in section 80CCD, from the extent of 10% to the extent of 14% of the salary of the employee.

New Tax Regime: What else can be done?

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024 : The Modi government has been looking to make the new income tax regime more attractive for the common man, middle class and salaried income taxpayers. Raising of basic exemption limit , introduction of standard deduction , and tweaking of tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime signal that the government wants taxpayers to shift to the new regime.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024 and personal tax experts are of the opinion that some changes in the new income tax regime can be expected.What can be done to make the new income tax regime more attractive than the old tax regime, especially for individuals who have done their tax planning based on the old regime? TOI Online Survey of personal tax experts finds out:Also Check | Budget 2024 Live Updates All personal tax experts unanimously agree that to make the new income tax more attractive for taxpayers, especially for middle class salaried taxpayers , the government needs to tweak it to introduce more deductions and exemptions.One common deduction that experts believe should make way into the new income tax regime, and one that makes the old tax regime more lucrative for taxpayers, is housing loan deduction.Preeti Sharma, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India LLP says that currently under the new tax regime, exemption against interest paid on home loan taken for a self-occupied or vacant property is not available. “This provision may be relooked at and be allowed under the new tax regime,” she tells TOI.Agrees Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, saying, “the deduction for interest on housing loan may be introduced to make it (new tax regime) better for those who still chose the old tax regime.”Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings Yet another recommendation is to increase the basic exemption limit and standard deduction under the new regime.“Increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 to 5 lakhs, raise the standard deduction to Rs 100,000,” Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners says that the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime may be further raised by at least Rs 50,000, which will benefit all individual taxpayers (salaried or non-salaried) opting for the new income tax regime. This will help increase purchasing power of the taxpayers which may further boost the investments.Aarti Raote, Partner, Deloitte India says raising the basic exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh and introducing the 30% tax rate to the income category of Rs 20 lakh & above as against the existing limit of Rs 15 lakh will give tax relief to all. She also believes that the standard deduction should be increased to Rs 1 lakh from the existing Rs 50,000 limit.Aarti Raote is of the view that to make the new regime more attractive the government should consider allowing deductions for employee contributions to the NPS within the new tax regime framework.Vialto’s Chander Talreja notes that the employer’s contribution to the NPS is allowed as a deduction under the new income tax regime. “For the non-salaried individuals, while this deduction is not applicable, they do not even get any deduction for their own contribution. This is a hardship and the government may consider introducing deduction in respect of an individual's contribution to NPS under section 80CCD(1B), currently capped at Rs 50,000. This will benefit salaried as well as non-salaried individuals,” he tells TOI.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Raise basic exemption limit, standard deduction and NPS benefits for taxpayers Preeti Sharma believes that in order to promote savings towards retirement, the government may consider allowing deductions available under section 80C of the Act, under the new tax regime as well.Aarti Raote says that in line with the government’s agenda of affordable housing and green energy, it is anticipated that specific deductions towards mortgage repayments on affordable housing or electric vehicles be provided under the new tax regime besides incentivizing taxpayers for installation or adoption of solar energy equipment.However, Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors notes that the government has already rationalized the slabs and the rates in its Budget 2023. “I am not expecting that something more would be done except discontinuing the old tax regime whereby by default everyone is in the new regime,” he tells TOI.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024.

Budget 2024: Big Relief To Indian Taxpayers | Changes In New Regime Slabs | Nirmala Sitharaman

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure, despite the indexation benefit being withdrawn for property, and asserted that govt decided on the new structure after undertaking an elaborate exercise.“This perception that you will be at a disadvantage is not realistic, it’s absolutely not correct… In almost every case people have a lower tax burden under this system.The small or the medium people who are going into the market or property investments are going to benefit from it,” she told TOI in an interview.On Tuesday, she had announced a reduction in long term capital gains tax on property and gold from 20% to 12.5%, while withdrawing the benefit to adjust it for inflation. This came with the provision that indexation benefit will be available for properties bought up to 2001.The FM said the amendments have been proposed with the intent to simplify the tax regime and bring all asset classes at par.Sitharaman said the Union Budget presented on Tuesday was a continuation of the interim budget and insisted that the measures announced for Andhra Pradesh were part of the commitments given at the time of bifurcation of the state . “In Bihar’s case can anyone deny the devastation that happens because of Kosi flooding?” she said.She also said that the skilling plan through internship was voluntary for companies and she had received suggestions for such a scheme from various industry bodies. “We're not forcing anybody, we've had a lot of discussion with CII and Ficci and they thought it is possible to do it. It will actually help because they will have industry-ready people, who can be employed.”She hit out at the Opposition, saying, “This brazen method of building a false narrative, repeating it and restating it with the hope that it will stick has been tried in the Lok Sabha elections. They are trying it even now.”Along with the calculations released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes under different scenarios, tax authorities said, “Nominal real estate returns are generally in the region of 12-16% per annum, much higher than inflation. The indexation for inflation in in the region of 4-5%, depending on the period of holding. Therefore, substantial tax savings are expected for a vast majority of taxpayers.”The statement further said that the new regime is beneficial for five-year old properties under the new regime which have seen an appreciation of 1.7 times or more. Similarly, for 10 years, if the value rises 2.4 times the new mechanism is seen to be beneficial. Ditto for property purchased in 2009-10 with appreciation of 4.9 times or more, the tax department said.“It's only where returns are low (less than about 9-11% per annum) that the earlier tax rate is beneficial, but such low returns in real estate are unrealistic and rare (less than 10% of cases),” it said.Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra told TOI that benefits of reinvesting the capital gains in a new property and parking the funds in tax-exempt 54EC bonds issued by REC are intact.Asked about the revenue impact, he said that the Centre may end up losing revenue as most taxpayers are likely to gain from the decision.“Simplification of any tax structure has benefits of ease of compliance, including computation filing, maintenance of records. This also removes the differential rates for various asset classes,” CBDT said.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure.

This has led to movement in Jaiprakash Associates and Amtek Auto , where lenders were seen to be dragging their feet.""Banks have been citing delays in the tribunal, but we discovered that they were themselves to blame.They were found to be discussing loan settlements in some cases when the issue had been taken up under IBC,"" a top official said, suggesting a nexus between promoters and bankers in some cases.Take for instance, Jaiprakash Associates, promoted by the Gaurs. In 2017, it was in the second batch of high-profile cases identified by the finance ministry and govt that was to be taken up for insolvency resolution. While Jaypee Infra was pursued, banks led by ICICI Bank, were seen to be moving slowly in the Allahabad bench of NCLT , despite SBI filing another petition. It was only after the govt decided to step in that the bankers pursued it.Officials said Nirmala Sitharaman is herself reviewing some of the cases. Financial services secretary Vivek Joshi, IBBI chairman Ravi Mittal and corporate affairs secretary Manoj Govil have been monitoring the cases and asking banks to move swiftly as delay results in significant value erosion and lower the overall resolution and recovery.Bankers have often blamed NCLT and legal system, along with promoters, for delays. But a case wise analysis by the officials showed that in several cases banks had sought adjournments and sought to put the blame on promoters. Final resolution has been done in 947 of the 7,567 cases admitted in NCLT although the finance ministry is taking credit for several cases, where the companies decided to clear the dues the moment one of the aggrieved creditors moved the tribunal (see graphic).Recently, Amtek Auto promoter Arvind Dham was also arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a loan fraud case following a Supreme Court order.In the budget, Sitharaman announced measures to strengthen IBC and also provide a fresh boost to debt recovery tribunals (DRTs). Officials said govt intends to add more DRTs and Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunals, given the large and growing number of pending cases.","Banks have been citing delays in the tribunal, but we discovered that they were themselves to blame.

Billionaire battle heats up as Adani challenges Birla in cement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gautam-adani-vs-kumar-mangalam-birla-ultratech-cement-india-cement/articleshow/112093883.cms,"M&A warchest

Leadership moat

Mission to build

Hunting ground

Anti-trust scrutiny

Battle lines are being drawn in India’s cement space as Gautam Adani’s expansion spree sets off a race with fellow billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s UltraTech Cement Ltd to build capacity and snap up assets.The clash of titans is likely to intensify as the deep-pocketed tycoons seek to dominate supplies of a building material that is critical to sustaining India’s infrastructure boom.Adani’s ambitious upstart and the sector leader UltraTech have already done six deals in less than two years, with Birla’s cement maker announcing the seventh on Sunday to control a coveted regional player. At least half a dozen smaller rivals are still up for grabs.“Adani’s philosophy whenever they enter a sector is to dominate and take on competitors on a war footing,” said Aditya Kondawar, Pune-based partner at wealth management firm, Complete Circle Capital Pvt. “Once Adani came in, there was fresh aggression in the sector which motivated UltraTech also to expand. When competition is at the door, you either step up or step aside.”Adani Group ’s big bang entry in 2022 upended the local pecking order — it became No. 2 cement maker overnight with the acquisition of Ambuja Cements Ltd and ACC Ltd — but it spent much of 2023 fire-fighting after Hindenburg Research’s scathing report.The ports-to-power conglomerate only got back to its expansionist ways fully this year, stoking a turf war in cement as Birla’s entrenched incumbent digs in its heels.Adani, already down four acquisitions in the sector since it entered, is looking to double annual production capacity to 140 million tons by 2028.The group is scouting for more cement assets to expand its reach, procure key raw material — limestone reserves — and has a war chest of about $4.5 billion for acquisitions over the next two years, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The Adani Group, which controls India’s largest private sector port operator, is aiming to drive down costs significantly even if it can’t match the cost efficiency of Chinese cement makers, one person said.Sea or inland water transportation costs a fraction of transport via trucks and Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd’s network will be helpful there, this person added. Adani Ports is already planning a 2-million-ton cement grinding unit at its transshipment terminal in Kerala. Green energy from group firms can help pare fuel costs, the person said.To bolster the moat around its leadership, UltraTech acquired a smaller rival last year. In June, it bought a minority stake in a Chennai-based cement maker in June before ramping it up to majority control this week — a move seen as marking its territory to fend off Adani. It’s also circling another target.Birla’s cement giant will continue to expand operations and snap up assets to reach 200 million tons annual capacity by 2027, people familiar with Birla’s strategy said.Representatives for the Adani Group declined to comment while those for UltraTech didn’t respond to an emailed request for comments.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mission to build everything from airport and power facilities to roads, bridges and tunnels will spur India’s infrastructure investment to 15 trillion rupees ($179.2 billion) by March 2026, according to Crisil Ratings.This will spawn massive demand for cement, outpacing supply in the coming years and creating opportunities for expansion that neither Adani, Asia’s second-richest person, nor Birla can resist.Adani, which acquired Penna Cement Industries Ltd last month, has looked at Jaypee Group’s as well as Orient Cement Ltd. in the recent past, according to local media reports. Orient Cement has now drawn interest from UltraTech also.Others such as Saurashtra Cement Ltd, Mangalam Cement Ltd, Vadraj Cement Ltd.and Bagalkot Cement Industries Ltd may also emerge as targets, people familiar said.The southern parts of India is the most fragmented market for cement in the country, with the highest installed capacity and a large number of firms which have not expanded capacity over the years, Sanjeev Kumar Singh and Mudit Agarwal, analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. wrote in a July report.“It is possible that a few of these entities might consider exiting the industry if they are offered favorable valuations,” Singh and Agarwal wrote.That makes this geography the perfect hunting ground for both the billionaires, who have already begun cliching deals.Adani’s Penna Cement purchase in June was to boost its footprint in southern India. Days later, UltraTech bought a 23% stake in India Cements Ltd, a Chennai-based firm with almost 14.5 million tons capacity, in a move to block any possible Adani overtures. On Sunday, Birla’s firm bought almost a third more of India Cements for $472 million, pushing its total stake past 55%.It “enables UltraTech to serve the southern markets more effectively” and expedites the path to 200 million tons target, Birla said in a statement Sunday.“The pace of acquisitions in the cement industry was inevitable because of government spending in infrastructure and housing,”said Aveek Mitra, New Delhi-based founder of Aveksat Investment Advisory.India has about 100 listed and closely held cement makers, with most having tiny market shares, according to Mitra.“Asset block of 28 million tons is in pipeline for acquisition” and M&A deals will continue since the large incumbent players want to maintain their market share, Anupama Reddy, co-group head of corporate ratings at ICRA Ltd wrote in a June 13 note.To be sure, even with all the aggressive expansion it’d still be hard for Adani to topple UltraTech. The gap between the two rivals is significant and will remain so, based on announced capacity additions.Adani and UltraTech will also need to be mindful of scrutiny from India’s anti-trust watchdog and avoid acquisitions in geographies where they have high market share concentration.While cement demand is strong now, it could reduce in four or five years, according to Jyoti Gupta, a research analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. Smaller players like Dalmia Bharat Ltd, Shree Cement Ltd and JSW Cement Ltd are also scaling up.“When infrastructure spending will reduce, and there is ample supply of residential properties, will there be enough demand to utilize all this added capacity?” Gupta said.",Adani’s ambitious upstart and the sector leader UltraTech have already done six deals in less than two years. The clash of titans is likely to intensify as the deep-pocketed tycoons seek to dominate supplies of a building material.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112093956,imgsize-80070,width-400,resizemode-4/112093956.jpg"

Additionally, UltraTech will make an open offer to India Cements ' public shareholders to acquire an extra 26% stake at the same price in line with India's takeover norms, raising the total cost for UltraTech to Rs 7,100 crore.If approved by regulators, this deal will extend UltraTech's footprint in the highly fragmented and fast-growing southern market , particularly in Tamil Nadu, where it has had limited presence. The scarcity of limestone in Tamil Nadu has restricted UltraTech from setting up new integrated units in the state since acquiring its last unit in Aug 1998.UltraTech will add India Cements' 14.5 million tonnes capacity spread across Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Rajasthan to its existing 153 million tonnes capacity and take on the company's 1,855 employees. UltraTech's only integrated unit in Tamil Nadu has a capacity of 1.4 million tonnes, whereas India Cements has a capacity of 6 million tonnes in the state.Conglomerate chair Kumar Mangalam Birla said the India Cements opportunity is an ""exciting"" one as it enables UltraTech to serve the southern market more effectively and also ""accelerates our path to 200 plus million tonnes capacity"". UltraTech is up against Ambuja Cements, a part of Gautam Adani's enterprise, which is gunning for the leading position in the industry. Ambuja has a capacity of 89 million tonnes.This deal follows Birla's acquisition of a 23% stake in India Cements from billionaire investor and DMart founder Radhakisan Damani for Rs 1,885 crore at Rs 267 a share. Following this ""financial investment,"" UltraTech was approached by the promoters of India Cements, who were interested in selling their holding in the company.Srinivasan joined India Cements after his father and the company's co-founder passed away in 1968. Currently the vice chairman and MD, Srinivasan, 79, is facing health issues, and his wife and daughter, Rupa Gurunath, are not interested in running India Cements. The trio will step down from the board once the acquisition is complete.India Cements has faced financial issues in recent quarters, with its offices being searched by the Enforcement Directorate earlier this year in relation to certain foreign exchange transactions. The company has been restructuring its balance sheet to reduce losses, modernize its vintage plants, and meet working capital needs.","UltraTech Cement, a part of the $65-billion Aditya Birla conglomerate, will acquire about 33% stake in India Cements.

Gold losing sheen?

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

The same principle will also apply in case of multiple sellers, where the share of each seller is less than Rs.50 lakh, but the aggregate sale-price of the property is over Rs. 50 lakh.The 1% TDS applies on the purchase price or the stamp duty value, whichever is higher. This amendment proposed in Budget 2024 , comes into effect from October 1.The explanatory memorandum points out that, “Some taxpayers are interpreting that the consideration being paid or credited refers to each individual buyer’s payment rather than the total consideration paid for the immovable property.” The memorandum illustrates that based on this interpretation, if buyers are paying less than Rs. 50 lakh each, no tax is being deducted, even if the purchase value of the immovable property or stamp duty value exceeds Rs. 50 lakh. “This is against the intention of the legislature,” it states.“Accordingly, it is proposed to amend sub-section (2) of section 194-IA of the Act to clarify that where there is more than one transferor (seller) or transferee (buyer) in respect of an immovable property, then such consideration shall be the aggregate of the amounts paid or payable by all the transferees to the transferor or all the transferors for transfer of such immovable property.”Tax experts point out that buyers should be aware of this change as the penalties for not deducting and depositing tax at source are significant. In addition to deducting and depositing the TDS the buyers also have to issue the TDS certificates after generating the same on the I-T department’s e-portal (TRACES).

Budget 2024 : India's Economic Survey for 2024 revealed the country's infrastructure leap. FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20 with concerted efforts to boost physical connectivity, electricity, water and sanitation, urban development, strategic and digital infrastructure. It also marked emphasis on resource mobilisation from new sources and data aggregation and management for tracking projects and optimal allocation of scarce resources.While capital allocation for major infrastructure sub-sectors like roads, railways, etc. continues as already announced by the government during the interim Budget, the current final Budget heralds a transformative vision for the eastern states with the ‘Purvodaya’ plan, targeting holistic growth with announcements of new roads, power plant, airports, colleges and sports infrastructure.For the shipping sector, the government has announced ownership, leasing and flagging reforms which should improve the share of the Indian shipping industry and generate more employment.Capital projects in the sector uplifts the society at large and generates employment. Brownfield redevelopment of cities and houses for the poor will fuel demand in the sector thereby generating employment and economic growth. Additionally, the government has announced an employment incentive scheme for first time employers to further fillip jobs creation and youth empowerment.From a tax standpoint, the government recognised the potential of cruise tourism in India and in order to give a fillip to this employment generating industry, a simplified tax regime where 20 percent of revenues will be deemed as income from such business will be considered for the purpose of income-tax.India has recognised the need to have a robust MRO ecosystem for the airline and boat & ship sector in view of increased demand. From Customs perspective, the period for export of goods which are imported for repairs and requirement to re-import goods which are exported for repairs under warranty has been extended.The government recognises the need for participation from the private sector in this critical sector including investments from foreign investors. Deletion of angel tax provision is a welcome move which will propel raising of funds in the sector.Second round of VSV gives opportunity to minimise litigation with focus on ease of doing business.On an overall basis, this year’s Budget lays down a framework to propel growth and generate employment with higher involvement of the private sector in upskilling India and some relaxation for individual taxpayers."," FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20.

This, in turn, led to under reporting of income. These individuals offered the overseas income net of tax and at the same time claimed a foreign tax credit (FTC) for taxes withheld overseas against their India tax liability.In short - they got a double advantage.The Budget proposes to amend section 198 of the I-T Act to include income taxes paid outside India for the purpose of computing the income of the taxpayer who is liable to tax in India. This proposal will be effective financial year 2024-25.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said, ""The amendment is more clarificatory in nature. This was always the correct position. As explained in the explanatory memorandum. It appears that some taxpayers (including companies) were not doing so and hence this amendment was introduced making it abundantly clear.""She gives an illustration. An Indian employee of an Indian subsidiary of a German company was granted shares under the global Esop plan. He was eligible to receive dividend of 100 euros on such shares. According to German law, 10 euros was withheld and the balance was transferred to the employee's Indian bank account.""The correct tax position was always to offer the entire 100 euros as income and claim 10 euros as a double tax relief (credit against Indian tax liability on such 100 euros),"" KPMG India's Sirwalla added.Ameya Kunte, founder, Globeview Advisors, points out a few decisions where overseas tax was not held part of the total income assessable to tax in India - these now stand overturned.""The MP high court in the case of Yawar Rashid had held that the tax deducted at source outside India from foreign dividends and interest income was not part of the total income and thus not assessable in the hands of the taxpayer. This HC decision was also relied upon by the Bangalore bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in the case of Sunil Shinde. The proposed amendment makes it clear tax deducted at source outside India, will be part of income.

Sources said Rahul specifically told the members to focus on what their respective states have not got in the Budget, rather than speaking about what others have got. The party decided to accommodate maximum states through MPs in its allocated four hours discussion time.

Opposition members chanted slogans ‘sarkar ko bachane wala Budget’ and ‘sarkar bachao, kursi bachao Budget’ as the FM read out a slew of measu res for the two states.Congress and DMK members from Tamil Nadu and Kerala were seen raising demands for relief and rehabilitation for the two states hit by the fury of heavy rainfall. They appeared incensed as Sitharaman made some announcements for rain-hit Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, but they never threatened to scale up an allopposition effort because of their own stakes in Bihar and Uttarakhand.Frequent comments by Trinamool member Saugata Ray and DMK’s Dayanidhi Maran drew the ire of Speaker Om Birla, who warned the two.

International Business Machines Corp reported a jump in bookings for its artificial intelligence business as customers work to implement the latest technology.

Ford Motor Co posted second-quarter profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates, saying quality problems with new vehicles led to a surge in warranty costs.

Bank of America Corp said its board authorized another $25 billion stock repurchase program.

Whirlpool Corp, the owner of Maytag, lowered its full-year earnings forecast, as consumers continued to shy away from big-ticket appliance purchases amid a weakening housing market.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc’s limited-time offers and speedy service helped it beat expectations in the second quarter, but executives warned the burrito chain will face pressures to profitability.

ServiceNow Inc. reported better-than-expected sales and bookings in the second quarter, signaling strong customer demand for its broad suite of software tools.

Wall Street got a reality check after a disappointing start of the megacap earnings season fueled concern the artificial-intelligence frenzy that has powered the bull market might be overblown.A selloff in big tech sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since December 2022, ending the best stretch without a 2% drop since the start of the global financial crisis.Losses were more pronounced in the Nasdaq 100, which tumbled over 3.5%. Alphabet Inc. slid 5% after sinking more resources into its drive to outmatch rivals in AI, with spending higher than analysts expected. Tesla Inc.’s profit miss and the Robotaxi delay spurred a 12% stock plunge.“Investors are finally waking up to all that AI spend and realizing it is much more of an expense right now rather than a revenue generator,” said Peter Boockvar at The Boock Report.Wednesday’s session was another lesson in the “concentration risk” bears see as latent in a market whose upside has owed disproportionately to a narrow cohort of massive gainers. For a fourth straight session — and the 10th time in 11 days — the performance of smaller companies exceeded larger ones, evidence investor tastes have shifted from the megacap tech names that have come to dominate benchmark indexes.The Treasury curve steepened on bets the Federal Reserve is close to cutting rates. Former New York Fed President William Dudley called for lower borrowing costs — preferably at next week’s gathering. For many analysts, such a move would be worrisome as it would indicate officials rushing to avoid a recession.The loonie fell as the Bank of Canada cut rates, focused on “downside risks.” The yen hit the highest since May amid an unwind in carry trades.To Steve Clayton at Hargreaves Lansdown, this could be the year markets start talking about the “So-So Seven,” noting that results from Tesla and Alphabet are not enough to maintain their momentum.“The market is not impressed with the start of earnings season for the mega tech stocks,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. “There was a lot resting on these results and we don’t think that they give clear answers to questions about the effectiveness and profit potential for AI right now.”After driving the rally in stocks for most of 2024, big tech slammed into a wall. Traders rotated from megacaps to lagging parts of the market, spurred by bets on Fed rate cuts and concern AI still needs to pay off.“Tech’s problem isn’t just that earnings are less than perfect, but the group is still caught up in the violent rotation trade that kicked off with the June CPI,” said Vital Knowledge’s Adam Crisafulli. “Many assumed the anti-tech rotation would be ephemeral and the fact it’s proving durable is compounding anxiety toward the group and spurring additional selling pressure.”The drubbing in these stocks has seen some of the air come out of valuations. While that’s something that could argue in favor of dip buying, the earnings season is just getting started. Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Meta Platforms Inc are all due toTo Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers, the equity correction is far from over. “Yesterday we wrote that a 10% to 15% correction was in the cards this quarter, historically the worst period of the year,” Torres said. “This quarter, the valuation concerns are paired with front-loaded gains, irrational exuberance, a high bar for earnings estimates and a presidential election.”In fact, the second-quarter US earnings season is off to a weaker start than usual.Among S&P 500 companies that reported results, profits beat analyst estimates by the smallest margin since the end of 2022 — while sales surprises were the worst in at least two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“We are still looking for volatility to increase moving through the second half of 2024 - with the potential for a 10% to 15% correction in benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100,” said Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “Our work does not point to secular/structural downturn at this time, but rather a pause in the reflationary expansion cycle that began a few years ago.”Just as earnings roll in, a key technical indicator in the US stock market sat close to historic extremes — a crucial gauge that has foretold past selloffs.Known as the “the 200-DMA” — an abbreviation of 200-day moving average — the gauge measures how the S&P 500 is performing against that longer-term measure. At one point last week, the benchmark was trading as much as 15% above it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.While the gap has since narrowed — to 9% through Wednesday’s close — that kind of gulf above 12% still preceded declines for the index in 2011, 2018 and 2021. Although that does not necessarily mean the market is about to tank, it is a warning sign for investors concerned about lofty tech valuations and concentration risk.","A selloff in big tech sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since December 2022.

Using SIMBARA, the government would be able to track the nickel and tin from mines to domestic smelters .""Smelting companies have to register where they buy the nickel from and where the mines are,"" Septian Hario Seto, deputy coordinating minister for maritime and investment affairs, said in an interview.Smelters will not be allowed to unload ore shipments from mines that have not yet paid their royalties. The system successfully increased government revenue in the coal sector, Seto told Reuters, and hoped to see similar improvement in the nickel and tin sectors.The SIMBARA system will also be linked to the government's digital records of mining quotas , known as RKAB. It enables miners to track how much production quota a miner has left for the period and to alert authorities should there be discrepancies in output and sales data, he added.A senior official has said Jakarta will implement the system on other minerals such as bauxite and copper, but the timing would be decided later on, once the nickel and tin tracking system has run smoothly.","Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of nickel and one of its largest producers of tin.

TAIPEI: Taiwan's TSMC , the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its full-year revenue forecast on Thursday given surging demand for chips used in artificial intelligence, and rejected the idea of a joint venture factory in the United States.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), a major Apple Inc and Nvidia supplier, has benefited from the global AI boom that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand.The bellwether for the chip industry earlier on Thursday posted net profit that beat market expectations.

Stock traders in Asia are ramping up the Trump trade in preparation for a potential second term for the former US president, which will likely create winners and losers in the region.Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia from agriculture and farm equipment to textiles and weapons production.Asian companies’ momentum in the global race for electric vehicles and chips could slow should a Trump administration follow through on his pledges.China is seen as a clear loser given Trump’s call for higher tariffs and confrontational rhetoric against the world’s second largest economy. Taiwan and South Korea, which are heavily reliant on export revenues from semiconductor and other tech sectors, are also staring at an outlook downturn, market watchers say.India is deemed as a potential beneficiary should the former US president’s polling hold up and lead to his win in November. Southeast Asian economies, whose fortunes aren’t closely tied to exports, may be able to deflect much of the fallout from a change in the White House, investors say.Here is what market watchers are saying“India stands out as an economy that is relatively shielded from these shocks as the country has only a small share of global goods markets and is less exposed to China-related risks.”“It looks like India has a much better relationship with the US than China. At least from India’s side, the impact of Trump was not as bad as it was for many other emerging markets. It’s difficult to think it’ll be different this time.”“China’s obviously going to be one of the most affected if those tariffs really come in place and if Trump successfully can put enough pressure on the EU to also put some tariffs of their own on China.”Still, “a lot of companies are diversifying their markets or starting to diversify the supply chains and build manufacturing facilities outside of China. And even if a Trump presidency imposes high tariffs, Europe might decide not to follow it unless there is some really super strong political pressure.”“For Japan, we believe that risks are more balanced than China as the country’s sensitivity to global trade is a bit lower, and its relations with the US will likely remain solid even under the Trump administration.”“We also see the opportunity for the country to cement its semiconductor sector renaissance if Taiwan or South Korea end up bearing the brunt of the Trump team’s potentially consequential re-calibration of the US strategy for them.”“In Asia, the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Vietnam has been benefiting from the lower-end manufacturing, such as textile and wooden furniture, while Taiwan and Malaysia have been benefiting from electronic products supply chain shifts.”“Southeast Asia will be in a pretty good position because of what’s happening with China. So in that sense, Southeast Asia would be good. Thailand even, well, Vietnam may get into some trouble because they’re doing so much manufacturing of Chinese goods, but they’re also doing a lot of manufacturing for Korea.”“For Asia, it would really affect the tech-related ones more. It’s really whether the momentum trade of Taiwan, Korea is going to continue a bit longer, versus Asean being a bit more resilient, less tied to the tech sector, and having the China plus one strategy and secular themes playing out.”","Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia.
