Check penalties, consequences for late filing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2023-24-what-happens-if-i-file-income-tax-return-after-deadline-check-penalties-consequences-for-late-filing/articleshow/112105116.cms,"What is the penalty for belated ITR filing?

Who is required to pay the penalty?

Income Exceeds Basic Exemption Limit: Taxpayers whose income exceeds the basic exemption limit will be penalised for late filing. The limit varies by tax regime: Rs 3 lakh under the new tax regime, irrespective of age, and different limits under the old tax regime based on age.

Section 139(1) Conditions: Even if income is below the exemption limit, taxpayers must file an ITR if they meet specific conditions in Section 139(1). These include:

Spending Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel. Paying Rs 1 lakh or more in electricity bills. Depositing Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts.

Holding Foreign Assets: Residents with foreign assets or income must file an ITR, even if their income is below the exemption limit. Late filing fees apply in these cases.

Exceptions to Penalties

How is a belated ITR filed?

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24 : For individual taxpayers whose accounts do not need auditing, the last date to file income tax returns (ITRs) for FY 2023–24 (AY 2024–25) is July 31, 2024. Missing this deadline means filing a belated ITR , which comes with penalties and interest.Under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000.For small taxpayers with a taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh, the penalty is restricted to Rs 1,000, according to an ET report. The important thing to note is that this penalty applies even if the belated ITR shows zero tax payable. Additionally, penal interest on the pending tax payable must be paid when filing a belated ITR.Certain taxpayers are required to pay penalties if they miss the ITR filing deadline and they fulfil the following conditions:Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites Individuals might need to submit an income tax return to receive a refund. However, if their taxable income is below the basic exemption limit, they will not face penalties for filing after the due date, according to income tax laws. This means the gross taxable income is considered before any eligible deductions are accounted for.The process for filing a belated ITR is the same as filing on time, with the key difference being the selection of Section 139(4) instead of 139(1) on the ITR form.","Filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000 under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

August 2024 Bank Holidays: In August, banks across India, both public and private, will be closed for up to 13 days, including Sundays, national and regional holidays, and the second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Various festivals will be celebrated in different states during August, leading to bank closures. These include Ker Puja, Tendong Lho Rum Faat, Patriot's Day, Independence Day/Parsi New Year (Shahenshahi), Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami.The specific dates and states affected by these closures vary.This year, August 15, which is Independence Day, falls on a Thursday, so there will not be an extended weekend during that week.However, in certain states, there will be a long weekend due to the closure of banks on Monday, August 26, for Janmashtami (Shravan Vad-8)/Krishna Jayanthi, which follows the fourth Saturday and Sunday of the month.According to an ET report, the states affected by this long weekend include Gujarat, Orissa, Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Jammu, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, and Srinagar.","In August, banks across India will be closed for up to 13 days, including national and regional holidays.

The NSE Nifty 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex, experienced declines, deviating from the generally optimistic global market sentiment.The Nifty 50 fell by 0.26% to close at 23,992.55, while the Sensex ended the day 0.21% lower at 78,593.07.This downward movement was attributed to profit-taking by investors, with analysts pointing to valuation concerns and global uncertainties as factors negatively impacting market sentiment.Earlier in the day, the indices had shown promise, rising approximately 1.2% following a worldwide sell-off on Monday that erased around $250 billion from the market capitalization of Indian equities .Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research at Profitmart Securities, told Reuters, ""What happened in Indian equities on Monday was an over-reaction, but our markets were due for a correction and will remain subdued as investors await clarity on U.S. economy and rate cut trajectory.""He further noted that no major segment in the Indian markets is currently trading at attractive valuations, which is also affecting buying interest.The performance of Indian benchmarks stood in contrast to the largely positive sentiment observed in most Asian markets and the recovery of U.S. stock index futures.The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index, for instance, rose by about 1%. Within the Indian market, high-weightage financial stocks fell by 1.07%, primarily due to a nearly 1% drop in HDFC Bank, a leading private lender. Analysts suggested that while heavyweight stocks like HDFC Bank offer capital protection, they are unlikely to generate high returns in the near future, prompting some investors to realize profits.On the other hand, information technology companies, which derive a substantial portion of their revenue from the U.S., experienced a 0.49% gain, following a 3.26% drop on Monday. Textile manufacturers such as Welspun Living, Trident, Gokaldas Exports, and KPR Mill saw significant gains ranging from 2.9% to 15% amidst political unrest in Bangladesh. At least one analyst suggested that major brands may consider India as an alternative sourcing destination. The broader, more domestically focused small-cap and mid-cap indices also experienced declines of approximately 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively.","The Nifty 50 fell by 0.26% to close at 23,992.55, while the Sensex ended the day 0.21% lower at 78,593.07.

The tax demand, which aligns with the country's good and services tax regulations, was sent to the IT services company, which ranks as the second-largest in India.After a meeting with tax officials, Infosys has requested a period of ten days to prepare and submit its response to the tax demand, according to the source.The Directorate General of GST Intelligence ( DGGI ) is investigating Infosys for allegedly evading more than Rs 32,400 crore in GST payments between July 2017 and March 2022, according to a TOI eport last week. The company is accused of failing to pay Integrated GST on services imported from its overseas branches.Based on an incident report by DGGI's Bangalore zonal unit, Infosys was required to pay GST under the reverse charge mechanism (RCM), which mandates the service recipient to pay the tax. Integrated GST applies to imports and inter-state transactions of goods and services.Infosys has disputed the allegations, stating, ""The company believes that as per regulations, GST is not applicable on these expenses. Additionally, as per a recent circular issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on the recommendations of the GST Council, services provided by the overseas branches to Indian entity are not subject to GST. It is also important to note that the GST payments are eligible for credit or refund against export of IT services.

India lifestyle market

MUMBAI: India’s smaller urban centres and rural regions are driving the growth of the $130-billion lifestyle market , about 80% of which is led by the fashion segment that includes apparel, footwear and accessories. Urban regions beyond the top 50 cities and rural collectively account for about 67% or two-thirds of lifestyle consumption in the country, which is home to a large cohort of young Gen Z shoppers, according to a joint report by Bain and Myntra .Online platforms have played their fair share in democratising access for consumers — about 50% of more than 175 million e-shoppers come from households with an annual income of less than Rs 10 lakh. Two in three of them come from beyond the top 50 cities.“Online shopping is filling up the access gap. Consumers sitting in beyond the top 50 cities have the same exposure to brands and trends as their metro and tier one counterparts. As consumers become more comfortable, they are buying products across multiple categories and for different occasions. About 40% of our sales from international brands come from tier two plus cities,” Myntra CEO Nandita Sinha told TOI.The lifestyle market is expected to touch $210 billion by 2028 from about $130 billion currently. The online lifestyle segment, which is pegged at $16-17 billion, is estimated to grow to $40-45 billion by 2028 as the market is still underpenetrated at 13% (of the total market), leaving enough room for growth. “Because of the low penetration base that we have in e-commerce shopping for fashion, there is an opportunity for us to grow beyond the inflationary pressures that the overall market (fashion industry) is seeing,” said Sinha. For Myntra, markets like Jaipur, Patna, and Guwahati are growing very well.A large part of the growth for the lifestyle market, particularly online, going ahead will come from the Gen Z shoppers. Gen Zs are digital natives who seek fresh fashion trends, buy more frequently and comprise 60 million of the e-lifestyle shoppers. “Gen Z shoppers today account for only 25% of GMV (gross merchandise value). But as they enter the job market, their contribution will go up,” said Shyam Unnikrishnan, partner at Bain. The cohort will also add to the new consumers for online lifestyle shopping from beyond the top 50 cities.As consumers across income strata upgrade their purchases, helped by improving incomes and premiumise, it will add to the incremental $80-billion spending that the lifestyle market is estimated to see. At present, the price point of less than Rs 600 lead the lifestyle market but going ahead masstige (mass + prestige) plus price points are expected to grow faster.",India’s smaller urban centres and rural regions are driving the growth of the $130-billion lifestyle market.

The company had issued GDS in 1994 and had appointed Citibank as exclusive depository for this programme.“Considering that there has been no activity for the past several years and this will simplify the company’s financial reporting requirements and reduction in administrative costs, it has been decided to terminate the GDS programme and its engagement with Citibank.

Tech is core to curing disease,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/times-techies/tech-is-core-to-curing-disease/articleshow/112332172.cms,"Around the world, healthcare systems are seeing a shift from having to deal with infectious ailments to addressing non-communicable disorders, such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases. “What they have in common is that they are very personalised. In infectious diseases, there is a onesize-fits-all treatment, but for the drug in cancer for example, you need to find out exactly what the cancer is, where it is, and at what stage it is, and then make a personalised treatment decision,” says Bernd Montag, CEO of Siemens Healthineers .One of the technologies that will help in this, he says, is artificial intelligence (AI). Siemens Healthineers, one of the world’s biggest medical technology companies, is among those working to bring AI to the cellular level so that across micro-domains, it can free up physician time, or even enable diagnosis where no doctor is present. “As an example, you can screen for TB in a remote area, when you don’t have a physician looking at the image,” says Bernd.All this requires AI to understand medicine, and recognise what counts in a particular procedure. “You need to train the AI to differentiate a malignant tumour from a benign tumour, to automatically do the treatment planning for radiation therapy. Or, when you have multiple sclerosis, you need to train the AI to quantify what is the stage of multiple sclerosis,” he says.An important field for Siemens Healthineers is cancer care, and creating an ecosystem for the same, one that encompasses early and accurate diagnosis and treatment, especially in low-resource set-ups in smaller towns. “We are building cancer care centres, where our type of technology is the backbone, whether it’s imaging or radiation therapy,” says Bernd.In cancer care, imaging and therapy go hand in hand, and AI has a role to play here. “You do a CT scan for simulating – or planning – the treatment. And we have an AI algorithm that uses the images to look at which parts of the body need to be protected from the radiation, and where exactly the tumour is. And then the Linac (linear accelerator, a device that uses electricity to generate high-energy x-rays or electrons) is programmed to do exactly this,” Bernd says.It’s possible, he says, to make this technology more and more user-independent and standardised, so that one doesn’t need physicians and other staff at every site to do this treatment.A lot of such work is happening in Bengaluru, where Siemens has a software and digital innovation hub. “There is literally no Siemens product which doesn’t have Indian engineering, software engineering, digital and AI magic and creativity in it,” says Bernd. The India centre has over 3,000 engineers and specialists, and another 2,000-plus are expected to be added over the next five years in a new campus that the company is building.He says the company is also committed to ‘ Make in India ’, locally producing, for instance, C-Arm X-ray machines, and MRI scanners. “In C-Arm machines, India is the hub for world production,” he says.","Siemens Healthineers is one of the world’s biggest medical technology companies.

Data governance

& engineering

Building talent, using experts

In the heart of Mumbai’s bustling financial district, the offices of Vodafone Idea hum with activity. But it’s not just human employees driving the telecommunications giant forward. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of the company’s operations, from customer service to network management.“We’ve been an AI and machine learning factory for years,” says Hitesh TK, chief information officer at Vodafone Idea.“It’s crucial for handling the volume of data generated by our 200-300 million customers.”Across town, at the headquarters of IndianOil, a similar revolution is underway. Suresh Nambiar, executive director of information systems, speaks proudly of the company’s AI-driven predictive maintenance systems. “We’re using AI to optimise refinery processes and improve supply chain logistics,” Suresh says. “It has substantially reduced downtime and enhanced operational efficiency.”These illustrate a significant shift in how the country’s largest companies are embracing AI. But as AI’s role grows, so does the need for robust governance frameworks to ensure its responsible and ethical use – especially in India’s critical industries like telecom and oil & gas.Rishi Aurora, managing partner at IBM Consulting for India and South Asia, says that 71% of chief executives in India believe that without stable governance, AI models will not be successful.At IndianOil, the journey towards effective AI governance began with their digital transformation initiative. “When we started that transformation in 2019, we engaged a consultant,” Suresh says. “We carved out a special purpose vehicle, a Strategic Information Systems group, dedicated to driving the digital transformation of IndianOil.” This group, which started with just four members and has now grown to 30, has been instrumental in implementing AI governance practices across the organisation.One of their key strategies has been to conduct hackathons across the organisation. “We did one for the business intelligence tool, one for the analytics tool, one for mobile tools, and one for generative AI tools, in coordination with Microsoft,” Suresh says. These hackathons not only helped identify potential AI use cases, but also fostered a culture of responsible innovation within the company.Hitesh says Vodafone Idea focused heavily on data governance as the foundation of their AI strategy. “We moved from multiple points of data sources into a single data lake.” This consolidation of data sources has been crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of their AI models. Hitesh also emphasises the importance of proper data definition in AI governance. “Three people look at the same data in three different ways,” he says. “So, you need to have a proper data definition. Otherwise, a prediction, for example, from a customer service point of view will look accurate, but from a marketing point of view, it may not look so.”To address this challenge and build trust in AI, Hitesh says, they implemented a data engineering process. Both companies have also had to grapple with the challenge of privacy protection, especially in light of India’s new Digital Personal Data Protection Act.Vodafone Idea has had to take this challenge particularly seriously, given the sensitive nature of the customer data they handle. Hitesh’s team had to ensure their work processes never store or reveal any personal information of their customers. “Even for basic tasks like complaint resolution, we ensure we’re not revealing exact customer locations,” he says.Continuous monitoring and improvement of AI systems is another crucial aspect of governance, especially considering the pace of advancement of AI models. Both companies have implemented processes for regular updates and adaptations to their AI systems.The shortage of skilled talent presents yet another governance challenge. Both Vodafone Idea and IndianOil have implemented extensive training programmes to upskill their existing workforce. “We conducted a mandatory training programme on generative AI for all employees, regardless of their role,” Hitesh says. Ensuring that all employees understand the technology they’re working with is seen as a key part of a good AI governance strategy.Despite this, addressing the multifaceted challenges of AI governance requires most enterprises to partner with technology companies like IBM. Suresh says these collaborations bring not only advanced AI tools and platforms, but also valuable expertise in implementation and governance. “Technology players bring a wealth of knowledge and experience. They help us navigate the intricacies of AI development, ensuring our strategies align with best practices and global standards,” he says.As Indian enterprises expand their use of AI, the focus on governance will intensify. Rishi predicts that 2024 will see many pilot projects in AI being converted into full-scale implementations, particularly in areas like finance, talent transformation, and IT modernisation.","Vodafone Idea and IndianOil have implemented extensive training programmes to upskill their existing workforce. 71% of chief executives in India believe that without stable governance, AI models will not be successful.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024? Experts decode,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/are-nps-vatsalya-hiked-nps-deduction-limit-for-private-sector-employees-good-moves-from-budget-2024-experts-decode/articleshow/112108765.cms,"How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Controversial actions by Jamaat-e-Islami

Widespread presence globally

Current scenario and govt crackdown

In a dramatic turn of events, Bangladesh 's political landscape has been overturned. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned on Monday and fled to India following widespread violent protests and civil unrest.Amid this turmoil, army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman announced the establishment of an interim government to guide the country through this period of instability.He also said that the military would take over maintaining law and order.The Jamaat-e-Islami, founded in 1975, is one of the largest Islamist parties in Bangladesh. Historically allied with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), it was banned from participating in national elections in 2013. The Bangladesh government has since officially designated Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing, Chhatra Shibir, as terrorist organisations.The Jamaat-e-Ismali's constitution violated the national constitution by opposing secularism, as per an Associated Press report. The government also accused the party of instigating violent protests, which resulted in the deaths of over 300 people and injuries to thousands more. These protests were triggered by a controversial quota system for government jobs.Jamaat-e-Islami was founded by Sayyid Abul A’la Maududi, a figure associated with theMuslim Brotherhood , with the mission of establishing an Islamic state. The name translates to ""congregation of Islam,"" while its student wing, Chhatra Shibir, means ""student camp."" The organization's ideology promotes an Islamic conquest, aiming to bring the world under Islamic rule.The actions of the Islamist organisation Jamaat-e-Islami have been contentious since the liberation of Bangladesh. The country's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, banned the organisation due to its members' involvement in forming auxiliary forces like Razakars, Al-Badr, Al-Shams, and the Peace Committee. These groups were implicated in committing atrocities against Bengali freedom fighters, particularly targeting Hindus.Jamaat-e-Islami has established a widespread presence beyond Bangladesh. In Pakistan, it remains a major political force, despite its involvement in militant activities through its student wing, Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba. The organisation has connections with various militant groups, including Gaza-based Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Muslim brotherhood.After the ban, Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies have launched a crackdown on Jamaat-e-Islami and its affiliates.Authorities are targeting offices and publication houses associated with the group in an effort to dismantle its operations within the country. Despite these efforts, reports indicate that Jamaat activists are attempting to mobilise and stage protests in various regions.Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's government is taking decisive actions to curb the influence of Jamaat-e-Islami, a group with a history of violence and extremism.","Jamaat-e-Islami, founded in 1975, is one of the largest Islamist parties in Bangladesh.

Cash cow

RIYADH: Saudi oil giant Aramco on Tuesday reported net profit of $29.07 billion in the second quarter, a slight drop from the same period last year as output remained subdued.The decrease of 3.4 percent ""mainly reflects the impact of lower crude oil volumes sold and weakening refining margins"", the company said in a statement posted to the Saudi stock exchange.Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, is currently producing roughly nine million barrels per day (bpd), well below its capacity of 12 million bpd.Production averaged 8.8 million bpd in June, Riyadh-based firm Jadwa Investment said last week.The relatively low figure reflects cuts dating back to October 2022, when the OPEC+ bloc of oil producers that Riyadh co-leads with Moscow announced it would reduce output by two million bpd to boost prices.In April 2023, several OPEC+ members announced they would further slash production by more than one million bpd, and in June 2023, Riyadh announced an additional voluntary cut of one million bpd.""Output will remain at similar levels until at least October"", at which point an OPEC+ agreement announced in June 2024 will allow ""for gradual monthly increases"", Jadwa said.Aramco is the jewel of the Saudi economy and the main source of revenue for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to set the Gulf kingdom up for a prosperous post-oil future.The firm's profits help allow Saudi Arabia to finance flagship projects including NEOM, the futuristic mega-city being built in the desert, a giant airport in Riyadh and major tourism and leisure developments.The IMF said in April that, at current production levels, Saudi Arabia's fiscal break-even oil price would be $96.2 per barrel in 2024.Brent, the international benchmark, was trading at $76.43 per barrel on Tuesday after Monday's global stock market rout fuelled by US recession fears.Yet Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser told reporters that Aramco was still ""positive about the outlook for global oil demand"", pointing to ""strong"" demand from China.""The market in my view is overreacting and the fundamentals do not support the drop in prices that we are witnessing today,"" Nasser said.""I think the market is reading too much into the short-term responses to the news coming from the US with regards to the number of jobs.""The government's stake in Aramco, one of the world's biggest companies by market capitalisation, is around 81.5 percent.Aramco's initial public offering in 2019, the biggest flotation in history, raised $29.4 billion, and a secondary offering this year of nearly 1.7 billion shares fetched $12.35 billion.Aramco announced last year it would start paying a performance-based dividend in addition to its base dividend.In May, the firm announced base dividend payouts for the first quarter totalling $20.3 billion and a performance-linked dividend distribution of $10.8 billion to be paid in the second quarter.Those payments will be extended for another quarter and Aramco ""expects to declare industry-leading dividends of $124.2 billion in 2024"", Tuesday's statement said.""We have delivered market-leading performance once again, with strong earnings and cash flows in the first half of the year,"" Nasser said.""Leveraging those strong earnings, we continued to deliver a base dividend that is sustainable and progressive.""Aramco reported record profits in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices soaring, allowing Saudi Arabia to record its first budget surplus in nearly a decade.But the cash cow saw its profits drop by a quarter last year because of lower oil prices and production cuts, and profits in the first quarter of this year were down 14.5 percent.In January, Aramco said it had been instructed to abandon a plan to increase production capacity to 13 million barrels per day, up from its current level of 12 million bpd.Analysts said the surprise announcement could reflect a lack of confidence in demand, although Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said it was motivated by the transition to cleaner fuels.Saudi Arabia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060, a statement that has drawn intense scepticism from environmental activists.Aramco has vowed to achieve ""operational net-zero"" carbon emissions by 2050, which does not include the emissions from customers burning its products.Nasser told reporters on Tuesday that oil and gas demand ""will not peak any time soon given the vital role that hydrocarbons continue to play in the global economy"".","Saudi oil giant Aramco on Tuesday reported net profit of $29.07 billion in the second quarter.

Japan’s equity benchmarks slid more than 20% from record highs reached last month as investor confidence crumbled from the surge in the yen, tighter monetary policy and the deteriorating economic outlook in the US.The Topix and Nikkei 225 Stock Average tumbled more than 7%, with both set for three-day declines that would be the worst since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown and push them into bear markets.Circuit breakers suspended trading of futures for both equity benchmarks.Exporters were among the heaviest drags on the Topix after the yen surged more than 2% versus the dollar on the unwinding of carry trades, while banks dropped after yields of 10-year government bonds plunged 13 basis points.“We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses,” said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.Com. “The rapidity of the move has caught me off guard; there’s a lot of panic selling now, which is what causes these non-linear reactions in asset prices to pretty straightforward fundamental dynamics.”All 33 of the Topix’s industry groups have fallen since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates on July 31, triggering a surge in the yen that has cast a pall over the earnings outlook for exporters. Yen-funded carry trades were among the most popular in emerging markets as volatility remained low and investors bet Japanese rates would remain at rock bottom.Even insurers and banks that were expected to benefit from higher rates are now some of the biggest losers since the BOJ’s hike as global equity markets slump. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shares fell as much as 21%, their biggest intraday decline on record, as yields plunged globally following poor US data.“Many people long the weak JPY trades and soft landing scenario are being forced to unwind,” said Rafael Nemet-Nejat a senior portfolio manager at Jin Investment Management Pte. “The moves are extreme especially in crowded longs even if earnings are huge beats, likely indicating that funds are either blowing up and/or experiencing a lot of pain.’Signs of weakness in the US economy sparked a slump on Wall Street on Friday and a plunge in Treasury yields. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 114,000 — one of the weakest prints since the pandemic — and job growth was revised lower in the prior two months. The unemployment rate unexpectedly climbed for a fourth month to 4.3%, triggering a closely watched recession indicator.Once the main drivers of the market’s ascent, foreign investors sold net ¥1.56 trillion ($10.7 billion) Japanese cash equities and futures combined in the week that ended July 26, according to data from Japan Exchange Group Inc.“The latest big selloff in equities, reinforced by US market’s downturn and led by technology stocks, has staged a big reset in terms of expectations for Japan equity returns for the rest of the year,” Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors Pte in Singapore, wrote in a note.“Although the market is currently in a ‘storm,’ Japanese stocks will gradually find a place to settle down along with the U.S. stock market,” she said. “Selling is being spurred by the unwinding of long positions and the involvement of trend-following hedge funds. Valuation and fundamental strategies are not applicable in some areas due to the panic selling aspect of the market.”“It is too early to tell if the summer heat will abate. But it is certainly a case of a conspiracy of ‘risk off’ triggers. The BOJ from what it did (hike and signal more) and the Fed for it has not (cut and commit to emphatic cutting) are conspiring to undermine precariously rich markets.”“There is a general pattern of a reversal from the previous year’s data and the BOJ is not likely to raise interest rates further and will likely not be possible looking at the pace of the stock prices.”“Until the bottoming out of USD/JPY is confirmed, aggressive buying of Japanese equities is likely to be restrained. At the moment, the US economic surprise index is showing a worsening trend, and investors are becoming increasingly wary of deteriorating US economic indicators.”",Japan’s equity benchmarks slid more than 20% from record highs reached last month.
