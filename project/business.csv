"ITR Filing FY 2023-24: What happens if I file income tax return after deadline? Check penalties, consequences for late filing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2023-24-what-happens-if-i-file-income-tax-return-after-deadline-check-penalties-consequences-for-late-filing/articleshow/112105116.cms,"What is the penalty for belated ITR filing?

Who is required to pay the penalty?

Income Exceeds Basic Exemption Limit: Taxpayers whose income exceeds the basic exemption limit will be penalised for late filing. The limit varies by tax regime: Rs 3 lakh under the new tax regime, irrespective of age, and different limits under the old tax regime based on age.

Section 139(1) Conditions: Even if income is below the exemption limit, taxpayers must file an ITR if they meet specific conditions in Section 139(1). These include:

Spending Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel. Paying Rs 1 lakh or more in electricity bills. Depositing Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts.

Holding Foreign Assets: Residents with foreign assets or income must file an ITR, even if their income is below the exemption limit. Late filing fees apply in these cases.

Exceptions to Penalties

How is a belated ITR filed?

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24 : For individual taxpayers whose accounts do not need auditing, the last date to file income tax returns (ITRs) for FY 2023–24 (AY 2024–25) is July 31, 2024. Missing this deadline means filing a belated ITR , which comes with penalties and interest.Under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000.For small taxpayers with a taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh, the penalty is restricted to Rs 1,000, according to an ET report. The important thing to note is that this penalty applies even if the belated ITR shows zero tax payable. Additionally, penal interest on the pending tax payable must be paid when filing a belated ITR.Certain taxpayers are required to pay penalties if they miss the ITR filing deadline and they fulfil the following conditions:Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites Individuals might need to submit an income tax return to receive a refund. However, if their taxable income is below the basic exemption limit, they will not face penalties for filing after the due date, according to income tax laws. This means the gross taxable income is considered before any eligible deductions are accounted for.The process for filing a belated ITR is the same as filing on time, with the key difference being the selection of Section 139(4) instead of 139(1) on the ITR form.","Filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000 under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Boost for security forces! Phase 3 of India-China border roads project started; to give impetus to road network in eastern Ladakh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/boost-for-security-forces-phase-3-of-india-china-border-roads-project-started-to-give-impetus-to-road-network-in-eastern-ladakh/articleshow/112100429.cms,"Roads Completed in Eastern Ladakh

Boost for security forces on India-China border! The Border Roads Organisation ( BRO ), in collaboration with the Central Public Works Department ( CPWD ) and the National Projects Construction Corporation , has commenced the third phase of the strategic India, China Border Roads ( ICBR ) project.This initiative aims to enhance the road network in eastern Ladakh, facilitating faster movement of security forces along the Line of Actual Control.While some key roads under Phase II of ICBR are still under construction, most of the phase has been completed, providing all-weather roads for improved connectivity, according to an ET report.India and China share a 3,488 km border spanning across Ladakh, Arunachal, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim. Following the 2020 standoff with the Chinese army at Galwan in eastern Ladakh, the Union government has accelerated the pace of road construction and identified new roads under the third phase of ICBR.According to official data, India has achieved a formation cutting rate of 470 km roads per year from 2017-20, a significant increase from the 230 km per year maintained in the previous decade until 2017. Under ICBR phases I and II, 73 roads were identified as strategic, with 61 of them assigned to BRO. In eastern Ladakh, five new roads have been identified under phase 3, to be constructed by BRO and CPWD. In many cases, single or double-lane roads have been upgraded to four lanes.Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiated the first blast for the Shinku La tunnel, which is expected to provide all-weather connectivity from Manali to Leh. The 4.1-kilometre tunnel is anticipated to facilitate the movement of armed forces and equipment.The Union Budget 2024 recently allocated Rs 6,500 crore to BRO for 2024-25, a 30% increase compared to the allocation for 2023-24.

Why GST rate rationalisation is both due & needed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-gst-rate-rationalisation-is-both-due-needed/articleshow/112273958.cms,"NEW DELHI: Transport minister Nitin Gadkari's letter to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on reducing the GST on health and life insurance has struck a chord with most consumers, who have to shell out 18 per cent tax to cover their medical risk when quality healthcare is something that the Centre and states should have been providing with the taxes they collect.Gadkari's suggestion for removal of the levy is unimplementable, since it will break the GST chain, denying refunds to those who sell goods or services to insurers. But many see merit in a reduction. Around six months ago, a parliamentary standing committee headed by Jayant Sinha had underlined the need to reduce GST on health and term insurance.But it isn't just insurance, govt is seen to be imposing hefty levies on consumers for several other basic services, including telecom, which too attracts 18 per cent, and 28 per cent on air conditioners and cement, which are part of the demerit goods slab. Despite cement being a key construction input, GST Council , comprising the Union and state FMs, has ignored demands for a cut.A look at your last car invoice would reveal how much tax you have paid to the Centre and states - 43 per cent GST if you bought a ""luxury vehicle"" (classified as anything which is more than 4 metres long), and a steep registration cost apart from motor insurance, where the premium only keeps rising even if you don't make a claim, and the govt then levies 18 per cent GST. For a sin goods like gutka or pan masala, the effective rate is in three digits.For several years, GST Council has been talking about reviewing rates but has refused to move even as tax collections rose month after month. There are talks of discussions starting at the next meeting, but it is unlikely that a decision will be taken for several months. For that, a panel of ministers led by Bihar deputy chief minister Samrat Chaudhary needs to work out a blueprint and that will also be linked to the item-by-item review by the GST Council secretariat to ensure that there is no revenue loss.The rationalisation of GST rates is overdue. It was to be undertaken a few years after its rollout. Initially, Covid played spoilsport. Although the finance ministry faces much of the flak for tax rates , officials said, the states were not keen as they feared a revenue loss at a time when compensation cess was to be phased out. Compensation cess was a temporary measure to ensure 14 per cent annual growth in revenue for states for five years. But it had to be extended in the wake of Covid.What added to the conundrum was higher inflation and the prospects of the 12 per cent and 18 per cent rates being merged to a median rate of 15-16 per cent. That will marginally lower rates for biscuits, ice cream, paints, refrigerators and TV sets (up to 32 inches) as well as insurance and telecom. This will also mean that bicycles, clothing and footwear that cost up to Rs 1,000 a pair, pencils, pre-packed namkeen and bhujia and several other food items will see a price increase as they will attract a higher levy than the current 12 per cent.Besides, it will also entail the GST Council to not just increase the 5 per cent rate to 7-8 per cent to not just ensure steady revenue but also narrow the difference between the new median rate and the rate for merit goods.For the govt, almost two-thirds revenue comes from the 18 per cent slab and another 15-20 per cent from goods and services that attract 28 per cent. While a third of the items, mostly household, are in the 5 per cent segment, their contribution to revenue is in single digits. There has been a suggestion to bring some tax-exempted goods under the tax net.""This is a good time to move ahead with rationalisation, which cannot be done overnight as the entire exercise will take a few months. The revenue situation has improved considerably, the economy is doing well and the inflation has eased and is likely to improve further,"" said former CBIC chairman Vivek Johri.Tax experts have been demanding the change for months. ""The process of rationalising the rates of GST and compressing the rate slabs in GST should now begin as the tax has now entered a stable phase with stable collections, increased compliance, and the growing focus on audits. Tax simplification has, in the past, led to increased collections arising from improved acceptance and the resultant growth in the number of compliant taxpayers,"" said M S Mani, partner at Deloitte India.GST Council will have to decide the road map for cess on items like tobacco products, pan masala, automobiles, coal and soft drinks. The rationalisation exercise will come with its own challenges. For instance, lowering GST on insurance to the lowest slab will mean that several inputs face higher levy and tax refunds will be an issue as refund outgo will be larger than tax collected in the final stage.","Transport minister Nitin Gadkari's letter to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on reducing the GST on health and life insurance has struck a chord with most consumers. But it isn't just insurance, govt is seen to be imposing hefty levies on consumers for several other basic services.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112273968,imgsize-614780,width-400,resizemode-4/112273968.jpg"

Irdai, in its health insurance guidelines effective April 2024, said that insurers cannot reject any claim on the grounds of pre-existence of ailment three years after the issue of policy.According to Kaul, the pricing of the product is not going to hit demand. ""Health is not a price seeker market it is a value seeker market. It is our ability to customise and bring products to market. Unlike motor insurance, where the covers are pretty much standardised, health has lot of scope for customisation,"" he said.SBI General Insurance is looking to launch a slew of new products every quarter. On the anvil is a health plan where the customer can 'drag and drop' do-it-yourself covers to the policy based on the environment. The company is also coming up with a super top-up health cover.The company's focus is now on increasing the share of its individual health insurance business. ""We have set up a strategic business unit for handling health insurance underwriting and claims in Pune and are now servicing most of our individual claims in-house,"" said Kaul. He added that SBI General has the largest network of private hospitals with which it has service level agreements.Kaul said that growth drivers will be the ability to innovate and customize products for segments based on each distribution channel. This has been made possible because of the insurers new technology platform. ""We have put in place a partner engagement too Simba which empowers the distributor to customize products on their own""","Irdai will cut the waiting period for pre-existing diseases in health insurance from four years to three, starting from April 2024.

Deposit crunch forces banks to raise rates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/deposit-crunch-forces-banks-to-raise-rates/articleshow/112273960.cms,"MUMBAI: Even as analysts are forecasting the monetary policy committee meeting this week to vote for another pause with a rate cut pushed to December, banks have been selectively raising deposits and lending rates.According to SBI chairman Dinesh Khara, markets can no longer look up to the US Federal Reserve for the direction of interest rates . ""There is a lot of decoupling that is happening.It is not that US Fed reduces rates and everybody else starts falling. We have seen the Bank of England reduce first followed by Australia. Japan has increased. All the central banks are not in sync,"" Khara said.According to Bank of India chairman Rajneesh Karnatak, the fight for resources is like to continue for a few quarters. ""We are passing on the increase in cost of deposits to borrower in the form of higher MCLR rates and we may increase the spread over the repo rate as well,"" he said.What is skewing the interest rate market is that while depositors are punishing banks for not offering enough on savings accounts, large corporates are still deciding their borrowing rates.""Corporate still holding the pricing power - the weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loan decreased by 11 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) from Jan to June 2024 even though the weighted average domestic term deposit rate increased by 3bps..

This means small businesses are bearing the brunt of the rate hikes.According to Bank of Baroda chief economist Madan Sabnavis, the earliest rate cut can happen in Dec 2024. ""RBI's MPC is likely to hold repo rate steady. The stance of the monetary policy is also expected to be retained at withdrawal of accommodation. Incidentally, the stance of the monetary policy was last changed in June. This is because RBI is unlikely to be comfortable with the elevated levels of food inflation in the recent months,"" said Sabnavis.According to Barclays regional economist Shreya Sodhani, the rate cut is likely to get pushed to 2025. ""We continue to expect the window for a rate cut to open only in Dec 2024, but see the risks that the first cut will be delayed into 2025.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime?

This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

1% TDS on property purchase over Rs 50 lakh even in case of multiple buyers or sellers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/1-tds-on-property-purchase-over-rs-50-lakh-even-in-case-of-multiple-buyers-or-sellers/articleshow/112032080.cms,"Mumbai: In case of purchase of immovable property (other than agricultural land) from a resident seller, of over Rs. 50 lakh, a TDS of 1% will apply, even if there are more than one buyers and the contribution of each buyer works out to less than Rs. 50 lakh. The same principle will also apply in case of multiple sellers, where the share of each seller is less than Rs.50 lakh, but the aggregate sale-price of the property is over Rs. 50 lakh.The 1% TDS applies on the purchase price or the stamp duty value, whichever is higher. This amendment proposed in Budget 2024 , comes into effect from October 1.The explanatory memorandum points out that, “Some taxpayers are interpreting that the consideration being paid or credited refers to each individual buyer’s payment rather than the total consideration paid for the immovable property.” The memorandum illustrates that based on this interpretation, if buyers are paying less than Rs. 50 lakh each, no tax is being deducted, even if the purchase value of the immovable property or stamp duty value exceeds Rs. 50 lakh. “This is against the intention of the legislature,” it states.“Accordingly, it is proposed to amend sub-section (2) of section 194-IA of the Act to clarify that where there is more than one transferor (seller) or transferee (buyer) in respect of an immovable property, then such consideration shall be the aggregate of the amounts paid or payable by all the transferees to the transferor or all the transferors for transfer of such immovable property.”Tax experts point out that buyers should be aware of this change as the penalties for not deducting and depositing tax at source are significant. In addition to deducting and depositing the TDS the buyers also have to issue the TDS certificates after generating the same on the I-T department’s e-portal (TRACES). This amendment will increase the compliance burden for buyers.","The 1% TDS applies on the purchase price or the stamp duty value, whichever is higher.

TN looks to women to boost growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tn-looks-to-women-to-boost-growth/articleshow/112269173.cms,"Tamil Nadu is betting big on women – both in terms of entrepreneurship as well as manufacturing muscle – to achieve its target of a $1 trillion economy. Already the state accounts for 42% of women working in factories nationally; and its percentage of women in the work force is above the national average at 35% in rural areas and 23% to 25% in urban areas.“As we aim for a $1 trillion economy, women’s contributions in startups, MSMEs and various industries are crucial,” says state industries minister T R B Rajaa. “Focused policies such as DEI payroll subsidy for new investments, training of women under Naan Mudhalvan, Pudhumai Penn scheme, free bus pass scheme, various initiatives under TN Rise and women-centric incentives at StartUp TN, are not only about gender equality but also about harnessing a powerful economic force through women’s entrepreneurship and workforce participation,” he adds.Given Tamil Nadu’s industrial diversification in recent times, this is a smart strategy. Economists agree that the state needs more than incremental investments to propel it to the $1 trillion target. That’s why TN has been diversifying aggressively towards R&D driven investments in new-age sectors. “There is an alignment of sectors we are promoting with women’s employment. Electronics, for instance, is women friendly as is non-leather footwear production. TN is a labour resource state, so women are a critical factor in our economic growth,” says industries secretary V Arun Roy.A series of coordinated initiatives point to the govt’s thinking. Recently the state govt launched TN Rise (Tamil Nadu Rural Incubator & Startup Enabler) to create more women-led startups in rural areas. An initiative of the state-owned Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Project, this platform gets money from the World Bank and will guide both women entrepreneurs and enterprise groups. “TN Rise will help entrepreneurs in the unorganised sector scale up, diversify products base, leverage govt schemes for financial support and use marketing linkages. As a precursor to the launch, we ran bootcamps in all districts asking women entrepreneurs facing challenges to come forward,” says S Divyadharshini, MD of Tamil Nadu Corporation for Development of Women. Of the nearly 3,000 who did, the scheme has identified a first batch of 200 who will be trained, guided and supported, she adds.TN Rise is the latest platform to focus on women entrepreneurship. The MSME department has been working on funding as well as skilling, and offering market linkages. “There are more than 4,400 women-led startups with at least one woman as co-founder out of the 9,000-plus startups in TN,” says Archana Patnaik, MSME secretary. Under EDII (Entrepreneurship Development and Innovation Institute, Govt of Tamil Nadu) last financial year, 7,556 women entrepreneurs were trained and this year till date about 5,550 have been trained, she says. “Apart from exclusive mentorship and acceleration support, financial incentives are also being given. For example, 25% of Tanseed seed funding is earmarked (for women) with funding raised to `15 lakh from `10 lakh,” says Patnaik. So far, 51 such startups have benefited (combined funding of `5.8 crore). Similarly, under TN SC/ST Startup Fund, nine women-led startups have benefited (with combined funding of `5.6 crore). “Tansidco has also established five industrial parks exclusively for women,” she adds.And, under Annal Ambedkar Business Champions Scheme launched a year ago for SC/ST entrepreneurs, 288 women got loans worth ₹62.87 crore with subsidy of ₹33.09 crore, says Patnaik. “This is important because it is not just credit facilitation but also training and help with marketing linkages. Similarly, under PMFME, specifically food processing, in the last three years, 2,419 women entrepreneurs have benefited,” she says.The MSME focus on women entrepreneurship is part of a broader focus on women development outlined in the Tamil Nadu State Policy for Women 2024 launched earlier this year. At a panel discussion by Women Business Council of the MCCI, Pooja Kulkarni, CEO, Tamil Nadu Infrastructure Development Board, had explained why this policy dovetails with the state’s economic targets. The Tamil Nadu govt is looking to promote industries that will help bring women from informal to formal employment and that requires improved skilling. To that end, the Skill Development Corporation is imparting skills in AI, electronics, programming, logistics, hospitality, management and health care, she had said.To this end, the govt is partnering with industry in terms of training and internships that make students job worthy. Industry, for its part, understands how important that collaboration is. With TN becoming a hub for manufacturing and tech centres, there’s a “huge appetite from the private sector”, says Dr Lakshmi Venu, director, TAFE. To really grow, industry needs “skilled talent on a large scale” so “it will be essential to bring women into this sector, both in manufacturing and entrepreneurship”. The way forward, she says, is “partnerships between education and industry. Tamil Nadu has a strong university ecosystem and both industry and university have a history of working together.” This, she says, will create a favourable “environment to attract more manufacturing-fuelled growth by attracting more women into manufacturing”.",Tamil Nadu is betting big on women to achieve its target of a $1 trillion economy.

HIGH TECH AT LOW COST,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/high-tech-at-low-cost/articleshow/112269195.cms,"This startup’s 7,500 sq ft laboratory at Nandanam in Chennai studies blood samples from across the country to monitor organ health after transplants. It uses a method called cfDNA or liquid biopsy. That is, it tests DNA fragments from dead cells through a blood draw instead of an invasive biopsy. This helps in monitoring organ rejection by the body and other issues.Acrannolife Genomics is the first Indian player to have a US patent in genomics and circulating DNA tech, according to its co-founder and chief executive Agragesh Ramani. He says the tech is 5X cheaper and offers more insights.Most cutting-edge, patented bio-tech comes from the western markets and is expensive. “Our people cannot afford such things and our clinicians cannot get access to these technologies,” says Ramani. The startup aims to make these tests affordable for the mass market. “If you solve a healthcare problem in India, you’re solving it for the world. And there lies the opportunity for startups,” says Agragesh Ramani. The global market for detection of organ health post transplant using molecular diagnostics is $5 billion and about $400 million in India, he adds.Agragesh, who has a background in business administration and has worked in tech startups such as PayTM, founded Acrannolife Genomics in 2014 with his brother Dr Avinash Ramani, a researcher in genomics, immunology and biotechnology. Their family’s history of grappling with chronic health conditions motivated the Ramani brothers to start this venture. “Our dad is a financial professional who helped two companies go public. But most of the family wealth was lost to healthcare expenses,” says Agragesh Ramani.“Our vision statement, back in 2015, spoke about mRNA vaccines, circulating DNA. Many people, including a few venture capitalists, said these are not possible from India. Today they have become commonplace.”Acrannolife Genomics managed to get more than $2 million funding from high-net worth individuals. The founders mortgaged their house and rely upon research grants, he says. After they finally got validation for their technology, the pandemic hit and halted organ transplants. Acronnolife Genomics made quick test kits for Covid briefly.The company is currently working with clinicians to adopt Trunome, its organ care technology, and hopes to cover the post-transplant care market in India. It also plans to tap the US and European markets. The aim is to reach ₹4,000 crore revenue in five to seven years, says Agragesh Ramani.Bhavesh Trivedi, company’s chief growth officer, says, “We are trying to provide affordable tech for post-care for kidney, heart, liver, pancreas, lung transplant patients.” While there is no regulatory process for the laboratories, Acronnolife Genomics has conducted studies and publications in journals as a validation for its work, he says.Ramani says the startup has had zero attrition in the past three years despite having high-value talents such as doctorates and post docs.",Acrannolife Genomics is the first Indian player to have a US patent in genomics and circulating DNA tech.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has received five bids from Chinese firms to help raise funds via Panda bonds , marking a significant step as the nation pushes ahead with plans to return to global capital markets. The finance ministry reported three offers from law firms and two from credit rating agencies , alongside interest from two Pakistani firms to act as domestic legal counsels, a Bloomberg report said.Issuing Panda bonds is a strategic move for Pakistan to diversify its funding sources and tap into new investor markets. This comes at a crucial time as Pakistan seeks to stabilize its economy and reduce its dependency on Western financial markets. ""China will support the Panda bond,"" said finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, highlighting the importance of this initiative for future fundraising efforts in Europe and the US.The IMF 's $7 billion loan deal provides crucial financial support to Pakistan, reducing external funding risks.This bailout, coupled with the positive credit rating from Fitch , bolsters Pakistan's credibility in issuing Panda bonds and reassures potential investors of the country's financial stability.Fitch has upgraded Pakistan’s credit rating to CCC+ from CCC, citing reduced risks from external funding after the country secured a new $7 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This upgrade, along with S&P's reaffirmation of Pakistan's long-term foreign currency debt rating at CCC+, underscores improved financial confidence. Issuing yuan-denominated debt is part of Pakistan’s broader strategy to manage its fiscal deficit and improve its financial standing.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb emphasized the significance of this move in March, saying that selling Panda bonds will allow Pakistan to ""diversify its funding sources and reach investors in a new market."" The positive feedback from rating agencies has emboldened the government to look ahead to future fundraising globally. “Ultimately we’ll have to get to the euro bonds and we’ll have to get back to the US market,” Aurangzeb said in a video message on Monday.The issuance of Panda bonds by Pakistan not only secures essential financial resources but also strengthens diplomatic ties with China. This move reflects a shared commitment to fostering mutual trust and cooperation. However, analysts caution about the long-term implications of increased debt, particularly regarding China's growing influence in the region and the potential risks associated with debt repayment.Panda bonds, renminbi-denominated bonds issued by non-Chinese entities in China, offer a mechanism for foreign governments and corporations to raise capital from Chinese investors.Dim Sum bonds, also renminbi-denominated, are issued in Hong Kong and cater to foreign investors.The key difference lies in their issuance location and the regulatory environment they adhere to.Pakistan's decision to issue these bonds is part of a strategic effort to stabilize its economy and leverage its relationship with China, its largest trading partner.This initiative also highlights the expanding Chinese bond market, which has grown significantly, providing ample liquidity and opportunities for foreign entities to access a vast pool of capital.The finance ministry is currently evaluating the proposals for Panda bonds before making a final selection.This initiative is expected to attract Chinese investors, leveraging the close economic ties between Pakistan and China.The proceeds from the bonds are anticipated to be used for various purposes, including social services and infrastructure development, which are critical for Pakistan’s economic recovery.(With inputs from agencies)",Pakistan has received five bids from Chinese firms to help raise funds via Panda bonds.

The one-day wipeout is his third-worst, trailing only April 4, 2019, when the Amazon co-founder’s wealth tumbled $36 billion following his divorce settlement, and April 29, 2022, when Amazon shares plunged 14%.The Nasdaq 100 Index fell 2.4%, dragging down the fortunes of other tech billionaires including Elon Musk and Oracle Corp.’s Larry Ellison, whose net worths were pared $6.6 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. Uncertainty over possible Federal Reserve rate cuts, as well as some high-profile earnings disappointments, have helped plunge the tech-heavy index into correction territory, wiping out more than $2 trillion in value in just over three weeks.Investors have also become jittery over fears that this year’s AI-fueled gains are overdone or the market is too concentrated. The decline in Amazon shares — the biggest drop since April 2022 — came after the company said on an earnings call that it planned to continue spending big on AI even at the expense of short-term profits.Technology billionaires Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin and Larry Page also each lost more than $3 billion Friday as shares of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet fell in New York trading. Tech tycoons in total saw $68 billion carved from their fortunes, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.Bezos, 60, the world’s second-richest person, has been steadily offloading Amazon shares this year. He sold stock worth about $8.5 billion over nine trading days in February. And on a day last month when Amazon hit a fresh record, he disclosed a plan to sell 25 million additional shares worth $5 billion.The additional sales would bring his total this year to roughly $13.5 billion, according to Bloomberg’s calculations. He would still hold almost 912 million shares, or about 8.8% of Amazon, once those sales are complete.His wealth also derives from space-exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post.","Bezos' net worth shrank by $15.2 billion Friday, leading a wide-ranging slump that erased $134 billion from the fortunes of the 500 richest people in the world.

Amazon reports boost in quarterly profits but misses revenue estimates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-reports-boost-in-quarterly-profits-but-misses-revenue-estimates/articleshow/112215057.cms,"Amazon's quarterly profits has surged, but the company's revenue fell short of analysts' expectations. For the April-June period, Amazon reported earnings of $13.5 billion, exceeding the $10.99 billion anticipated by industry analysts surveyed by FactSet. This marks an increase from the $6.7 billion earned during the same period last year. Earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.26, surpassing analysts' expectations of $1.03.Despite the positive earnings, investors reacted negatively to other results, leading to a more than 6% drop in Amazon shares after the closing bell.The company's revenue of $148 billion, a 10% increase, slightly missed analyst expectations of $148.67 billion. Amazon also provided a lower-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter, ending Sept. 30, ranging from $154 billion to $158.5 billion, compared to the $158.22 billion predicted by analysts.During the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon increased its spending to meet the higher demand from consumers who relied more on online shopping. However, as demand cooled and other parts of its business faced economic pressures, the company implemented aggressive cost-cutting measures, including eliminating unprofitable businesses and laying off more than 27,000 corporate employees. These cost-cutting efforts have contributed to the growth in profits.Amazon is also benefiting from the excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence, which has helped revitalize its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), after experiencing a slowdown. The company reported a 19% increase in revenue for AWS compared to the same period last year. ""We're continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,"" said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement.However, Amazon is expected to increase its spending this year to support AWS. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky stated that the company spent more than $30 billion on capital expenditures during the first half of the year, primarily to enhance infrastructure for AWS, and anticipates further increases in the second half. Like other tech companies, Amazon is investing in data centers, chips, and power infrastructure to support AI workloads.Meanwhile, Amazon's core e-commerce business experienced a more modest 5% revenue growth, excluding sales from its annual Prime Day discount event. Olsavsky attributed the slower growth in North America to customers being cautious with their spending and opting for cheaper items.The company's advertising business, primarily consisting of ad listings on its online platform, saw a 20% jump in sales. Amazon recently began placing ads on movies and TV shows on its Prime Video service to generate additional revenue. Prime Video also secured an 11-year media rights deal with the National Basketball Association, alongside two other companies.Despite these developments, Amazon faces challenges, including a recall of more than 400,000 hazardous products sold by third-party sellers on its platform and an antitrust lawsuit alleging overcharging of sellers and stifling competition.
