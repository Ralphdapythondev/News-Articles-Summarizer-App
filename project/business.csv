India’s stock value tops $5 trillion as Modi’s win powers rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-stock-value-tops-5-trillion-as-modis-win-powers-rally/articleshow/111071763.cms,"India’s stock market value exceeded $5 trillion for the first time, with the latest boost coming from a commitment by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s new coalition for policy continuity in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.The country’s equity market has joined the ranks of the US, China, Japan and Hong Kong after topping the threshold last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It took India about six months to add the latest $1 trillion to the capitalization of companies listed on its exchanges.Indian stocks have been scaling new peaks since the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party secured sufficient support from key allies to form a coalition government , ensuring Modi’s return to power for a third straight term. The victory, alongside robust economic growth and a recent upgrade of India’s ratings outlook by S&P Global Ratings, are combining to burnish India’s appeal for global investors.The formation of the new government with most key ministers retaining their portfolios “broadly affirms policy continuity,” according to Goldman Sachs strategist Sunil Koul. India remains a market with exceptionally stable macroeconomics and earnings growth is expected to continue, driving stocks higher, Koul said in a Bloomberg Television interview last week.A distinctive feature of gains in recent years has been the extent to which millions of young Indians have taken to equity investments. Local funds, including banks and insurers, have bought more than $26 billion in shares this year, while foreigners offloaded about $3.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The once dominant foreign institutional investors are no longer the sole drivers of the market,” according to Bino Pathiparampil, head of research at Mumbai-based Elara Capital.Still, off-shore interest have started to return following the outcome of the elections.“There appears ample money on the sidelines waiting to be deployed into India from foreign regional funds and India dedicated funds,” said Chetan Seth, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “Foreigners have not been able to get enough of India largely due to concerns around valuations and are still underweight.”India’s benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index closed at a fresh all-time high on Friday and is headed for an unprecedented ninth-straight year of gains. The shares of smaller and mid-sized companies have also been rallying and outperformed their larger peers in recent years to account for about 40% of the total market valuation.

"Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-modi-government-may-lower-personal-tax-rates-says-report-top-5-points/articleshow/111058341.cms,"Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations: The Modi government is mulling over the possibility of reducing personal tax rates for specific groups of individuals, according to two government sources who spoke to Reuters. This move has the potential to stimulate consumption in India, which is the third-largest economy in Asia.The sources, who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of budget discussions, indicated that the plan might be unveiled in July when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the first Union Budget following the Modi 3.0 government.Also Check | Income Tax Slabs FY 2024-25 Explained: New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime - What are the tax rates, slabs & surcharge rates?

Snowflake’s taking AI to where data resides: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/snowflakes-taking-ai-to-where-data-resides-ceo/articleshow/110955730.cms,"It has been about four years since Snowflake entered the Indian market. How has the journey been so far?

How has the rise of GenAI impacted cloud-based data storage and analytics service businesses?

You have just announced Snowflake Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search…

Where else do you see Gen AI having an impact?

You say that Snowflake LLM Arctic with its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture allows AI models to be built faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. How does it do this?

How do you see the adoption of Gen AI-based products in enterprises?

SAN FRANCISCO: “We receive five billion queries on our Data Cloud every day,” says Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake, the cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions. The number is significant, considering Google receives an average of 8.5 billion search requests every day. Ramaswamy was speaking at the firm’s ‘Snowflake Summit 2024’ in San Francisco earlier this week, where the company announced a slew of new technologies that “take AI to where data resides”. The company also announced a tie up with Nvidia that will allow Snowflake customers and partners to build AI-powered applications. Ramaswamy, an IIT Madras alumnus who was in Google for over 15 years and who was appointed CEO of Snowflake in Feb, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the summit. Excerpts:Snowflake operates in two buckets in India. One is with India-based customers like Swiggy, Urban Company, and Piramal Capital, so they can unlock the full value of their data. The second pertains to the trend of American companies moving their core infrastructure to India. We are investing heavily in having a presence in India, in training more people on Snowflake. Companies like Morgan Stanley, for example, have their very senior staff in India taking care of data operations using Snowflake. We have close to 500 people in our Pune centre of excellence, and a lot more expansion is to come.Generative AI is going to have an impact from bottom to top in the stack. For example, there’s a Snowflake feature that transcribes videos, and after indexing the text, you can create a chatbot based on it. And the thing that people are most excited about is that instead of getting a bunch of links, you get answers. We also help them get grounded, cited answers, so that they know where the answers are coming from. Our value prop at Snowflake is to create a single unified product, where things like AI are tightly integrated, and we see ourselves as more an AI Data Cloud.Cortex Analyst is a bit of a North Star for the business analytics area — it will let a business user talk to their data and get answers back. If a business user asks an unreasonable question, the product will say ‘no’. As soon as you give people a chatbot, they start asking ridiculous things like ‘what is my revenue going to be 15 years from now’. A piece of SQL is certainly not going to give you that information. I generally see AI as an enhancer for data access and visualisation. Cortex Analyst is all about asking natural language questions of structured data. Cortex Search is about getting documents indexed so that you can create a chatbot very easily.In cleaning data, for instance. Data has always been messy. There’s no magic wand making sure that you have clean data. For example, think about all the documents that you have consumed. Whenever you search, for example, you are going to run into outdated documents. Making sure that these are marked as outdated or updated will be an ongoing event. We see language models helping with several of these problems. Companies currently spend millions of dollars every year just on data engineering – for cleaning up data, and getting it into a good place.Just like standard AI models, MoE is a stack of parameters, one on top of each other. There are often 24 to 32 layers of neurons that are different kinds of behaviour and connections. In dense models like GPT-3, when a new token (unit of input like a word, an image, etc) comes in for training, it ends up affecting every parameter (GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters) at every layer. For instance, you take a sentence, mask a word in it, and ask the model to predict the word by feeding this sentence in. In the process, every token ends up affecting all parameters and this just makes it computationally expensive to update the model to train on a large amount of data. With MoE, you do an arbitrary subdivision of the token space and, during training, you will have portions of the neural network that get activated for different buckets of tokens (instead of having to impact all the parameters). So, you end up constructing models that are a combination of dense networks that are activated for every token, and sparse experts that are activated only partially. Now, this process can end up producing models that are almost as good as the dense models, but for a smaller amount of compute. And, you can train models faster and more efficiently.Canva, Zoom and Bayer and many others are harnessing Cortex AI to create applications and drive productivity. We have several hundred others building applications to talk to their enterprise data with natural language for business-critical decision making.","Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions.

Job Creation: Balancing Productivity and Job Creation for India's Economic Growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/balancing-productivity-and-job-creation-for-indias-economic-growth/articleshow/111178316.cms,"MUMBAI: India’s growth-centric policies, technological prowess and rising affluence places it well in its journey towards becoming one of the world’s leading economies but to leverage the opportunities that India has to offer and realise the country’s growth potential, focus on building “human capital” is essential, said Nitin Paranjpe, chairman at Hindustan Unilever in his address at the company’s 91st AGM on Friday.India, Paranjpe said, will have to strike a balance between productivity and job creation to achieve growth going forward. “In any growth model, productivity will always be a key driver but it cannot just be productivity. It will have to be productivity plus creation of jobs. That should be in a position to address the new roles that we need to create to absorb the people who are coming into the working class. The focus just doesn’t have to be on growth but the texture of growth,” Paranjpe told TOI in an interview at the HUL headquarters here.The way India would derive its growth has to be different from how countries like Japan, South Korea, or parts of Europe would get growth. “They are going to be short of people in the working class and therefore, their growth has to be only productivity-led. We need that balance,” Paranjpe said. A greater focus on sectors that have a high employment elasticity like the services and MSME sectors will be key. “Everything that govt is doing to create more jobs is really what we need,” said Paranjpe.Projections indicate that the country will need to create 90 million non-farm jobs over the next decade to both manage the migration of labour from agriculture and provide employment opportunities to the people entering the working age population. However, job creation alone will not help, the process needs to be aided by ensuring that the working age population is “employable”. This is where foundational literacy becomes imperative, said Paranjpe.“As a nation, we have to make sure that the quality of education that we impart to people delivers the outcomes that we want…. it is about building human capital which is geared to address the jobs we need to,” Paranjpe said, adding that govt and corporates will need to collaborate to address the challenges in developing human capital.“Corporates will need to play a key role — be it in ensuring reskilling and upskilling the workforce populace, creating employment, embracing diversity or supporting human development,” Paranjpe said. HUL, the chairman said, has in the last year alone invested 1,00,000 hours on training and upskilling interventions across its offices, factories and sales workforce.Paranjpe said that he is “quite optimistic” about the growth opportunities that India has for the next decade and beyond. “Much of it is going to come from consumption, new category creation…. It is going to come from premiumisation. All of these are good growth drivers for the economy at large and for companies in the FMCG space as well,” Paranjpe said.","India will have to strike a balance between productivity and job creation to achieve growth going forward.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

GST rate rationalisation after item-wise analysis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-rate-rationalisation-after-item-wise-analysis/articleshow/111178080.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rationalisation of GST rates may be some time away, but assessment has begun in the background to assess possible changes that may be required to make the indirect tax regime more balanced and avoid inverted duty structure in several segments where the duty on the final product is lower than the tax on inputs.While industry has demanded that rationalisation, which will mean reworking of rates on various goods and services and also merging the four slabs on three, govt is not going to rush into any such exercise without a detailed analysis. A group of ministers had earlier looked at the issue but a decision on it has been pending for several months.The broad assessment among industry players is that 12% and 18% slabs will be merged and a new 15-16% rate could emerge as the mid-rate, along with the 5% and 28% slabs. Given that several items will see an upward movement from the 12% slab, a political call needs to be taken. In fact, a few years ago some internal exercise had also been done in the finance ministry but Covid had upset all the calculations. Whenever the rate changes take place, which could be several months away, govt wants to avoid a situation where it is accused of being anti-consumer, while also ensuring that the exercise is revenue neutral to the extent possible.As a result, a very preliminary internal assessment is being done to see how a change in the rate of items in these segments would impact revenue flow , especially when the weighted average rate worked out to 11.6% according to an analysis done by RBI a few years ago, against the proposed revenue neutral rate of 15-15.5% when GST was launched almost seven years ago.But there is growing demand, and to an extent even realisation within a section of govt, that the rates on several items, such as insurance or telecom services should not be 18%, but lower. Or, for that matter even cement should not be in the 28% bracket, given that it is used for construction, which has been a key demand of the industry. But before item-wise rates are discussion, finance ministers from the states and the Centre need to take a call to move ahead with rationalisation.","Rationalisation of GST rates may be some time away, but assessment has begun in the background to assess possible changes. The broad assessment among industry players is that 12% and 18% slabs will be merged and a new 15-16% rate could emerge as the mid-rate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111178213,imgsize-895821,width-400,resizemode-4/111178213.jpg"

Pine Labs , a company that handles digital payments in Asia, plans to raise $1 billion by selling its shares for the first time in India, seeking a $6-billion valuation. The IPO will be a combination of new share sale and a sale by existing investors.Avanse was originally set up by promoters of home loan company DHFL and was acquired by Warburg Pincus in 2019 after the collapse of the DHFL group. In April, the company raised Rs 1,000-crore equity from Mubadala Investment and Avendus.The selling shareholders in Avanse, according to the draft prospectus, are Olive Vine Investment (Warburg), International Finance Corporation, and Kedaara Capital Growth Fund. Meanwhile, Pine Labs is considering a pre-IPO fundraising round. If Pine Labs goes ahead with this $1-billion sale, it would be the biggest first-time sale by an Indian finance and technology company since 2021. Pine Labs had earlier planned an IPO in the US and filed papers with the SEC. However, the company shifted its registration from Singapore to India. In its last funding round, Pine Labs was valued at close to $5.8 billion.Pine Labs began as a point-of-sale system for merchants but has rapidly expanded into digital payments and the buy-now-pay-later market.","Avanse Financial Services has filed a draft prospectus with Sebi for a Rs 3,500-crore IPO.

Zepto scores $665mn as funds ride Q-comm wave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/zepto-scores-665mn-as-funds-ride-q-comm-wave/articleshow/111177655.cms,"MUMBAI: Zepto has raised $665 million in fresh funding round at a valuation of $3.6 billion underlining growing investor appetite for the quick commerce segment. The investment comes less than a year after the Mumbai-based firm pocketed $235 million from investors at a valuation of $1.4 billion, joining the league of unicorn startups .The funding led by existing backers Glade Brook Capital, Nexus Venture Partners and StepStone Group also saw new investors Avenir, Lightspeed and Avra join the startup's cap table. The investment will boost the startup's balance sheet as it aims for a public listing in 2025, co-founder & CEO Aadit Palicha told TOI.""We want to have a healthy balance sheet going into the IPO. We do not have any intent to spend the capital needlessly. The ambition to go for an IPO is within 2025 but it would depend on where the capital markets are at that time,"" Palicha said.The quick commerce space has been growing in India, helped by demand from millennials and GenZs, many of whom often do not make planned purchases and end up ordering several times a month from platforms like Zepto which offer doorstep deliveries in 10-15 minutes. Zepto competes with Zomato's Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Tata's BigBasket in the market, which has quickly expanded beyond groceries. Currently, Blinkit leads the space with a 40-45%market share , analysts said.The funding for Zepto comes at a time when players like Walmart's Flipkart and Reliance's JioMart are set to enter the space, intensifying competition. The funding also indicates a revival of late-stage deals in the startup space where flow of large investments have been tepid.""We are getting this financing because we have executed quite well. We have been able to grow our sales and are quite close to overall ebitda break-even,"" Palicha said. Ebitda refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. Zepto claimed that its gross merchandise value (or the value of goods sold on its platform) stood at $1 billion in FY24.The startup is now looking to expand into about 10 cities with launches planned in Jaipur, Chandigarh, Ahmedabad and Coimbatore in about a couple of months. Besides, it will work on expanding selection of products on the platform and take its dark store count to 700 from 350 by March 2025.""About 75% of our stores are generating profits. We will keep reinvesting the profits we are making from our matured stores back into the business,"" said Palicha.","The investment comes less than a year after the Mumbai-based firm pocketed $235 million from investors at a valuation of $1.4 billion.

Water Shortage: Delhi Water Crisis : Atishi to begin indefinite hunger strike at Bhogal today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/atishi-to-sit-on-fast-for-water-from-today/articleshow/111150134.cms,"NEW DELHI: Demanding immediate release of additional water from Haryana , Delhi water minister Atishi will go on an indefinite satyagraha (hunger strike) from Friday in Jangpura’s Bhogal.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said that before beginning the fast at 12 noon, Atishi would visit Rajghat to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, whose teachings on satyagraha as a means of non-violent resistance inspired her actions.Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Atishi said Delhi was facing a water shortage of more than 100 million gallon per day (MGD) when people were troubled by heatwaves.She said Delhi’s total water supply was 1,005MGD, of which 613MGD came from Haryana. “Haryana govt has been giving only 513MGD for the past few days. Due to this, more than 28 lakh Delhiites are not getting their share of water,” Atishi claimed.In a post on X, the minister said despite all efforts, the Haryana government was not releasing the full share of Delhi's water.“As water minister, I have tried everything possible. I spoke to central govt, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Though Himachal is ready to give water, that, too, will have to come through Haryana. Haryana govt has refused to give more water to Delhi. Now I have no other option left to provide water to the people of Delhi, and from June 21, I will sit on an indefinite fast,” she added.There comes a time when there is no solution to any problem and Gandhiji has taught that to fight the battle of truth, there is no other option left except satyagraha, Atishi said.According to the water minister’s office, Delhi gets its share of the Yamuna water through a 1994 agreement among the northern states — Uttar Pradesh, HP, Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan. It added that Delhi’s population has increased almost three times since 1994, but its water share had remained constant at 1,005MGD. Delhi gets 257MGD from UP and 135MGD is extracted from ranney wells and tubewells.“Delhi has been repeatedly requesting Haryana to release the shortfall of 100 MGD on humanitarian grounds. This constitutes only 1.5% of Haryana’s water supply, but Haryana govt is unwilling to help,” Atishi said, adding that the 1994 agreement will have to be revisited in 2025.AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh called on all parties in the opposition INDIA bloc to support the party’s demand for fair water distribution to Delhi. Targeting BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and lieutenant governor VK Saxena, he asked why the people of Delhi, who had elected all seven BJP MPs, were still being deprived of their essential water needs.Meanwhile, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) reported 924 MGD water production on Thursday, a slight improvement from 916MGD on Tuesday. While DJB’s summer action plan has set a target of 1,000MGD this year, the estimated requirement of the city, as per the economic survey of Delhi, is 1,290MGD.The water treatment plants (WTPs) at Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Dwarka and Bawana are not working at optimal levels. Against a capacity of 131MGD, the Wazirabad WTP produced just 88MGD on Thursday. The plant has been facing the maximum problem due to the low supply of raw water through the Yamuna channels from Haryana and has reported the biggest drop in drinking water production. The shortfall has also impacted the distribution from other plants.Another major WTP at Chandrawal produced 86MGD against its capacity of 94MGD while the Bawana WTP reported a dip of 2MGD.The water levels at the Wazirabad pond have been continuously going down, putting pressure on the overall supply network and leading to water scarcity in several parts of the city.","Delhi water minister Atishi will go on an indefinite satyagraha (hunger strike) from Friday in Jangpura’s Bhogal.

The response from Saudi authorities has not been so positive so far.Similarly, in the case of Japan, the pitch is to corner investment from the large pension funds in the Asian giant instead of merely depending on JBIC, which finances projects with several conditions.The funding sources are in addition to traditional long-duration funds that govt has been eyeing from Canada, Australia and other parts of the world.While there are concerns around investor protection and certainty of investment, govt is seeking to address some of them through existing mechanisms, the sources said.

Green energy is another thrust for govt although there is significant private investment too that is flowing into the sector.

Trump media stock plunges 46% following his conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-media-stock-plunges-46-following-his-conviction/articleshow/111145637.cms,"Trump Media stock has experienced a significant decline, plunging 46% since former President Donald Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in his federal hush-money trial last month. The decline in the stock, which owns the Truth Social media company, has been steady but accelerated this week following the SEC's declaration of the company's S-1 filing as effective.

The stock fell by 6% on Monday, continued to decline by another 10% on Tuesday, and dropped another 10% on Thursday. The SEC's approval of the S-1 filing means more dilution is imminent for current shareholders as millions of warrants are likely to be exercised. If all warrants covered by the recently approved registration statement are exercised, it would raise approximately $247 million in cash for the company.

Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes welcomed the SEC's decision in a press release on Tuesday, stating that the cash raised from the exercise of warrants would position the company well to launch a TV streaming platform. ""With our S-1 declared effective, we're expecting to be well positioned to energetically pursue TV streaming, other enhancements to the platform, and potential mergers and acquisitions,"" Nunes said.

However, the amended S-1 filing also includes a new risk related to former President Trump's recent engagement with TikTok. The filing notes, ""If TMTG disagrees with President Donald J. Trump about the scope of his obligation to use, or first post on, Truth Social, TMTG lacks any meaningful remedy with respect to such disagreement—which could have a material adverse effect on the business and/or operations of TMTG.""

Trump has almost exclusively posted on his Truth Social media platform since he was banned from most major social media platforms following the January 6 insurrection.

Xi Jinping’s mystery plans take shape with biggest shift in years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/xi-jinpings-mystery-plans-take-shape-with-biggest-shift-in-years/articleshow/111129426.cms,"It started with a cryptic quote from President Xi Jinping buried in a 172-page book on the financial sector. Three months later, plans for potentially the biggest shift in years in how China conducts monetary policy are starting to surface.Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China , on Wednesday gave the clearest acknowledgment that the monetary authority is looking into trading government bonds in the secondary market as a way to regulate liquidity. The PBOC is studying the implementation with the finance ministry and it will be a gradual process, he said in a speech.That responds to Xi’s directive to “enrich the monetary policy toolbox” and “gradually increase government bond buying and selling in central bank open market operation” in a speech during a financial policy meeting last year, made public only in the book published in March.On top of that, Pan hinted at other changes to the interest-rate system. The bank may consider moving to using a single short-term rate to guide markets. It’s also considering narrowing the corridor within which market rates are allowed to fluctuate to signal a clearer policy target.To be sure, all these moves aim to refine the technical tools that the PBOC uses to manage interest rates and money. They won’t necessarily help answer some of the big questions that confront Chinese policymakers right now — like whether credit can prop up the economy when households and companies aren’t eager to take on more debt, or how to ease borrowing costs without weakening the yuan. Many details remain vague, along with the timeline for change.PBOC watchers see the proposals as part of a long-running effort in which the central bank ultimately seeks to guide market interest rates rather than setting them directly — and a step further away from the command economy where officials determined both the price and the quantity of credit. Pan said on Wednesday that it’s time to pay less attention to targets like the pace of loan growth because borrowing by real estate developers and local governments is in decline as part of the economy’s transition.“Moving to one short-term interest rate that is connected to the financial market as the main policy rate would be an obvious further step in the gradual reform of China’s monetary policy framework,” said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia-Pacific economist for S&P Global Ratings. “It would make the framework simpler and more transparent, and bring it closer to the ‘industry standard’ as practiced in most advanced economies.”One conclusion many analysts drew from Pan’s speech is that the PBOC is preparing to downplay what’s been one of its headline instruments: the one-year policy loans known as the medium-term lending facility. Since it was introduced a decade ago, the MLF has become a major channel for the central bank to inject money into the economy and guide market rates.But in recent months, banks’ demand for these funds has languished as it became cheaper for them to borrow from each other. The interest rate on the MLF has been held steady for 10 months, even as other borrowing costs in the economy plunged — partly because the PBOC is wary of currency depreciation.What’s more, the MLF is also only available to selected banks. By buying and selling sovereign bonds as an alternative way of managing liquidity, central bankers can influence financial conditions across a wider range of market participants. And compared with the MLF, the rate on seven-day reverse repurchases — short-term loans available to banks every day — offers more flexibility for policy fine-tuning.Pan may believe that China’s rates market is now mature enough for the central bank to stop using multiple anchors to guide it, according to Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.Financial News, a newspaper managed by the PBOC, on Thursday cited unnamed industry experts as saying that the central bank should weaken the link between MLF — which represents banks’ financing costs — and the loan prime rate, a benchmark for lending rates to the real economy. The latter is more important because actual borrowers’ costs matters more for economic growth, according to the report.Currently, the LPRs are based on the interest rates that 20 banks offer their best customers. They are quoted as a spread over the MLF rate.One likely goal is to ensure a smoother transmission mechanism from short-term interest rates to longer ones.The PBOC’s current setup of using two policy rates — the seven-day reverse repo and the MLF — reduces the signaling effect from its monetary decisions, Macquarie Group Ltd. economists led by Larry Hu argued in a report on Thursday.In addition, the current interest rate corridor constructed by the PBOC — the range within which market rates are supposed to move — is too wide, they said, leading to a highly volatile market for seven-day interbank lending by comparison with much more stable rates in the US and Europe.","The People’s Bank of China is looking into trading government bonds in the secondary market as a way to regulate liquidity.

Vaccine group Gavi seeks $11.9 billion to immunize world's poorest children,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/vaccine-group-gavi-seeks-11-9-billion-to-immunize-worlds-poorest-children/articleshow/111129507.cms,"LONDON: The global vaccine organization Gavi is likely to seek around $11.9 billion from governments and foundations on Thursday to fund immunization efforts in the world's poorest countries over five years, board documents reviewed by Reuters showed.The amount will be finalized at a meeting on Thursday in Paris, where donors will make pledges for the organization's plan for 2026-2030.A separately funded $1 billion scheme to boost vaccine production in Africa , the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator, will also launch on Thursday.Gavi helps low-income countries buy vaccines to protect against killer diseases. Around one billion children have been immunized as a result of Gavi's work since 2020.Gavi chief executive Sania Nishtar said the group aims to move more quickly and offer more vaccines. This will include expanding a malaria vaccine roll-out, which began in Cameroon this year, as well as catching up on routine programmes for diseases like measles, which were set back by the COVID-19 pandemic.The global vaccine alliance wants to reach ""the highest number of children, covering them against the widest number of diseases in the shortest possible time,"" Nishtar told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, ahead of the meeting.Nishtar said the amount in the board documents was not yet final, adding that it was a very challenging time for global health with aid budgets stretched worldwide by demands from conflicts to climate change.""Gavi has never had to make trade-offs,"" she said. ""On the one hand, there is a wide portfolio of vaccines available. On the other hand, we're looking at an environment where donors are resource constrained.""But she said she was cautiously optimistic that the organization would raise the amount needed.Gavi also plans to further expand its work in the coming years, for example by setting up an mpox vaccine stockpile. It is also likely to add a dengue vaccine to its programme as climate change puts more countries at risk of outbreaks. It will also establish a ""day zero"" $500m pandemic response fund for quick action on major outbreaks.","Gavi is likely to seek around $11.9 billion from governments and foundations on Thursday.

"Robots: Robots to babysit, cars to drive themselves",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/robots-to-babysit-cars-to-drive-themselves/articleshow/111123523.cms,"BENGALURU: You may soon be able to buy an autonomous humanoid robot that can babysit your kids after it’s done cleaning your home, all for the price of a low-end electric car, that’s the future Elon Musk painted at Tesla ’s 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas last week.Musk said Tesla’s Optimus robot, first announced in 2021, is a humanoid robot that is intended to be able to do anything you want it to do. “It can be your companion. It can be at your house; it can sort of babysit your kids and teach them. It can do factory stuff.”Musk also said that Tesla is already using Optimus robots in the production of its electric cars. “We have two Optimus robots in our Fremont factory that are doing basically…taking cells off the end of the line and placing them in a shipping container. We actually have quite a few of these cruising around our offices in Palo Alto,” he said.The billionaire did a little jig as he came on stage with many shareholders rising to their feet and shouting ‘Musk, Musk’. Every major pronouncement by him was met with loud applause, drowning out criticism by some of Musk’s huge pay package that came up for voting.Musk predicted that everyone in the world is going to want the AI-powered humanoid robots when they release, and that the demand could push Tesla’s valuation to $25 trillion. “I think we could make one for a cost, at a really high scale, of about $10,000. It’d be less expensive than a car. And I think if you sell it for $20,000 or something, this is at large-scale volume, Tesla would basically make about a trillion dollars of profit a year from that.” Though no exact release dates were given, Musk did say they plan to move into limited production by the end of next year and that thousands of these robots could be working at Tesla’s factories by then.Aside from robots, Musk was also bullish on fully unsupervised autonomous vehicles and claimed that autonomous driving technology is maturing so fast that car owners of the future may be able to send their cars out to work for them.“It’s actually a combination of Airbnb and Uber to some degree, so there’ll be some cars that Tesla owns itself, kind of like an Uber fashion, but then for the fleet that is owned by our customers, it will be like an Airbnb thing where you can add or subtract your car to the fleet whenever you want. So, in case you’re going away for a week, at just one tap on your Tesla app, your car gets added to the fleet and it just makes money for you while you’re gone,” he said.","Musk said Tesla’s Optimus robot, first announced in 2021, is a humanoid robot that is intended to be able to do anything you want it to do. “I think we could make one for a cost, at a really high scale, of about $10,000.
