MUMBAI: The Godrej family has agreed not to compete among themselves for six years except in the real estate business , following a split in the 127-year-old locks-to-land development group. After the non-compete period , they are free to venture into each other’s domain but not under the Godrej brand .Adi Godrej and his younger brother Nadir, as part of the family settlement agreement, will have exclusive rights to use the Godrej brand in FMCG (cosmetics, cleaning supplies, toiletries, foods, beverages), financial services, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and chemicals businesses.Their cousin Jamshyd and his sister Smita Crishna will have exclusive rights to use the Godrej brand in defence, consumer durables, medical devices, construction materials, interior design, electric mobility, software services and security products businesses.However, both groups can use the brand name in the real estate development & marketing business. Jamshyd and Smita have interests in real estate through the unlisted Godrej & Boyce while Adi and Nadir control the listed Godrej Properties.None of the Godrej group companies will have to pay royalty for the brand. The non-compete period came into play on April 30. According to the agreement, after the six-year period, “a family group can enter into the exclusive business of the other family group, without the use of the Godrej brand including in their corporate names”.Both the groups, however, can venture into areas where neither has a presence, using the Godrej brand with group-level differentiators, as these have been agreed upon as shared spaces for business.

When will gold prices hit Rs 2 lakh mark? Here’s what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-will-gold-prices-hit-rs-2-lakh-mark-heres-what-experts-say/articleshow/109750709.cms,"Gold Prices Outlook:

Gold prices: What should investors do?

Gold has been a cherished asset for Indian households, consistently delivering impressive returns compared to other investment options. Even as gold prices touch new highs this year, one wonders when the yellow metal will hit levels of Rs 1 lakh, or even Rs 2 lakh? What does historical data on the movement of gold suggest and what should investors do?Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015.This follows a similar pattern observed in the previous 9-year period, when the price tripled from Rs 8,250 in 2006. Going back further, it took approximately 19 years for the gold price to triple from Rs 2,570 per 10 g in 1987, preceded by tripling cycles of around 8 years and 6 years, states an ET report by Naveen Kumar.If the price continues to triple from its current level, gold could surpass the Rs 2 lakh per 10 gram mark. However, investors are keen to know how long it will take for the price to reach this milestone. Here is what experts have to say on future returns and timeline for gold to hit the Rs 2 lakh level:Gold prices are sensitive to global events, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, which can cause rapid increases in relatively short periods. In the past 5 years, factors like rupee weakness, geopolitical issues, the pandemic, and war have contributed to a 75% increase in gold prices, from Rs 40,000 to over Rs 7,00,000, in just 3.3 years. In contrast, from 2014 to 2018, gold prices only increased by 12%, from Rs 28,000 to Rs 31,250.Also Read | Important updates for NPS subscribers: New charges and security measures announced by PFRDA Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities, states, ""Historical data shows that major global changes, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, can significantly influence gold prices, leading to rapid increases within relatively short periods. The recent past of 5 years has shown rupee weakness as well as geopolitical issues and pandemic and war. All these together have given gold a spurt from Rs 40,000 to Rs 7,00,00+ — a gain of 75% in a matter of 3.3 years. In 2014, gold price was Rs 28,000 and in 2018 it was Rs 31,250, which is only 12% in a matter of 5 years.""Trivedi also suggests that gold prices could potentially reach Rs 2 lakh within the next 7-12 years, given recent trends.Some experts, like Surendra Mehta, National Secretary of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, are even more optimistic about gold prices tripling and crossing Rs 2 lakh. Mehta believes that escalating geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel after Ramzan, as well as China-Taiwan tensions, could bring uncertainty and lead to de-dollarisation. He predicts that these factors, along with heavy paper trading of gold in SGE and Comex, could cause gold prices to triple within the next 6 years.However, it's important to note that the tripling period for gold prices can vary significantly. Vikram Dhawan, Fund Manager and Head - Commodities at Nippon India Mutual Fund, points out that there has been an instance where the tripling period extended to almost 19 years. Dhawan reminds us that gold, like any other asset, is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns.He states, ""Like any other asset, gold is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns. However, as long as there is no better alternative, gold will continue to be in great demand from consumers and investors alike, hopefully rising to meet their return expectations.""Also Read | New mutual fund KYC rules: Is your KYC validated, verified, registered or on hold? Find out Gold is widely regarded as one of the most effective hedges against inflation. According to Harsh Gahlaut, Co-founder and CEO of FinEdge, ""Gold price is directly correlated to inflation. Inflation has been high across geographies and will take time to cool off. As long as inflation remains high, gold prices will continue to get support and see an upward trend in the future.""The trajectory of inflation will also play a crucial role in determining the pace at which gold prices increase. Hareesh V, Head of Commodities at Geojit Financial Services, explains, ""Inflation and gold prices often have a complex relationship. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation because its value tends to hold relatively steady or even increase during times of inflation.""In addition to inflation, various other factors also contribute to the fluctuations in gold prices. Dhawan elaborates, ""When inflation rates rise, the purchasing power of fiat currencies decreases, leading investors to turn to gold as a store of value, thus driving up its price. This relationship is complex and not always direct, as other economic factors can also impact gold prices during periods of high inflation.""The availability of gold has remained consistent, and any sudden increase in demand has the potential to drive prices higher in the short term. ""The total supply of gold is limited, which is the one reason the metal is considered a valuable asset. The supply of gold comes from two main sources — mining and recycling. The amount of new gold mined each year is relatively stable. The rest of the demand is usually met by recycling scrap gold,"" says Hareesh.The growing demand from central banks is expected to persist and may contribute to rising prices. ""There has been large-scale buying from some large central banks as they are considerably increasing their gold holdings — like Russia, China, India, etc. Since the supply of gold is limited, this increase in sovereign treasury holdings will continue to put pressure on supply and will support gold prices. We do not see the supply-side pressure easing in the near future as the risk of geopolitical conflicts does not seem to be easing,"" says Gahlaut.Also Read | Using a credit card? From usage beyond limit to overlimit fees - top queries answered based on RBI’s new FAQs While jewellery has traditionally been a significant driver of demand, it may not continue to play the same role in the future. However, the demand for bullion is anticipated to increase. ""I can see that in a country like India, gold is converting its orbit from consumption item to investment item at a much faster pace. So, sale of jewellery will keep dropping with improved sale of bullion due to financialisation of gold,"" says Mehta.The shifting dynamics of the global landscape may have a lasting effect on the trajectory of gold prices. Dhawan suggests, ""A decline in the credit rating of the US, whether actual or perceived, may propel gold into a multi-decade bull run. Re-globalisation leading to competitive currency devaluations, along with trade disputes, is conducive for gold prices. On the positive side, bigger and wealthier emerging economies that have a cultural affinity towards gold, like India, may lead to a material increase in gold consumption, underpinning the prices.""If the present situations persist or intensify, gold prices are expected to surge even higher. Gahlaut states, ""Any escalation of regional or global conflicts, outright wars breaking out, and dollar domination coming under pressure as a global currency can lead to a spike in gold prices. While returns from gold are not linear, gold will continue to play an important role as a risk reduction tool and as a hedge against inflation.""The implementation of ESG regulations could potentially cause a significant decrease in the supply of gold. Dhawan explains, ""The strict adoption of environmental, social & governance (ESG) rules worldwide is a threat to gold production. This is because gold mines are among the most expensive and most toxic places.""When considering whether to link your investment strategy to the rapid tripling of gold prices, it's essential to approach the decision with caution. ""In conclusion, the trajectory of gold prices will be shaped by a combination of economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. While predicting exact price movements is challenging, the fundamental role of gold as a safe-haven asset suggests continued potential for growth in the future,"" says Trivedi.Incorporating gold into your investment portfolio can be a wise choice for diversification purposes. ""Diversifying investments and considering different assets, including gold, can help mitigate risks associated with inflation. During deflationary phases, gold tends to perform well compared to most asset classes,"" says Dhawan.Also Read | Mutual Fund KYC issues: What problems are MF investors facing with new rules and how they can check their KYC status However, it's crucial not to base your entire gold investment strategy solely on the expectation of its tripling potential. ""While it is impossible to predict how long gold will take to triple from the current level, it is important to note that as an asset class, gold plays a critical role as a hedge against inflation, volatility, geopolitical and currency risks and, therefore, will remain an important part of asset allocation in a person's portfolio,"" says Gahlaut.Investing in gold can be beneficial at any time when you are aiming to diversify your investment portfolio. Nevertheless, as the price of gold continues to rise, there may be opportunities to purchase gold during dips in the market. ""Higher prices may eventually lead to reactions from the supply side. However, as gold is under-owned and global gold ETF holdings are at a five-year low, pullbacks may bring in dip buying from investors. Moreover, central banks continue to be net buyers,"" says Dhawan.","Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015.

Micron to export first batch of India-made semiconductor chips from Gujarat’s Sanand in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/micron-to-export-first-batch-of-india-made-semiconductor-chips-from-gujarats-sanand-in-2025/articleshow/109774137.cms,"Micron India is aiming to release the initial set of chips packaged at its Sanand facility in Gujarat by the beginning of next year. The majority of these semiconductor chips will be designated for export, the company’s India managing director Anand Ramamoorthy has said.Ramamoorthy informed ET that while the domestic demand for semiconductor chips is increasing, the total addressable market for India remains relatively small in comparison to the global demand for semiconductors.He spoke at a company event in the city where partnerships with higher education institutes were announced by the company.“No factory for India will ever be making only for India. It will be a small part, and the bulk of it will be for exports. A factory supporting India’s customers is a thing of convenience. But the factory becoming truly global in terms of turnaround time, cost structure, and quality speaks a lot more,” he said.Ramamoorthy also said that the chips to be packaged at the Sanand unit will mainly be utilized in data centers, smartphones, notebooks, internet-of-things devices, and the automotive segments.Also Read | India to allow Chinese investment? Curbs may be eased in hi-tech electronics sector According to Ramamoorthy, the demand in India will be influenced by the product offering of domestic chip foundries, including the one established by the Tata Group in partnership with Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation.Micron will consider serving all sectors. The demand-supply chain dynamics will depend on various factors like inventory, turnaround time, pricing, customers’ needs, and their inventory positions.“We have to be very agile and nimble. It is not like if we make a chip today, it is pre-decided that it will be used in a specific sector. Those specifics can be moved very quickly. That is the beauty and challenge in our business,” he said.In 2023, Micron announced its plan to establish a semiconductor chip assembly and testing facility in Sanand, Gujarat. The total investment in the plant, which was India’s first semiconductor chip packaging unit at that time, is planned to be $2.75 billion, with the company investing $825 million.Also Read | 5 lakh ‘Apployments’: Apple ecosystem to create huge number of jobs in 3 years; iPhone maker may move half its supply chain from China to India The company, headquartered in Idaho, has a global workforce of over 40,000 people, with approximately 4000 employees at its research and development centres in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Micron intends to increase the number of employees in India to 5000 and anticipates the creation of approximately 15,000 indirect jobs in the coming years.All the employees recruited by Micron India for the research and development centers in Hyderabad and Bengaluru undergo different training sessions, which also include training at its global centers in the United States, Japan, and China. Moving forward, the company is eager to uphold its reputation of recruiting recent college graduates, who constitute up to 30% of its overall workforce in research and development operations in India, as mentioned by him.“The interesting part here is that talent shortage is a global phenomenon. It is often mentioned that India faces a talent shortage. However, that is not true. This holds true for every country. Cybersecurity, semiconductors and others are niche emerging sectors that will always have a global supply shortage in terms of talent,” Ramamoorthy said.","Micron India is aiming to release the initial set of chips packaged at its Sanand facility in Gujarat by the beginning of next year.

In FY24, domestic compact car sales experienced a decline of about 4%.Maruti has instructed its part vendors to prepare for supplying a total of 2.4 million units this fiscal, which includes domestic sales, exports, light commercial vehicles, and sales to Toyota Kirloskar Motor.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107357973,imgsize-300646,width-400,resizemode-4/107357973.jpg"

RBI had, on Nov 15, 2023, directed Bajaj Finance to halt loan issuance through its 'eCOM' and 'Insta EMI Card '.RBI had imposed the restrictions due to a lack of transparency and disclosure of conditions like fees, charges, and recovery practices in a key fact statement, which is a crucial requirement for digital loans.The EMI card allows customers to shop with a flexible repayment tenure for purchases of consumer goods and electronics without an additional cost. Similarly, the eCOM product enables online purchases on platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart through loans.Bajaj Finance informed the stock exchanges that RBI, based on the remedial actions taken by the company, has lifted the restrictions with immediate effect. The company will resume sanction and disbursal of loans in the two segments.RBI's curbs had turned investors cautious as restrictions imposed on HDFC Bank in 2020 had lasted for over a year. Bajaj Finance, which had started to address some of the issues before RBI's action, had recently requested the central bank to lift the ban.Bajaj Finance had 42 lakh digitally sourced users for the EMI Card at the end of Sept 2023. RBI's embargo had resulted in the company's Q4FY24 profit before tax being hit by 4%.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for June climbed 69 cents, or 0.87%, to $79.69.Prices fell more than 3% to a seven-week low on Wednesday after the U.S.Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady and warned of stubborn inflation, which could curtail economic growth this year and limit oil demand increases.Crude was also pressured by an unexpected increase in U.S. crude inventories in data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Inventories were shown at their highest since June..""The updated inventory statistics were probably the most salient price driver over the course of yesterday's trading session,"" said PVM analyst Tamas Varga.Crude inventories rose by 7.3 million barrels to 460.9 million barrels in the week ended April 26, compared with the 1.1 million barrel draw expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.Supporting the price recovery were ceasefire talks in the Israel-Hamas war and the potential for low prices to spur U.S. government buying for strategic reserves.""As the impact of the U.S. crude stock build and the Fed signalling higher-for-longer rates is close to being fully baked in, attention will turn towards the outcome of the Gaza talks,"" said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights.In the Middle East, expectations grew that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be in sight after a renewed push led by Egypt, though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to go ahead with a long-promised assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah.""The geopolitical temperature might have dropped a notch or two, but the climate remains hot,"" Varga added.The U.S. has previously said it aims to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) after a historic sale from the emergency stockpile in 2022 and wants to buy back oil at $79 a barrel or less.""The oil market was supported by speculation that if WTI falls below $79, the U.S. will move to build up its strategic reserves,"" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, owned by Nissan Securities.","Brent crude futures for July gained 79 cents, or 0.95%, to $84.23 a barrel by 0959 GMT.
