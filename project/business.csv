"TN finance minister urges Nirmala Sitharaman to relieve state of financial stress, allocate funds for infra projects",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-finance-minister-urges-nirmala-sitharaman-to-allocate-funds-for-infra-projects/articleshow/111191864.cms,"CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu finance, human resources and electricity minister Thangam Thennarasu on Saturday urged the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to make provisions in the upcoming Union budget to sanction Rs 63,246 crore for the Phase II of the Chennai Metro Rail project, as it was originally envisaged as the central sector project.Speaking at the meeting of state finance ministers with the Union finance minister in New Delhi on Saturday, Thennarasu said the CMRL phase II has been awaiting the approval of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for the last three years.""Pending this approval, the entire expenditure is being borne by the state from its own funds. The delay in approval is making a severe impact on our state finances and has slowed the pace of implementation of this project,"" said the minister.The Union minister held the meeting to seek suggestions from the states before the budget.Thennarasu requested Sitharaman to allocate Rs 3,000 crore for the restoration of flood-affected areas in Tamil Nadu as Rs 276 crore released from the National Disaster Fund was inadequate.He highlighted how various restrictive measures by the Union govt coupled with shifting the burden of central-sponsored schemes on the states had impacted the resources of Tamil Nadu and its ability to fund its development priorities.The minister said the termination of GST compensation in 2022 had led to revenue shortfall of Rs 20,000 crore every year while the imposition of cesses and surcharges on gross tax revenue had further diverted the funds away from the states.""The percentage of cesses and surcharges has increased from 10.4% to 20.28% in 10 years. The cesses and surcharges should be merged with basic rates of taxation for the states to get their legitimate share,"" he said.The minister said the Union govt's share in centrally sponsored projects should be at least 50%.The minister said Tamil Nadu's gross state domestic product (GSDP) was always underestimated which had reduced the borrowing capacity by Rs 8,500 crore in the last four years since states' borrowing ceiling was fixed at 3% of their GSDP.Thennarasu urged the Union finance minister to exclude the loans taken by state govts for taking over losses of DISCOMS, from the calculation of fiscal deficit and borrowing ceilings of the state.""Currently, to get an additional borrowing space of 0.5% (Rs 30,000 crore), state govt should take over Rs 52,000 crore of discom's losses,"" he said.In the railway projects, the minister requested Sitharaman to sanction fourth railway line between Tambaram and Chengalpet, new lines linking Tirupattur with Hosur via Krishnagiri as well as Madurai with Tuticorin via Aruppukottai, a semi-high speed railway corridor to Chennai, Salem and Coimbatore with further extensions.The minister sought allocation of funds for an elevated road from Tambaram to Chengalpet and from Chengalpet to Tindivanam.","Tamil Nadu finance, human resources and electricity minister Thangam Thennarasu urged the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to sanction Rs 63,246 crore for the Phase II of the Chennai Metro Rail project.

New GST era set to start with end of anti-profiteering clause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-gst-era-set-to-start-with-end-of-anti-profiteering-clause/articleshow/111195828.cms,"NEW DELHI: While deciding to do away with the anti-profiteering clause , which mandates sellers to pass on benefit of tax cuts , GST Council Saturday signalled its intent to transition to the next stage with rationalisation , including a possible reduction in slabs, as well as roadmap for compensation cess on products such as cars, coal, cola and tobacco will be taken up at its next meeting scheduled for end of August.The panel of finance ministers headed by Union FM Nirmala Sitharaman decided to end the ant-profiteering provision from April, which means that from next fiscal year, sellers or service providers cannot be hauled up in case they do not pass on benefit of tax cuts to consumers. Existing cases will be handled by principal bench of GST Appellate Tribunal, an official statement said.Sitharaman also said that some of the group of ministers have been recast as 11 new finance ministers have joined the Council with the one on rationalisation, now headed by Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, been asked to make a presentation at the next meeting of the all-powerful body, which is likely to be held after a couple of months. “When GST Council meets next, GoM will make a presentation and discussion on rationalisation will start,” FM said while stating that a decision may not be taken during the meeting itself. It is unlikely that the ministers are going to rush ahead with a decision given that crucial assembly polls are due at the end of the year.At Saturday’s meeting, Karnataka sought a discussion on compensation cess that is levied on several products to cover the “revenue loss” states. While the cess was for five years, it had to be extended up to March 2026 following the outbreak of Covid-19 as state had to borrow from the market to meet the shortfall in collections. With borrowings likely to be repaid only in 2025-26, the GST Council will deliberate on the future of the levy and the sharing formula in case some amount is left in the kitty after repaying the loans.Asked about including petrol and diesel within the ambit of GST, FM said that the law has a provision for their inclusion but it was for the states to first decide on it and then fix the rate of tax. Responding to another query, revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the issue of GST exemption for fertiliser too has been referred to the group of ministers.",The panel of finance ministers headed by Union FM Nirmala Sitharaman decided to end the ant-profiteering provision from April.

"Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-modi-government-may-lower-personal-tax-rates-says-report-top-5-points/articleshow/111058341.cms,"Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations: The Modi government is mulling over the possibility of reducing personal tax rates for specific groups of individuals, according to two government sources who spoke to Reuters. This move has the potential to stimulate consumption in India, which is the third-largest economy in Asia.The sources, who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of budget discussions, indicated that the plan might be unveiled in July when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the first Union Budget following the Modi 3.0 government.Also Check | Income Tax Slabs FY 2024-25 Explained: New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime - What are the tax rates, slabs & surcharge rates?

Snowflake’s taking AI to where data resides: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/snowflakes-taking-ai-to-where-data-resides-ceo/articleshow/110955730.cms,"It has been about four years since Snowflake entered the Indian market. How has the journey been so far?

How has the rise of GenAI impacted cloud-based data storage and analytics service businesses?

You have just announced Snowflake Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search…

Where else do you see Gen AI having an impact?

You say that Snowflake LLM Arctic with its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture allows AI models to be built faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. How does it do this?

How do you see the adoption of Gen AI-based products in enterprises?

SAN FRANCISCO: “We receive five billion queries on our Data Cloud every day,” says Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake, the cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions. The number is significant, considering Google receives an average of 8.5 billion search requests every day. Ramaswamy was speaking at the firm’s ‘Snowflake Summit 2024’ in San Francisco earlier this week, where the company announced a slew of new technologies that “take AI to where data resides”. The company also announced a tie up with Nvidia that will allow Snowflake customers and partners to build AI-powered applications. Ramaswamy, an IIT Madras alumnus who was in Google for over 15 years and who was appointed CEO of Snowflake in Feb, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the summit. Excerpts:Snowflake operates in two buckets in India. One is with India-based customers like Swiggy, Urban Company, and Piramal Capital, so they can unlock the full value of their data. The second pertains to the trend of American companies moving their core infrastructure to India. We are investing heavily in having a presence in India, in training more people on Snowflake. Companies like Morgan Stanley, for example, have their very senior staff in India taking care of data operations using Snowflake. We have close to 500 people in our Pune centre of excellence, and a lot more expansion is to come.Generative AI is going to have an impact from bottom to top in the stack. For example, there’s a Snowflake feature that transcribes videos, and after indexing the text, you can create a chatbot based on it. And the thing that people are most excited about is that instead of getting a bunch of links, you get answers. We also help them get grounded, cited answers, so that they know where the answers are coming from. Our value prop at Snowflake is to create a single unified product, where things like AI are tightly integrated, and we see ourselves as more an AI Data Cloud.Cortex Analyst is a bit of a North Star for the business analytics area — it will let a business user talk to their data and get answers back. If a business user asks an unreasonable question, the product will say ‘no’. As soon as you give people a chatbot, they start asking ridiculous things like ‘what is my revenue going to be 15 years from now’. A piece of SQL is certainly not going to give you that information. I generally see AI as an enhancer for data access and visualisation. Cortex Analyst is all about asking natural language questions of structured data. Cortex Search is about getting documents indexed so that you can create a chatbot very easily.In cleaning data, for instance. Data has always been messy. There’s no magic wand making sure that you have clean data. For example, think about all the documents that you have consumed. Whenever you search, for example, you are going to run into outdated documents. Making sure that these are marked as outdated or updated will be an ongoing event. We see language models helping with several of these problems. Companies currently spend millions of dollars every year just on data engineering – for cleaning up data, and getting it into a good place.Just like standard AI models, MoE is a stack of parameters, one on top of each other. There are often 24 to 32 layers of neurons that are different kinds of behaviour and connections. In dense models like GPT-3, when a new token (unit of input like a word, an image, etc) comes in for training, it ends up affecting every parameter (GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters) at every layer. For instance, you take a sentence, mask a word in it, and ask the model to predict the word by feeding this sentence in. In the process, every token ends up affecting all parameters and this just makes it computationally expensive to update the model to train on a large amount of data. With MoE, you do an arbitrary subdivision of the token space and, during training, you will have portions of the neural network that get activated for different buckets of tokens (instead of having to impact all the parameters). So, you end up constructing models that are a combination of dense networks that are activated for every token, and sparse experts that are activated only partially. Now, this process can end up producing models that are almost as good as the dense models, but for a smaller amount of compute. And, you can train models faster and more efficiently.Canva, Zoom and Bayer and many others are harnessing Cortex AI to create applications and drive productivity. We have several hundred others building applications to talk to their enterprise data with natural language for business-critical decision making.","Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions.

Are EV loans cheaper?

Is the financing rate on offer the same if you were to buy a petrol or diesel vehicle? The answer is both yes and no.In electric passenger vehicles, the rates are competitive with ICE and sometimes lower as well. In e-two-wheelers , the rates are invariably higher depending on the brand and the credit profile of the customer.""Captive NBFCs and banks offer green loans for e-PVs which is 0.1% cheaper than ICE financing so the rates are more or less the same. In e-two wheelers, the rate differential is anything from 1-4% depending on product and brand,"" said Deloitte India partner Rajat Mahajan.Currently, loans for petrol and diesel passenger vehicles attract anything between 9.3% and 10.3% interest rates , while ICE two-wheeler rates are 16-20%. In EVs, cars and SUVs come for 8.5-9.5% while e-two-wheelers come for 18-22%.But that's not the critical part. Financiers and dealers admit, off the record, that EV financing is lower than ICE even when both are from the same automotive brand.""As EVs are an evolving segment, banks and NBFCs have been cautious while funding due to lack of understanding of how EV batteries work (working life, replacement/repairs) and are awaiting the evolution of a strong secondary/resale market,"" IndoStar Capital Finance CEO Karthikeyan Srinivasan said.That explains the difference in financing penetration between ICE and e-two-wheelers. ""Currently, petrol two-wheeler financing penetration is 80% plus,"" said Nikunj Sanghi, MD of JS Fourwheel, Hero Motocorp and M&M dealers. While, ""financing penetration of e-two wheelers have gone from 15-20% around 18 months ago to 40-45% now with 80% financing coming from banks,"" said Mahajan.EV financing has also seen rate revisions in the past one year. Public sector Indian Overseas Bank for instance has increased the rate of interest for EV four-wheelers by 25 basis points to 8.65-10.15% from 8.4-9.9% a year ago due to revision in repo-linked lending rate. However, its rate of interest on EV two-wheelers remains the same at 11%. The bank also provides 0.2% interest concession for e-four-wheelers ""to promote clean energy and environment"", said IOB MD & CEO Ajay Kumar Srivastava. L&T Finance has also hiked rates on EV financing by 1-1.5 percentage points in a year. ""Currently, it is 8.5-9.5% (flat). The range is due to the different risk profiling of clients,"" said a spokesperson.In commercial vehicles, where EV adoption is higher than PVs, there has not been much change in rates and EVs are more competitive than ICE. Reason: captive NBFCs.

This came following a net withdrawal of Rs 25,586 crore from equities in May on poll jitters and more than Rs 8,700 crore in April amid concerns over a tweak in India's tax treaty with Mauritius and a sustained rise in US bond yields.

The total outflow now stood at Rs 11,194 crore so far in 2024 (till June 21), data with the depositories showed.

The decision was, however, taken on Saturday as the Council met for the first time in eight months. Tax consultants said that several companies would be relieved as they were under the lens of tax authorities for what was a normal remuneration practice across the corporate sector .Under GST law, securities are neither considered goods, nor services. Purchase and sale of securities or shares is neither supply of goods or services and does not attract GST, an official explained. Further, companies offer ESOPs to their employees to motivate them to perform better and to retain them and are part of the remuneration in line with the terms of the contract. Again, services rendered by employees are neither classified as goods or services and do not attract GST.When the foreign holding company directly transfers shares to employees of the Indian arm, reimbursement by the domestic entity to the parent is done on a cost-to-cost basis, which is at the market value and without any commission. Since the transfer of funds to the foreign holding company is for transfer of securities, it does not attract GST.If the foreign company, however, charges an additional fee or commission then it will be treated as a supply of service and attract GST.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime.

‘Sipcot will add 30 industrial parks across state by 2030’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sipcot-will-add-30-industrial-parks-across-state-by-2030/articleshow/111211794.cms,"Tamil Nadu recorded an investment commitmentof more than Rs 6.6 lakh crore at the Global Investors Meet (GIM) early this year, and more is expected over the next few years. To accommodate industry’sneeds, the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (Sipcot) plans to double the number of industrial parks from 30 to 60 over the next six years, says its managing director K Senthil Raj in an interview to TOI. Excerpts: What is the size of Sipcot’s current land bank?We have 30 industrial parks spread over 41,000 acres where more than 3,200 industrial units operate. What are Sipcot’s expansion plans?An announcement was made in 2021 that new industrial parks would be created on an additional 45,000 acres of land. Of this, 40,000 acres have been identified and of this 4,000 acres have been acquired and handed over to various industries. The remaining 36,000 acres are under various stages of acquisition. The focus is on developing facilities in backward districts including Ariyalur and Ramanathapuram. Thirty new industrial parks will be created by 2030 across the state. What types of industrial parks are planned?These could be either large industrial parks or a standalone park for a specific industry. Of late, Sipcot is adapting to the changing manufacturing trends. Earlier, we used to form only general engineering parks, which allow companies from different sectors to operate. Now, we are looking at creating sector-specific parks, where common facilities including testing centres and cold storages can be set up by Sipcot. We have ventured into parks for electronic manufacturing clusters, food, furniture, medical devices and non-leather footwear in different parts of the state. Sipcot is exploring new sectors including seafood and space. How is Sipcot making industrial parks future ready?We are developing industrial parks that are sustainable. For instance, all the 11 parks in Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts will get treated water from the two tertiary treatment reverse osmosis (TTRO) plants in Chennai. We plan to extend this supply up to the Sipcot industrial parks at Cheyyar and Ranipet via Sriperumbudur. We are attempting to shift to renewable energy and encouraging installation of solar panels in industrial complexes. How will the new industrial parks cater to industries looking to commence operations quickly?Already, construction has started on plug-and-play facilities in Perundurai, Oragadam and Vallam Vadagal. Industries are looking at spaces where production can commence quickly. So, we have earmarked 15 acres-30 acres for such plug-and-play facilities in every Sipcot industrial park. They will have industrial sheds, power, drainage and water under the PPP model. Industries need to just install their machines to commence operations. Walk-to-work is catching on. Is Sipcot planning any living space around its industrial parks?At Vallam Vadagal near Chennai, we are constructing 13 blocks, each a 10-floor industrial housing unit, to accommodate 18,000 employees of Foxconn. Dormitories for workers, with a total of 2,000 beds, will be built at Gangaikondan, Siruseri, Cheyyar and Shoolagiri in phase I. This is the first time Sipcot is developing such facilities and they will be expanded in the future.",State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu plans to double the number of industrial parks from 30 to 60 over the next six years.

Byju's declined to comment.In a fresh order issued earlier this month, the Bengaluru bench of the NCLT had directed the startup to not proceed with the second tranche besides restricting it from using any funds that have been collected since the opening of the issue on May 13. The NCLT also directed the company to maintain status quo with regard to existing shareholders and their holding.The second tranche is part of the issue through which the cash-starved company sought to raise $200 million. With certain investors not participating during the first round, the issue was not fully subscribed and hence split into two tranches. In the second round, the unsubscribed portion was put up for existing investors to invest on a super pro rata (a provision which allows investors to buy a larger percentage of the company) basis.In their petition, a group of Byju's investors have reiterated that due to the siphoning off funds by the startup's management, the company is in ""dire straits"" and therefore, they should not be allowed to raise further money.Earlier this year, Byju's had launched its $200-million rights issue at a valuation of $225-230 million, a 99% drop from its peak valuation of $22 billion. A section of investors including Prosus, Peak XV Partners, Sofina and General Atlantic have been opposing the rights issue since the outset.In an interim order issued in late Feb, the NCLT had directed Byju's to keep the funds raised as part of the first tranche of its rights issue in a separate escrow account while also restraining the firm from withdrawing them till the disposal of the suit filed by its investors.","Troubled edtech startup Byju's has moved the Karnataka high court challenging the National Company Law Tribunal's order restraining it from going ahead with the second tranche of its $200-million rights issue.

In his address, he said, "" I have just returned after staying in Delhi. Earlier too, our leader (Chouhan) was popular as chief minister. But I don't know why it seems that he became more popular when he was not the chief minister.""""Now, when our leader has gone after a huge victory, the whole of Delhi also bows down before him today. Entire Delhi also knows him, recognises him, respects him. Not just Delhi, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari if we count the top leaders then our leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan figures in the list,"" he said.Kartikeya Singh, who is an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania in the US, expressed his gratitude to the people of the Budhni constituency for supporting his father in the elections.He further emphasized the respect his father commands in the political landscape. ""It is said that there is a woman behind every successful man. But I will say that there are people in his area behind the success of a leader along with a woman,"" he remarked.Following these statements, State Congress chief Jitu Patwari took the opportunity to critique Singh's comments.

The unusual request comes amid a recent war of words between Balyan and his arch-rival, Sardhana's former BJP MLA Sangeet Som . Recently, a letter allegedly accusing Balyan of corrupt practices was distributed to journalists during a press conference held at Som’s residence.Firmly denying the graft allegations, Balyan, in his letter to the Home Minister, said, ""In recent times, an important matter has come to light through the media. A letter, distributed to journalists on the letterhead of a former MLA from western UP, contains baseless allegations of corruption against me. I deny all the allegations and, as I have served as a minister in the last two Union governments, I believe it is my responsibility to ensure an impartial investigation. Therefore, I request the CBI or any other high-level institution to investigate these claims to uncover the truth and expose the conspirators.""When asked about his letter, which was widely circulated on social media, Balyan declined to comment.The allegations against Balyan surfaced during a press conference on June 11 at Som's house, where press notes accusing Balyan of corruption were distributed. Despite the note bearing Som's name, he distanced himself from the allegations. The press note accused Balyan of purchasing land in Australia, with his close aide Sanjeev Khardu acting as a mediator and witness in the sale deed. Additional charges regarding Balyan's business partnerships and property details were also mentioned.Commenting on the controversy, Muzaffarnagar-based political analyst Ravinder Singh said, ""The dispute between Balyan and Som arose after the 2022 UP elections. After losing the polls, Som felt that the low vote percentage of Jats was to blame, leading him to target Balyan, who is a Jat leader. This dispute has since then escalated, especially during the recent Lok Sabha elections.""Muzaffarnagar Lok Sabha constituency includes six assembly seats, including Sardhana, where Som was defeated in 2022. Multiple panchayats held by the Rajput community across Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, and Saharanpur before the Lok Sabha elections aimed to “teach BJP a lesson” and are believed to have contributed to the saffron party's dismal performance this time.A two-time MP from Muzaffarnagar, Balyan was defeated by India Bloc candidate Harendra Malik by 24,672 votes. Balyan attributed his defeat to ""the polarisation of Muslim votes, the division of Hindu votes by caste, and low voter turnout.""Without naming anyone, Balyan also blamed local BJP leaders for his defeat, saying, ""Some Jaichands and Vibhishans were successful in misleading the public. It is my fault that I could not fully explain it to the people. There might have been shortcomings in my work, but the party will soon identify these traitors.""","Sanjeev Balyan, a former Union minister in the BJP government, has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah requesting a CBI investigation into corruption allegations against him.

"Some Vietnam coffee farms thrive despite drought, but may not stop espresso price hikes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/some-vietnam-coffee-farms-thrive-despite-drought-but-may-not-stop-espresso-price-hikes/articleshow/111217393.cms,"Bitter price effect?

PLEIKU: Vietnamese coffee growers have been hit hard this year by the worst drought in nearly a decade, raising concerns of pricier espressos across the world, even as some farmers keep yields healthy with clever countermeasures.Domestic forecasts for next season's harvest in Vietnam, the world's second biggest coffee producer, remain grim.The Mercantile Exchange of Vietnam (MVX) expects a 10-16% fall in output because of the extreme heat that hit the Central Highlands coffee region between March and early May, according to deputy head Nguyen Ngoc Quynh.However, a return of rains in recent weeks has improved the outlook, boosting confidence among farmers and officials. But it remains unclear whether the improved weather will help boost output and drive down prices of robusta beans, the variety most commonly found in espressos and instant coffees, of which Vietnam is the world's top producer.""I expect the country's output to fall by 10-15%, but my farm will increase production"", said Nguyen Huu Long, who grows coffee in a 50-hectare plantation in Gia Lai, one of the top coffee-producing provinces in Vietnam.To protect his trees during the heatwave, he kept the soil around the plants moist by covering it with leaves. Contrary to the local practice of cutting trees after a few years to boost soil quality, he keeps his growing for decades. As a result, plants have deeper roots and broader access to underground water reserves.Farmers in his plantation also soften the soil around plants to improve absorption of rainwater and fertilisers, said Doan Van Thang, 39.Tran Thi Huong, a tenant farmer who works in another plantation 20 km from Pleiku, Gia Lai's capital, resorted to using more water than usual. Thanks to abundant reserves from canals built by local authorities, she could keep her plants sufficiently irrigated during the heatwave.Coffee cherries are smaller than in previous years, but she expects the overall output to be unaffected. It also helped that she timely intervened with biopesticides against bugs that were more numerous than usual because of the extreme weather.That is in line with the forecast from the United States department of agriculture (USDA) which estimates Vietnam's next harvest would be roughly steady versus the current season's output far less pessimistic than domestic projections.Whatever the impact on the harvest will be, coffee prices for drinkers around the world are likely to rise.Wholesale prices in Vietnam and London-traded robusta futures have risen to record highs earlier this year mostly after an underwhelming harvest in Vietnam and because of fears over the country's next harvest after the drought, according to multiple traders and analysts.Record wholesale prices have so far had a limited impact on consumer prices, with coffee inflation up by only 1.6% in the 27-country European Union in April, according to the latest Eurostat data, and 2.5% in robusta-loving Italy.While well below price rises from a year earlier, it was higher than 1% in the March EU reading, a sign roasters may have started to pass their higher costs on consumers.Besides, worries about Vietnam are far from over, as insufficient rains after the drought or excessive downpours before the upcoming October harvest season could further reduce output, warned a Vietnam-based trader.The high wholesale prices may also be there to stay, as robusta demand is growing globally and farmers have boosted their leverage in the current circumstances, with many having also replaced coffee plants with pungent smelling durian, a tropical fruit experiencing huge demand in China.""They have the financial ability to hoard and hold on goods, so they will not be in a hurry to sell,"" said Le Thanh Son, of Simexco, one of Vietnam's biggest coffee exporters.","Domestic forecasts for next season's harvest in Vietnam remain grim.

Pakistan: Weekly inflation continues upward trend; driven by rising vegetable prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistan-weekly-inflation-continues-upward-trend-driven-by-rising-vegetable-prices/articleshow/111182459.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Inflation based on the Sensitive Price Index ( SPI ) marked its fourth consecutive weekly increase, primarily attributed to a surge in vegetable prices , according to official data released, Dawn reported.For the week ending June 20, year-on-year SPI-based inflation escalated sharply by 23.78 per cent. The weekly comparison showed a 0.94 per cent rise.The Finance Bill 2024 proposes a range of indirect taxes that are anticipated to escalate inflation in the coming weeks. Notably, an 18 per cent sales tax is projected to impact prices of pharmaceuticals, books, stationery, and poultry products.Despite a decline in petrol prices , the impact on essential commodities is expected to be offset by rising prices of perishable vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. Moreover, the imposition of increased sales tax and customs duties on fresh vegetables and fruits imported from Iran and Afghanistan is likely to further fuel food inflation in the near term.Weekly inflation had peaked at a record 48.35 per cent year-on-year in early May 2023, later moderating to as low as 24.4 per cent by late August 2023, before surging beyond 40 per cent in the week ending November 16, 2023, according to Dawn.The weekly price movements indicated significant increases for items such as tomatoes (65.84 per cent), potatoes (5.61 per cent), onions (3.78 per cent), bananas (3.29 per cent), LPG (2.44 per cent), cigarettes (1.67 per cent), pulse moong (1.53 per cent), garlic (1.29 per cent), fresh milk (0.95 per cent), eggs (0.83 per cent), georgette (0.28 per cent), and shirting (0.17 per cent).Conversely, items that witnessed price declines over the previous week included petrol (3.76 per cent), diesel (0.84 per cent), rice basmati broken and pulse masoor (0.08 per cent each), and chicken (0.05 per cent).On an annual basis, notable price increases were recorded for Q1 gas charges (570 per cent), tomatoes (191 per cent), onions (122.66 per cent), chillies powder (54.81 per cent), garlic (40.55 percent), shirting (30.75 per cent), salt powder (29.49 per cent), gents sandal (25.01 per cent), pulse gram (22.67 per cent), pulse mash (22.60 per cent), beef (22.12 per cent), and Q1 electricity charges (21.46 per cent).In contrast, prices decreased significantly for wheat flour (32.90 per cent), chicken (20.60 per cent), 5-liter cooking oil (16.17 per cent), 2.5 kg vegetable ghee (13.39 per cent), 1 kg vegetable ghee (12.42 per cent), bananas (11.69 per cent), mustard oil (8.24 per cent), Lipton tea (2.52 per cent), and petrol (1.38 per cent).The SPI index closed at 316.88 compared to 313.93 the previous week and 256 a year ago. This index, composed of 51 items surveyed from 50 markets across 17 cities, provides a weekly snapshot of essential commodity and service prices.Data analysis indicated that prices increased for 25 items, decreased for 5 items, and remained unchanged for 21 items compared to the previous week.","For the week ending June 20, year-on-year SPI-based inflation escalated sharply by 23.78 per cent.

Wall Street week ahead: Rally in US big tech stocks may be getting stretched,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-week-ahead-rally-in-us-big-tech-stocks-may-be-getting-stretched/articleshow/111182179.cms,"A blistering rally in US big tech stocks may be due for a breather, offering hope for market segments that have been more tepid this year.Although the S&P 500 is up 14.6% this year, most of the broader index's gains have been concentrated in the information technology and communications sectors - up 28.2% and 24.3%, respectively. The rest of the market has been more subdued: the next best performing sector, utilities, is only up 9.5% year-to-date.Many investors believe the long-term case for tech stocks is solid, given their strong earnings and excitement over the revolutionary potential of artificial intelligence. But huge price gains, including Nvidia Corp 's 155% year-to-date run, have stirred worries that the tech rally might be overheated.Market laggards such as small caps and so-called value stocks such financials and industrials may be looking like bargains.""Nvidia has been a rocket ship, and when things go up this quickly you don't want to be the last one through the exit door,"" said Michael Purves, CEO of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. ""People want to be invested in this equity rally, and if they sell Nvidia the most likely places they are going to go is value and cyclical stocks .""A rotation out of big tech could allay concerns of concentration that have arisen in recent weeks, as themarket rally has once again narrowed to a handful of names. About 60% of the S&P 500's total return of more than 14% for the year has been driven by five companies whose shares have some of the heaviest weightings in the index: Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon.com , data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.Some signs of big tech exhaustion emerged in the past week. Nvidia shares are down 10% from their peak reached on Thursday, taking the chipmaker out of its short-lived position as the world's most valuable company. Nvidia is on track for a 4% decline for the week, while the S&P 500 is on track for a less than 1% gain.Closely watched economic data in the week ahead, including inflation data on Friday, could also affect investor positioning, as market participants gauge whether a nascent slowdown in inflation is continuing.Tech appears over-extended based on several barometers, Purves noted. The Relative Strength Indicator of the Mag6 Index, which measures the speed and magnitude of price changes in the stock market's six biggest stocks, is at the highest it has ever been, he said.Meanwhile, the price ratio between the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index - a proxy for the average stock - has jumped 9% since the beginning of June, he said. The S&P 500, by contrast, is up nearly 4% this month.Optimism is high among retail and institutional investors, which some view as a contrarian indicator because it means the bar for positive surprises is elevated. The AAII Sentiment Survey was steady at 44% in the week ended June 19, about 8 percentage points above its historical average. Sentiment among fund managers in the latest survey by BofA Global Research was at its highest level since late 2021, with investors trimming cash positions and increasing equity allocations.The 13% month-to-date gain in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is a sign that AI-fever might have gone too far, said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report.""In the near-term you could get a pullback in tech and semis, and a healthy rotation into other parts of the market that would keep this bull market going.""Even if a pullback does occur, there are few signs investors would leave tech and growth stocks for long. Betting against tech has been a losing proposition over the last decade, as the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced more than 400% while the Russell 1000 Value is up about 70% over the same time.The Russell Value index is up 5.6% this year. Investors have given an even chillier reception to small cap stocks , with the Russell 1000 down 0.5% year-to-date.Tech could rebound fairly quickly as investors rush to buy the dip. The Nasdaq 100 took five weeks to reach a new high after falling as much as 9% in April.""I don't get the sense that investors are looking to ring the register on this and book gains,"" said Jason Alonzo, portfolio manager at Harbor Capital Advisors. ""If anything, I'm seeing people who feel that they missed it trying to get in on this trend.""","The S&P 500 is up 14.6% this year.

The response from Saudi authorities has not been so positive so far.Similarly, in the case of Japan, the pitch is to corner investment from the large pension funds in the Asian giant instead of merely depending on JBIC, which finances projects with several conditions.The funding sources are in addition to traditional long-duration funds that govt has been eyeing from Canada, Australia and other parts of the world.While there are concerns around investor protection and certainty of investment, govt is seeking to address some of them through existing mechanisms, the sources said. Besides, some of the investors from the UK had raised environmental issues, including in road projects, which were addressed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) as ESG is part of the mandate for most assignments. Govt is looking to channelise resources from multiple sources to ensure that infrastructure construction takes place in full swing as it is seen to be crucial for economic growth .A bulk of the resources are flowing into transport - highways and railways - with even the public spending of Rs 11,11,111 crore focused on these two crucial sectors. Green energy is another thrust for govt although there is significant private investment too that is flowing into the sector. Even in the Budget, FM Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to prioritise infrastructure investment as it is seen to help generate demand for steel, cement and other inputs while creating jobs.","The finance ministry and Niti Aayog are offering a list of projects, such as a ring road around a tier II city or a large highway, to investors from other countries.
