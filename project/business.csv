Income Tax Return e-filing: Salaried individuals should wait till this date before filing ITR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/income-tax-return-e-filing-salaried-individuals-should-wait-till-this-date-before-filing-itr-heres-why/articleshow/110554238.cms,"Income Tax Return (ITR) e-filing on Income Tax Portal: The income tax return (ITR) filing process for the financial year 2023-24 (assessment year 2024-25) has commenced on the e-filing income tax portal. The commonly used ITR forms were made available on April 1 to facilitate early and convenient filing of tax returns.Although the ITR forms are accessible, it is advisable for salaried individuals to postpone filing their returns until June 15, according to an ET report by Preeti Motiani. The reason behind this recommendation is that their Annual Information Statements (AIS) and Form 26AS are typically fully updated by May 31, and salaried individuals receive their TDS certificates within 15 days from this date.While some data may start appearing in AIS and Form 26AS before May 31, the information for the last quarter of the previous financial year is usually updated by May 31.Also Read | Income Tax Rules FY 2024-25: New vs old tax regime - 6 rules salaried individuals should know Taxpayers who submit returns based on incomplete data may face penalties if their income is underreported due to missing information. Therefore, it is sensible to wait until June 15. Salaried individuals have until July 31, 2024, to file their income tax returns for the financial year 2023-24 (assessment year 2024-25).Banks and other financial institutions must submit a Statement of Financial Transactions (SFT) to the income tax department annually. SFTs provide the income tax department with information on various transactions carried out by taxpayers during the financial year.These statements encompass income from shares, mutual funds, dividends, interest from savings bank accounts, fixed deposits, public provident fund accounts, credit card bill payments, and more. The AIS, accessible to taxpayers, is updated once these institutions file their SFTs.Also Read | New Vs Old Tax Regime: How income of even Rs 10 lakh can be tax-free under old tax regime AIS provides a comprehensive record of an individual's financial transactions, regardless of whether tax was deducted or not. It includes details such as total salary income, tax deducted and deposited, and interest earned from savings bank accounts, even if no tax was deducted on the interest.When it comes to tax deducted at source (TDS) on incomes, the tax deductor, which can be companies or banks, has until May 31 to file a TDS return for the last quarter of the fiscal year. Although tax is deducted and deposited monthly, TDS returns are filed quarterly, as per income tax laws.Once the tax deductor files the TDS return, the tax deposited against the relevant PAN will be reflected in Form 26AS, which serves as a tax passbook showing the total taxes deducted/collected against a PAN. Form 26AS also includes Tax Collected at Source (TCS) deductions on foreign travel or foreign remittances.Abhishek Soni, CEO of Tax2Win.in, an income tax return filing platform, explains, ""A tax deductor is required to file TDS/TCS returns by May 31 for the tax deducted in the last quarter of a financial year (between January and March). Further, banks and other financial institutions are required to file SFT by May 31 to update the data in AIS. Hence, till TDS/TCS return and SFT is filed, the information available on the income tax portal via AIS and Form 26AS is incomplete.""Also Check | Income Tax Calculator 2024-25: Which is better old or new regime? Check salary-wise, exemption & deductions calculation Filing an income tax return using incomplete information from AIS may result in an individual receiving an income tax notice for underreporting income due to relying on this incomplete data.As per income tax regulations, a deductor must provide a TDS/TCS certificate after filing a TDS/TCS return. The deadline for issuing TDS certificates is 15 days from the date of filing the TDS return. Therefore, your employer should provide you with Form 16 (TDS certificate) no later than June 15.Additionally, if banks, mutual funds, or companies have deducted taxes during FY 2023-24 (which ended on March 31, 2024), they must issue Form 16A (TDS certificates) to individuals by this date. Although TDS returns can be filed before the deadline, and TDS certificates can be issued earlier than June 15, in most cases, the certificates are typically issued by this date.Taxpayers should verify that the tax deducted as shown in Form 16/Form 16A is consistent with the information in AIS and Form 26AS. Any discrepancies may lead to difficulties for the taxpayer.Soni states, ""The income tax department can send tax notices if the information available to them via an individual's AIS/Form 26AS does not match with what the individual has mentioned in the income tax return. The tax department will allow tax credit on what is shown in Form 26AS/AIS.""Also Read | Planning to invest in NPS? Top 5 reasons you should consider National Pension System It is important to note that Form 16 (TDS certificate) simplifies the process of filing tax returns for salaried individuals. The TDS certificate consists of two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A displays the taxes deducted during the financial year, while Part B shows the total salary income paid by an employer and the tax deducted from this salary. Any deductions claimed by employees (under either the old or new tax regime) will also be reflected in Form 16.Filing an incorrect income in your Income Tax Return can lead to serious consequences. The assessing officer may classify this as either misreporting or under-reporting of income, resulting in penalties ranging from 50% to 200% of the tax payable on the under-reported amount. These penalties are imposed under Section 270A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.Also Check | SCSS Calculator: Earn Over Rs 10 Lakh Interest Income From Senior Citizen Savings Scheme; Interest Rate To Tax Benefits - Top 10 Facts According to Soni, ""If the income is declared less than actual due to misreporting of income, then the penalty will be 200% of the tax payable on such misreported income. However, if the income is under-reported due to any other reason (such as failure to report income in the ITR), then the penalty will be 50% of tax payable on the under-reported income.""Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the income reported in the ITR is accurate. If an individual discovers that they have filed their ITR based on incorrect income information, they have the option to file a revised ITR by December 31, 2024. Nevertheless, it is always advisable to file the original ITR using accurate and complete income information.In cases where no TDS has been deducted from your income, no TCS has been collected from you, and you have complete information about your total income earned from various sources during the financial year 2023-24 (assessment year 2024-25), you may proceed with filing your ITR without waiting until June 15.","The income tax return (ITR) filing process for the financial year 2023-24 (assessment year 2024-25) has commenced on the e-filing income tax portal.

Indian pharma companies are poised to benefit from sustained revenue improvement in FY25 in the US market, with limited price erosion and opportunities to capture market share amidst drug shortages, according to India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).

India GDP power-surge: FY24 growth beats expectations at 8.2%! Top 10 takeaways from Q4 GDP data

India's economy grew at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.8% in Q1 FY24, driven by robust manufacturing growth. FY24 GDP estimated at 8.2%. Economists project FY25 real GDP growth at 7-7.5%. S&P upgrades India's credit rating outlook to positive.

NEW DELHI: Government expects a good monsoon to spur farm sector activity and help sustain the growth momentum, while projecting a GDP expansion of around 7% during current financial year.Government’s estimate, which is in line with RBI’s projection, is based on an assessment that domestic economic activity remains resilient on the back of strong investment demand and upbeat business and consumer sentiments. A sustained govt capex push and free trade agreements are expected to add thrust.“We will see faster growth in private final consumption expenditure in FY25 due to better monsoon and pick up in rural demand,” a source said, while dismissing concerns over a moderation in consumption growth to 4% last year, from 6.8% in the previous year. Sources said the moderation happened after an average growth of over 9% in the preceding two years.Most agencies are projecting 6.5-7% GDP growth for current financial year. On Friday, Moody’s Ratings projected India to grow 6.8% this year, followed by 6.5% in 2025, on the back of strong economic expansion and an expectation of policy continuity post-poll.Government expects economic expansion to stabilise around 6.5-7% potential rate of growth. “The economy is capable of sustaining the potential growth rate as long as we can keep inflation under check and prolong the financial cycle,” sources added.During a webinar, S&P Global Ratings analyst YeeFarn Phua said India’s long term growth potential could be around 8% once the impact of high infrastructure investment is realised and bottlenecks are removed.Government has, however, identified several risk factors, with geopolitical tension being a major threat to global as well as India’s growth. Divergence in monetary easing path of global central banks, which are seeking to moderate inflation, is seen to be adding to policy uncertainty. Food price challenges, accentuated by climate risk, are making the task tougher, although govt and RBI believe they have jointly delivered on these fronts by cooling down prices in domestic market.Besides, there are some worries over elevated financial market valuations, mainly in the US, which could have a dampening impact on Indian markets. Although FM Nirmala Sitharaman and CEA V Anantha Nageswaran had flagged concerns over futures & options segment in Indian markets, it is not seen as a systemic risk yet.","Government expects economic expansion to stabilise around 6.5-7% potential rate of growth.

Only in exceptional circumstances can recovery be initiated earlier. But with ""early action"" becoming a norm or sorts, leading to pressure on taxpayers, CBIC has now said that if recovery has to be initiated before three months, a principal commissioner- or commissioner-rank officer will have to order action and state specific reasons.""Such reasons could include high risk to revenue involved in waiting till the completion of the three-month period due to apprehension that the concerned taxable person may close the business operations in near future, or due to possibility of default by the taxable person due to his declining financial conditions or impending insolvency, or likely initiation of proceedings under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act,"" the instructions issued on Thursday said, while stating mechanical issuing of demand should be avoided.The order must be based on credible evidence and should be issued after considering the financial health, status of business, credibility of the taxpayer, infrastructure and should strike a balance between the interests of tax authorities and ease of doing business, it said.""Such explicit instructions from govt are quite welcome and will help minimise any unnecessary hassles that businesses have been facing regarding tax recovery.

""The listing of Zomato has demonstrated that the Indian stock market rewards new-age, internet companies with high valuations.

According to Pai, these companies are household names, and many Indian retail investors are eager to participate in their growth. Listing in the US would deny Indian investors this opportunity.Listings in India outpaced Hong Kong last year and the momentum is seen as continuing this year. Ola Electric, Swiggy, FirstCry, among other companies, are preparing for their debuts on the Indian stock market.Regulations prevent foreign-registered companies from launching IPOs in India, securing NBFC, payment licenses from RBI and exporting certain types of data (like street view, payment information) from here. Over the past few years, India has introduced new regulations to make consumer internet and e-commerce companies more accountable to local regulators. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules require ""significant social media intermediaries"" to have a resident chief compliance officer and a nodal officer in India, necessitating a physical presence and increased accountability to Indian courts and govt. Similarly, in the geospatial sector, govt has restricted the collection, processing, and storage of street view data to Indian-controlled companies. RBI has also implemented data localisation regulations to ensure that the payment data collected by payment systems remains in India.""These regulations significantly contribute to a company's decision to shift its domicile back to India, especially if a significant portion of its target consumers are in India. Investors also want to secure their interests in the intellectual property and data collected by these ventures,"" said Aasish Somasi, associate partner at SNG Partners.Digital payments company PhonePe, owned by US retailer Walmart, re-domiciled to India from Singapore in 2022. Financial services firm Groww followed a similar approach, re-domiciling to India from the US in March 2024. Edtech firm Eruditus is preparing to shift its domicile to India from Singapore for a stock market listing.Many Indian-origin startups registered their holding companies in Singapore, the US, and Dubai for easier access to foreign capital and tax incentives. ""Foreign investors also preferred startups to be incorporated outside India due to legal comfort in contract enforcement and ease of exiting a venture,"" said Bhavin Shah, private equity leader at PwC India. Another factor that drove startups abroad was access to high-paying customers in the US and Europe, who perceive services from these regions as high quality.""For many data-driven startups catering to such customers, the US serves as a gateway to European customers.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Securing independence: Preventing fragility fractures for a healthy retirement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/securing-independence-preventing-fragility-fractures-for-a-healthy-retirement/articleshow/110624241.cms,"What to do, according to

Dr Ravi Shankar Kirubandnan,

Trauma & Orthopedician at

, Vadapalani

Have a balanced healthy diet, rich in calcium

Reduce weight to the appropriate BMI

Expose your body to the sun daily for at least 10 mins

STAY active DAILY – minimal walking, stretching exercises, yoga, swimming

Avoid prolonged standing/sitting and climbing stairs – break the rest cycle with 5 min moving around the house every 60 minutes. This keeps the joints lubricated, and muscles active, prevents – clots in the blood vessels DVT (deep venous thrombosis), and helps joint arthritis from worsening.

Check your BMD (bone mineral density) and calcium levels, having a negative BMD indicates your bones are weaker and more prone to bending of legs, pain in the muscles and joints and ultimately fractures of hips.

We must be aware that fragility hip fractures is very common occurrence after a simple fall within the house. This event will almost always require a surgical procedure to regain mobility with the help of orthogeriatric team support.

Falls prevention is the key: Keeping the floors dry to avoid slippage, wearing rubber footwear, avoiding walking and toileting at night, having a stick, and eyeglasses nearby for assistance, and installing railings and supports in the walls can help the elderly grab with confidence while moving around in the house.

Yearly check-ups and ortho consultations will guide you to stay pain-free and focus on independent mobility.

As we reach the age of 60, we aim to have a retired, healthy, and independent life. On the contrary, our current ortho-geriatric population is entangled with multiple medical and surgical problems like – osteoporosis, arthritis of joints, and fractures of hips and vertebrae (spine) which progressively lead to poor mobility and loss of independence The traumatic experience of corona disease has demonstrated to the world how important is to have a healthy lung, controlled diabetes helps us to survive the illness. Similarly having healthy bones and mobile joints is the only way to prevent these catastrophic hip fractures and arthritis of knee, spine, and hip joints.Ironically females are affected more than men because, females undergo multiple phases of hormone changes in their lives like puberty, childbirth, and menopause, which will lead to earlier accelerated reduction in BMR(bone marrow density) than the males at around the age of 45 years. Generally, females are at risk due to reduced physical activity, less exposure to the sun, more standing jobs as a homemaker, and poor dietary intake further puts them in danger of having fragility fractures .We should be aware that our BMD reduces gradually as age increases and the bone becomes brittle and fragile. If this bone loss is not prevented can lead to generalised body/ joint pain and catastrophic fractures even for a simple slip and fall – ultimately leading to reduced or loss of independent mobility.This simple phenomenon of reduced mobility can lead to a cycle of negative effects in the orthogeriatric population of worsening medical conditions like diabetes, cardiac problems, thyroid imbalance, and above all psychological impact of depending on others for even basic daily functionality like going to the toilet, cooking, and bathing.So how to prevent this catastrophe in later life – when you are supposed to be enjoying the retired life?Prevention is the only way.Fragility fractures particularly hips and vertebrae are life-altering events. These fractures can convert a mobile life to absolutely bedridden condition for at least 3 months. With the help of multi-disciplinary specialists like orthopedics, medical physicians, and physiotherapists, we aim to bring mobility out of the bed as early as possible. To achieve this patient physiology must cooperate.Kauvery Hospital’s ortho geriatric team at KVP helps prevent these catastrophic fragility fractures and achieve healthy bones and joints.Dr. Ravi Shankar is a distinguished senior consultant Orthopaedic surgeon with a specialisation in joint replacement and revision arthroplasty.

Adequate coal is available at thermal power plants amidst high power demand: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adequate-coal-is-available-at-thermal-power-plants-amidst-high-power-demand-government/articleshow/110615875.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of coal has confirmed that coal stocks at thermal power plants remain robust, ensuring a steady power supply across the nation. Current coal reserves at these plants exceed 45 million tonnes (MT), which is 30 per cent higher than the same period last year.These reserves are sufficient to meet the power sector's needs for the next 19 days.Meanwhile, Coal India Limited ( CIL ) reported in an exchange filing the total coal production of 64.4 million metric tonnes (MMT) for May 2024, reflecting a 7.5 per cent growth compared to the same period last year, which was 59.9 MMT.Among its subsidiaries, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL) produced the highest amount at 18.0 MMT, marking an 11.3 per cent growth.However, May's production showed a decline from April 2024, which was 78.69 MT. Despite this, the overall growth in production from the previous year remains significant.CIL's total coal offtake for May 2024 was 68.2 MMT, showing a 7.2 per cent increase compared to 63.7 MMT during the same period last year. This consistent increase in both production and offtake highlights the robust performance of the coal sector.Throughout May 2024, thermal power plants experienced an average daily depletion of just 10,000 tonnes of coal. This low rate of depletion has been attributed to efficient logistics and supply chain management.According to the press release by the Ministry of Coal, a Sub-Group mechanism, comprising representatives from the Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Railways, and power generating companies, has played a crucial role in maintaining this steady supply.Coal production has seen an impressive growth rate of over 8 per cent compared to last year. Stockpiles at mine pit-heads have surpassed 100 MT, ensuring ample supply for the power sector.The Ministry of Railways has facilitated this process by increasing the average daily availability of railway rakes by 9 per cent, which is vital for coal transportation.In addition to rail transport, coal evacuation through coastal shipping has expanded significantly. Traditionally reliant on the Paradip port, coal is now being shipped through the Dhamra and Gangavaram ports as well.This diversification results from coordinated efforts under the coal logistics policy, improving coal distribution efficiency.Infrastructural upgrades in the railway network have substantially contributed to the faster movement of coal rakes, particularly along the Son Nagar to Dadri route, read the press release.This has led to more than a 100 per cent improvement in the turnaround time of these rakes, further ensuring the steady flow of coal to power plants.The Ministry of Coal is proactively preparing for the monsoon season, a period typically associated with logistical challenges in coal transportation.By July 1, 2024, it is expected that coal reserves at thermal power plants will be maintained at over 42 MT, ensuring uninterrupted power generation during the rainy season.These measures have been crucial in meeting record-high power demands. On May 30, 2024, the country achieved a remarkable peak power demand of 250 gigawatts (GW).Additionally, Delhi recorded an all-time high power consumption of over 8,300 megawatts (MW), underscoring the effectiveness of the current coal supply and logistics strategies.In April 2024, India's coal production reached 78.69 MT, marking a growth rate of 7.41 per cent compared to the previous year. CIL alone achieved a production of 61.78 MT, reflecting a 7.31 per cent increase.Additionally, coal production by Captive/others in April 2024 stood at 11.43 MT, a robust growth of 12.99 per cent from the previous year.India's coal dispatches for April 2024 reached 85.10 MT, a 6.07 per cent increase from the previous year. CIL dispatched 64.26 MT, with a growth of 3.18 per cent, while Captive/others recorded a significant dispatch growth of 26.90 per cent.","Coal stocks at thermal power plants remain robust, ensuring a steady power supply across the nation.

Tesla shareholder sues Musk for alleged $7.5 billion insider trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-shareholder-sues-musk-for-alleged-7-5-billion-insider-trading/articleshow/110608901.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Tesla shareholder, on Thursday, sued Elon Musk engaged in insider trading by selling over $7.5 billion worth of shares in the electric car manufacturer in late 2022.Shareholder Michael Perry filed the lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, contending that Musk sold the shares before the public disclosure of potentially disappointing production and delivery figures, resulting in an estimated $3 billion in insider profits for Musk. Tesla's share price plummeted after the company's fourth-quarter numbers were made public on January 2, 2023.""Musk exploited his position at Tesla, and he breached his fiduciary duties to Tesla,"" the lawsuit said, asking the court to direct Musk to return the profits made from the trades.According to the lawsuit, Musk sold the shares on multiple occasions between November and December 2022. The complaint also accuses Tesla's directors of failing in their fiduciary duty by permitting Musk to execute the sales.As of the report, neither Musk nor Tesla had responded to requests for comment from Reuters.Perry alleges that Musk, who had previously touted strong demand for Tesla vehicles in 2022, became aware of lower-than-anticipated figures in mid-November, utilizing his access to real-time data to sell his shares before the information became public. Following the revelation of vehicle price discounts and the subsequent release of figures in January, Tesla's stock experienced a significant decline.""Had (Musk) waited to make these sales until after the release of material adverse news,... his sales would have netted him less than 55% of the amounts realized from his November and December 2022 sales,"" the lawsuit said.This legal action adds to Musk's ongoing legal challenges. Notably, Tesla shareholders are set to vote on June 13 regarding the ratification of Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge nullified in January due to improper control exerted by Musk.Additionally, Musk is under regulatory scrutiny for potential violations of federal securities laws related to his acquisition of shares in Twitter, later rebranded as X. Musk has criticized the US securities and exchange commission, accusing them of harassment through unwarranted investigations.Musk and the top US markets regulator have been in a years-long feud, dating back to 2018 when he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private.A separate shareholder lawsuit has accused Musk of defrauding X investors by delaying disclosing his stake in the social media company to amass lower-priced shares.(With inputs from the agency)","A Tesla shareholder, on Thursday, sued Elon Musk engaged in insider trading by selling over $7.5 billion worth of shares in the electric car manufacturer in late 2022.

New meme coin with 100x potential prepares for launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/new-meme-coin-with-100x-potential-prepares-for-launch-last-chance-to-invest-in-dogeverse-presale/articleshow/110597550.cms,"Dogeverse lives on 6 chains, creating unique opportunity for cross-chain applications

Dogeverse Is poised to soar to top of Meme Coin charts

Analysts line up behind Dogeverse, predict massive gains

Staking rewards limit selling pressure around launch, ensuring explosive price action

Dogeverse , a multi-chain meme coin built on 6 of the most popular blockchain networks, is readying for launch after one of the most successful presales of 2024. The project raised more than $15 million, putting it among the top 70 meme coins in the world by market cap.Investors and traders now have just 3 days remaining to buy $DOGEVERSE before it hits exchanges. The presale will officially end on Monday, June 3, at 10am UTC. However, it could close even sooner if Dogeverse sells out the remaining tokens in its $17 million hard cap.The presale will be followed by a token claim two days later, on Wednesday, June 5, at 10am UTC. $DOGEVERSE will simultaneously list on decentralized exchanges on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Base immediately following the token claim.Analysts expect that $DOGEVERSE will explode higher after trading begins. So, this is the final chance to join Dogeverse before the token shoots for the moon and potentially delivers enormous gains for everyone who bought tokens during the presale. Dogeverse is something that the meme coin world has never seen before: a token that lives not just on Ethereum or Solana, but on six of the most popular blockchains.Dogeverse is native to Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Base. Investors can buy the token on any of these networks, and it will list for trading on exchanges on all of them at the same time.That means the scale of Dogeverse’s launch will be unprecedented. The token will be instantly available to holders of all ERC-20 tokens, all BSC-20 tokens, $AVAX, $SOL, Solana meme coins, and Base meme coins.The potential audience of traders buying $DOGEVERSE and pushing up its price immediately after launch is enormous. Ethereum remains the largest and most popular blockchain network for altcoins, but Solana, Base, and Avalanche are quickly growing in importance. By launching on all of these networks, Dogeverse ensures that it will benefit from growth in any of these chains instead of potentially being stuck on a network that goes out of favor.Dogeverse also has inherent value because of what the project team calls multi-bridge utility. Dogeverse can transfer assets between major blockchains with no wrapped tokens and low gas fees.It’s an elegant solution to one of the biggest problems in Web3—how to get blockchains to work together. Dogeverse opens the door to cross-chain applications in DeFi, crypto gaming, crypto trading, metaverse development, and more. It could ultimately serve as the foundation of a more connected and accessible blockchain ecosystem.The Dogeverse presale raised $15 million, an amount that has caught many meme coin traders’ attention. This is already one of the largest meme coin ICOs of all time and puts $DOGEVERSE in the top 70 meme coins by market cap.Dogeverse could quickly move up through the charts. A recently launched dog-themed meme coin, Dog-go-to-the-Moon ($DOG), rocketed from a $10 million market cap to a $825 million market cap within just two weeks of launching. $DOG has no utility and no staking, and began with a much smaller community around it compared to $DOGEVERSE.So, Dogeverse could not only replicate Dog-go-to-the-Moon’s trajectory, but exceed it. A $1 billion market cap could potentially be in reach, putting $DOGEVERSE ahead of hugely successful Solana meme coins like Book of Meme.It also helps that 7 out of 10 meme coins in the top 10 are dog-themed. Dogeverse builds on the legacy of the ultra-successful doge meme with its chain-hopping, space-faring mascot, Cosmo.Crypto analysts have also been extremely bullish on Dogeverse, a strong signal that the token is poised for gains. One analyst, Jacob ‘Crypto’ Bury, predicted that Dogeverse could soar as much as 100x after launch.https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDT7PBzdjwAOther analysts have been more conservative, but still extremely bullish. YouTube influencer ClayBro predicted a 20x gain for $DOGEVERSE, while Myles G Investments predicted a 10x gain. Together, these three analysts boast a combined following of more than 230,000 subscribers.Dogeverse has also gotten a lot of positive coverage in crypto media. Decrypt, Bitcoin.com, The Economic Times, Crypto.news, CryptoPotato, NewsBTC, and Cryptonews.com have all covered Dogeverse’s presale. The crypto community clearly expects this launch to make a big splash.$DOGEVERSE investors who buy during the final days of the presale have the option to stake their tokens to earn 44% APY rewards. This is an opportunity to earn even more $DOGEVERSE before the token’s price begins climbing.Importantly, staking can also limit selling pressure in the immediate aftermath of the token launch.

China’s 60 million homes are hard to sell even in big cities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-60-million-homes-are-hard-to-sell-even-in-big-cities/articleshow/110580493.cms,"Top Cities

Chinese policymakers have identified reducing a glut of housing inventory as the key to ending the nation’s unprecedented property slump . It’s easy to see why.The country has the equivalent of 60 million unsold apartments, which will take more than four years to sell without government aid , according to Bloomberg Economics. The oversupply is dragging down prices at the fastest rate in a decade, giving people less reason to buy a home. The situation is worst in the capital city.To break this vicious cycle, the central bank recently announced a 300 billion yuan ($41 billion) initiative for local governments to purchase unsold homes . On the demand side, it urged cities to reduce minimum downpayments and mortgage rates to entice buyers. But it remains to be seen whether the steps will succeed in shrinking supply and ending the crisis.“Housing inventory is at its highest in China’s history,” said Jay Lau, a property analyst at S&P Global Ratings. “The latest property policies could be a temporary confidence booster.”Below are charts that show the scale of China’s problem with unsold housing.Even in China’s four tier-1 cities, where the market is relatively resilient, it will take an estimated 27 months to sell the supply of new homes as of April, according to China Real Estate Information Corp. That is the longest in at least seven years. By comparison, the US has about nine months’ supply of new homes, according to the US housing department.Three of China’s biggest cities — Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou — have rolled out major easing for homebuyers, slashing downpayment requirements and allowing room for cheaper home loans. Analysts expect Beijing, the other tier-1 city, to do the same. China’s capital has the longest monthly overhang in unsold homes, according to CRIC.There’s no guarantee that the loosening will revive home sales immediately. Homeowners even in big metropolitan areas are losing conviction in their decades-long belief that property is a reliable store of wealth, according to Yan Yuejin, director of E-house China Research & Development Institute.“There is a fundamental change in homebuyers’ confidence over the biggest cities in the long term,” Yan said. “While low-tier cities have higher outstanding housing stock, the major inventory issue lies in bigger ones.”As of April, about 80% of China’s cities had an inventory absorption pace that was worse than a “warning line” of 18 months, according to CRIC. That’s even after developers refrained from offering new projects amid lackluster sales, leading new supply to shrink 20% from March.The challenge looks just as daunting when measured by floor space. Residences completed by developers but unsold expanded to 391 million square meters nationwide as of April, the highest since 2017, official data show. Including properties that are almost finished and approved for presale, the stock is much larger at about 1.8 billion square meters, JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates. Most of the excess sits in lower-tier cities, according to S&P.China’s support package announced on May 17 is estimated to translate into 500 billion yuan of credit to help government-backed firms buy housing stock from developers. Yet that is unlikely to make a big enough dent in the supply, according to economists.Reducing the inventory to a more optimal level through government-backed acquisitions would require 5 trillion yuan, according to JPMorgan analyst Karl Chan. CGS International Securities HK’s Raymond Cheng estimates 1 trillion yuan to 2 trillion yuan of funding is needed.There are also questions over the program’s implementation as smaller trials earlier have struggled to get traction amid questions over the incentives for local governments, developers and banks.Not all of China’s developers will be able to tap the property-purchase plan to swap inventory for much-needed cash. Many have pledged a large part of their real estate held for sale to secure loans, making it tough for them to divest the assets, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kristy Hung. KWG Group Holdings Ltd., for example, pledged 92% of its properties held for sale as of the end of last year, according to BI.The rescue fund might have more meaningful impact in injecting liquidity for China Vanke Co. and Longfor Group Holdings Ltd., whose unpledged properties held for sale exceeded their short-term debt as of last year, BI estimates. They now have the option to offload slow-selling inventory to local government-backed firms at a discount to beef up cash.","China has the equivalent of 60 million unsold apartments, which will take more than four years to sell without government aid.

US GDP growth was slower last quarter on soft consumer spending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-gdp-growth-was-slower-last-quarter-on-soft-consumer-spending/articleshow/110569714.cms,"Metric Revision Initial Estimate GDP +1.3% +1.6%

Consumer spending +2.0% +2.5%

Nonresidential investment +3.3% +2.9% Residential investment +15.4% +13.9% Government spending +1.3% +1.2%

The US economy grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than initially reported, primarily reflecting softer consumer spending on goods.Gross domestic product rose 1.3% annualized in the first three months of the year, below the previous estimate of 1.6%, Bureau of Economic Analysis figures published Thursday showed. The economy’s main growth engine — personal spending — advanced 2.0%, versus the previous estimate of 2.5%.The numbers underscore a loss of momentum to start 2024 after continual upside surprises in 2023. High interest rates, waning pandemic-era savings and slower income growth are some of the key factors weighing on American households and businesses.Consumer spending was marked down as outlays for goods — particularly autos — were much softer. Federal government spending slowed, while imports picked up compared to the first estimate. Net exports subtracted from growth for the first time in two years.The downward revision to consumer spending was partially offset by stronger business and residential investment. A key measure of underlying domestic demand known as final sales to private domestic purchasers rose 2.8%, versus the initially reported 3.1% increase.Economists have pointed to the strength in this metric as reason to believe that demand is still strong, even if the headline GDP figure looks weak by comparison.“Monthly data beyond March generally point to a continued, albeit gently cooling, economic expansion . We anticipate continued GDP gains this year and a healthy advance in 2024 overall,” Nationwide Financial Markets Economist Oren Klachkin said in a note.“Some warning signs regarding the economic outlook are visible beneath the surface, but nothing that makes us pessimistic about the road ahead.”Alongside its second estimate of GDP, the BEA also publishes data on gross domestic income, its other main measure of economic activity. GDI rose 1.5% in the first quarter, according to the report. GDP measures spending on goods and services, whereas GDI measures income generated and costs incurred from producing those same goods and services.The GDI data include figures on corporate profits. In the first quarter, adjusted pre-tax profits fell 0.6%, the first decline in a year. After-tax profits as a share of gross value added for non-financial corporations, a measure of aggregate profit margins, were little changed at 15.2%.On the inflation front, the Federal Reserve’s preferred metric — the personal consumption expenditures price index — rose at a 3.3% annualized rate in the first quarter, slightly down from the initial projection. Excluding food and energy, the core PCE gauge rose 3.6%, versus 3.7% in the previous estimate.Growth in disposable personal income was marked up to 1.9% versus 1.1% initially. That may bode well for consumer spending and GDP going forward.Economists are looking ahead to the release of monthly PCE data for April, due Friday from the BEA, after reports published earlier this month showed a stalling in growth of retail sales and a slower pace of increase in consumer prices to start the second quarter.Fresh merchandise trade figures for April suggest little room for improvement in the second quarter. Separate data out Thursday showed the gap in goods trade last month widened to the largest since May 2022.Meantime, initial applications for unemployment benefits were little changed in the latest week at low levels.",Gross domestic product rose 1.3% annualized in the first three months of the year.

Saudi Arabia set to launch $10 billion Aramco offer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/saudi-arabia-set-to-launch-10-billion-aramco-offer/articleshow/110553504.cms,"Economic Transformation

Saudi IPO Boom

Saudi Arabia is preparing to formally launch a secondary offering of shares in oil giant Aramco as soon as Sunday, a deal that could raise more than $10 billion and rank among the largest of its kind in recent years.The government plans to run a book-building process to take orders until next Thursday, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The deal has attracted informal interest from investors across the Mideast and Europe totaling over $10 billion, they said.The offering will likely be priced at a further discount of as much as 10% to the trading price, though that could narrow based on investor demand, some of the people said. That’s in line with secondary sales in Saudi Telecom Co. and Tadawul Group Holding, which operates the kingdom’s stock exchange.No final decisions have been made on the offering period. Terms of the deal, including its size, could still change, the people said. Aramco didn’t immediately respond to requests to comment.The offering is set to come days after Aramco’s stock dropped to the lowest level in over a year. The deal opening will coincide with an OPEC+ gathering on Sunday to discuss oil output policy, with most market-watchers expecting the group to maintain supply curbs. That would keep Saudi Arabia’s production near the lowest level in about three yearsThe kingdom is lining up a slate of banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc for the deal, Bloomberg News has previously reported. Local firms including Saudi National Bank are likely to be involved, people familiar with the matter said, while Moelis & Co. has been acting as a financial adviser to help pick underwriters.The follow-on offer would come almost five years after Saudi Arabia raised about $30 billion in Aramco’s IPO, which was the world’s largest ever stock sale.Some of the Wall Street banks likely to be involved in the secondary offering also worked on that listing, when they were paid just over $100 million. In comparison, banks including Goldman and JPMorgan split about $60 million from helping Peloton Interactive Inc. raise $1.2 billion in 2019.Low fees are common in the Middle East. For bankers, the share sale is a trade-off between working for less and the prospect of winning more business in the largest Gulf economy that’s in the middle of a multitrillion-dollar overhaul.Proceeds from the share sale will help fund big initiatives tied to that economic transformation. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans include a push into artificial intelligence, sports, tourism as well as projects such as the $1.5 trillion development of Neom.The deal comes at a crucial time for the kingdom, which holds an 82% stake in the $1.9 trillion firm. Crude oil prices are below the levels the government needs to balance its budget and Saudi Arabia has lagged behind its target of attracting more than $100 billion a year in foreign direct investment.The government needs oil near $100 a barrel to pay for its spending plans, according to the International Monetary Fund. But global oil benchmark Brent, currently at about $85, is forecast to be near $79 in 2025 and $75 the following year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Aramco’s oil production is also restricted by OPEC+ policy as the group’s de-facto leader Saudi Arabia tries to revive the market and boost prices. The company already has large unused output capacity, and earlier this year was ordered by the government to halt a further expansion of its capability.Against that backdrop, and amid questions about climate change and the future of fossil fuels, the offer will test global investors’ appetite. Aramco’s IPO had relied mostly on local investors, who’d faced pressure from the government to back the deal after most foreign money managers balked at valuations.While the company’s massive dividend payouts may now be a draw, its shares are expensive with price-to-earnings ratios almost 50% higher than Exxon Mobil Corp. and double Shell Plc’s.Any deal will also coincide with a resurgence in the Saudi market for new share sales — investors have plowed in a combined $176 billion in orders for four deals in recent weeks. That’s higher than the orders for Aramco’s 2019 IPO and is weighing on the kingdom’s stock market.The Tadawul All Share Index is trailing its emerging-market peers for the first time since the pandemic and has fallen almost 8% from its March peak — partly because of investors who’re holding on to cash to invest in the offerings.","Saudi Arabia is preparing to formally launch a secondary offering of shares in oil giant Aramco as soon as Sunday.

Boeing reaches deadline for reporting how it will fix aircraft safety and quality problems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-reaches-deadline-for-reporting-how-it-will-fix-aircraft-safety-and-quality-problems/articleshow/110551657.cms,"Boeing is due to tell federal regulators Thursday how it plans to fix the safety and quality problems that have plagued its aircraft-manufacturing work in recent years.The Federal Aviation Administration required the company to produce a turnaround plan after one of its jetliners suffered a blowout of a fuselage panel during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.Nobody was hurt during the midair incident. Accident investigators determined that bolts that helped secure the panel to the frame of the Boeing 737 Max 9 were missing before the piece blew off. The mishhas further battered Boeing's reputation and led to multiple civil and criminal investigations.Whistleblowers have accused the company of taking shortcuts that endanger passengers, a claim that Boeing disputes. A panel convened by the FAA found shortcomings in the aircraft maker's safety culture.In late February, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to improve quality and ease the agency's safety concerns. Whitaker described the plan as the beginning, not the end, of a process to improve Boeing.""It's going to be a long road to get Boeing back to where they need to be, making safe airplanes,"" he told ABC News last week.The FAA limited Boeing production of the 737 Max, its best-selling plane, although analysts believe the number the company is making has fallen even lower than the FAA cap.Boeing's recent problems could expose it to criminal prosecution related to the deadly crashes of two Max jetliners in 2018 and 2019. The Justice Department said two weeks ago that Boeing violated terms of a 2021 settlement that allowed it to avoid prosecution for fraud. The charge was based on the company allegedly deceiving regulators about a flight-control system that was implicated in the crashes.Most of the recent problems have been related to the Max, however Boeing and key supplier Spirit AeroSystems have also struggled with manufacturing flaws on a larger plane, the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing has suffered setbacks on other programs including its Starliner space capsule, a military refueling tanker, and new Air Force One presidential jets.Boeing officials have vowed to regain the trust of regulators and the flying public. Boeing has fallen behind rival Airbus, and production setbacks have hurt the company's ability to generate cash.The company says it is reducing ""traveled work"" - assembly tasks that are done out of their proper chronological order - and keeping closer tabs on Spirit AeroSystems.","The Federal Aviation Administration required the company to produce a turnaround plan after one of its jetliners suffered a blowout of a fuselage panel during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.

The submersible is equipped with unique ""Gull Wings"" that raise its propulsion system away from the seabed, ensuring delicate marine life remains undisturbed during the descent.Connor shared his vision for the mission in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, saying, ""I want to show people that while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way."" His comments reflect a broader ambition to inspire confidence in deep-sea exploration and to highlight the potential benefits and wonders of underwater adventures.The Titan submersible tragedy that took place last June is still fresh in memory. The submersible suffered a catastrophic implosion just one hour and 45 minutes into its descent towards the Titanic, leading to the loss of all five passengers on board. The victims included UK billionaire Hamish Harding, OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, father-son pair Shahzada and Suleman Dawood, and French mariner Paul-Henry Nargeolet. This incident underscored the inherent risks associated with deep-sea exploration.Despite these risks, Connor and Lahey are committed to proving the feasibility and safety of constructing and operating a cutting-edge deep-sea exploration submarine. Their mission aims to validate that such ventures can be conducted safely and successfully, potentially setting new standards for underwater exploration and research.The Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer represents a significant technological advancement in submersible design and capabilities. If successful, this mission could pave the way for future explorations, expanding our understanding of the ocean's depths and the historical treasures it holds, such as the Titanic.","Ohio billionaire Larry Connor is planning a return expedition to the Titanic wreck, despite the tragic implosion of the Titan submersible last year. Connor, a real estate investor worth an estimated $2 billion, is partnering with Patrick Lahey, co-founder and CEO of Triton Submarines, to develop a new, state-of-the- art submarine. A spokesman for Connor confirmed to FOX Business that the duo aims to build the new submersibles and embark on their expedition in the summer of 2026.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110541683,imgsize-28648,width-400,resizemode-4/110541683.jpg"
"'Don't delay, vote today': Elon Musk entices investors with factory tours to garner support for pay package",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dont-delay-vote-today-elon-musk-entices-investors-with-factory-tours-to-garner-support-for-pay-package/articleshow/110518226.cms,"NEW DELHI: Elon Musk , in an attempt to secure votes for his $56 billion compensation package , is offering factory tours to 15 Tesla shareholders next month. This move comes after a court rejected the pay deal, and the upcoming vote is viewed as a test of Musk's leadership amidst concerns about his divided attention and controversial remarks affecting Tesla's reputation and sales.Tesla's board maintains that the compensation is essential to ensure Musk prioritises the company over his other ventures. The company is making a concerted effort to garner support for the pay package, which was originally approved in 2018 but later struck down by a judge who found that the directors involved in the negotiation appeared to be influenced by Musk.""Don't delay, vote today!"" Tesla said on Tuesday.The factory tour, led by Musk and other Tesla executives, will showcase the production lines for Cybertrucks and Model Ys in Texas on June 12, the day before the annual shareholders' meeting. Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, sees this as a ""last-ditch effort to try to charm retail investors.""Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, has advised Tesla shareholders to vote against the pay package, citing Musk's ""slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects.""Kristin Hull, founder of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, also voted against the package, emphasizing that Musk's focus is not solely on Tesla. ""His focus is clearly not just on Tesla,"" Hull said.Musk is also involved in various other ventures, including SpaceX, Twitter, and the recently launched AI company xAI.He owns around 13% of Tesla and has threatened to develop AI products outside the company if he doesn't achieve 25% voting power, which would require some of the stock options in the compensation deal.Building AI projects outside Tesla could negatively impact the company's valuation, which heavily relies on its AI capabilities in self-driving technology. Musk himself has said that without full self-driving, Tesla would be ""worth basically zero.""","Elon Musk is offering factory tours to 15 Tesla shareholders next month.
