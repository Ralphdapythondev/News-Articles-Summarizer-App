"Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What can the salaried, individual taxpayers expect?

Increase in the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime – One key change expected from the upcoming budget is the increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3,00,000 to Rs 5,00,000.

Reduction in tax rates under new tax regime – It is expected to have reduced tax rates / rejig in tax slabs under the new tax regime.

Increase in standard deduction – It is expected that the standard deduction is increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,00,000 as this limit has remained the same for the last 5 years.

Increase in deduction for interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property – It is expected that the limit for deduction towards interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property will be increased from Rs 2,00,000 to Rs 3,00,000. This may also help promote home ownership and help the government in its mission of ‘Housing for All’.

Overhaul of the capital gains tax structure – Currently there are various tax rates and holding periods for different types of instruments and also the indexation benefit differs in different situations for the purpose of computation of capital gains tax. It is expected that the government may bring about some amendments such as changes in tax rates, method of computation, period of holding etc. to have a more unified and simplified capital gains tax regime. One specific wish from a capital gains taxation standpoint would be the increase in the tax-free ceiling limit on long-term capital gains from sale of equity shares (listed) / equity oriented mutual funds from Rs 1,00,000 to Rs 2,00,000.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : The government is set to table its first full budget after elections and the wish list of taxpayers is as long as ever. This is especially so as the government did not make any key changes in the interim budget as it was a Vote on Account budget. Over the years, the government has been taking steps to make the concessional tax regime or the new tax regime more attractive for individual taxpayers.Few changes which were introduced in the last year’s budget i.e., Budget 2023 were:a) Increase in the basic exemption limit to Rs 3,00,000 from Rs 2,50,000b) Capping of maximum surcharge at 25%c) Introduction of standard deduction of Rs 50,000d) Rejig of the tax slabs.Keeping in view the government’s intent to simplify/ rationalise tax laws and enhance compliance, one may expect a few changes in the upcoming Union Budget 2024 to make the new income tax regime more attractive.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why 50% HRA exemption should include cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad At present, for individuals with gross income above Rs 15,50,000, if their total deductions and exemptions exceed Rs 3,75,000* (excluding standard deduction), the old regime is more beneficial as compared to the new one.Further, the increased cost of housing and increased awareness towards various investment instruments has led to higher claim of HRA exemptions and higher investment-based deductions (eligible under sections 80C, 80D of the Income-tax Act, interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property etc.) among salaried taxpayers and in many cases such limit of Rs 3,75,000 is easily breached resulting in taxpayers opting for existing / old tax regime.Therefore, in order to make the new tax regime more attractive and to keep up with the government’s intent of having a unified tax regime with fewer deductions / exemptions, one may expect few changes in the new regime as below:*This limit is for deductions and exemptions not available under the new tax regimeAlso Read | Income Tax expectations Budget 2024: Tax exempt limit for savings account interest to be raised to Rs 25,000?

New Tax Regime: What else can be done?

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024 : The Modi government has been looking to make the new income tax regime more attractive for the common man, middle class and salaried income taxpayers. Raising of basic exemption limit , introduction of standard deduction , and tweaking of tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime signal that the government wants taxpayers to shift to the new regime.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024 and personal tax experts are of the opinion that some changes in the new income tax regime can be expected.What can be done to make the new income tax regime more attractive than the old tax regime, especially for individuals who have done their tax planning based on the old regime? TOI Online Survey of personal tax experts finds out:Also Check | Budget 2024 Live Updates All personal tax experts unanimously agree that to make the new income tax more attractive for taxpayers, especially for middle class salaried taxpayers , the government needs to tweak it to introduce more deductions and exemptions.One common deduction that experts believe should make way into the new income tax regime, and one that makes the old tax regime more lucrative for taxpayers, is housing loan deduction.Preeti Sharma, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India LLP says that currently under the new tax regime, exemption against interest paid on home loan taken for a self-occupied or vacant property is not available. “This provision may be relooked at and be allowed under the new tax regime,” she tells TOI.Agrees Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, saying, “the deduction for interest on housing loan may be introduced to make it (new tax regime) better for those who still chose the old tax regime.”Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings Yet another recommendation is to increase the basic exemption limit and standard deduction under the new regime.“Increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 to 5 lakhs, raise the standard deduction to Rs 100,000,” Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners says that the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime may be further raised by at least Rs 50,000, which will benefit all individual taxpayers (salaried or non-salaried) opting for the new income tax regime. This will help increase purchasing power of the taxpayers which may further boost the investments.Aarti Raote, Partner, Deloitte India says raising the basic exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh and introducing the 30% tax rate to the income category of Rs 20 lakh & above as against the existing limit of Rs 15 lakh will give tax relief to all. She also believes that the standard deduction should be increased to Rs 1 lakh from the existing Rs 50,000 limit.Aarti Raote is of the view that to make the new regime more attractive the government should consider allowing deductions for employee contributions to the NPS within the new tax regime framework.Vialto’s Chander Talreja notes that the employer’s contribution to the NPS is allowed as a deduction under the new income tax regime. “For the non-salaried individuals, while this deduction is not applicable, they do not even get any deduction for their own contribution. This is a hardship and the government may consider introducing deduction in respect of an individual's contribution to NPS under section 80CCD(1B), currently capped at Rs 50,000. This will benefit salaried as well as non-salaried individuals,” he tells TOI.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Raise basic exemption limit, standard deduction and NPS benefits for taxpayers Preeti Sharma believes that in order to promote savings towards retirement, the government may consider allowing deductions available under section 80C of the Act, under the new tax regime as well.Aarti Raote says that in line with the government’s agenda of affordable housing and green energy, it is anticipated that specific deductions towards mortgage repayments on affordable housing or electric vehicles be provided under the new tax regime besides incentivizing taxpayers for installation or adoption of solar energy equipment.However, Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors notes that the government has already rationalized the slabs and the rates in its Budget 2023. “I am not expecting that something more would be done except discontinuing the old tax regime whereby by default everyone is in the new regime,” he tells TOI.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024.

Banks offer special FD rates to attract deposits: In an effort to attract retail deposits, banks have launched special schemes offering savers an additional 25-30 basis points for term deposits above current commitments for similar tenures. This move suggests that policy interest rates are likely to remain high in the near future.According to an ET report, several major banks, including SBI , Bank of Baroda , Indian Overseas Bank , Union Bank of India , and Bank of Maharashtra, have introduced deposit plans with interest rates ranging from 7.25% to 7.30% for investments spanning 399 to 444 days.Senior citizens are eligible for an extra 50 basis points on these rates.For example, SBI's Amrit Vrishti scheme provides an interest rate of 7.25% for deposits with a tenure of 444 days. Similarly, Bank of Baroda's Monsoon Dhamaka plan offers the same rate of 7.25% for deposits spanning 399 days.Indian Overseas Bank has set its interest rate at 7.30% for deposits lasting 444 days. Bank of Maharashtra, on the other hand, is offering 6.90% for deposits with a duration of 200 days and 7.10% for those extending to 400 days.Lenders are struggling to raise retail deposits and have therefore introduced limited-period schemes, according to a treasury head from a commercial bank. Bankers believe that if credit growth continues at 14-16%, they will need to offer more attractive interest rates to mobilize deposits.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2023-24: What is the penalty for late filing of income tax return? Check penalties for misreporting tax & other mistakes The decision to increase deposit rates follows a recent interaction between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and bank CEOs, where the regulator instructed banks to close the gap between deposit and credit growth. As of June 28, bank credit had risen by 14% year-on-year, while deposits had only increased by 11%.Industry experts believe that banks are offering these peak rates on shorter tenures because they anticipate the rate cycle, which was previously expected to shift in the latter half of this calendar year, will eventually start to reverse as inflation remains consistently within the central bank's legally mandated limits.Anil Gupta, senior vice president of the financial sector at ICRA Ratings, said, ""Banks are offering higher rates for less than two years tenure. So when the interest rate cycle turns, banks would not want to be stuck with high-cost liabilities.""However, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das recently indicated that rates would remain elevated for some time, saying, ""The overall economic environment globally and in India is so uncertain... I think it is too early to talk about an interest rate cut.""",Banks have launched special schemes offering savers an additional 25-30 basis points for term deposits.

How Can India Benefit From China plus one strategy?

Economic Survey 2023-24 : India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy in terms of nominal GDP, is looking to become the third largest in the coming years, and one area that India is looking to benefit is the ‘China Plus One’ strategy. But will India be able to benefit from the China Plus One strategy? And how easy will India’s journey be to ‘ Viksit Bharat ’ by 2047?According to the Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, India’s march towards being a developed country will be different from China’s - and it won’t be an easy road!“Between the last Economic survey published in January 2023 and this one, big changes are afoot in the geopolitical environment.The global backdrop for India’s march towards Viksit Bharat in 2047 could not be more different from what it was during the rise of China between 1980 and 2015,” the Economic Survey notes.Also Check | Economic Survey 2024 Live Updates: FM Sitharaman tables survey; real GDP growth seen at 6.5-7% in FY25, Indian economy resilient “Then, globalisation was at the cusp of its long expansion. Geopolitics was largely calm with the end of the Cold War, and Western powers welcomed and even encouraged the rise of China and its integration into the world economy. Concerns over climate change and global warming were not so pervasive or grave then as they are now,” the Survey notes.Also, the advent of Artificial Intelligence casts a huge pall of uncertainty as to its impact on workers across all skill levels – low, semi and high. “These will create barriers and hurdles to sustained high growth rates for India in the coming years and decades. Overcoming these requires a grand alliance of union and state governments and the private sector,” the Economic Survey says.India has the potential to gain from the 'China plus one' approach due to its vast domestic consumer base, which makes it an appealing location for businesses to establish their operations.According to the Economic Survey, India has two options to capitalize on the China plus one strategy: it can either integrate into China's supply chain or encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) from China. Between these two options, prioritizing FDI from China appears to be a more promising avenue for increasing India's exports to the United States, following the example set by East Asian economies in the past, the Survey says.Furthermore, selecting FDI as a means to benefit from China plus one strategy seems more beneficial than depending on trade. This is because China is India's primary import partner, and the trade deficit with China has been increasing.Also Check | Budget 2024 date, time: When will FM Nirmala Sitharaman present Union Budget 2024?

Whether we do so by relying solely on imports or partially through Chinese investments is a choice that India has to make,"" it said.Pointing to a recent research note, which cautioned against the risk of coercion due to Chinese dominance in certain segments, the Survey advocated ""striking a right balance between importing goods and importing capital"" from China. The report had cited how Brazil, Turkey and some European nations had raised import duty on electric vehicles, but courted investment from China.""India has a similar decision to make, given its large bilateral trade deficit with China. It makes India vulnerable to potential abrupt supply disruptions. Replacing some well-chosen imports with investments from China raises the prospect of creating domestic know-how down the road.

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024 and the Budget is being looked at for relief to salaried, middle class taxpayers and also the common man.What can you expect from the Modi 3.0 government’s Budget 2024? What are the top expectations from an income tax perspective and what do the experts recommend? We take a look:1.Changes in New Income Tax regime: The new income tax regime could be made more attractive by rationalizing the income tax rates and slabs, according to experts. They suggest that the 30% tax slab should be applicable for incomes above Rs 20 or Rs 25 lakh, instead of the current Rs 15 lakh threshold.One of the expectations is the inclusion of Section 80C exemption under the new income tax regime. Additionally, since the limit of Rs 1.5 lakh has not been revised since 2014, there is a request to increase it to Rs 3 lakh to encourage savings.Also Read | How can Budget 2024 make the new income tax regime more attractive for salaried taxpayers? Top points from TOI Online tax experts’ survey Personal tax experts unanimously agree that the standard deduction limit of Rs 50,000, introduced in the new tax regime last year, should be increased to Rs 1 lakh. This revision is particularly crucial as the standard deduction limit has not been updated since the financial year 2019-20.To encourage more taxpayers to opt for the new income tax regime, personal tax experts recommend increasing the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Additionally, some experts propose raising the limit for tax rebate from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh.Tax experts believe that the current exemption limit of Rs 10,000 for interest on bank deposits is insufficient and should be increased. Moreover, they suggest that term deposits and fixed deposits should also be included under this limit.Salaried taxpayers are requesting an increase in the health insurance premium deduction under Section 80D from the current limit of Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000 or even Rs 1 lakh. This change would offer relief to taxpayers and motivate them to prioritize their health, which is especially important in the present circumstances.Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings There is a demand to raise the current limit for deduction on interest paid towards housing loan for self-occupied house property from Rs 2 lakh to a minimum of Rs 3 lakh. One ask is also to include this under the new tax regime.Experts note that the government recognizes the intricacies in the current capital gains tax structure, which suffers from inconsistencies in tax rates and holding periods for various instruments within the same asset class. Moreover, the indexation benefit is not uniformly applied across different scenarios. They anticipate that the government may propose a streamlined capital gains tax regime, possibly involving adjustments to tax rates and computation methods.In Budget 2023, the TCS rate was increased from 5% to 20% for certain transactions to curb the outflow of foreign exchange. However, this sharp increase has had a significant impact on many individuals, including employees. The 20% TCS on amounts sent abroad exceeding 7 lakhs for maintenance purposes is causing substantial cash flow problems. Experts recommend lowering the TCS rate from 20% to 10% to alleviate this burden.Experts suggest that the online grievance resolution system for income tax return filing should be streamlined to make it more user-friendly. They also recommend further simplifying the income tax filing process to ease the burden on taxpayers.","The Union Budget 2024 will be presented on July 23, 2024.

Railway Budget 2024 expectations: Indian Railways does not just bridge distances, it is verily an engine of the country’s economic growth. The Government of India’s decision to not have a separate railway budget has not undermined the role it continues to have and play. While there has been much discussion around Vande Bharat and bullet trains, there have also been occasional concerns raised about the safety of our train operations.Also Read: Income Tax Budget 2024 Live Similarly, while there have been announcements regarding developments under the Amrit Bharat Station scheme and the creation of new Gati Shakti Terminals , there is also heightened demand for new coaches. The time is now for dedicated freight corridors to be fully operational.The railways is poised to enter an exciting phase of freight supremacy by leveraging these corridors for extensive network planning and other strategic gains. New economic corridors have also been announced, but they may take some time to complete.Also Read | Railway Budget 2024: How Budget 2024 can drive Indian Railways’ infrastructure to new heights Now, let’s analyse the trends and factors that are expected to shape the upcoming union budget for the railway sector.The cumulative budget outlay for fiscals 2020-2025 was Rs 8.7 lakh crore. There has been a shortfall of about Rs 5 lakh crore compared with the planned outlay under the National Infrastructure Pipeline of Rs 13.7 lakh crore. The upcoming union budget for fiscal 2025 is expected to make up for this shortfall.Indian Railways was allocated Rs 2.40 lakh crore in Union Budget 2023-2024 and Rs 2.52 lakh crore in Interim Budget 2024-2025. This marks a staggering 75% increase from the fiscal 2022 allocation.The upcoming budget is expected to allocate funds to key priorities such as safety, new coaches, new trains and new corridors. However, it should be noted that revenue expenditure, including staff costs and pensions, is expected to increase steadily.Also Read | Railway Budget 2024: Indian Railways to journey beyond Vande Bharat? Experts suggest focus on non-AC trains, safety Consequently, the operating ratio may increase from the budgeted 98.22% in fiscal 2025, limiting additional capital investments in railways. Accordingly, it remains to be seen whether the focus on allocation for new railway lines, which has grown 21.7% annually since fiscal 2023, will diminish or persist.On the safety front, the budget is likely to maintain its focus, if not enhance it. Additional funding is expected to be allocated to achieve the implementation target for the Kavach anti-collision train system. Kavach has already been deployed on roughly 1,500 km of routes, with an additional 3,000 km currently under implementation.Also expected in the budget are allocations for upgrading conventional coaches to Vande Bharat standards, launching additional Vande Bharat trains, and introducing new trains such as Vande Bharat sleeper and Amrit Bharat Express.The announcement of new economic corridors to improve logistics efficiency is a significant step towards achieving the ambitious target for expanding freight transportation modal share set out in the National Rail Plan. The resultant decongestion of high-traffic corridors will also improve passenger train operations.Also Check | Budget 2024 2024 Live Updates: Economic Survey projects 6.5-7% GDP growth These large-scale corridor projects, high-speed train station redevelopment (Amrit Bharat Station), and ongoing track infrastructure augmentation call for a budgetary top-up.Having seen rapid progress earlier, electrification might not receive as much attention now.The emerging requirement for Indian Railways is to reduce its carbon footprint and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. To meet this requirement, about 30 GW of renewable capacity is required to be installed. As of January 2024, Indian Railways has installed 216.36 MW of solar rooftop capacity and 103.4 MW of wind energy. To become a net-zero emitter, other strategies that Indian Railways could employ include transitioning from diesel to electric, improving energy efficiency, building dedicated freight corridors, supporting afforestation, etc.Private-sector participation in the context of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the railway sector has been limited. The sector has been unable to execute its plans under the National Monetisation Pipeline. Contrastingly, private container train operations have been a success — although it’s an old story. Recently, Gati Shakti multi-modal terminals have also shown success.Look to the budget for initiatives encouraging PPPs, leveraging private sector capital, efficiency and technology.","Indian Railways was allocated Rs 2.40 lakh crore in Union Budget 2023-2024.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations for senior citizens: What are the top things FM Sitharaman can do for senior citizens?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-for-senior-citizens-what-are-the-top-things-fm-sitharaman-can-do-for-senior-citizens/articleshow/111926033.cms,"By Nitin Baijal

Budget 2024 for senior citizens : With the Union Budget on the horizon, just like corporates and industry players, senior citizens too are eagerly awaiting as to what is in store for them? The senior citizen population would be looking at reforms that could potentially support in managing their financial burden and enhance the overall quality of life.In recent years, the government has endeavored to streamline the tax system, introducing changes in Budget 2023 aimed at making the new tax regime more appealing and efficient. These efforts included adjustments such as expanding non-taxable income threshold, implementing standard deductions, and revising tax slabs to incorporate lower rates.Looking ahead to Budget 2024, senior citizens have been advocating for reforms that cater specifically to their unique financial needs and challenges. With age there are multiple mental, health and financial issues that are needed to be managed. While the new tax regime has been introduced and policy makers are apparently working towards making it user-friendly for the larger population, senior citizens have also been expecting some key changes to make it viable for them as well.Also Check | Income Tax Budget 2024 Live A key expectation among senior citizens is for a revision in the basic tax exemption limit under the simplified tax regime. Currently, individuals aged 60 years or above are subjected to the same tax slabs as younger taxpayers. Seniors are hopeful that Budget 2024 will raise the basic exemption limit to at least INR 7 lakh per annum. This adjustment aims to lessen the tax burden on elderly taxpayers with limited income sources and various medical and financial aspects to cope up with.Acknowledging the financial challenges seniors face, especially with rising inflation and healthcare costs, policymakers may consider increasing the standard deduction to INR 200,000 for senior citizens, up from the current INR 50,000. This adjustment could help offset medical expenses and deductions from fixed deposits provided under Chapter VIA particularly, as part of the old tax regime. This may be in sync with the government’s strategy of moving the larger population from the old tax regime to the new tax regime.Additionally, Section 194P of the domestic tax law provides for exempting senior citizens aged 75 years and above, from filing income tax returns, subject to certain specified conditions. While the thought behind such provisions needs to be really appreciated, the provision needs a rejig for the larger senior citizen population taking benefit of the same. So, for the benefit to be availed by a larger chunk the section needs to introduce much more dearer provisions.Also Read | How can Budget 2024 make the new income tax regime more attractive for salaried taxpayers? Top points from TOI Online tax experts’ survey Seniors hope for the introduction of dedicated helplines or assistance centers that cater specifically to their needs, offering personalized guidance and support throughout the tax filing process. Furthermore, implementation of user-friendly digital platforms such as portals and mobile applications would facilitate seamless tax compliance and ensure timely refunds for seniors.As the countdown to Budget 2024 begins, the nation is closely monitoring the events, including senior citizens, on what to expect. With this being the first main Budget of the government, a lot is expected in terms of tax reforms. While industries would hope for rebates, tax concessions, tax holidays, senior citizens are looking forward to amendments that can help them take a sigh of relief. Watch this space for more","Budget 2024 is the first main Budget of the government. With age there are multiple mental, health and financial issues that are needed to be managed.

SHEconomy push:

MSMEs:

Sustainable development:

(The author is Partner and Markets Leader, PwC India)

Budget 2024 expectations : In the next few years, India aspires to be among the top three global economies. Achieving this economic feat would require doubling the GDP from $3.5 trillion to $7 trillion by 2030 while maintaining an annual growth rate of around 10%.To make this a reality, India must unleash its untapped potential by moving towards inclusive and responsible growth.Also Read: Income tax Slab Budget 2024 This shift requires going beyond headline numbers. Even as growth figures paint a rosy picture, India’s social fabric continues to be an opportunity to be built upon for the next growth phase.The India growth story will get an impetus by adopting a three-pronged approach to unlocking its true potential: integrating women into the workforce, focusing on sustainability, and bolstering micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs ).Also Check | Budget 2024 Live Updates: FM Sitharaman tables Economic survey; real GDP growth seen at 6.5-7% in FY25, Indian economy resilient India has traditionally struggled with low female labour force participation, which has hovered at around 20%. Although this has improved to 37% as per recent figures, when compared with the US and China, which boast participation rates of around 57% and 60%, respectively, there is much room to move further north.There is overwhelming evidence to show a positive correlation between female workforce participation and GDP growth . Currently, women contribute to about 18% of the country’s GDP. Some researchers point out that if women’s participation continues to grow, it could result in a 30% increase in India’s GDP.But as of today, women’s participation continues to be a missed opportunity not just for the government but also for the private sector. The challenge can broadly be divided into two parts: bringing more women into the workforce and ensuring they do not fall off the wagon within a few years. Driving large-scale women’s participation would require targeted investments in education and infrastructure. Investments in education stand at about 3% of GDP, which needs to double in the coming years, especially in schemes that can help bridge the gender gap.However, education is just one piece of the puzzle. Strong infrastructure is critical for supporting female employment. The government can play a key role by incentivising organisations operating in rural areas to provide job-oriented training programmes for women.The government currently runs several programmes that are aimed at rural youth. Enhancing these initiatives to incorporate high-demand skills, either directly or through partnerships with major private organisations for direct training, holds great potential. This approach can cater to graduates by aligning their skillsets to job requirements.Also Read | How can Budget 2024 make the new income tax regime more attractive for salaried taxpayers? Top points from TOI Online tax experts’ survey Retaining women in the workforce is another crucial aspect. While the private sector bears the primary responsibility for this, nudges through government policy can be highly effective. Encouraging voluntary ESG disclosures, which include transparent reporting on gender policies and workforce statistics, can push organisations towards demonstrating both transparency and improvement in gender equality practices.Increased female participation in the workforce would not only benefit the overall economy but also stimulate rural consumption – a critical missing piece for India’s economic growth. Putting money directly in the hands of women, through increased employment opportunities, will most certainly have a ripple effect on the economy.India’s MSME sector is the engine of its economy, employing about 12.36 crore people, or about 25% of the workforce, and contributing significantly to GDP and exports. To further unlock their potential, a focus on two key areas is crucial.Aligning supply chains with global ESG mandates will enhance the competitiveness of MSMEs in the international market. This becomes more important as Europe introduces stricter ESG regulations and global economies attempt to reduce their reliance on China. Facilitating Indian MSMEs to source in a more responsible manner will not only secure long-term global market access but also contribute to environmental sustainability.While ESG can play into India’s long-term strategy, aligning supply chains in line with this strategy is also crucial. MSMEs face significant cost burdens due to inefficient logistics. According to the 2022/23 Economic Survey, logistics costs in India range between 14-18% of the GDP, as against 8% globally. Creating specialised MSME clusters with dedicated transport networks could significantly enhance their efficiency and global competitiveness.Also Read | Economic Survey 2023-24: Why India’s march to ‘Viksit Bharat’ will be more difficult than China’s rise India’s ambition to become a manufacturing powerhouse hinges on a robust infrastructure foundation. Beyond traditional infrastructure projects, the government can create an ecosystem for sustainable growth by replicating the success stories of farmer-owned cooperatives like Amul.The government could identify regional strengths and strategically invest in infrastructure to create new growth hubs. For large-scale manufacturing projects, particularly in strategic areas like semiconductor production, robust social infrastructure encompassing housing, schooling, and healthcare is necessary to attract a skilled workforce and encourage families to relocate.There are tailwinds favouring India’s economic growth, and focus on inclusive development could boost growth further.One of the best examples of sustainable growth models is Amul.It’s high time India replicates this model – not necessarily a cooperative model nationwide, but an integration of rural strengths with market dynamics. Investment in rural infrastructure that goes beyond roads and bridges and invests in facilities that create platforms for young entrepreneurs would not only create sustainable growth but also improve consumption.Indian labourers avoid travelling too far from their families, and the government would need to boost housing in and around manufacturing hubs. India can boost growth by creating peripheral infrastructure by investing in housing, schools and other social infrastructure in and around such proposed manufacturing hubs.Also Read | Railway Budget 2024: Indian Railways to journey beyond Vande Bharat? Experts suggest focus on non-AC trains, safety It is also crucial to ensure that government initiatives aimed at attracting investments, whether in manufacturing of EVs or semiconductors, are in sync with India’s net-zero emission goals. Policy initiatives holding manufacturers more accountable for their own carbon footprint and making them responsible for their own waste management would not only lead to transparency but also attract investors looking to integrate India in their long-term strategy.As the Indian economy expands, its economic model will come under more intense scrutiny. India should not only capitalise on its demographic dividend but also aim to enhance productivity in the coming years. An inclusive growth model built on sustainability can prove to be the catalyst the country’s growth engine needs.","India aspires to be among the top three global economies.

Hard to implement IMF deal as political pressure surges in Pakistan: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hard-to-implement-imf-deal-as-political-pressure-surges-in-pakistan-experts/articleshow/111900453.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The current fiscal year's tax-laden budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on reserved seats have shifted the focus of politics to the economy , further posing doubts over Pakistan 's ability to meet the new International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions for a $7 billion loan, reported Dawn.A senior researcher said, ""This is crucial to determining if the government can meet the conditions for a USD 7 billion IMF loan agreement.Nonetheless, I am confident the government will sign the deal at any cost.""According to the analysts, the government is seeking China's help to restructure its substantial $28 billion debt.However, sources have suggested that China is unlikely to restructure these loans, fearing that other nations, like Sri Lanka, may also seek debt restructuring from Beijing.Bankers and analysts agreed that the country has been facing significant challenges, with political pressure mounting to provide relief to the public, Dawn reported.""The government has failed to offer any relief, instead exacerbating the situation by repeatedly increasing fuel and electricity prices,"" a senior banker said, noting that only banks and the equity market are enjoying the ""worst economy,"" recording historic profits.On the contrary, sectors like textiles are calling for tax reductions and price controls. Exporters are also dissatisfied with the new taxes on their income.The annual inflation rate for FY24 stood at 23.4%, leaving the real interest rate negative by three per cent.""How can we expect any big cut in the interest rate in the future to stimulate the economy?"" the banker questioned.The sources said that the IMF has asked the State Bank to maintain fiscal discipline, implying no substantial relief in interest rates soon.The high cost of doing business has already led to economic contraction in FY23, with a mere 2.4 per cent growth in FY24.""If the political situation remains unstable, significant growth in FY25 is unlikely, which will increase unemployment and deepen political uncertainties,"" noted an analyst. The IMF projects 3.5% growth for FY25, while Fitch Ratings estimates 3.2%.Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, showed optimism and said that the IMF deal will unlock additional funding sources, stabilise the rupee and bolster foreign exchange reserves.However, he expressed concerns about the political and social challenges in the country, which could complicate the successful implementation of IMF conditions, as reported by Dawn.""Moody's points out that Pakistan has historically struggled with implementing the structural reforms required by IMF programmes, which casts doubt on the current deal's effectiveness,"" he said.Despite campaigns for deals with Saudi Arabia, UAE and China, no substantial progress has been made, nor has privatisation of any government entity gone through, Mamsa said, adding that the anti-poor budget may not be sustainable in the long term.","The current fiscal year's tax-laden budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on reserved seats have shifted the focus of politics to the economy.

The system successfully increased government revenue in the coal sector, Seto told Reuters, and hoped to see similar improvement in the nickel and tin sectors.The SIMBARA system will also be linked to the government's digital records of mining quotas , known as RKAB. It enables miners to track how much production quota a miner has left for the period and to alert authorities should there be discrepancies in output and sales data, he added.A senior official has said Jakarta will implement the system on other minerals such as bauxite and copper, but the timing would be decided later on, once the nickel and tin tracking system has run smoothly.","Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of nickel and one of its largest producers of tin.

Stock traders in Asia are ramping up the Trump trade in preparation for a potential second term for the former US president, which will likely create winners and losers in the region.Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia from agriculture and farm equipment to textiles and weapons production.Asian companies’ momentum in the global race for electric vehicles and chips could slow should a Trump administration follow through on his pledges.China is seen as a clear loser given Trump’s call for higher tariffs and confrontational rhetoric against the world’s second largest economy. Taiwan and South Korea, which are heavily reliant on export revenues from semiconductor and other tech sectors, are also staring at an outlook downturn, market watchers say.India is deemed as a potential beneficiary should the former US president’s polling hold up and lead to his win in November. Southeast Asian economies, whose fortunes aren’t closely tied to exports, may be able to deflect much of the fallout from a change in the White House, investors say.Here is what market watchers are saying“India stands out as an economy that is relatively shielded from these shocks as the country has only a small share of global goods markets and is less exposed to China-related risks.”“It looks like India has a much better relationship with the US than China. At least from India’s side, the impact of Trump was not as bad as it was for many other emerging markets. It’s difficult to think it’ll be different this time.”“China’s obviously going to be one of the most affected if those tariffs really come in place and if Trump successfully can put enough pressure on the EU to also put some tariffs of their own on China.”Still, “a lot of companies are diversifying their markets or starting to diversify the supply chains and build manufacturing facilities outside of China. And even if a Trump presidency imposes high tariffs, Europe might decide not to follow it unless there is some really super strong political pressure.”“For Japan, we believe that risks are more balanced than China as the country’s sensitivity to global trade is a bit lower, and its relations with the US will likely remain solid even under the Trump administration.”“We also see the opportunity for the country to cement its semiconductor sector renaissance if Taiwan or South Korea end up bearing the brunt of the Trump team’s potentially consequential re-calibration of the US strategy for them.”“In Asia, the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Vietnam has been benefiting from the lower-end manufacturing, such as textile and wooden furniture, while Taiwan and Malaysia have been benefiting from electronic products supply chain shifts.”“Southeast Asia will be in a pretty good position because of what’s happening with China. So in that sense, Southeast Asia would be good. Thailand even, well, Vietnam may get into some trouble because they’re doing so much manufacturing of Chinese goods, but they’re also doing a lot of manufacturing for Korea.”“For Asia, it would really affect the tech-related ones more. It’s really whether the momentum trade of Taiwan, Korea is going to continue a bit longer, versus Asean being a bit more resilient, less tied to the tech sector, and having the China plus one strategy and secular themes playing out.”","Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia.

Bank Of England: UK inflation holds at 2% but underlying price pressures stay strong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-inflation-holds-at-2-but-underlying-price-pressures-stay-strong/articleshow/111806256.cms,"British inflation held at 2.0 per cent last month, defying forecasts for a slight fall, and underlying price pressures persisted, maintaining uncertainty about the date of the Bank of England 's first interest rate cut since 2020.Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected headline consumer price inflation would ease to 1.9per cent in the 12 months to June, extending its drop from a peak of 11.1per cent in October 2022.Inflation for services was much stronger at 5.7 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said, unchanged from May. The Reuters poll had pointed to a slightly weaker 5.6per cent increase.Sterling rose against the dollar immediately after the data was published.The BoE - which has a target of consumer price inflation of 2 per cent - has expressed concern about the strength of services inflation, which largely reflects pressure from wage growth in a labour market short of candidates to fill jobs.Data due on Thursday is expected to show wages growing slightly less strongly than in data published a month ago but still rising by almost 6per cent - roughly double the rate that would be compatible with keeping inflation at 2per cent.The BoE is due to announce its next decision on interest rates on Aug. 1 and investors see a roughly 50per cent chance of a first cut to borrowing costs since 2020.A rate cut next month would give an early boost to new Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his finance minister Rachel Reeves who have said they will speed up the slow-moving British economy after winning power in a landslide election two weeks ago.But last week the BoE's Chief Economist, Huw Pill, said he was focused on persistently strong price pressures and said the timing of the first rate cut was an open question.Core inflation - excluding volatile food and energy prices - held at 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to June, the ONS said, matching the median forecast in the Reuters poll.The BoE had expected headline inflation of 2.0 per cent in June and services inflation of 5.1per cent, according to forecasts it published two months ago.

HSBC appoints insider Georges Elhedery as CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hsbc-appoints-insider-georges-elhedery-as-ceo/articleshow/111800768.cms,"LONDON: HSBC Holdings Plc said on Wednesday that Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery will become group CEO , a choice that highlights the global lender's preference for continuity as it looks to kickstart growth.Elhedery, 50, who becomes HSBC's third CEO in less than eight years, will replace outgoing head Noel Quinn on September 2. The 160 year old lender has traditionally appointed its CEO from within.Since 2020, Elhedery has been the co head of the Global banking and markets business, the division that houses HSBC's trading and investment banking advisory businesses.Lebanon born Elhedery, who began his career in banking as a rates trader before joining HSBC in 2005, was named the surprise successor to Ewen Stevenson as CFO in October 2022, just weeks after returning from a sabbatical.He also led HSBC's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkiye region as the CEO of that division between July 2016 and February 2019.""Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory,"" he said in the bank's statement announcing his appointment.Quinn, who led the global lender for five years, will remain CEO until his successor starts in the role.His surprise departure was announced in April, and at that time he had said he wanted a better work life balance and planned to pursue a portfolio career.Quinn oversaw a raft of asset sales, navigated a global pandemic and a push by rebel investors to break up the 160 year bank, and guided the lender to record profit.The move comes at a time when HSBC, Europe's largest lender by assets with a balance sheet of $3 trillion, is betting on its historic Asian ties to ramp up profit.Since the financial crisis of 2008, HSBC has already shrunk its global footprint by around a quarter, exiting low growth markets to plough capital and resources into Asia.The bank's shares have risen 7% this year, against an 18% gain in the STOXX Europe banks index.HSBC said it will announce Elhedery's successor as Group CFO in due course. Ahead of the announcement, the bank was exploring financial incentives and reallocating key projects to retain those who miss out on the top job, two people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.HSBC will report its annual results on July 31.The lender's shares in Hong Kong were trading mostly flat after the announcement.","Georges Elhedery, 50, becomes HSBC's third CEO in less than eight years.

This rally was fueled by expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024, which could boost the economy and corporate profits. The positive sentiment was further supported by strong earnings reports from major companies like Bank of America and UnitedHealth Group.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 742.76 points, or 1.85%, to 40,954.48, the S&P 500 gained 35.98 points, or 0.64%, at 5,667.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.77 points, or 0.2%, at 18,509.34.Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, industrials enjoyed the largest percentage gains, while technology and communication services were the only two sectors to end in negative territory.Economically sensitive small caps extended their rally. The Russell 2000 scored a fifth straight day of gains greater than 1%, its longest winning streak since April 2000. The index gained 3.5%, touching its highest level since January 2022.Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler's comments about the possibility of lowering interest rates sooner if the job market cools ""too much"" added to the optimism on Wall Street. Analysts believe that the current market environment assumes a perfect scenario where the Fed cuts rates while inflation slows down without pushing the economy into a recession. Additionally, rising expectations of a Donald Trump victory in the 2024 US presidential election, which could lead to tax cuts and deregulation, further contributed to the bullish sentiment.In contrast to the US market, European bourses experienced declines, with German investor confidence falling for the first time in a year. The International Monetary Fund maintained its global growth forecast for this year at 3.2% but trimmed its projections for the United States and Japan while warning of ongoing inflation risks and trade tensions.Gold prices also reached a new record, jumping 1.9% to $2,450.07 per ounce, driven by shifting expectations regarding the Fed's monetary policy. In Asia, markets were mixed, with Hong Kong experiencing losses in the tech sector, while other major indices saw modest gains or declines.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.
