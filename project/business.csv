Louvre exhibition shows how Panchatantra went 'viral',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/louvre-exhibition-shows-how-panchatantra-went-viral/articleshow/109469009.cms,"Louvre Abu Dhabi revisits 3rd century Indian animal folk tales as the source of most

fables

in the Arab world and beyond

(Picture credit: : Ismail Noor/Seeing Things)

Panchatantra ’s cautionary tale of the dog with a bone – the one who mistakes his own image in the water for another dog with a better bone only to learn a hard lesson on how greed robs and corrupts – is etched in gold as part of a 14th century Iraqi manuscript currently on display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi (LAD).Called ‘From Kalila wa Dimna to La Fontaine: Travelling through Fables’, the exhibition explores how Indian fables went ‘viral’ across the ancient world and were translated in many tongues to resonate through the ages.The show hops from India’s very own animal tales compiled in the 3rd century to its Arabic descendant in Kalila wa Dimna, and all the way up to French fabulist Jean de La Fontaine’s ‘Selected Fables’ in the 17th century. Kalila wa Dimna was translated and compiled in the 8th century by one of the greats of Arabic prose, Ibn Al Muqaffa. His translation of the Panchatantra from Middle Persian later led to the Sanskrit text being rendered in Greek, Latin, Persian, Hebrew and Old Spanish among other languages.An 18th century manuscript of the Panchatantra is one of the exhibits.LAD was born in 2017 after an agreement between the governments of Abu Dhabi and France, and envisioned as “the first universal museum of the Arab world”. “We are a storytelling museum; we speak the connected stories of our shared humanity. So, it makes a lot of sense for us to propose an exhibition dedicated to storytelling and fables. It’s a mirror of what we are,” says LAD director Manuel Rabaté.Panchatantra champions principles of good governance, statecraft and lessons in power through anthropomorphic animal characters. So, the two jackals, Karataka and Damanaka – ministers to the lion king Pingalaka in Panchatantra – become Kalila and Dimna in Muqaffa’s Arabic translation. “I feel I have been living with the two jackals for a long time now,” laughs Annie Vernay Nouri, former chief curator at the oriental manuscripts department of Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), which is one of the main collaborators of the exhibition. Nouri did years of research on Kalila wa Dimna and first thought of holding an exhibition on travelling tales almost ten years ago.The exhibition features an 18th century palm-leaf manuscript of the Panchatantra and a 17th century Hitopadesha paper manuscript, both acquired from BnF. There is also a reproduction of an 8th century Indonesian sculpture depicting the Kacchapa-Jataka (The Talkative Turtle) which appeared in the original Panchatantra. The story of the talkative turtle and the two ducks appeared on Indian and Indonesian sculptures before the illustrated Arab manuscripts.The exhibition also highlights how certain stories from Panchatantra were revised to align with prevailing notions of justice. For example, the Indian tale of the Lion and the Bull ends with the death of the bull. But in Kalila wa Dimna, Muqaffa adds a chapter where Dimna, who is responsible for the lion and bull’s fight, is judged and punished for his crime. Dimna’s trial is a perfect example of how anyone who acts badly will be severely punished. In Panchatantra, however, the law of the strongest prevails.“Like Kalila wa Dimna, Panchatantra continues to be read and exists in several other forms – from cartoons to books, movies, theatre and even television shows. No original manuscript of Panchatantra survives but versions written and illustrated in the 17th and 18th century exist. I have seen the illustrated ones at Musée Guimet in their oriental collections department only recently,” says Nouri, saying it was a challenge sourcing the scattered remains of Panchatantra in existing manuscripts for the exhibition.The LAD exhibition also features the Kalila wa Dimna manuscript in Arabic, the earliest known illustrated version produced around 1220 AD. There are over 130 other artworks on display --- from rare manuscripts, paintings, to contemporary works, AI-driven-make-your-own-fable panels and more. They all depict narratives of friendship, loyalty, cunning and morality through the travails of envious cats, clever monkeys, devoted bears, quick-thinking rats and the like.The cross-cultural spread of Kalila wa Dimna is often compared to that of the Bible. When it reached Fontaine – whose pithy tales continue to enrich French school curriculum – he acknowledged Panchatantra’s influence in his work filtered through Kalila wa Dimna. “The crusades had brought the European mind in contact with Indian works (Panchatantra and Hitopadesa) in their Arabic dress. Translations and imitations in the European tongues were speedily multiplied,” wrote La Fontaine’s translator.BnF dates back to the 14th century. It was originally the library of the king of France but became a public library after the French Revolution. BnF hosts a huge collection of eastern manuscripts, from Arabic to Indian to those from the Far East, through a set of donations and acquisitions. “Fontaine, who was inspired by both eastern and western traditions of fables while writing his own, is as important a literary figure as French playwright Moliere. His fables, which schoolchildren learn by heart, promote basic morals and universal, secular values. Teachers ensure these values are well transmitted. Many artists, too, have been inspired by these fables,” says Emmanuel Coquery, director of Museum and Culture and BnF.LAD also plans to have more exhibitions integrating India. “About 10-12% of our guests at LAD are Indians , as tourists and those living and working in the UAE. We have several Indian artworks in our permanent collection. On June 21, we have a big yoga practice under the dome of the museum. I am also pushing my team to launch a club dedicated entirely to the Indian friends of Louvre Abu Dhabi just like American Friends of the Louvre (AFL),” adds Rabaté.‘From Kalila wa Dimna to La Fontaine: Travelling through Fables’ is on view at the Louvre Abu Dhabi till July 21.",The exhibition explores how Indian fables went ‘viral’ across the ancient world and were translated in many tongues. The show hops from India’s very own animal tales compiled in the 3rd century to its Arabic descendant in Kalila wa Dimna. There are over 130 other artworks on display from rare paintings to contemporary works.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109469169,imgsize-84182,width-400,resizemode-4/109469169.jpg"

Maldives' polls today a test of President Mohamed Muizzu's India policy too,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maldives-sunday-polls-a-test-of-muizzus-india-policy-too/articleshow/109464698.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maldives will vote today in the country's 4th multi-party Parliamentary elections that will also put to the test for the first time President Mohamed Muizzu's hostile India policy , especially the decision to throw out Indian military personnel from the Indian Ocean archipelago.The Indian government is hoping that the main opposition and pro-India party - Maldivian Democratic party (MDP) - will win a majority, leading to an effective legislative oversight of executive power.Ahead of the voting, the leader of MDP and former foreign minister, Abdulla Shahid, told TOI his party is optimistic about winning as the Muizzu administration has failed in the past 5 months in both domestic and foreign policies and the Maldivian people are also seeing a regression of democratic values under his watch.Shahid said Muizzu came into office by ""mongering lies and hate"" and all development projects have been halted. ""Intimidation of employees in state owned companies has returned with a vengeance. Thousands of people from the opposition have been threatened with suspension and termination from their jobs. There are calls to restrict delivery of essential services based on political affiliation,"" said Shahid, also a former president of the UN General Assembly.""Waste and corruption is rampant. People are clearly seeing the regression of democratic values and principles under this administration. And we are confident that they will show their response in their vote tomorrow."" he added, while underlining the significance of strong legislative oversight.The supervision of the exercise of executive authority and ensuring it's accountable for the exercise of its powers is an important constituent of the law-making powers of the 93-member People's Majlis. While the MDP is hoping to retain majority, if not repeat its 2019 ""super majority"" of 65 seats that thinned out later because of large-scale defections, the ruling People's National Congress (PNC) alliance is stressing the significance of a majority in People's Majlis for the president's development initiatives. Significantly, Muizzu, whose party had benefited from MDP defections, ratified last week an anti-defection law which was passed by Parliament earlier this month.Often described as a pro-China leader, Muizzu defeated his MDP predecessor Ibrahim Solih last year in a presidential poll seen internationally as a face-off between India and China. His pro-China image has held since then as he jetted off to Beijing in January, becoming the first democratically elected Maldivian president to visit China before travelling to India, and signed a bagful of agreements, including for defence cooperation. This was preceded by his decisions to expel Indian troops, who operated Indian naval choppers for HADR activities, and to walk out of an agreement that allowed the Indian Navy to carry out hydrographic surveys in the Maldivian waters.In his campaign for the Parliamentary polls, Muizzu, who attained office on the back of an India Out campaign, has often tom-tommed his eviction of Indian military staff and made snide remarks about India like accusing his predecessor of taking orders from a ""foreign government"".

APMC constructing a mall and five-star hotel is a scam: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apmc-constructing-a-mall-and-five-star-hotel-is-a-scam-sc/articleshow/109448949.cms,"NEW DELHI: Success in business may be most Gujarati’s alter ego but the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee of Surat took it to the next level by constructing a mall and a five-star hotel on its land, which was acquired by Gujarat govt in the 1960s for the benefit of farmers.A Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and J B Pardiwala castigated Surat APMC for frittering away land meant for welfare of farmers.“This is a scam of the highest proportion. How could the APMC have used the surplus land for a mall and five-star hotel? Which law authorized it to take such a decision?”Appearing for APMC, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said it was APMC’s land and the committee was free to put it to proper use for revenue generation. “How can the Gujarat HC direct the state to take over the land and property of APMC?” The hotel lease holder through senior advocate Nidhesh Gupta said there was no irregularity in the grant of the lease to run the hotel.The bench remained unconvinced and said the HC passed the extreme order considering the level of irregularity in allotment of APMC land for a hotel and a mall. It dismissed the appeal of both the APMC and the leaseholder of the hotel.The HC bench of CJ Sunita Agarwal and Aniruddha Mayee on March 27 had ordered the state to take possession of APMC’s five-star hotel constructed on the market yard’s land. It also ordered a public auction of the property and directed authorities to deposit the amount to the state's market funds.The bench ordered action against erring officials and APMC members responsible for construction of the luxurious hotel, which violated the aims and objectives of the market yard, for which the govt had acquired about 14,000 sq mt land.The HC ordered the director of Agriculture, Marketing and Rural Finance to conduct inspection of ‘Krushi Bazar’ on allegations by a petitioner that shops in the mall were leased for sale of items like jewellery and clothes. It ordered closure of all activities in the mall that were not for the welfare of the farmers.The SC’s view found broader acceptance in the December 2019 report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture. The Committee had severely criticized the way APMCs across India, except UP and Punjab, were managed and how they were acting in detriment to the benefit of farmers.

"Meet Vasuki Indicus, the ‘crocodile’ that was a 50ft snake",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-vasuki-indicus-the-crocodile-that-was-a-50ft-snake/articleshow/109414059.cms,"NEW DELHI/ROORKEE: A fossil found in 2005 from Gujarat’s Kutch and believed till now to be that of a giant crocodile has turned out to be of one of the largest snakes that ever existed on Earth .The discovery of ‘ Vasuki Indicus ’ by scientists of IIT , Roorkee could prove to be a “jackpot” of information of the evolutionary process, continental shift and India’s vital link to origin of many species, especially reptiles, researchers say.According to Sunil Bajpai, chair professor in IIT-Roorkee’s department of earth sciences, this serpent measuring between 11m (36ft) and 15m (49.22ft) could have been even longer than the now extinct Titanoboa, which once lived in Colombia. The closest relatives of ‘Vasuki Indicus’, the study finds, are Titanoboa and python.Researchers said the large size of ‘Vasuki Indicus’, named after the mythical king of serpents usually depicted round the neck of Shiva and in reference to its country of discovery, would have made it a slow-moving, ambush predator akin to an anaconda.The study named, ‘Largest known madtsoiid snake from warm Eocene period of India suggests intercontinental Gondwana dispersal”, was published in ‘Scientific Reports’ on ‘Springer Nature’ platform on Friday.Bajpai and post-doctoral fellow Debajit Datta from IIT-Roorkee said the fossil of this snake recovered from the Panandhro Lignite Mine in Kutch dates back to Middle Eocene period, approximately 47 million years ago. During their exploration, the researchers discovered 27 well-preserved vertebrae that appear to be from a fully grown reptile. Its length makes it the the largest known madtsoiid snake, which thrived during a warm geological interval with average temperatures estimated at 28°C.On the finding which is as much scientific as much accidental, Bajpai said: “The fossil was found in 2005, but since I have been working on different other fossils, it went on the backburner. In 2022, we started re-examining the fossil. Initially, due to its size, I thought it was of a crocodile. But then we realised it was of a snake and it turned out to be the biggest in its family and possibly one of the biggest and similar to Titanoboa.”The scientists claim that comparing its inter-relationship with other Indian and North African madtsoiids, ‘Vasuki’ represents a now-extinct relic lineage that originated in India. Subsequent India-Asia collision led to intercontinental dispersal of this lineage from the subcontinent into North Africa through southern Eurasia. “Though this discovery we have been able to show that we have some of the most remarkable snakes in India as well as other species,” said Bajpai, who along with his fellow reserachers had also discovered the fossil of a plant-eating dinosaur believed to be 167 million years old, in Jaisalmer last year.","'Vasuki Indicus' could prove to be a ‘jackpot’ of information of the evolutionary process, continental shift and India’s vital link to origin of many species, especially reptiles.

Additionally, Kejriwal is permitted to consume only 20 ml of oil per day in his meals.Furthermore, the Tihar administration mentioned that, according to a government circular, no referral can be made to any private hospital, despite Kejriwal's request for videoconferencing with his doctor.","Tihar jail submitted Delhi CM's health report to LG V K Saxena.

Three Jain couples to follow their kids into monkhood tomorrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-jain-couples-to-follow-their-kids-into-monkhood-tomorrow/articleshow/109465398.cms,"AHMEDABAD: Following their children's footsteps, three Jain couples will embrace monkhood at Sabarmati Riverfront on Monday. Bhavesh and Jinal Bhandari from Ahmedabad, Jaswant and Dipika Shah from Surat, and Sanjay and Beena Sadadiya from Mumbai are among 35 people who will take diksha under the guidance of Acharya Yogtilaksuri .Two years ago, the Bhandaris' children - daughter Vishwa (19) and son Bhavya (16) - renounced the material world to walk on the path of dharma.The happiness their children experienced after diksha inspired the couple to take the plunge. Leading a monastic life means the Bhandaris would have nothing to do with their property and business, worth over Rs 100 crore.A native of Sabarkantha, Bhavesh Bhandari recently made headlines when he donated food, clothes and cash during the grand procession held as part of the initiation ceremony.

How many Bitcoin halving are left?

The world of cryptocurrency witnessed another significant event as Bitcoin underwent its latest ""halving"" on Friday, effectively halving the mining reward and potentially influencing the currency’s future market dynamics. This pre-programmed adjustment occurs every four years and is critical for managing Bitcoin's supply. Following the event, Bitcoin's price remained relatively stable at approximately $63,907.With the reduction in new Bitcoin production, various implications arise for miners and the overall market, stirring both concerns and expectations among investors and analysts.Here is all you need to knowBitcoin ""halving"" is an automatic adjustment to the reward miners receive for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Initially set to distribute 50 bitcoins per block, this reward halves every 210,000 blocks. The latest halving reduced the reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins per block. This mechanism ensures that the total supply of Bitcoin caps at 21 million, a design to introduce scarcity, akin to precious metals like gold.Miners face a direct impact from halving as their earnings from rewards drop by 50%, which can significantly affect their profitability. Given the high costs associated with mining—such as electricity and hardware—reduced rewards mean that only the most efficient mining operations can sustain profitability. This could lead to increased consolidation in the industry, where only key players survive, potentially increasing the centralization of mining operations.Historically, halving events have preceded substantial increases in Bitcoin’s price. For instance, post-2020 halving, Bitcoin's price surged nearly seven-fold by the following year. However, experts like Adam Morgan McCarthy caution that past performance may not reliably predict future results, and other market conditions also heavily influence prices. Analysts remain divided, with some predicting significant rallies and others cautioning that the effects of halving might already be priced into the market.Beyond its impact on mining and prices, halving is viewed as a measure to preserve Bitcoin's value over time by controlling inflation. This scarcity mechanism is crucial for Bitcoin’s proposition as 'digital gold'. However, the reduced supply can also exacerbate price volatility in response to fluctuating demand.Environmental impact directly related to bitcoin halving remains somewhat uncertain. However, it is a well known fact that crypto mining consumes a significant amount of energy, with operations relying on polluting sources.The profitability pressures could push miners towards cheaper, potentially less environmentally friendly energy sources unless countered by technological advancements and regulatory measures.A recent study conducted by the United Nations University and published in Earth's Future journal revealed that the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining across 76 countries in 2020-2021 was equal to the emissions generated by burning 84 billion pounds of coal or operating 190 natural gas-fired power plants. The study found that coal accounted for the majority of bitcoin's electricity requirements (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).There are expected to be 64 Bitcoin halvings before the 21 million cap is reached sometime around 2140 At that point, halvings will cease and the blockchain will stop issuing new tokens.(With inputs from agencies)","Bitcoin underwent its latest ""halving"" on Friday, effectively halving the mining reward.

Millions of foreign tourists visit each year

CANARY ISLANDS: Tens of thousands of people protested across the Canary Islands on Saturday to demand changes to the mass tourism model they say is overwhelming the archipelago.There is a demand for a reevaluation of the tourism strategy in the Spanish archipelago, as well as a pause on the number of visitors.Police said 20,000 demonstrators turned out for the rallies, while organizers put the number closer to 50,000.There were also demonstrations in Madrid and Barcelona in support of the rallies on the Canary Islands.Protest organizers say mass tourism perpetuates an economic model that harms local residents. They want authorities to temporarily limit tourist arrivals to curb a boom in short-term rentals and hotel construction that drives up housing costs for locals.They are calling for restrictions on property purchases by foreigners. The protesters also want residents to have a greater say in what they see as uncontrolled development that is damaging the environment.Last week, several members of the Canaries Sold Out collective also began an ""indefinite"" hunger strike against the construction of two large luxury developments in southern Tenerife.Tourism is essential for the islands' economy. The industry accounts for 35% of economic output and secures 40% of jobs.In 2023, about 14 million visitors, mainly from the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as around 2 million people from mainland Spain went on holiday there""We are not against tourism,"" demonstrator Rosario Correo said. ""We're asking that they change this model that allows for unlimited growth of tourism.""Island officials are concerned about the impact on residents.

"Climate Change Blamed for Dubai Floods, Not Cloud Seeding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/climate-change-blamed-for-dubai-floods-not-cloud-seeding/articleshow/109408915.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: Many wondered whether it was cloud seeding - a weather modification technique to induce rains - that led to flooding of Dubai, but scientists involved in such projects in India categorically dismissed any link, and meteorologists and climatologists rather blamed climate change for the record precipitation in arid West Asia.Since parched UAE periodically conducts cloud seeding to increase level of its dwindling groundwater, extreme rainfall between Monday night and Tuesday evening raised questions on the artificial rain mechanism.The country received a record 255 mm of rain in less than 24 hours, flooding Dubai.Though it rained heavily in neighbouring Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well, Dubai in UAE faced the maximum impact.IIT Kanpur professor Sachchida Nand Tripathi, who is closely involved with the cloud seeding project in India said, there was no connection between cloud seeding and the floods in Dubai. “Seeding is tried at an early stage of storm development. In this case when the system progressed from the Gulf of Oman it was already an intensified storm. It is highly unlikely and unsafe to seed such systems. Seeding can at max contribute to 25% enhancement in rainfall. In this case the total rainfall was 25 cm. So even without seeding 20 cm of rainfall would have happened,” Tripathi toldEven distinguished climate scientist and former secretary in the ministry of earth science (MoES), Madhavan Rajeevan, dismissed the possibility of any link, saying cloud seeding cannot trigger such heavy rainfall and floods.Asked about likely reasons, he said, “This is absolutely a clear signal of climate change. It was a huge thunderstorm caused by a synoptic system which was moving across the Gulf region. With global warming there is now a tendency that if it rains, it rains very heavily. We should expect this kind of events more frequently in any part of the world and at any time.”Former chief of India Meteorological Department (IMD), K J Ramesh, too believed that cloud seeding was not the primary cause for the downpour. “Western disturbance-triggered extreme rainfall event development is the primary cause of the floods in the region,""he said.On its link with climate change, Ramesh said, “It is well known that any rain bearing system will become stronger under changing climate - global warming regime as warming enables atmospheric clouds to hold extra moisture and grow bigger and bigger leading to enhanced intensity of rain bearing systems.”Elaborating on the weather phenomena, he said, “Southward extension of passing westerly wave trough, supported by additional moisture feed from Arabian Sea, basically caused extreme weather events, causing unprecedented quantum of rainfall over not only UAE but also over Oman, north Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar.""Prior to this, a similar westerly wave gave heavy rainfall spells for two days over Afghanistan, leading to floods, thunderstorms and lightning over Pakistan”.On the UAE’s cloud seeding project, Ramesh said the country through its Rainfall Enhancing Experiment, launched in 2002, has been trying to carry out aircraft based cloud seeding as and when rain bearing weather systems develop over the surrounding regions. “Through such efforts, the cloud seeding team was able to enhance the quantum of rainfall up to 15% over and above the rainfall otherwise occurring any way naturally.”","The country received a record 255 mm of rain in less than 24 hours, flooding Dubai.

Indian-origin men involved in Canada's largest-ever gold and money heist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indian-origin-men-involved-in-canadas-largest-ever-gold-and-money-heist/articleshow/109415390.cms,"It was a brazen theft: thousands of gold bars and millions of dollars in bank notes stolen a year ago from Toronto's international airport.Canadian and US authorities said on Wednesday six people, including two Indian-origin men , have been arrested and three more are being sought in connection with what they called the largest gold heist in Canadian history - a cargo of over C$22 million ($16 million) in gold and currency.The arrests were announced after a long-year investigation under Project 24K. The suspects, including two Air Canada employees, forged an airway bill to steal a cargo arriving from Switzerland of C$20 million-worth 6,600 gold bars weighing 400 kg and C$2.5 million in foreign currency, police officials said. The gold was melted down and used to purchase illegal firearms. ""This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,"" said Nishan Duraiappah, chief of Peel police, responsible for law enforcement at Toronto airport .The gold theft appeared to be remarkably simple. The gold and cash arrived at the Toronto airport in a special container aboard an Air Canada flight from Switzerland on April 17, 2023, and it was moved to one of the airline's warehouses. The container held gold bars that were destined for a Toronto-based bank and bank notes bound for a currency exchange. About two hours later, a truck driven by a man who was arrested in Pennsylvania pulled up at the warehouse. The man carried a waybill - a document usually issued by a carrier with details about a shipment - that gave him access to the warehouse. It was actually a duplicate of a waybill, printed on an Air Canada printer, for a shipment of seafood that had been picked up a day earlier. The container with the gold bars and bank notes was loaded into the truck. Video recordings showed the truck travelling down Canada's busiest highway before eventually disappearing from sight in a rural area west of the city.Peel police officers were called early the next morning after an armoured truck of Brinks, an American cash handling company, arrived with the actual waybill for the shipment of gold and bank notes. Canada police said Wednesday that they believe the gold bars, which had serial numbers, were all melted down and that they had seized smelting pots. The only gold recovered, police said, was six bracelets made out of C$89,000 worth of gold.Air Canada employee Parmpal Sidhu, 54, from Brampton, Ontario, jewellery store owner Ali Raza, 37, from Toronto, Amit Jalota, 40, an Oakville, Ontario resident, Ammad Chaudhary, 43, from Georgetown, Ontario and Prasath Paramalingam, 35, from Brampton are among those that have been arrested. According to a PTI report, Sidhu and Jalota are of Indian origin. Police are searching for former Air Canada manager Simran Preet Panesar, 31, from Brampton as well as Archit Grover, 36, from Brampton and Arsalan Chaudhary, 42, from Ontario.Peel detective sergeant Mike Mavity said the truck driver that allegedly picked up the gold, Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old from Brampton, is currently in custody in the US. Sixty-five illegal firearms were found in his possession, two of which had been modified to have fully automatic capabilities.They were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada.

Third temporary channel opens for vessels to Baltimore port after bridge collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/third-temporary-channel-opens-for-vessels-to-baltimore-port-after-bridge-collapse/articleshow/109464112.cms,"BALTIMORE: A third temporary channel for boats to enter and depart the Port of Baltimore has opened, expanding further shipping access as collapsed sections of the Francis Scott Key Bridge are salvaged before the span can ultimately be rebuilt.The alternate channel, located to the northeast of the fallen bridge, is open to “commercially essential vessels ,” port officials announced late Friday.The new temporary path, with a controlling depth of 20 feet (6.1 meters), a horizontal clearance of 300 feet (91.4 meters) and a vertical clearance of 135 feet (41.2 meters), allows a greater variety of vessels to access the port while crews work to reopen the main channel, Coast Guard and port Capt. David O’Connell said in a news release.With the new channel open, about 15% of pre-collapse commercial activity will resume, O'Connell said. The first temporary channel opened April 1. The bridge collapsed early March 26 after it was struck by the cargo ship Dali.Officials hope to open a channel by the end of the month to allow most maritime traffic back into one of the East Coast’s busiest maritime transit hubs.Workers are laboring to remove thousands of tons of debris sitting atop the Dali, the cargo ship that veered off course and struck the 1.6-mile-long (2.57-kilometer-long) bridge. Six roadwork crew members on the bridge died. Two of their bodies have not been found.With massive cranes, workers so far have taken away about 1,300 tons (1,179 metric tons) of steel. The debris on the stationary ship must be removed before the vessel can be returned to the port.","A third temporary channel for boats to enter and depart the Port of Baltimore has opened.

"The House votes for possible TikTok ban in the US, but don't expect the app to go away anytime soon",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-house-votes-for-possible-tiktok-ban-in-the-us-but-dont-expect-the-app-to-go-away-anytime-soon/articleshow/109464312.cms,"WASHINGTON: The House passed legislation Saturday that would ban TikTok in the United States if the popular social media platform's China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year, but don't expect the app to go away anytime soon.The decision by House Republicans to include TikTok as part of a larger foreign aid package, a priority for President Joe Biden with broad congressional support for Ukraine and Israel, fast-tracked the ban after an earlier version had stalled in the Senate.A standalone bill with a six-month selling deadline passed the House in March by an overwhelming bipartisan vote as both Democrats and Republicans voiced national security concerns about the app's owner, the Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd.The modified measure now goes to the Senate after negotiations that produced a compromise.Even if the legislation becomes law, though, the company would have up to a year to find a buyer and would likely try to challenge the law in court, arguing it would deprive the app's millions of users of their First Amendment rights. Court challenges could significantly delay the timeline set out by Congress or block the law from going into effect.The company lobbied hard against the legislation, pushing the app's 170 million US users - many of whom are young - to call Congress and voice opposition. But the ferocity of the pushback angered lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where there is broad concern about Chinese threats to the US and where few members use the platform themselves.""We will not stop fighting and advocating for you,"" TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in a video that was posted on the platform last month and directed toward the app's users. ""We will continue to do all we can, including exercising our legal rights, to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you.""The bill's quick path through Congress is extraordinary because it targets one company and because Congress has taken a hands-off approach to tech regulation for decades. Lawmakers had failed to act despite efforts to protect children online, safeguard users' privacy and make companies more liable for content posted on their platforms, among other measures.The TikTok ban reflects widespread concerns from lawmakers about China.Members of both parties, along with intelligence officials, have worried that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over American user data or direct the company to suppress or boost TikTok content favorable to its interests. TikTok has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the Chinese government and has said it has not shared US user data with Chinese authorities.The US government has not publicly provided evidence that shows TikTok shared US user data with the Chinese government or tinkered with the company's popular algorithm, which influences what Americans see.The company has good reason to think a legal challenge could be successful, having seen some success in previous legal fights over its operations in the US. In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued.In 2020, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights. His administration brokered a deal that would have had US corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok. The sale never went through for a number of reasons; one was China, which imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers.Dozens of states and the federal government have put in place TikTok bans on government devices. Texas' ban was challenged last year by The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which argued in a lawsuit that the policy was impeding academic freedom because it extended to public universities. In December, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state.Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have backed the app. ""Congress cannot take away the rights of over 170 million Americans who use TikTok to express themselves, engage in political advocacy, and access information from around the world,"" said Jenna Leventoff, a lawyer for the group.Since mid-March, TikTok has spent $5 million on TV ads opposing the legislation, according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. The ads have included a range of content creators, including a nun, extolling the positive impacts of the platform on their lives and arguing a ban would trample on the First Amendment. The company has also encouraged its users to contact Congress, and some lawmakers have received profanity-laced calls.""It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the US economy, annually,"" said Alex Haurek, a spokesman for the company.Nadya Okamoto, a content creator who has roughly 4 million followers on TikTok, said she has been having conversations with other creators who are experiencing ""so much anger and anxiety"" about the bill and how it's going to impact their lives. The 26-year-old, whose company ""August"" sells menstrual products and is known for her advocacy around destigmatizing menstrual periods, makes most of her income from TikTok.""This is going to have real repercussions,"" she said.",The House passed a bill that would ban TikTok in the United States if the popular social media platform's China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year. The modified measure now goes to the Senate after negotiations that produced a compromise.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Maldives, opposition parties are calling for an investigation and possible impeachment of President Mohamed Muizzu in response to a leaked report dating back to 2018 alleging corruption.The parliamentary elections for the Majlis are scheduled for Sunday, ahead of which, the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and President Muizzu 's People's National Congress (PNC) have engaged in trading barbs and accusations against each other.The political turmoil began when an anonymous individual using the handle 'Hassan Kurusee' shared leaked intelligence reports on social media, which included documents from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Maldives Monetary Authority and the Maldives Police Service. These reports purportedly linked President Muizzu to financial misconduct, citing irregularities in money transfers to his personal bank account and suggesting possible involvement with politically exposed individuals, embezzlement, structured transactions, and the use of corporate entities to conceal fund origins.The allegations sparked a firestorm of reactions on social media, with demands from the MDP and People's National Front (PNF) for an official investigation into the matter. Former vice president Dr Mohamed Jameel Ahmed went a step further, calling for President Muizzu's impeachment based on the leaked intelligence reports. Jameel emphasized the importance of accountability in governance and urged President Muizzu to cooperate with independent investigations into the allegations, including those related to the Ras Male' development project and alleged excessive spending on public relations.President Muizzu responded to the corruption allegations on Tuesday, asserting that the opposition's attempts to implicate him were baseless and driven by desperation. He denied any wrongdoing and accused the opposition of leaking the reports to tarnish his reputation.""The same allegations had been made during his campaigns for mayor and President,"" he said adding, the response would also be the same as before.""While you attempt to pin something on me like this, you couldn't do it before and you can't do it now.

The change was officially recorded in filings at Companies House for Harry's eco travel venture, Travalyst, where his ‘New Country/State Usually Resident’ is now listed as the USA, a Daily Mail report said.This relocation raises substantial questions about Prince Harry’s ability to serve as a Counsellor of State—an office requiring a UK domicile. Dr Craig Prescott, a constitutional law expert, describes the scenario as ""uncharted waters,"" given the legal framework was not designed to address a senior royal family member choosing to live abroad.The implications extend beyond his royal duties, as Harry has also indicated considering US citizenship, which could necessitate renouncing his royal titles. ""The thought has crossed my mind but not a high priority right now,"" Harry stated in a February interview on Good Morning America.The disclosure of Harry's residency status has also sparked calls for the Biden administration to release his visa records, fueled by a statement from the American ambassador to London ensuring that Harry would not face deportation under the current administration.The recent developments highlight ongoing family tensions and the changing dynamics within the British royal family, as they navigate the practical and legal complexities of Prince Harry’s new life in the United States.","On June 29 last year, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle removed the last of their belongings from Frogmore Cottage.

UK PM Rishi Sunak faces leadership test as Tories trail Labour in new poll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-faces-leadership-test-as-tories-trail-labour-in-new-poll/articleshow/109398085.cms,"Key findings from the poll include:

NEW DELHI: A comprehensive poll conducted by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft has revealed that the Conservative Party is trailing behind Labour on every significant political issue as articulated by the voters. This includes traditional Conservative strongholds such as defence, tax, and immigration, with an astonishing 35-point deficit on matters related to the NHS.As per a Daily Mail report, despite the overwhelming support for Labour across these issues, 45% of the electorate expressed reservations about a government led by Labour's Sir Keir Starmer. This sentiment places considerable pressure on current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to avert a potential electoral defeat.The poll, which surveyed over 5,400 voters, indicates that Labour holds a commanding 21-point lead over the Conservatives, with potential results translating into a historic landslide victory for Labour if the trend holds in the upcoming general .On the NHS and social care, 49% of respondents favored Labour, compared to only 14% for the Conservatives.Labour also leads on the cost of living with a 41:19 margin, and on the economy and jobs with a 37:23 margin.Even on immigration, traditionally a Conservative stronghold, Labour leads by 34:20.Addressing the issue of leadership, only 13% of respondents felt that the Conservative Party's values align closely with those of the public, and a mere 11% believe theTories will win the upcoming election. Meanwhile, 34% of respondents see Sir Keir Starmer as the preferable Prime Minister over Sunak, who garnered only 19% support.The poll also touched on controversial policies such as the plan to deport Channel migrants to Rwanda, which is seen as critical to galvanizing Conservative support. Yet, public opinion is divided: 38% support the scheme, whereas 42% echo Sir Keir’s opposition, the Daily Mail report said.Lord Ashcroft highlighted the dilemma faced by Sunak, whether to delay the election in hopes of a political turnaround or to proceed as planned. He noted, ""We can surely understand why a beleaguered PM would want to put off calling an election for as long as possible in the hope that something might turn up. But what if things just keep getting worse?""As the political landscape shifts, the Conservatives face the challenge of not only retaining their base but also winning back those who have shifted their allegiance to other parties, a task made daunting by the widespread preference for Labour across almost all policy fronts.","A comprehensive poll conducted by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft has revealed that the Conservative Party is trailing behind Labour on every significant political issue.

Smokers' delight: Thousands light up for 420 in Berlin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/smokers-delight-thousands-light-up-for-420-in-berlin/articleshow/109470438.cms,"Buzzkill,

Berlin police say some 4,000 people gathered at the German capital's landmark Brandenburg gate on Saturday for a ""smoke-in"" celebrating the recent legalization of cannabis in the country.The day featured concert performances and speeches by activists.Enjoying their now decriminalized drug of choice, some in the crowd held signs reading, ""Not everyone wants to drink,"" and speakers lauded the move away from prohibition.Although it is now legal to consume weed in Germany, Deutsche Bahn (DB) on Saturday announced that the smoking of hashish and cannabis would be prohibited at train stations across the country.Earlier this month, it became legal for adults in Germany to carry up to 25 grams of cannabis and cultivate up to three marijuana plants at home.Despite the fact that DB generally maintains designated cigarette- and cigar-smoking areas on its platforms, it said, ""Based on the legal ban on daytimecannabis consumption in pedestrian zones and in the vicinity of schools and playgrounds, we would like to safeguard all our passengers at our stations, especially children and young people.""The company said it would have the new rules in place within the next month.April 20, or 4/20 as written in the US [spoken: four-twenty], has become an international day of cannabis celebration and activism. The number stems from anecdotes tied to the origins of US cannabis culture in the 1960s and '70s.","Police say 4,000 people gathered at Berlin's Brandenburg gate for a ""smoke-in"" It is now legal for adults in Germany to carry up to 25 grams of cannabis and cultivate up to three marijuana plants.

Volkswagen's Tennessee workers vote to join UAW trade union,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/volkswagens-tennessee-workers-vote-to-join-uaw-trade-union/articleshow/109470252.cms,"Wage deals with 'Big Three,' Biden on Detroit picket

Workers at German car giant Volkswagen 's Chattanooga factory in Tennessee have voted to join the United Auto Workers trade union, in a major boost for the largest car union in the US outside its powerbase in Detroit.Well over half of eligible workers cast ballots, making the result binding.And of those who voted, 2,628 were in favor and 985 against, a 73% level of support for unionizing.Workers celebrated the result, cheering and waving their ""Union Yes"" campaign posters as the outcome was announced late on Friday.Even President Joe Biden commented on the results, having voiced support for the move in the run-up.""Together, these union wins have helped raise wages and demonstrate once again that the middle-class built America and that unions are still building and expanding the middle class for all workers,"" he said in a statement.Union presence rare in US South and WestFriday's result will make Chattanooga the first auto plant in the South to unionize via an election since the 1940s, and the first foreign-owned plant in the South to do so.VW held a neutral posture in the vote, with unionization the norm at its facilities around the world, including in its native Germany. It used to have a UAW presence at its defunct plant in Pennsylvania far to the north, until that closed in 1988. So the vote appears more likely to lead to a deal rather than deadlock.UAW President Shawn Fain has been trying to extend the influence of the US' main car workers' union beyond the historic automotive capital of Detroit where it's focused.Fain and his team have committed to spending more than $40 million (€37.5 million) through 2026 in a bid to unionize plants owned by a variety of carmakers in other parts of the US, including Tesla.""I'm exhilarated that we actually accomplished what set out to accomplish,"" VW employee Lisa Elliott said after the results were announced. ""Tell Mercedes they're next.""That was a reference to a Mercedes plant in Alabama, which will be the next facility to hold a UAW election during the week of May 13.It was the third attempt to affiliate with UAW at the factory, with votes in 2014 and 2019 narrowly failing. Other votes at other factories, like a Nissan facility in Mississippi in 2017, also failed.But this year's vote had coincided with a boost in public support for unions in the US, which can be fairly skeptical of organized labor by international standards.Republican governors in six southern states, including Tennessee, have spoken out against the move to unionize car plants in recent months.The UAW last year securing big pay settlements with the ""Big Three"" US carmakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis (more commonly still called Chrysler) — after President Biden walked a Detroit picket line also brought the group into public focus.The union has indicated it is also eyeing a Hyundai factory in Alabama and a Toyota facility in Missouri where it says that more than 30% of staff have already signed cards indicating they want a vote on joining.","VW workers in Tennessee vote to join United Auto Workers trade union.

UK rules out youth mobility deal with EU,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/uk-rules-out-youth-mobility-deal-with-eu/articleshow/109459904.cms,"BRUSSELS: The UK government has ruled out any post-Brexit deal with the EU that would make it easier for young Britons to live, study and work in the bloc, a government spokesman said on Saturday.The European Commission this week called for the 27 EU nations to open negotiations on a "" youth mobility scheme "" for UK citizens aged 18-30.But the UK, which has individual youth mobility schemes with 13 countries, said it preferred bilateral arrangements with individual countries over an EU-wide deal.""We are not introducing an EU wide youth mobility scheme -- free movement within the EU was ended and there are no plans to introduce it,"" a government spokesman said.The UK was open to agreeing youth mobility schemes with its ""international partners"", including individual EU member states.The opposition Labour Party has also ruled out the possibility of an EU-wide scheme, saying it would ""seek to improve the UK's working relationship with the bloc within its red lines -- ""no return to the single market, customs union or free movement"".Britain left the European student exchange schemeErasmus after Brexit , but the commission said that, should the UK wish to rejoin, it remained ""open"" to the idea.The European Commission's proposal envisages setting university fees in Britain and the bloc at the same level for EU and UK students, as before Brexit.According to the EU executive, tuition for non-UK residents at British universities now averages 22,000 pounds ($27,400) a year, compared to around 9,000 pounds for residents.Under the plan, young EU and UK citizens would be able to stay in the country of their choice for up to four years and visa fees would not be ""excessive"".Currently a young person from the EU seeking to study in the UK must pay £490 while a skilled worker visa costs between £719 and £1,639, the commission said.There is also an extra cost for healthcare running into hundreds of pounds that the commission wants to scrap.","The UK government has ruled out any post-Brexit deal with the EU that would make it easier for young Britons to live, study and work in the bloc.
