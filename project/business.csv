Will Indian IT companies be forced to exit H-1B visa program? Steep fee hike to make significant dent in pockets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-indian-it-companies-be-forced-to-exit-h1-b-visa-program-steep-fee-hike-to-make-significant-dent-in-pockets/articleshow/110379349.cms,"H1-B Visa Fee Hike

The US H-1B visa fee hike has raised concerns among industry representatives and immigration experts, who warn that it could pose significant challenges for Indian IT service providers and strain their finances.Indian IT companies heavily depend on H-1B visas to bring thousands of highly skilled professionals to the US to fill specialty positions that are in high demand but short supply in the country, according to an ET report by Annapurna Roy.In April, the USCIS implemented substantial fee increases for various immigration processes . The H-1B visa registration fee saw a staggering 2050% increase, rising from $10 to $215, while the application fee increased by 70%, from $460 to $780. Additionally, a $600 asylum fee was introduced for filing H-1B and other petitions, which experts argue is unrelated to non-immigrant work visas like H-1B.""The drastic percentage increase and added asylum fee all at once makes things difficult,"" said Shivendra Singh, vice president - global trade and development at industry association Nasscom .According to an analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy, the visa fee hikes could result in employers spending over $33,000 in legal and government fees for each H-1B visa petition filed for initial employment or employment extension.Jonathan Wasden, managing attorney at immigration litigation firm Wasden Law, warned that the new rules might force Indian IT companies to withdraw from the visa process altogether.Unlike product companies such as Apple and Google, or banking institutions that may only file one H-1B petition every three years, these IT firms are likely to incur significantly higher costs due to the need to file petitions more frequently.Also Read | Why Indian IT’s reliance on H-1B work visas has plunged 56% in the last 8 years Wasden believes that this is a deliberate attempt by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to eliminate Indian IT companies from the H-1B program, stating, ""It is no secret to anyone who practices employment-based business immigration that USCIS has been trying for decades to eliminate Indian IT companies from the H-1B program. This is merely the latest tactic to achieve this goal,"" Wasden told ET. ""They are trying to make the process so expensive for companies doing third-party placement that they will go out of business,"" he added.Wasden represents US industry body IT Serve Alliance, one of the plaintiffs challenging the fee rule in court.Nasscom also expressed concerns about the impact of the fee hikes on their member companies. Shivendra Singh says that the increase in filing fees comes at a time when there is a significant demand-supply gap in skills availability. He warned that any measure that complicates and raises the cost of addressing this gap could have a substantial impact on the ease of doing business and adversely affect the competitiveness of the US economy.Also Read | Why Infosys’ Narayana Murthy wants to be remembered ‘not as a good man but…’ In addition to the fee hikes, Singh pointed out that the proposed modernisation rule provisions, which aim to narrow the criteria for 'specialty occupation' and H-1B employees staffed at third parties, could have serious consequences if implemented in the future.While some experts believe that the fee hikes will lead to a decrease in the use of H-1B visas over time, others suggest that companies will continue to bear the costs to secure the skills they desperately need. Cyrus Mehta, managing partner at immigration law firm Cyrus D Mehta & Partners PLLC, noted that Indian heritage companies have started to absorb the fee increase, viewing it as a cost of doing business in the US.However, he also cautioned that the fee increase could become a burden, particularly for India-born workers caught up in green card backlogs, as H-1B extensions will need to be filed repeatedly on their behalf.","In April, the USCIS implemented substantial fee increases for various immigration processes.

Goldilocks scenario for gold! Why it’s the right time to buy gold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/goldilocks-scenario-for-gold-why-its-the-right-time-to-buy-gold/articleshow/110381856.cms,"Gold Funds

Gold price outlook : The current circumstances appear to be ideal for gold, and overlooking its appeal could be a costly mistake for investors seeking to safeguard their wealth.Central banks in emerging markets are accumulating gold reserves as tensions persist in West Asia, enhancing the metal's status as a reliable store of value. Additionally, the near certainty of an extended pause in US interest rates further bolsters the case for gold, says an ET analysis by Prashant Mahesh.Tapan Patel, fund manager - commodities at Tata Asset Management, advises, ""Investors could increase their allocation to gold from 8-10% to 10-15%, over the next three months, given the positive outlook for gold.""Gold prices have experienced a significant upswing in recent times, outperforming the Nifty 50 over a 5-year period with a return of 17.39% compared to the Nifty's 15.24%. However, gold underperformed over a 10-year period, yielding a return of 9.02% against the Nifty 50's 13.3%. In the last three months, gold prices have surged by 19%, and over the past year, they have risen by 22.8%.Financial advisors highlight several factors that could drive gold prices higher and recommend that investors accumulate the precious metal during any price dips in the coming three months.The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.3% in April, following advances of 0.4% in March and February. This suggests that inflation has resumed its downward trend at the beginning of the second quarter.Ghazal Jain, a fund manager at Quantum Mutual Fund, warns that any escalation in geopolitical tensions, fiscal or monetary measures to bolster the economy before the US elections, and the recently announced deceleration in Fed balance sheet reductions could adversely affect inflation, maintaining gold's relevance.Also Read | When will gold prices hit the Rs 2 lakh mark? Patel adds that gold prices will remain robust due to significant purchases by central banks, particularly China, Turkey, and Russia. The Ukraine invasion raised concerns about the risks associated with US dollar exposure for many nations.As a result, central banks globally are actively accumulating gold to diversify their reserves and reduce their reliance on the US dollar. In China, retail investors are also purchasing gold, further increasing demand for the precious metal. Prior to 2020, when the Chinese government cracked down on real estate, it was one of the most favored forms of savings for retail investors. With the local property market falling out of favor, investors have shifted their focus to gold.Also Read | Gold prices surge! Why 9-Carat gold jewellery may now be hallmarked Anup Bhaiya, managing director of Money Honey Financial Services, advises, ""Retail investors could stagger their bets in 3-4 tranches using a buy on dip strategy, instead of buying at one go.""He suggests that investors in higher tax brackets could use a combination of sovereign gold bonds and multi-asset funds to build their exposure in a tax-efficient manner, while those whose income is not subject to tax could opt for gold ETFs or gold funds. Some multi-asset funds are taxed as equity funds, while others are eligible for capital gains tax with indexation benefits if held for three years.","Central banks in emerging markets are accumulating gold reserves as tensions persist in West Asia.

The group has repeatedly denied those allegations.The flagship’s stock rose 1.7% to 3,445.05 in Mumbai on Friday and has now almost tripled since its nadir in February 2023. The latest upswing comes as some analysts expect Adani Enterprises’ stock to be included in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index in June, potentially bringing passive flows.Other Adani companies are engaging with global investors to raise fresh debt as the group pushes ahead with plans to expand its cement and copper businesses. Besides Adani Enterprises, at least five of the 10 listed Adani group stocks are trading above the levels seen before the Hindenburg report .“There are a handful of groups in India that can undertake big projects and Adani Group has taken the leadership position,” said Abhay Agarwal, a fund manager with Mumbai-based Piper Serica Advisors Pvt. “Investors are looking at Adani group as a policy play and since there is a clear direction on the country’s policy, we are seeing recovery.”Shares of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. and Adani Power Ltd. have been among the best performers this year among the group companies, adding more than 35% each while television broadcaster New Delhi Television Ltd. has been the biggest laggard, giving away 5.5%.Back in January 2023, the short seller Hindenburg’s bombshell report saw Adani Enterprises scrap a $2.4 billion equity offering — which was then poised to be India’s largest follow-on share sale — amid a stock meltdown that at one point eroded more than $150 billion from the group’s market value. It also wrecked the personal wealth of Gautam Adani while the short seller’s claims set off regulatory probes in India.The group is now less than $30 billion away from returning to the market value it commanded on the eve of the short seller report.The first leg of the recovery in Adani stocks came in March last year after star emerging-market investor Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners bought shares worth almost $2 billion in four of the group firms, including the flagship, from an Adani family trust. Jain added to his positions through 2023.

He said it is ""unlikely in the extreme” this time.However, he cautioned that modifications to the capital gains taxation could be announced in the Union Budget in July, following the general elections. According to an ET report, Wood highlighted that domestic fund managers are currently discussing the possibility of increased capital gains tax rates or an extension of the period required to qualify for long-term gains, or a combination of both.At present, investors must pay a 15% short-term capital gains tax if profits from stocks and equity-oriented mutual funds are realized within one year of holding.

He attributed the motivation behind these proposals to the growing evidence of retail speculation, particularly in the options market, which is unlikely to be viewed favorably by Prime Minister Modi or the BJP.""Greed & fear's probably correct assumption is that the Indian prime minister has a natural suspicion of those making money out of money, most particularly in a zero-sum game like options,"" said Wood.He emphasized that since his days as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, where he served for nearly 13 years, Modi has consistently focused on the physical manifestations of growth, with a particular emphasis on infrastructure construction.","Chris Wood, a global equity strategist at Jefferies, believes that potential changes in the capital gains tax regime for stock market transactions pose a more significant risk to Indian markets than the outcome of the upcoming elections.

Why Apple had to install currency note counting machines in its Delhi and Mumbai stores,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-apple-had-to-install-currency-note-counting-machines-in-its-delhi-and-mumbai-stores/articleshow/110413853.cms,"Currency in circulation

Apple encountered an unexpected hurdle shortly after launching two company-owned stores in India in April of the previous year - a significant number of customers preferred to pay in cash. This development led the iPhone manufacturer to install currency note counting machines in both its Mumbai and Delhi stores.Individuals familiar with the matter told ET that cash payments account for 7-9% of the American company's sales in its two Indian stores, a stark contrast to the less than 1% or even zero cash transactions in its US or European outlets. Customers continue to flock to the stores with bundles of cash to purchase mobile phones or computers.It comes as no surprise that Quora, a social question-and-answer website, is inundated with inquiries from consumers regarding the possibility of making cash payments at Apple stores in India, sources told ET. One of the individuals, who wished to remain anonymous, noted that the proportion of customers purchasing Apple products with cash is higher in the Delhi store compared to the Mumbai store.The two stores in India have a direct reporting line to the Apple retail team in the US, rather than to the Apple India sales operations. Their sales are also included in the global financial records.Apple, however, is not the only company grappling with cash payments in India. The government has implemented a cash transaction limit of Rs 2 lakh per person per transaction, per day, or per event and occasion since 2017. This measure aims to encouragedigital payments and curb black money.The amount of cash circulating in India has seen a significant increase, rising from Rs 13.35 lakh crore in March 2017 to Rs 35.15 lakh crore in March 2023, as reported by ET last month.This growth highlights the continued importance of cash as a means of transaction, despite the substantial increase in digital payments through Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ), which reached Rs 19.64 lakh crore at the end of April 2023, up from Rs 2,425 crore in March 2017, according to data from the National Payments Corporation of India.Also Read | 5 lakh ‘Apployments’: Apple ecosystem to create huge number of jobs in 3 years; iPhone maker may move half its supply chain from China to India The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) estimates that between 15% and 20% of car purchases in India are self-funded, with buyers paying up to Rs 2 lakh in cash upfront, even for luxury vehicles. The remaining balance can be paid through various methods, including account payee cheques, bank drafts, electronic clearing systems, net banking, or debit cards.Mercedes-Benz India, a German luxury carmaker, has observed that cash and self-funded purchases account for a higher share of 25% in Mumbai and Bengaluru, compared to 15% in other markets across the country.Santosh Iyer, managing director of Mercedes Benz India, was quoted as saying, ""Almost 20% of the customers opt for an all-cash purchase."" An anonymous car dealer in Delhi expressed their frustration when a buyer wanted to purchase a super luxury car entirely with cash.Manish Raj Singhania, president of FADA, explains that many customers prefer not to avail financing options to avoid paying interest and instead choose to pay in full using their savings.Some buyers may not have the necessary documents, such as income tax returns, to secure a bank loan or may not be considered credit-worthy. These buyers, present in both rural and urban markets, make payments using a combination of cash (up to the government-regulated limit of Rs 2 lakh), cheques, and real-time gross settlement (RTGS) funds transfers between bank accounts.","Cash payments account for 7-9% of the American company's sales in its two Indian stores.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

For June, the projection is 240 GW during daytime and 235 GW during evening hours. Officials now feel the country could see a new peak of 260 GW, given the met predictions.But and early onset of summer and long spell of unusually high temperatures, which was predicted by various meteorological channels, jacked up demand due to proliferation of cooling appliances, especially air-conditioners, on the back of rising aspirations and spending power of households as well as improved access to electricity.As reported by TOI in October last year, the International Energy Agency had said India will record the highest growth in demand for energy among countries or regions over the next three decades, with power consumption for running household air-conditioners alone rising nine-fold by 2050 to outstrip the present-day consumption in Africa.The uptick in peak demand became evident early in the week in step with the rising mercury.

GoAir stares at liquidation now as Nishant Pitti withdraws revival bid for airline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/goair-stares-at-liquidation-now-as-nishant-pitti-withdraws-revival-bid-for-airline/articleshow/110420684.cms,"NEW DELHI: It could be curtains for GoAir , which stopped flying last May, and the erstwhile Wadia Group airline may now head for liquidation. A key bidder to revive Go under insolvency law, Nishant Pitti , on Saturday withdrew the same. This was expected after last month the Delhi High Court had allowed lessors of Go’s 54 aircraft to repossess them.Government could soon now distribute Go’s slots and foreign bilateral rights to other airlines like Air India Group, IndiGo and Akasa which are growing rapidly after getting the legal nod. Akasa, for instance, did not get any bilaterals for Dubai — the biggest destination for Indian globetrotters — as the same have been exhausted fully. That will mean more flights — and hopefully slightly lower fares — on constrained routes with passengers suffering from under-capacity amid demand surge. Go managed to hold on to leased planes, engines, slots and bilaterals under the moratorium provided by Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.“After careful consideration, I have decided to withdraw from the GoAir bid in my personal capacity. This decision allows me to better focus on other strategic priorities and initiatives that align with our long-term vision and growth objectives… we continue to navigate new opportunities and challenges,” Pitti, founder-CEO of EaseMyTrip , said.Like scores of passenger and travel agents, Pitti’s company has a large amount stuck with Go in terms of unrefunded tickets. Go’s successful bidder could have got the arbitration proceeds of Go's ongoing about Rs 8,000-crore damages case against Pratt & Whitney whose snag-ridden engines for the Airbus A320 family of planes have been blamed for the airline’s demise.The airline owed over Rs 11,000 to creditors and employees when it shut down on May 3, 2023. Since the erstwhile promoters had filed for insolvency, the airline managed to retain leased planes and engines under moratorium. The committee of creditors had nudged the two bidders for Go, including Pitti, to up their bids given the massive swings of the airline.“Like Kingfisher, Jet and scores of other airline failures, the Go episode is also very sad. She have lost our hard earned retirement fund and salaries. The only saving grace has been we have been spared a pointless revival exercise being witnessed at Jet which has a successful bidder for years now but hasn’t taken off again,” said a former employee who is now working for another carrier.","Government could soon now distribute Go’s slots and foreign bilateral rights to other airlines like Air India Group, IndiGo and Akasa.

FDI inflow to increase in domestic manufacturing sector: Ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fdi-inflow-to-increase-in-domestic-manufacturing-sector-ministry/articleshow/110417759.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's domestic manufacturing sector is set to receive stronger external support in the upcoming months as investment in the sector to rise.According to the monthly economic review by the ministry of finance, a growing number of organizations in the US and Europe are focusing on reindustrialization. These organizations are primarily aiming to enhance supply chain resilience , a strategy that could significantly benefit India's manufacturing firms as part of the China Plus One strategy.The Ministry of Finance monthly review says that the approach of western economies involves diversifying supply chains to reduce dependence on China by incorporating other countries, with India being a prime candidate for such diversification.India's modestly improved economic activity and consumer sentiment in Europe and a steady US economy have increased India's exports in April. According to the Ministry of commerce data, India's exports, including merchandise and services, increased from USD 60.40 billion to USD 64.56 billion (Y-o-Y) in April.The monthly review also highlights that both the industrial and service sectors of the Indian economy are performing well, driven by robust domestic demand and supported by tentative external demand. This positive trend is expected to continue as global economic conditions improve.The EXIM Bank of India has forecasted that merchandise exports will achieve double-digit growth in the first quarter of FY25, further signalling strong prospects for India's manufacturing sector. This optimistic outlook is fueled by increased investments and the strategic shifts in global supply chains favoring India.As global economies seek to stabilize and grow, India's manufacturing sector stands to gain from these developments, leveraging both domestic strengths and enhanced external supportDuring the FY23-24, according to the commerce ministry India registered record exports of USD 778 billion.India's smartphone market shipped 34 million smartphone units in the first quarter of 2024. It also registered a 11.5 per cent growth YoY (year-over-year), making it the third consecutive quarter of growth in shipments, as per the Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker by International Data Corporation.The Defence exports of India have also touched a record Rs 21,083 crore in the Financial Year (FY) 2023-24, a growth of 32.5 per cent over the last fiscal when the figure was Rs 15,920 crore.According to the parliamentary data, from October 2019 to December 2023, the total foreign investments in the manufacturing sector, as reported by the States through FDI equity inflow, were USD 20.8 Bn. The top five states receiving the maximum investment are Maharashtra (29.6% Per cent), Karnataka (22.6 per cent), Gujarat (16.3 per cent), Delhi (13.5 per cent), and Tamil Nadu (4.7 per cent).Recently Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also asked for a greater push to the manufacturing sector.Sitharaman said many suggest India has a bigger opportunity in services but we can't ignore manufacturing and it must be pushed with greater investment and help from government policies.""Manufacturing must increase, India must also increase manufacturing with the help of policies, its share in manufacturing in global value chains. So we need to have greater sophistication in our product manufacturing and we also need to see how this can be given the best policy support"" said the minister.",India's domestic manufacturing sector is set to receive stronger external support in the upcoming months.

The package does not include a salary or cash bonus and instead ties rewards to Tesla's market value increasing to as much as $650 billion over a 10-year period starting from 2018.Currently, the company's market value stands at approximately $571.6 billion, according to LSEG data.Earlier this year, Judge Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery invalidated the original pay package. In response, Musk sought to change Tesla's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas.Glass Lewis also expressed concern over this proposed move, stating that it offers ""uncertain benefits and additional risk"" to shareholders.Despite the proxy advisor's recommendation, Tesla has encouraged shareholders to reaffirm their approval of the compensation package.In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Tesla's board chair Robyn Denholm defended the pay package, stating that Musk deserves it due to the company's achievement of ambitious targets for revenue and stock price.Musk has been Tesla's CEO since 2008 and has played a significant role in improving the company's performance. According to an online campaign website, Vote Tesla, the company has gone from a $2.2 billion loss in 2018 to a $15 billion profit, and vehicle production has increased sevenfold.In addition to its recommendation against Musk's pay package, Glass Lewis advised shareholders to vote against the reelection of board member Kimbal Musk, the billionaire's brother.

From lost wheels to a turbulent Singapore Airlines flight this week, the headline-grabbing events have left the flying public to wonder whether it’s still safe to fly.The reality, statistics show, remains that getting on a Boeing or Airbus SE jetliner is still exponentially safer than the drive to the airport. Last year, there wasn’t a single fatality among the 37 million commercial airline flights.While 2024 won’t match that record, it’s been an average year in terms of airline safety. Yet public perception remains jittery. US web searches for “flight safety” hit the highest level in March since October 2014, according to Google Trends.That year a decade ago was a particularly bad one for aviation fatalities. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March was followed by the shooting down of the same carrier’s Flight 17 over Ukraine in July and an AirAsia crash in December.The accidents this year have caused far fewer fatalities than in early 2014 or in 2019, when the second of two Boeing 737 Max flights crashed in March, killing 157 people in Ethiopia.Five people aboard a Japan Coast Guard turboprop lost their lives in early January when the plane ventured onto the runway path of an incoming Airbus A350. While nobody died in the Jan. 5 structural failure of a 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Air Group Inc., the accident dealt a serious blow to Boeing’s credibility and to passenger confidence.Since then, a series of more minor incidents, from a Delta Air Lines Inc Boeing 757 losing a nose wheel to a United Airlines Holdings Inc. 737 Max skidding off a runway in Houston, have received widespread media coverage.On the flight from London to Singapore this week, a 73-year-old British man died from a suspected heart attack after the plane encountered severe turbulence.“There is reason for the public to be concerned but I think the concern is elevated because of the real focus that some news stations have given,” said John Goglia, an aviation safety expert and former member of the National Transportation Safety Board. “The wheel falling off the aeroplane never would have gone anywhere; in some local newspapers it may have been a one-inch column.”Indeed, government statistics indicate the US is having a fairly normal year.In the US, there were 11 accidents and incidents on commercial passenger or cargo flights in the first quarter, according to the NTSB database. That’s slightly above an average of 9.7 in the decade from 2010 to 2019. Serious cases stood at four in the quarter, slightly above the pre-Covid average of 3.3. The figures are based on cases the NTSB investigates, which include all accidents and only some incidents, so the numbers can vary.Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration reported progress in one problem area. The rate of serious runway incursions in the first quarter decreased by 59% from the same period in 2023, a historically high year for such events. The current rate for 2024 is below the annual average of 0.31 per 1 million aircraft operations over the last decade, according to data provided to Bloomberg.“Aviation is the safest way to travel and that’s because we never take anything for granted,” said the FAA, which is responsible for airline safety in the US. “We are always looking for risk and ways to mitigate it.”The extended spotlight on Boeing has brought significant attention to the planemaker, with some fliers filtering out its 737 Max jets. Yet many of the incidents have occurred with older planes, and are more likely to be traced back to an airline maintenance or operational issue than the original design or build quality.“In this environment, any operational event no matter how routine can get outsize attention,” Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said at the company’s May 17 annual meeting.Many of the events which have worried fliers this year, from landing gear collapsing to pilots overshooting runways, are classified as incidents rather than the more serious “accident,” which the International Civil Aviation Organization defines as involving a person being fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustaining damage requiring repairs or the aircraft going missing.That doesn’t mean there aren’t improvements to be made, according to Loren Groff, the chief data scientist at the NTSB. He pointed to the work being done to improve staffing and training for air-traffic controllers after some recent errors and near-collisions on runways.“Overall, it’s amazing that the US aviation system, and most of the world in general, can do something so complex so successfully,” Groff said. “Would I be afraid of aviation in any way? No, absolutely not.”","A spate of high-profile airline accidents have left a lasting impression on the public. US web searches for “flight safety’ hit the highest level in March since October 2014. Last year, there wasn’t a single fatality among the 37 million commercial airline flights.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110386003,imgsize-2362214,width-400,resizemode-4/110386003.jpg"

That makes positives including demand for the South Korean firm’s AI-related chipmaking equipment and buying of the stock by its billionaire chief executive look more than fully priced in.Foreign investors have started to pare holdings after pouring money into the shares last year. Foreign ownership of Hanmi Semi declined to 13.2% as of Wednesday from 16.5% in mid-February.“People who bought out of ignorance have left, and now some investors are having second thoughts,” said Yoon Joonwon, a fund manager at DS Asset Management Co. Foreigners may still be attracted to the potential but are less certain now, while local funds “seem to be holding despite doubts.”The stock has more than doubled this year alone, making it the top performer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index , largely on excitement over the company’s thermal compression bonders.

His continual share purchases over the past year as well as expectations that Hanmi Semi will be added to the blue-chip Kospi 200 Index in the June review have been two additional positive catalysts for the stock.“It’s very unique that the CEO keeps buying shares,” said Ahn Hyunsang, chief executive officer at Korea Investment Research Institute. “The stock is very expensive based on the price-to-earnings ratio, so I’m not sure if there are any more legs to this rally.”Hanmi Semiconductor is trading at around 80 times estimate earnings for the next year, more than all other stocks in the 40-member FactSet Asia Semiconductor Index.According to DS Asset’s Yoon, the company would need to make 1 trillion won ($730 billion) in annual net income to justify its current valuation.

SEC opens the door for spot ether ETFs in big crypto victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sec-opens-the-door-for-spot-ether-etfs-in-big-crypto-victory/articleshow/110378077.cms,"Significant victory

Crypto crackdown

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday paved the way for trading in exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency Ether , putting the digital-asset industry on the cusp of a significant milestone.In a first-of-its-kind blessing, the SEC signed off on a proposal by venues run by Cboe Global Markets Inc., Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange to list products tied to the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency. The move, which had seemed unlikely as recently as last week, removes a key hurdle for spot Ether ETF trading in the US. Issuers now need a separate sign-off from the regulator; no deadline has been set for that decision.Investment companies, including VanEck, ARK Investment Management, BlackRock Inc., and Fidelity Investments, are all vying for crucial first-mover advantage in the race to launch a spot Ether ETF. Their interest has been piqued by billions of dollars gushing into new Bitcoin ETFs since January when the SEC signed off on trading in those products.Shares of Coinbase gained as much as 4.1% in after-hours trading Thursday, while Robinhood shares rose nearly 3%. The crypto market response to the news was relatively muted - Ether traded around $3819.80 in the immediate aftermath of the releaseBeyond ETFs, the SEC’s announcement on Thursday is laced with US financial policy implications.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been ambiguous on his views over whether Ether is a security, stoking concerns that the agency was hardening its stance. Crypto enthusiasts say they are worried about him trying to subject Ether — and potentially projects based on the Ethereum blockchain — to the agency’s tough, expensive and onerous investor-protection rules.Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US’s other main market regulator with jurisdiction over derivatives, has signaled that it doesn’t consider Ether to be a security. The CFTC has for years allowed trading in Ether futures by CME Group Inc.As recently as last week, companies were banking the SEC would reject the Cboe plan — and potentially others — by Thursday’s deadline. Additional SEC approval is still needed for the issuers, but the signoff is a significant victory for the industry.Backers hope a listing will bring a new flood of money to the asset class by appealing to retail and institutional investors, who are interested in crypto but more comfortable investing in ETFs than tokens.Overall, investors, many who retreated after FTX exchange’s collapse, have already been piling back into crypto. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, is up more than 60% this year alone thanks to the frenzy.Some of that rally is due to optimism that the US crackdown on the industry may be waning. The Republican-led House on Wednesday advanced sweeping cryptocurrency legislation despite opposition from the White House and Gensler. Although the Senate isn’t expected to approve the measure, it garnered some Democratic support in the House.On the jurisdictional question, Lee Reiners, policy director of the Duke Financial Economics Center at Duke University, said that exchange bids to list the products were based on Ether being a commodity and not a security. An SEC decision to green light the plan bolsters the view that the SEC still considers Ether not to be a security, he said.Investment companies seeking to list the products have already been making concessions to win SEC approval.Fidelity Investments said it will keep Ether it buys as part of the ETF out of programs that pay rewards for blockchain maintenance, known as staking. The latter has been a hot-button issue for Ether because it raises questions about whether the token should be treated as a security. Last year, the SEC in a lawsuit accused Coinbase Global Inc. of breaking its rules by offering staking services.",The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday paved the way for trading in exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency Ether.

Rare Rs 10 notes recovered from 1918 shipwreck to go under the hammer in London,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/two-10-rupee-notes-recovered-from-ss-shirala-to-go-under-the-hammer-in-mayfair/articleshow/110373472.cms,"(Photo credit: NOONANS)

LONDON: Two 10-rupee banknotes recovered from the wreck of the SS Shirala , which was sunk by a German U-boat on July 2, 1918, will be offered at the auction house Noonans in Mayfair next week as part of its sale of world banknotes.

Lots 474 and 475 are each estimated to fetch £2,000-2,600 (Rs 2.1 lakh to Rs 2.7 lakh) at the sale on May 29. Both are described as unsigned, on superb quality original paper, and very rare.

Thomasina Smith, worldwide head of numismatics at Noonans, said: “Whole blocks of these notes, along with lots of provisions ranging from marmalade to ammunition, were on their way to Bombay from London when the boat was sunk. Many notes floated to shore, including unsigned five and 10 rupees notes, and a signed one rupee one (which also features in this auction). Most were recovered and subsequently destroyed by the authorities and new ones were printed to replace them. However, a very few examples remained in private hands. These are in very good condition — they must have been in the middle of a tightly bound bundle, so didn’t make contact with the sea. It’s also wonderful that they bear consecutive serial numbers.”
