, good spin attack should help visitors challenge India in Test series

FIGHTING SPIRIT IN THE GROUP

SPIN STRENGTH

EXPERIENCE IN THE RANKS

CHENNAI: After conquering Pakistan for the first time, Bangladesh arrived in Chennai on Sunday with renewed hope ahead of their next long-format assignment in India. Having achieved half of a south Asian 'double' that once appeared impossible - winning Test series in Pakistan and India - Najmul Hossain Shanto 's Bangladesh now have a spring in their step.Bangladesh have shown that they have it in them to punch above their weight and India cannot afford to take the visiting team lightly in the forthcoming two-match contest, beginning with the game at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Thursday.Bangladesh displayed a never-say-die attitude when the chips were down in the recent Pakistan series; the best case in point being the miraculous recovery they produced in the second Test in Rawalpindi.The Shanto-led side turned the tables in stunning fashion after tottering at 26-6 while responding to Pakistan's first innings total of 274. Even in the first Test, Bangladesh never gave up; they emerged victorious by 10 wickets after Pakistan managed to post a huge first-innings score of 448-6 declared.A similar fighting spirit will be much needed in the Chennai Test, if Bangladesh are to execute what Shanto is expecting of them. ""We want to play well on all five days, that is our goal. We want to get the result in the last session of the Test match. At that time, the match can go in any direction. It is an opportunity (first Test victory in India), we will play for the win,"" Shanto said in the pre-departure press conference in Dhaka.It is to be recalled that Bangladesh ran India close in the second match of the two-game series at home in December 2022.India may have to think twice in case they plan to dish out a rank turner at Chepauk, given the spin strength in the opposition camp. Bangladesh have three potent slow bowling operators in Shakib Al Hasan , Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Taijul Islam , with each one of them capable of feasting in favourable conditions.The pace pack does not have the highest quality, but will draw confidence from their superb show in the second Pakistan Test - the fast bowlers bagged all 10 wickets in the second innings. ""We are in a good place with our bowling attack, both spin and pace. Our pacers are behind them (India's fast bowlers) in terms of experience, but our spin attack is close to theirs. They can bowl in any condition. All I can say is that we will give our 100 per cent,"" said Shanto, who will miss injured left-arm pacer Shoriful Islam In pressure situations, Bangladesh can turn to experienced campaigners like Shakib and Mushfiqur Rahim. Most of the other members in the core group also have enough matches under their belt to handle crunch moments. ""We can make a difference only if we play as a team. The whole team has to play together. As for Shakib, I am hopeful that he will do well. The expectations are always the same with him. He has been in good form with the ball,"" Shanto said.The Bangladesh players are not alien to the conditions as the main members were in action in the 2023 ODI WC contest against New Zealand.","Bangladesh have shown that they have it in them to punch above their weight.

Babar's recent form and leadership have drawn harsh criticism from former players, as he hasn't scored a half-century in his last 16 Test innings.Younis expressed his disappointment, stating, ""If Babar and other top players deliver on the field, then results will be clear to everyone.Humare players khelte kam, bolte zyada hai. (I have observed that our players tend to talk more than they perform).""The former captain also advised Babar to learn from Virat Kohli 's example, highlighting how the India star batter relinquished his captaincy to focus more on his batting.""Look at Virat Kohli.

How Sachin Tendulkar mastered the upper cut shot to perfection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/how-sachin-tendulkar-mastered-the-upper-cut-shot-to-perfection/articleshow/113377586.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sachin Tendulkar , one of the greatest cricketers of all time, was known for a wide array of classic shots that demonstrated his technical brilliance and adaptability.Tendulkar's shot-making was a perfect blend of technical mastery and timing. His ability to play a wide range of strokes against all types of bowling made him one of the most feared and respected batsmen in cricket .Tendulkar had one of the most refined techniques in cricket. His balance, footwork, and head position were exemplary. He made sure to get his body in the right position before playing a shot, whether against pace or spin. His compactness at the crease allowed him to play both on the front and back foot with ease, making him equally strong in defense and attack.Tendulkar popularized the uppercut, particularly during the latter part of his career. It involved slicing a short-pitched delivery over the slips or third-man boundary. It became a potent weapon, especially against fast bowlers.There is a video doing the rounds on the internet where Tendulkar talks about how he came up with the upper cut shot and how he mastered it to perfection.Talking about facing short-pitched deliveries from pacers, Tendulkar says in the video, ""We were asked to leave the ball any shorter than that, then to let the ball go, because you cannot be on top of the ball to something which is there. I mean if you look to keep it down then it's exactly at a catching height where the fielders are.""Tendulkar continues, ""So in 2001, we were playing South Africa in Bloemfontein and I thought being on top of the ball is not helping us score runs, why not get under the ball and play over the slip cordon in Test cricket. In Test cricket, very rarely you would find a third man in place, so I felt that was a scoring opportunity rather than letting the ball go because by nature instinctively I wanted to hit the ball and score runs.""Tendulkar's cut shot against fast bowlers like Brett Lee and Shoaib Akhtar was a demonstration of his brilliant hand-eye coordination, quick reflexes, and mastery of the game's technique.Both Lee and Akhtar were among the fastest bowlers of their era, regularly bowling over 150 kmph, but Tendulkar had the skill to turn their pace to his advantage, particularly with his cut shot.Brett Lee, known for his express pace and aggressive bowling, often tested batsmen with short-pitched deliveries outside off-stump. Tendulkar , with his impeccable footwork and technique, would use the pace of Lee to execute his cut shot, playing it late and using the width Lee provided. The late cut was one of Sachin's specialties against Lee, sending the ball racing past backward point or gully.Shoaib Akhtar, known as the "" Rawalpindi Express ,"" bowled with menacing speed and aggression. Tendulkar's ability to deal with Akhtar's pace was evident during the 2003 ODI World Cup and India's tour of Pakistan in 2004. Against Akhtar's fast, short-pitched deliveries outside off-stump, Tendulkar often used the cut shot to exploit the gaps between point and gully.One of the most famous moments in cricket history occurred in the 2003 World Cup when Tendulkar uppercut a short-pitched delivery from Akhtar over third man for a six. Although it was more of an uppercut than a traditional cut shot, it was another demonstration of Tendulkar's brilliance in using pace to his advantage. This shot, in particular, stands out in the minds of cricket fans for its audacity and timing.Tendulkar's ability to play the cut shot late allowed him to use the pace of the bowler, particularly against deliveries outside off-stump. His control over the shot meant that even if it went in the air, it was over the fielders and into the stands.Tendulkar would quickly move his feet into position, getting inside the line of the ball to either play the shot late or early depending on the bounce and pace. This allowed him to manipulate the field with precision.Even against bowlers as fast as Brett Lee and Shoaib Akhtar, Sachin displayed exceptional control, ensuring that the ball was placed in the gaps, often racing to the boundary with little effort.Tendulkar's cut shot against these two fiery fast bowlers exemplified his ability to neutralize extreme pace with finesse and technical superiority. These moments, especially his uppercut shots, remain etched in cricketing folklore.Tendulkar's shot-making was a mix of flawless technique, immense mental strength, and the ability to adapt to every situation. This is what made him one of the most complete and successful batsmen in cricket history.","Sachin Tendulkar's shot-making was a perfect blend of technical mastery and timing.

In the context of results, India has ticked all the boxes at the Asian Champions Trophy at Hulunbuir, China. Having remained unbeaten in five league matches, India have scored 21 goals - the highest by a stretch - and the four goals conceded are the least among the six teams in the fray.Despite the overriding dominance over the rest of the Asian teams, chief coach Craig Fulton will expect much from the talent he has at his disposal.India seemed to drop intensity in their attacks towards the business end of the league. They started well, routing hosts China 3-0, before registering convincing 5-1 and 8-1 wins against Japan and Malaysia respectively. But they were tested by both Korea (3-1) and Pakistan (2-1).Up against a plucky Korea in the semifinal on Monday, they need to up their game. The young strikers, who were scrappy in patches against Pakistan on Friday, will have to make amends. Collection of aerial balls and stopping inside the striking circle will have to be shored up. The midfield, led by the seasoned Manpreet Singh and Vivek Sagar Prasad, needs to plug the holes which were exposed during the last two league fixtures.On the brighter side, the form of skipper Harmanpreet Singh has been the USP for the defending champions. Apart from stoutly defending the backline, Harmanpreet has also been at the heart of India's penalty corner conversions, which has resulted in five goals. The Indians will also hope for the variations in penalty corners to work better for them.Although India will have the upper hand, Korea is no easy meat. Their forward line is quick on the counter, and they have thrived in the form of their drag flick ace Jihun Yang in penalty corners. With seven goals, Yang is currently the leading goal-scorer of the competition, and he could well prove a handful for goalkeepers Krishan Pathak and Suraj Karkera, who guard the posts equally during a match.""Korea is a tough team, they defend very well and can counterattack fast and skillfully,"" conceded Harmanpreet.In the other semis, Pakistan, who finished second behind India on the points table, will take on China.",India have remained unbeaten in five league matches.

In the world of sports, partnerships on the field often evolve into powerful unions off it. Among the many examples of athletic excellence and personal bonds, five iconic sports couples — Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf , Bastian Schweinsteiger and Ana Ivanovic , Bart Conner and Nadia Comaneci , David Lee and Caroline Wozniacki , Jozy Altidore and Sloane Stephens — showcase the perfect marriage of success in both love and their respective sporting careers.Their journeys, filled with triumphs and shared experiences, highlight how passion for sports can translate into strong, enduring relationships.Few couples in sports have achieved as much individual success as Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf. With a combined 30 Grand Slam singles titles, the tennis duo stands as one of the most successful pairs in sports history.Agassi, known for his powerful baseline game and charismatic personality, was a dominant force in tennis during the 1990s, while Graf’s elegance and dominance on the court earned her 22 Grand Slam titles.The couple, who married in 2001, initially kept their relationship low-key despite both being global superstars. Agassi and Graf have since focused on their family and philanthropic efforts, founding schools and engaging in charitable work through the Agassi Foundation.Bastian Schweinsteiger, the German football icon who lifted the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and Ana Ivanovic, a Serbian tennis star and former world No. 1, are one of sports' most adored couples. Their romance began after they both reached the pinnacle of their respective careers and culminated in a beautiful wedding in 2016.Schweinsteiger enjoyed a celebrated football career, winning titles with Bayern Munich and representing Germany on the international stage. Known for his leadership and midfield mastery, he was a key figure in Germany's World Cup-winning squad. Ivanovic, meanwhile, took the tennis world by storm when she won the French Open in 2008 and reached the top of the WTA rankings.The couple has since focused on family life, with Ivanovic retiring from tennis to prioritize motherhood, while Schweinsteiger pursued a brief career in broadcasting after his football retirement.Bart Conner and Nadia Comaneci’s love story is steeped in Olympic history. Both are legendary gymnasts, with Comaneci being the first gymnast to score a perfect 10 at the Olympics. Her historic achievement at the 1976 Montreal Games changed the sport forever, making her one of the most celebrated athletes in Olympic history.Conner, an American gymnastics star, also reached the pinnacle of success by winning two gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Their paths crossed after their competitive careers, and they eventually married in 1996. Together, they run a gymnastics academy and continue to promote the sport globally.Their relationship is a testament to the enduring connection that can come from shared experiences at the highest level of competition. Despite retiring from professional gymnastics, they remain highly involved in the sporting world, inspiring younger generations to pursue excellence in athletics.David Lee, a two-time NBA All-Star and 2015 NBA Champion, and Caroline Wozniacki, a former world No. 1 tennis player, form another high-profile sports couple. Lee, who played for teams such as the New York Knicks and Golden State Warriors, retired after a successful basketball career, while Wozniacki won her first Grand Slam at the 2018 Australian Open.The couple married in 2019, and since then, Wozniacki has retired from professional tennis to focus on family life, while Lee has continued to support her in her various ventures.

SACHIN TENDULKAR - THE RUNOUT THAT TRIGGERED A HUGE RIOT AND EMPTIED AN ENTIRE STADIUM!!

NEW DELHI: The 1999 Kolkata Test between India and Pakistan remains one of the most iconic—and controversial—matches in cricket history due to the controversial run-out of India's hero Sachin Tendulkar involving Shoaib Akhtar The Test was initially scheduled to be the third and final match of the series between India and Pakistan. However, it was later designated as the opening match of the inaugural Asian Test Championship .Pakistan had set a daunting target of 279 for India. The Indian team had a strong start, reaching 143 for the loss of two wickets. However, an unfortunate incident occurred on the fourth afternoon of the match, which marred the spirit of the game.Sachin Tendulkar had scored 7 runs when he played a shot off Wasim Akram towards deep midwicket. He completed two runs, achieving the milestone of 5000 Test runs, and attempted a third. However, substitute fielder Nadeem Khan threw the ball from the deep, hitting the stumps directly.Under normal circumstances, it would have been an easy third run, even with the direct hit. But as Tendulkar was running, he collided with Shoaib Akhtar, who was positioned near the stumps to collect the throw. As a result of the collision, Tendulkar ended up outside his crease, although he might have been just inside at the moment of impact.The on-field umpire, Steve Bucknor, referred the decision to the third umpire, KT Francis. After a prolonged deliberation, Francis declared Tendulkar out. Notably, this series marked the first instance where all officials were neutral.The third umpire reviewed the footage, and despite the crowd's disbelief, Tendulkar was given out. The dismissal was legal under the laws of cricket, but the circumstances were seen by many Indian fans as unfair, as it was clear the collision had slowed Tendulkar down.The crowd at Eden Gardens erupted in anger. Boos filled the stadium, and tensions boiled over. Some spectators even resorted to throwing objects onto the field, halting the game. Security forces had to intervene, and the situation grew so intense that police were deployed to clear the stands.Tendulkar's departure had ignited not just disappointment but fury among the fans, as they believed India's greatest hope had been unfairly removed from the game.After a period of uncertainty, the umpires decided to escort the players off the field, signaling an early break for tea. It was solely due to the heartfelt appeals made by Tendulkar and the ICC president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, that the game was given the green light to proceed.After the interruption, the match continued in an eerie atmosphere. India's batting lineup struggled without Tendulkar, and Pakistan went on to win the Test by 46 runs.","The 1999 Kolkata Test between India and Pakistan remains one of the most iconic—and controversial—matches in cricket history.

His second strike before the break was a well-guided finish from the edge of the box, further cementing Barcelona's control.Dani Olmo and Pedri Gonzalez added to the scoreline in the second half, with Olmo's sublime finish from a tight angle and Pedri's composed effort after being played through by Marc Casado highlighting Barcelona's attacking acumen.Girona, who had a remarkable third-place finish in the previous season, struggled to cope with Barcelona's intensity. Despite Cristhian Stuani's late consolation goal, the hosts were unable to mount a significant challenge, having lost several key players during the summer transfer window.The only blemishes for Barcelona were Gazzaniga's denial of Robert Lewandowski 's chipped effort and Ferran Torres's late red card for a high tackle on Yaser Asprilla. However, these incidents did little to dampen Barcelona's overall dominance and their 100 percent record at the start of the campaign.On Saturday, reigning champions Real Madrid secured a 2-0 win over Real Sociedad, moving them to second place, four points behind Flick's Barcelona.Later on Sunday, Atletico Madrid will host Valencia, while Athletic Bilbao are set to visit Las Palmas.",Lamine Yamal scores twice as Barcelona thrash Girona 4-1.

However, his drastic on-field actions made headlines around the globe.The match started with high tension, as fouls and disputes between players escalated quickly.In the second half, the game turned ugly when a player from one of the teams allegedly assaulted Murta after disagreeing with one of his decisions.The situation got heated, and rather than using a red card to discipline the players, Murta left the field and returned holding a firearm.Watch:Murta, who had the gun in his possession as part of his duties as a law enforcement officer, brandished the weapon in front of players.Players, coaches, and fans were stunned as they tried to de-escalate the situation.Fortunately, no shots were fired, and other match officials and players eventually calmed Murta down, convincing him to put the gun away.The shocking incident didn’t lead to any serious injuries, but it raised concerns about security and professionalism in Brazil’s lower football divisions.Murta later explained that he felt threatened after being assaulted and reacted instinctively as a police officer.Brazilian authorities investigated the incident, and Murta was required to undergo a psychological evaluation to determine his fitness to continue officiating.","Gabriel Murta pulled out a gun during an amateur league game in Brazil.

Chernyshov has his feet on ground as Md Sporing gear up for ISL debut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/chernyshov-has-his-feet-on-ground-as-md-sporing-gear-up-for-isl-debut/articleshow/113371314.cms,"KOLKATA: Mohammedan Sporting , by their coach Andrey Chernyshov ’s own admission, are gearing up for a “historic” beginning. Yet amid the euphoria of debuting in the Indian Super League — as they prepare to host NorthEast United FC at the Kishore Bharati Stadium on Monday — the Russian coach is also keeping his feet on the ground.“It's a good feeling because we are finally at the top level. Last season it was a dream to play in the ISL and now we are here.This is really a special match, a historic match for me and the players,” Chernyshov told reporters on Sunday.The Russian shepherded the black-and-white brigade to the I-League summit in the last season, thus becoming the second team to have gained promotion to the ISL. But being aware of the challenge ahead, he wants to keep the team’s ambitions rather subdued.According to their defender Samad Ali Mallick, the team is raring to go, banking on a good pre-season and youthful exuberance. Interestingly, a number of Mohammedan Sporting players — like Rochharzela, Gaurav Bora, and Joe Zoherliana — have had previous stints with the Highlanders as well. However, an ACL injury to Ghanaian Abdul Kadiri — who was supposed to be the team’s defensive mainstay — has possibly ended his season before the start of ISL, leaving the Russian facing the ground reality more coldly and less excitedly.""It’s easy to say we want to be in the top six, we want to be first or second and so on. But we have not played before in ISL and we need to know where we stand. We have so many young players in the team and they have good futures. But it’s after playing 4-5 matches you start understanding what you need to change in your game and what is needed to win,” Chernyshov further noted.It will be a different beginning for NorthEast United as well.Having announced their intent by winning the Durand Cup a fortnight ago, Juan Pedro Benali’s Highlanders will return to the city of their conquest with more conviction and perhaps carrying the favourites’ tag. However, the NorthEast coach is not in the mood of taking the debutants lightly.“It will be a dangerous game for both teams. Mohammedan SC, playing in front of their fans, will try to show that they deserve to be in ISL, that they deserve it as champions of the I-League. It won’t be easy and we must be ready for the challenge,” he said.",Mohammedan Sporting will make their debut in the Indian Super League on Monday. They will face NorthEast United FC at the Kishore Bharati Stadium. The Russian coach Andrey Chernyshov is keeping his feet on the ground.

NEW DELHI: Football is the world's most popular sport, captivating millions with its excitement, passion, and drama. However, for some footballers, the game has also come with a darker side—life-threatening risks.Over the years, a few top footballers have faced chilling threats, not from rival fans or on-pitch incidents, but from powerful and dangerous drug cartels .While most footballers don’t face death threats, those who play in or are from countries with high levels of organized crime can sometimes become targets due to their fame, wealth, or influence.In some countries, particularly during the 1990s in Colombia, drug cartels had a significant influence over football, using it to launder money. Athletes from these regions may be more susceptible to threats from criminal organizations.Many footballers in countries like Brazil and Argentina have security teams to protect them and their families from threats. However, their high-profile status makes them visible targets.Without any further ado, we dive into five football stars who encountered these harrowing threats and the circumstances that led to these terrifying moments.Diego Maradona, one of the most iconic footballers in history, was no stranger to the world of crime, particularly during his time playing for Napoli in Italy.Maradona’s battles with drug addiction became notorious, and at one point, his life was reportedly under threat from the Neapolitan Camorra mafia .The mafia, powerful in Naples, allegedly became involved with Maradona due to his cocaine habit and his influence in the city. he was threatened by the Neapolitan Camorra mafia due to his drug use and debts during his time at Napoli.While Maradona survived these dangerous times, his relationship with criminal elements highlighted the vulnerability of high-profile athletes to organized crime, particularly when they are dealing with personal demons.Maradona’s personal struggles and connection with organized crime in Naples added to his tumultuous career, making him vulnerable to threats from the underworld.His later years were filled with reflection on those turbulent times, though the constant threats and associations left a permanent mark on his life.Lionel Messi, one of the greatest footballers of all time, if not the greatest, has largely managed to stay away from controversy. However, in 2023, his name became entangled with a dangerous criminal world.Gunmen opened fire on a supermarket owned by Messi’s in-laws in his hometown of Rosario, Argentina. While no one was harmed, a menacing note left at the scene read: ""Messi, we’re waiting for you.""Rosario, once known for its football stars, has seen a surge in drug violence, with cartels expanding their control over the city. Messi's hometown of Rosario has become a hub of drug cartel violence, posing a threat even to its most famous resident.Though Messi himself wasn’t directly involved with any criminal activity, the incident underscored how even global icons aren’t immune to threats from organized crime.Argentina winger Ángel Di María found himself at the centre of a chilling threat amid a surge of drug-related violence in his hometown of Rosario.On the outskirts of the city, a message left at his family home warned him not to return to Rosario, ominously stating, ""Tell your son Angel not to come back to Rosario because we will kill a family member."" The threat was delivered alongside a mention of the provincial governor, Maximiliano Pullaro, with the warning, ""We don't leave paper notes. We leave bullets and dead people behind.""This unsettling event follows a similar threat aimed at Lionel Messi in 2023, where gunmen attacked a supermarket owned by Messi’s in-laws.Di María, currently playing for Benfica, expressed his desire to retire at his boyhood club Rosario Central, but this message casts a shadow on his future plans.Salvador Cabañas was at the peak of his career when he suffered a life-altering attack in 2010. The Paraguayan footballer, then a star striker for Club América in Mexico, was shot in the head at close range inside a nightclub bathroom.The shooter was identified as José Jorge Balderas Garza, also known as ""El JJ,"" a figure associated with Mexico's drug cartels.This horrific event not only ended Cabañas' football career but also became a symbol of the violent intersection between organized crime and football in Mexico.The incident occurred at the Bar Bar nightclub, a place frequented by athletes, celebrities, and drug lords alike. According to witnesses, a confrontation arose when Garza questioned Cabañas about his recent lack of goals, sparking an argument that led to Garza drawing a gun and shooting the footballer.Despite the severity of the wound, Cabañas miraculously survived, although the bullet lodged in his brain. His recovery was remarkable, but his professional football career came to an abrupt end, leaving the sport in shock.Fourteen years after the attack, new details have emerged about what transpired that night. According to crime journalist Carlos Jiménez, security footage and witness testimonies revealed that Garza felt provoked by Cabañas's response and, in a show of power, shot him.Perhaps the most tragic story in football history involves Colombian defender Andrés Escobar. After scoring an unfortunate own goal in the 1994 FIFA World Cup match against the United States, Escobar became a scapegoat for Colombia’s early exit from the tournament.Colombia's football during the 1990s was deeply influenced by drug cartels, including Pablo Escobar’s Medellín cartel, which frequently used the sport to launder money. Colombia, under immense pressure to perform, had been seen as a dark horse in the competition.Unfortunately, Escobar’s error wasn’t forgiven in his home country. Just days after the team’s elimination, Escobar was shot and killed in Medellín, reportedly as a result of a drug cartel member’s rage over losing money in bets.The brutal murder, connected to Colombia's infamous drug cartels, shocked the world and underlined the dangerous intersection between football and organized crime during that era.Football has the power to unite people across the globe, but for these five athletes, it also led to terrifying brushes with organized crime.Whether directly involved with cartels or simply targeted because of their fame, these footballers were not immune to the dangerous forces of the underworld.The stories of Andrés Escobar, Lionel Messi, Salvador Cabañas, Ángel Di María, and Diego Maradona serve as sobering reminders of the risks that come with fame in a world where crime and sports sometimes collide.","Argentina winger Ángel Di María found himself at the centre of a chilling threat amid a surge of drug-related violence in his hometown of Rosario.

It was the younger Borg's first win in the Davis Cup, having lost all the three matches he had played earlier. And it came in his first Cup match at home with dad watching, which made it even more special.""It was a great feeling, I could really feel the support of the fans today. And having my dad out there, I feel really happy,"" Borg said.For the Indian team, the first day rout exposed the lack of depth in their ranks. With the country's No. 1 player Sumit Nagal , currently ranked 82, as well as top doubles player Yuki Bhambri unavailable, their hopes of beating Sweden - who are 5-0 in head to head - for the first time ever were dashed even before the first ball was hit.And the ball proved to be a key factor.Captain Rohit Rajpal had spoken in the lead-up to the tie about the surface playing ""medium"" - neither fast nor slow - and how it might suit his players. But the Indians didn't account for the ball changing its character during the course of play.""After a few points, the ball was becoming fluffy and sitting,"" Ramkumar said. ""He (Borg) was staying really back and coming up with great returns."" Rajpal said, quite helplessly, ""Well, we had to do something different. We are not going to beat them from the back of the court. It was a bad day at the office.""The captain also made a pointed remark: ""The idea was not to come in at the net at the right moments, not for the sake of going to the net.""So, while the visitors aimed to take the fight to the hosts and put the pressure on them, the script played out just the opposite way.Ymer, son of Ethiopian immigrants, broke Balaji in the very first game and that set the tone for the rest of the day. Ramkumar, formerly 111 and adept at serve and volley, broke Borg early on but it proved to be false dawn. It had more to do with Borg's nerves.","India's serve-and-volley strategy fails to yield result as Balaji and Ramkumar lose their singles ties.

MATCH SCHEDULE

It has been an eventful year for Sriram Balaji and the amiable, battle-hardened pro will hold the key to India’s fortunes in the Davis Cup World Group I tie against Sweden in Stockholm on Saturday and Sunday.Balaji will open India’s campaign when he takes on Elias Ymer in the opening singles before Ramkumar Ramanathan tackles Leo Borg, the 21-year-old son of legendary Bjorn Borg, in the second match, as per the draw made on Friday.The Tamil Nadu combination will return to action on Sunday as they play the doubles rubber against hosts’ doubles specialists Andre Gorasnsson (aged 30 and ranked 66th in doubles) and Filip Bergevi (30, 125) at the Royal Tennis Hall.It is to Balaji’s credit that, despite him being a doubles specialist, captain Rohit Rajpal opted for his experience and reliability instead of saving him for the doubles and relying on the big serving Ramkumar to fetch him the two singles points.Balaji had a successful outing in singles in the previous tie, too, when he beat Pakistan’s ageing Akeel Khan in Islamabad earlier this year. But taking on Ymer, a 28-year-old who has been ranked 105 before and currently 238, will be an altogether different proposition. The Ethiopian-origin Swede has 11 titles, including six Challengers, the last of which came in Pune in 2018.Although he has run into a rough patch in recent times, he continues to play at the top level and is an excellent ball striker. If anything, turning out for his national team could be exactly the motivation Ymer needs to recover his form. Besides, he should have now been able to put behind him the emotional crisis arising out of his elder brother Mikael being handed a doping ban, which comes to an end later this year.But Balaji had been ranked in the top-300 and won 11 titles in the pro circuit in singles before focussing on doubles.What will be going for him, above all, is that he has been playing at the highest level with featuring in the Paris Olympics proving to be a cherished feather in the cap.“I played all the Grand Slams this year, I have been playing my best tennis. And playing for the country is always special. I keep practising singles and we played a lot of sets in practice after arriving here,” Balaji told TOIafter the draw.Asked how he intends to translate his doubles experience and skills to singles play, Balaji said: “I don’t want to give away too much of our strategy but I would be looking to keep the points short and put the pressure back on them.”By playing Balaji in combination with Ramkumar on Day 1, captain Rajpal has made clear his strategy.“What we don’t want is getting caught in long rallies,” Rajpal said.“They like to stay at the back (on the baseline) and both Ram and Balaji are good in serve and volley. They stand tall at the net, let them (opposition) try and pass them (Ram and Balaji).“They are playing at home. So, as Balaji said, we will try to put the pressure back on them.”For Ramkumar, the challenge will be to shrug off his poor form in singles — he has not won a match since May — and put his best foot forward, as he has often done when playing for India.“The surface is playing medium fast, and the ball is staying low. So it will be good for some slices. I will try to focus on my game,” Ram said.Saturday (from 5.30 pm IST):Sriram Balaji vs Elias Ymer; Ramkumar Ramanathan vs Leo Borg. Sunday (from 3.30 pm IST): Balaji/Ramkumar vs Andre Goransson/Filip Bergevi; Ramkumar vs Ymer; Balaji vs Borg.",Sriram Balaji will open India’s campaign when he takes on Elias Ymer in the opening singles before Ramkumar Ramanathan tackles Leo Borg. The Tamil Nadu combination will return to action on Sunday as they play the doubles rubber against hosts’ doubles specialists Andre Gorasnsson and Filip Bergevi.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113341134,imgsize-66878,width-400,resizemode-4/113341134.jpg"

If one has to characterise Leo Borg in one word, that would be it.It is one thing handling the pressure that comes with answering to a famous surname, quite another to embrace it and give your best day in and day out — to justify the adulation, to sort of earn the tag, maybe.“It’s a special thing to me to have a dad like him,” Borg said of his father, tennis legend Bjorn Borg , during a video call from his home town Stockholm on Thursday.Sweden host India in a World Group I tie on Saturday and Sunday.“He has done a lot of things in his time, and I feel really blessed because he has all the knowledge I need to get (from a father and a coach).“Of course, he’s been really supportive, and he has always been there for me on the tennis (court) and outside tennis. He’s been the best dad, actually. So I’m pretty, really proud of him, and he has a really special place in my heart.”On the tennis front, there’s no comparison between the father and the son.Borg senior, 68 now, lifted Sweden to its maiden Davis Cup win in 1975 when he was just 19. If his 33 singles win streak is a record in the tournament history, his six French Open trophies — four of them in a row — and five straight Wimbledon titles put him in a different plane altogether.Anyone else, in any walk of life, would have walked away from that borrowed stardom and harsh scrutiny that comes with it. Borg the junior has decided to not only play the sport, but also excel in it.Currently ranked 603, Leo had risen to 334 in the ATP charts last year before suffering a loss of form. He has recovered some of his level and motivation with a title and runner-up finish in the dreary ITF circuit in Thailand in recent weeks, jumping 169 places in the ranking ladder.Leo, 21, put it down to a “simple” advice he received from his father long ago.“Since I was really young, he said, ‘it’s really simple, never stop fighting until the last point’. And that’s been a very good advice, just to fight the whole match and the life outside tennis also. That’s a really simple thing, but it’s been really big.”The youngster’s humble journey on the tennis court may also explain the current woes of the sport in Sweden. For, Sweden is not just the land of Borg, it is also home to Zlatan Ibrahimovic.While Leo, who dabbled in football till the age of 12, had no doubts about his commitment to the racquet sport, his compatriots have quickly gravitated to soccer and other more rewarding sports. Not in them the mettle to fight back from losing the fourth set 16-18 in a tiebreaker after having five match points, and go on to win the fifth set in a Grand Slam final.“In my dad’s time, they had a really good amount of tennis players. I think they had some time like five top-10 players. Now, it’s completely different. We don’t have so many players in Sweden, it’s a little bit sad because we are a really good tennis country,” Leo said.“Many Swedish players quit tennis around the age of 18-19 because they think it’s too hard to get through to the pros. Of course, it’s hard, you really have to fight through to get to the top. I think our mentality has to be better.”","Leo Borg says it is a special thing to have a dad like Bjorn Borg.

Despite having never defeated Sweden in Davis Cup history, the Indian team is hopeful about securing their first victory in their sixth matchup.The contest will take place on a medium-speed indoor court at the Royal Tennis Hall in Sweden. India usually prefers faster surfaces, which would better suit their big servers.Indoor courts typically feature quick ball travel and are unaffected by external factors like wind.The team will play without top players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri .Former national champion Siddharth Vishwakarma is under consideration to join the team for an upcoming critical match. Despite his skills, his lack of experience at this level might prevent him from playing in a live rubber.The decision will likely consider his potential and the high-pressure nature of the match. His future participation seems contingent on further growth and experience.Captain Rohit Rajpal may opt for doubles specialist Balaji for the singles as he did against Pakistan on grass court earlier this year. In that match, Balaji performed well by defeating veteran Aqeel Khan in Islamabad and is currently in good form in Stockholm.Ramkumar Ramanathan is set to play a key role on the opening day of the upcoming match. The team's decision on the second singles match is still pending, with the choice between Niki Poonacha and N Sriram Balaji.Poonacha, despite his talent, has uncertain fitness due to a recent ankle sprain during practice. He is more focused on doubles and, although he beat Nagal earlier this year in Pune, has not played or won much in singles recently.Elias Ymer, Sweden's top singles player, is currently ranked 238. Indian player Ramkumar has faced Ymer twice on the ATP Tour, securing victories on both occasions.Ramkumar's performance has consistently shown strong talent and skill, yet the key for him is to stay composed under pressure and trust in his abilities.On Sunday, Balaji is set to play doubles. His partner will be either Ramkumar or Poonacha, which will be decided based on the scores after the first day.""We have better servers, and our players like to get in, play shorter points but these are medium-speed courts, so we are getting used to it by playing a lot of singles with each other,"" Rajpal told PTI.""If Yuki and Sumit were here, the tie would have tilted towards us, now it's 50-50.""""Leo Borg (second singles player) has improved a lot, we are watching him. They have a tough doubles team.""In preparation for the upcoming match, India's newly appointed Davis Cup coach, Ashutosh Singh, has conducted thorough research upon his arrival in Stockholm.In preparation for the upcoming competition, Ashutosh engaged with the coaches of the new team members, including Aryan Shah, to understand the young players' mindset and playing style.The Swedish team, led by Borg, holds the 603rd position in the rankings. Their doubles players, Andre Goransson and Filip Bergevi, are formidable competitors, ranked 66 and 125 respectively.Ashutosh engaged in discussions with players who have previously faced Borg to gather valuable insights. Additionally, Ashutosh dedicated a significant amount of time to analysing videos of the opposing players, which will aid in formulating effective strategies.The draw for the event is set to occur on Friday. The first day will feature singles matches, with doubles and reverse singles scheduled for Sunday.The winner of this tie will advance to the Qualifiers next year, while the losing team will move to the World Group I play-offs.","India will play Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group I contest starting on September 14.
