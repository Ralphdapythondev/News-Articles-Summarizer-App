Uninhibited flamboyance defines Rohit Sharma's class act in T20 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/uninhibited-flamboyance-defines-rohit-sharmas-class-act-in-t20-world-cup/articleshow/111272532.cms,"T20 WORLD CUP:

|

ST. LUCIA: It was the first media interaction with Rohit Sharma in this tournament, on the eve of India‚Äôs T20 World Cup opener with Ireland in New York. Normally, going into a tournament of this magnitude, you would expect a slightly cagey captain, someone holding his cards to his chest. In a departure from the trend, though, Rohit seemed extremely frank.It seemed he was tired of carrying the burden of a defeat in the ODI World Cup final in November last year and was just happy to let himself go.When the captain says right at the beginning of the tournament that ‚Äúour opening partnership won‚Äôt change through the tournament while the rest will go up and down as per necessity‚Äù, you know something has changed in Rohit. It is this sense of freedom in every step that the Indian captain has exercised over the last one month that paid rich dividends in a game of massive significance for India.It was his 41-ball 92, easily the best innings of this World Cup by any batter, in St. Lucia on Monday that left Australia on the brink of ouster. Afghanistan‚Äôs subsequent victory over Bangladesh eventually led to Australia‚Äôs early exit.It was the 28 that Rohit took off Mitchell Starc in the third over of the game that set the tone for this onslaught. Starc‚Äôs pace-bowling partner Josh Hazlewood doffed his hat to the effort.‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen Rohit do that a few times now. He‚Äôs a world-class player, so if you‚Äôre a bit off your game that can happen. It just looked like he obviously targeted the boundary with the wind there for a while and then we probably reacted and then he hit a few on the other side as well. He‚Äôs a class act and you expect him to do that a couple of times through the tournament,‚Äù Hazlewood said.Playing without any sense of inhibition is a practised art for some, but for Rohit it comes naturally. That‚Äôs what he used to be when he was growing up as a young batter, catching the eye of one and all. Now at the twilight of his career, it is this same flamboyance that makes him look so special when it comes off.‚ÄúThe idea is to be not just one-dimensional. And that is something that was going through my mind all through. I was thinking to hit the ball everywhere possible. And when you keep an open mind and not think about just playing one shot, you can open up and access all sides of the field,‚Äù Rohit said.While run-making wasn‚Äôt exactly a piece of cake in St Lucia ‚Äî the others struggled after Rohit‚Äôs departure, it was the sheer effortlessness of the skipper‚Äôs batting that kept the dugout relaxed.Indian pacer Arshdeep Singh explained how the team feels when Rohit takes charge the way he did.‚ÄúWe just enjoyed it a lot. When he hits those long sixes, it doesn‚Äôt feel like he is hitting the ball. He handles the ball with love, yet it goes far,‚Äù Arshdeep said.That‚Äôs the beauty of Rohit, who has been his own man through this World Cup. Happy, relaxed, sharing the odd laugh with people around, spending time with his family once off the field ‚Äî the pressure-cooker situation of opening and leading India in an ICC tournament hasn‚Äôt bothered him. And now it‚Äôs about keeping it going for two more games.The final act of this drama demands a perfect ending.",Rohit Sharma's 92 was the best innings of the T20 World Cup by any batter. Australia were on the brink of ouster after Afghanistan‚Äôs subsequent victory over Bangladesh.

Gulbadin Naib: 'I don't know what happened...': Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan on Gulbadin Naib's 'injury' during T20 World Cup match against Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/i-dont-know-what-happened-afghanistan-captain-rashid-khan-on-gulbadin-naibs-injury-during-t20-world-cup-match-against-bangladesh/articleshow/111271239.cms,"#AFGvBAN: ùêíùêîùêèùêÑùêë ùüñ | #RashidKhan's exclusive post-match press conference | #T20WorldCupOnStar

What is the Gulbadin Naib incident?

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan addressed the injury of his teammate Gulbadin Naib during their crucial T20 World Cup Super Eight match against Bangladesh , saying it did not make any difference to the outcome.Afghanistan managed to clinch an eight-run victory via the DLS method, securing their first-ever World Cup semi-final spot and eliminating Australia from the tournament.They will now face South Africa in the semi-finals.Rashid Khan, speaking at the post-match press conference, downplayed the impact of Naib‚Äôs injury on the game.When questioned by a Bangladeshi journalist about the incident and its negative reception on social media, Rashid responded, ‚ÄúWell, he had some cramps or something. I don't know what happened to him and I don't know what's going on in social media. But that doesn't matter; it's just a field injury, and we haven't lost any overs. The rain came, and we just went off. It's not something that brought a massive difference in the game. We came back on the field after 5 minutes, and there was no massive difference. For me, it's just like a small injury, and you just have to take some time.‚ÄùThe journalist also asked Rashid about Australia‚Äôs support for Bangladesh during the match, to which he replied, ‚ÄúWell, definitely, if we were in the place of Australia we would have supported the same team because what you want is to go ahead in the competition and you support the opposite team which can put you in the semis. So, we knew the support will be right there. We played good cricket, right cricket and I think we deserve to be in the semis.‚ÄùRashid expressed his relief and belief in their victory only after the final Bangladeshi wicket fell. He remarked, ‚ÄúWhen we got the last wicket, then I believed that we won the game. In T20, anything is possible, any batter can score any runs. We believe that till the last wicket we take, we don‚Äôt need to be relaxed and think about having won the game. In a low-scoring game, you can‚Äôt be very relaxed; you have to be very accurate. I believe we won the game only when we took the last wicket.‚ÄùHe further added that the difference between the Afghanistan team and Bangladesh was minimal, attributing their win to better performance on the day.‚ÄúNot much difference between Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Both playing good cricket, especially with the white ball‚Ä¶ We are at the same level. It's just about you play the right cricket on the right day, that's where you become a better team,‚Äù Rashid said.The incident involving Gulbadin Naib occurred when he dramatically fell on his back, clutching his thigh after Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott signaled the players to slow things down. This caused both amusement and annoyance among former players and fans, who questioned the genuineness of Naib‚Äôs discomfort.Naib, who was fielding in the slip cordon, complained of cramps during the 12th over bowled by spinner Noor Ahmad. This happened after Trott was seen on camera asking his players to slow down as Bangladesh had fallen behind on the Duckworth-Lewis par score.Naib received treatment on the field and was taken off by teammate Naveen-ul-Haq and a support staff member as it started raining again, causing players to run to the dugout.When play resumed after a short delay, the target for Bangladesh was revised. Naib returned to the field in the 13th over, with Najibullah Zadran temporarily substituting for him. He later bowled in the 15th over and dismissed Tanzim Hasan.This injury episode sparked discussions about its impact on the game, but Rashid Khan emphasized that it made no significant difference and focused on their overall performance leading to the historic semi-final qualification.",Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan downplayed the impact of Gulbadin Naib's injury. Naib was taken off the field during Afghanistan's T20 World Cup Super Eight match against Bangladesh. Afghanistan won the match by eight runs via the DLS method. They will now face South Africa in the semi-finals.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111271235,imgsize-87936,width-400,resizemode-4/111271235.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma earned widespread acclaim following his sensational performance against Australia in their last T20 World Cup Super Eight match in St Lucia on Monday.Rohit powered to a quickfire 92 off 41 balls, featuring eight massive sixes and seven fours, leading India to a commanding total of 205 for 5. The Indian bowlers then limited Australia to 181 for 7, ensuring a 24-run victory, which played a big part in eliminating the reigning ODI World Cup champions from the tournament.Rohit Sharma's innings was highlighted by an explosive over against Mitchell Starc , where he scored 29 runs. Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif emphasized the importance of this in swinging the momentum India's way.""He was having some issues with the full-length deliveries. Left-arm seamers were able to trap him on the legs, and he was getting out trying to play flick shots. But Rohit Sharma is a big-stage player. He performs when the big matches happen, and the competition is tough. When you have the likes of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, and Josh Hazlewood in the opposition,"" Kaif said on Star Sports.Kaif further noted Rohit's strategic and controlled batting against Starc.""Rohit Sharma knows how to play an attacking game. He played shots with a straight bat in the crucial match. The two cover drives for sixes off Starc were beautiful shots [Rohit Sharma ki khaas baat yeh hai ki woh attack karna jaante hai. Aur saamne shot lagayi. Saamne over the covers jo do chakka lagayi thi Starc ko, who nihayati khubsurat shot thi]. There was precise timing, and they were played with a high elbow behind the ball. He didn't hit it hard; he played with the full face of the bat. That was the highlight of his batting against Starc when he scored 29 runs in the over. That changed the momentum. India lost Virat Kohli just before that, but Rohit had decided that he wouldn't change his intent and would play attacking shots. Scoring 29 runs in an over changed the game,"" Kaif added.Sunil Gavaskar , an India legend, also praised Rohit's performance and leadership during the crucial juncture of the game.""Rohit Sharma, leading from the front, hitting those big sixes. Despite losing Kohli in the previous over, it just tells you the intent the captain of the Indian team has. They are going to go out and try to maximize their abilities and win matches for the team,"" Gavaskar noted.Rohit's influence and leadership have been key to India's progression to the semi-finals, where they are set to face defending champions England. His ability to perform under pressure will be essential as Team India continues its pursuit of the title.","Rohit Sharma scored 92 off 41 balls, featuring eight massive sixes and seven fours.

'No scarring': Why coach Jonathan Trott believes Afghanistan have an advantage over South Africa in T20 World Cup semi-final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/no-scarring-why-coach-jonathan-trott-believes-afghanistan-have-an-advantage-over-south-africa-in-t20-world-cup-semi-final/articleshow/111270622.cms,"NEW DELHI: Coach Jonathan Trott believes Afghanistan will enter the T20 World Cup semi-final against South Africa on Thursday with an advantage, citing their lack of historical baggage compared to the often unlucky and accident-prone South African team.Afghanistan, experiencing their first-ever last-four appearance in any World Cup, contrasts sharply with South Africa, who have a long history of close calls and missteps in major tournaments.Afghanistan, new to this advanced stage of the World Cup, is seen by Trott as a team without the past scars, which makes them a dangerous and unpredictable opponent.""We go into the semi-final with no scarring or no history with regards to semi-finals. This is uncharted territory for us,"" Trott was quoted as saying by AFP.He added that the Afghan team has no ""preconceived ideas on it all, or history of failure or success in semi-finals in past years."" This lack of historical burden is perceived as a significant advantage.According to Trott, this position frees the team to approach the game with nothing to lose, contrasting with the high pressure on South Africa.South Africa has had the upper hand in their meetings with Afghanistan in T20Is, with victories in their two past matches in the 2010 T20 World Cup in Barbados and in Mumbai six years later.However, South Africa‚Äôs path through the current World Cup has not been without drama. Despite winning all seven of their games, they have faced near-embarrassments against the Netherlands, Bangladesh and Nepal. Their Super Eights victory over defending champions England by a narrow seven-run margin also added to their tense moments.On the other side, Afghanistan‚Äôs journey included a defeat by India but was followed by a landmark victory over Australia and a tight eight-run win against Bangladesh that secured their semi-final spot.Trott described the experience of leading Afghanistan to the semi-finals as ‚Äúsurreal.‚Äù He has developed a strong bond with the team since taking over as coach in July 2022. This relationship was evident when, after the rain-affected win against Bangladesh, Trott was carried off the field on his players‚Äô shoulders.""When I took over, I was astounded by the talent that I saw,"" Trott said. He acknowledged the raw talent within the team and has aimed to add structure without limiting the players' natural abilities.""I've just tried to add here and there. At no stage have I tried to clip anybody's wings. I'm just trying to make the bow of the arrow even stronger so that they can go for longer, win more games and shoot for the stars even further away,"" Trott remarked.As the semi-final approaches, Trott‚Äôs approach and the team's fresh mindset leave Afghanistan positioned as a formidable contender against the more historically burdened South Africa.",Afghanistan face South Africa in T20 World Cup semi-final on Thursday.

'There was one moment where Rohit...': Brad Hogg says Australia weren't prepared for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/there-was-one-moment-where-rohit-brad-hogg-says-australia-werent-prepared-for-india/articleshow/111262588.cms,"NEW DELHI: Brad Hogg criticised the Australian team's lack of preparation for their match against India. Former Australian cricketer specifically pointed out the ineffectiveness of Mitchell Starc , the pace bowler, who struggled to contain Rohit Sharma 's onslaught during the T20 World Cup Super Eights encounter in Saint Lucia.In a remarkable display of batting prowess, Rohit unleashed a blistering 41-ball 92, which included an over where he plundered 29 runs off Starc's bowling. This explosive innings propelled India to an imposing total of 205 runs.India's formidable score proved to be too much for Australia , as they fell short by 24 runs in their chase. With this victory, India secured their place in the semifinals, where they are set to face England in what promises to be an exciting clash.""I thought they weren't prepared. This is a worry with Mitchell Starc. If the ball is not swinging, he doesn't change his length quickly enough. And he didn't change his length quickly enough to Rohit Sharma as well when he got hit for 29 runs there,"" PTI quoted Hogg, a veteran of seven Tests, 123 ODIs and 15 T20Is for Australia, as saying on Star Sports Press Room.""There was one moment where Rohit Sharma came out of the wicket. And then you saw Starc turn around. And I don't know whether he said Rohit's hitting with the wind or there's no swing there. That was a moment where I thought Australia were in a lot of trouble,"" he said in his critical analysis of the former champions.Hogg pointed out that in addition to Rohit's explosive batting performance, the subpar fielding display by the Australian team also played a role in their loss against India.As a consequence of their defeat to India and Afghanistan 's victory over Bangladesh, Australia's journey in the World Cup came to an end, resulting in their elimination from the tournament.""(I knew) They're not going to come back because they were starting just to look at what's going wrong rather than looking for the solutions. So, that's probably where it went wrong.""And also, dropping Hardik Pandya, it was an easy catch there for Mitchell Marsh, the skipper, with a couple of overs to go. And I think Hardik scored 22 off the next 10 balls. You can't afford to drop Hardik Pandya when you've just bought your way back into the game. That was also crucial,"" Hogg said.Hogg, at 53 years old, expressed his belief that South Africa, often labeled as chokers, are finding their rhythm at the crucial stages of the T20 World Cup. He praised Aiden Markram 's team, calling them ""amazing,"" and suggested they have the potential to overcome their historical struggle of never securing an ICC trophy.Despite consistently being considered one of the top contenders in ICC tournaments, South Africa has repeatedly fallen short due to lackluster performances and misfortune. They have yet to claim a title in these prestigious events.In the 2021 T20 World Cup, the Proteas narrowly missed out on a spot in the semifinals, losing the opportunity to England based on a lower net run rate. The 2022 T20 World Cup saw them suffer an unexpected loss against the Netherlands, further extending their disappointing record.But Hogg feels the Proteas have just started to blossom.""They are just spawning from here. It's amazing. I regard (opener Reeza)Hendricks as well, I really like him as a player. And then you've got to build a wall, they can build a nice spin with especially (Heinrich) Klassen. I expect him to do really well against Afghanistan and get to the finals,"" said Hogg.Given their history of strong performances, Hogg is confident that South Africa has what it takes to overcome the challenge posed by Afghanistan and advance to the championship match.""I think it is going to be South Africa and we have got a really strong squad, good spin with (Tabraiz) Shamsi and (Keshav) Maharaj. I don't plan on the big nations now, and I think they'll have to go out there and play it out again instead and just have that confidence to go with the final side.""For me, if I get past that semifinal right, South Africa is going to win the final this year. I just think I've got the team balanced and I've got the aggression as well. I really like Markram as the captain. He is correct and very composed. And I also think, we are going to win as a very well-composed team, not panicking and just setting the right conditions,"" added Hogg.Hogg also slammed the Australian team's fielding performance in their match against Afghanistan during the Super 8s stage. He described their efforts on the field as ""terrible,"" expressing his disappointment with their subpar display.In a stunning turn of events, Afghanistan managed to secure a 21-run victory over Australia, defying expectations. The Afghan team then proceeded to defeat a resilient Bangladesh side, securing their spot in the semifinals. This remarkable achievement sent the people of Afghanistan, a nation afflicted by conflict, into a state of euphoria and celebration.""Australia took Afghanistan too lightly. They rocked up. They weren't at their best. They were terrible in the field. They were terrible with the ball. And at the end of the day, Afghanistan deserved to be there rather than Australia.""Talking about (captain) Mitchell Marsh, he is probably the bro of the team. He's like Andrew Symonds. He has a lot of fun. If there's a little bit of division in the camp, or there's a bit of argy-bargy, he generally lights the load. So, he's that bro. But the other thing is, Pat Cummins probably wasn't a certainty to play in the playing XI of this World Cup,"" he said.","Former Australian cricketer Brad Hogg criticised the Australian team's lack of preparation for their match against India.

With the match at tenterhooks and rain in the air, both Bangladesh and Afghanistan dugouts had their calculators out throughout their crucial Group 1 match of the 'Super 8s' stage, which had a T20 World Cup semifinals spot at stake. But the tense proceedings led to a bizarre moment towards the climax of the game.The match was tentalisingly poised as Bangladesh continued to slip in their chase of Afghanistan's 115 for 8, while intermittent short spells of rain forced players to walk out of the park multiple times.The bizarre moment arrived when the scoreboard read 81 for 7, as Bangladesh chased a DSL-revised target of 114 in 19 overs. Noting that Afghanistan were ahead on DLS countback at that stage, coach Jonathan Trott signalled the players on the field to slow down the proceedings; and just before the next ball of the 12th over was bowled, slip fielder Gulbadin Naib went flat on the ground holding his hamstring.The chain of events left the commentators on live broadcast in splits, while Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan seemed to be expressing his annoyance with Naib.While Rashid was applauded for his displeasure with delay tactics, fans and cricket experts questioned Naib as well as Afghanistan coach and former England batsman Trott for allegedly bringing the game in disrepute.Rain relented enough to eventually allow the game to be completed as Afghanistan bowled out Bangladesh for 105 in 17.5 overs to win by 8 runs (DLS method) and join India as the two semifinalists from Group 1.Afghanistan's win also knocked Australia out of the tournament, while booking them a maiden World Cup semifinal against South Africa.

Be it in conversations with the cab driver or a new acquaintance in the roadside bar or the fisherman taking you out for a boat ride on the Caribbeansea, everyone felt there was a chance for the West Indies.It wasn‚Äôt exactly a chest-thumping super-confidence that the world is all theirs, but a ray of hope that this World Cup might be the start of a cricketing revival in the region. However, that wasn‚Äôt to be.West Indies flattered for a while, only to deceive at the end in a virtual quarterfinal with South Africa in the 'Super 8s' clash.Gregory, a man in his 40s donning a Barcelona shirt in a small town called Soufriere, near the active volcano in the Piton Mountains in St. Lucia says: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard times man. My football team (Barca) isn‚Äôt the team I knew anymore. Was hoping West Indies will play you guys in the semis or final, that‚Äôs also not happening.‚ÄùCricket in the West Indies has been in perpetual decline over the last two decades. The national team doesn‚Äôt win enough to get the GenNext hooked to it. Being unable to qualify for the ODI World Cup last year was the nadir. Still, you can feel a genuine love for the sport.At the roadside bars during the famous Friday street party in St. Lucia, it was cricket that was being played on the TVs as Indian fans mingled in with the locals, shaking their leg to some reggae beats.Dileep, a chartered accountant in his 70s from Guyana who now lives in Canada, had flown down with his family for a vacation that included cricket in this lovely island country.‚ÄúMy favourite was Roy Fredericks. The way that little man used to play Dennis Lillee, my god...we don‚Äôt have such guys anymore. Still, we don‚Äôt give up hope. That‚Äôs why we still take time off from our schedules to come and watch cricket,‚Äù Dileep says, buying a fresh round of beer for 'a new friend'.The locals in St. Lucia were slightly more expectant because the current West Indies team is being coached by a local boy Darren Sammy, the only St. Lucian who also led the country.‚ÄúHis house is just around the team. We all feel proud of him. There‚Äôs a sports school, too, nearby where he has put in some effort. Just wanted his team to do well,‚Äù Terrol, who runs a bed and breakfast by Rodney Bay, said the other day.A meaningful performance in this T20 World Cup would probably have reignited the passion among the youth who have more in life ‚Äúthan rooting for a losing team‚Äù. But during the course of this World Cup, West Indies did show glimpses and skipper Rovman Powell urged the fans not to turn their backs despite the soul-crunching defeat.‚ÄúWe are disappointed because we thought we had the personnel within our room to actually win a home World Cup. But having said that, we have played good cricket, we have entertained them in patches, and it‚Äôs just for them to keep on supporting us. How important the support is in whatever you do. So, I would implore them to justkeep on working with us, keep on supporting us over the last 12 months,‚Äù Powell said, mentioning that for the first time West Indies have been ranked No. 3 in the world in T20Is.But is it enough to keep the fans who need that sense of a victory to keep them going after a hard day‚Äôs work? We will see.",Cricket in the West Indies has been in perpetual decline over the last two decades. Being unable to qualify for the ODI World Cup last year was the nadir. A meaningful performance in this T20 World Cup would probably have reignited the passion among the youth.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111245949,imgsize-75200,width-400,resizemode-4/111245949.jpg"

Excerpts...

In times of crisis, how do you boost the team's morale?

How would you describe Australia's aggressive style of cricket?

Talking about the ODI World Cup final last year, you guys never appeared to be under pressure, even in front of a packed stadium in Ahmedabad. How would you describe the journey to that title win?

What is your approach and strategy as a captain?

Your take on docu-series 'The Test'..

NEW DELHI: It's India vs Australia , and the stakes in the T20 World Cup clash are incredibly high. The 2023 ODI World Cup final defeat must be on the minds of Rohit Sharma and his men. However, this time India have slightly upper hand as the Aussies will face the pressure of a must-win game in the 'Super 8s' match at St Lucia on Monday.Australia suffered a 21-run defeat to Afghanistan in their 'Super 8s' fixture, jeopardising their chances of qualifying for the semifinals.That thrilling contest has left Group 1 wide open, with none of the teams yet assured of finishing in the top two for a place in the semis.Ahead of the much-anticipated match, TimesofIndia.com caught up with the star Australian pacer Pat Cummins .I think knowing the guys really well gives you a sense of what people need at certain stages. And that‚Äôs not just me. It‚Äôs not always just on me. We‚Äôve got some wonderful senior guys who, if they feel like the dressing room needs something, they‚Äôll step up and lighten the mood or have a serious moment or whatever is needed. So it feels like, between the coaches and senior guys, we can always self-adjust pretty well.I probably wouldn't define the Aussie brand of cricket, to be honest. I'd probably define the team and the way that we want to go about it. And that‚Äôs just playing to our strengths. For some guys, that's being quite stoic, taking their time and wearing down the bowlers. For other guys, it‚Äôs the opposite; it's going out and taking the game on from ball one, putting the pressure back on the bowlers. So everyone in our team does it a slightly different way, but hopefully, when it comes to Test cricket in particular, we're relentless and having a bit of fun.There were so many different obstacles to overcome throughout that tournament. Even leading into the tournament, we had four of our main guys injured and (they had) hardly played a game leading up to that first match. So it felt like we were kind of putting out fire the whole tournament. There were injuries that popped up at different levels, along with issues of form and selections.It all culminated in the final where, even when things hadn't gone right, we still found a way to win some games. I think that gave us a lot of confidence going into the final. We went in there with a sense of having nothing to lose and probably came together for our best game.I try to be quite people-oriented. These are some of my really good mates, and I've played a lot of times with them. So hopefully, I build really good relationships. Hopefully, they know that they've got my backing, no matter what, pretty much. Then, we collaborate and try to work together to achieve some special things.I think we've seen with the first couple of series, how well-received they were by cricket-loving fans and even by the people who aren't necessarily cricket fans. People who don't know cricket or haven't watched much of it are being drawn into the sport through the documentary. We feel some responsibility to keep doing these series. The fans love it, and it brings more people to cricket, which is only a good thing.",Pat Cummins talks to TimesofIndia.com ahead of T20 World Cup clash with India.

NEW DELHI: South Africa 's quest to secure their maiden major cricket title may hinge on their ability to finally overcome the dreaded ""chokers"" label. Their latest test of resolve will come against Afghanistan in the Twenty20 World Cup semi-final at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba, Trinidad on Thursday.The Proteas have reached seven semi-finals across both short format World Cups, but have never progressed to a championship match. However, they will be relieved to avoid facing Australia this time, having suffered defeats to them in three of the last four encounters.Despite being known for consistently underperforming in international cricket, South Africa has been in impressive form, with their bowling performances propelling them through the group and Super Eight stages.Captain Aiden Markram , however, has been less satisfied with their batting displays and is seeking improvement in that department ahead of their crucial semi-final clash in Trinidad.""We've been doing really well and the bowling unit has been firing for us, which has been fantastic,"" Reuters quoted Markram as saying after his team ended the campaign of co-hosts West Indies in a shootout for a semi-final spot on Sunday.""From a batting point of view, we need to be more clinical. Understanding when the right time is to really take the game on, and maybe understanding when the right time is to knock around for a couple of overs.""South Africa will be pleased with the way various team members have risen to the occasion during high-pressure moments, enabling them to maintain a perfect record after seven games. They will aim for another comprehensive team performance to overcome Afghanistan.""We haven't played our best game of cricket yet,"" Markram said.""So we'll try and put our best game of cricket together for that semi-final.""Afghanistan's remarkable journey in the tournament continued as they secured a thrilling eight-run victory over Bangladesh on Monday, following their stunning upset against Australia in their previous Super Eight match. This win propelled them into the semi-finals alongside India from Group 1, while the 2021 champions were eliminated.The historic achievement of reaching their first-ever World Cup semi-final showcases the significant growth of cricket in Afghanistan, a nation that has been ravaged by conflict.Led by the charismatic Rashid Khan , the team has already made waves in the tournament, having also defeated New Zealand earlier on.Despite failing to secure a single victory in the previous edition of the World Cup, Afghanistan's potential was recognised by West Indies cricket legend Brian Lara, who predicted their semi-final appearance this year. Fittingly, the semi-final will be played at the Tarouba venue, which bears Lara's name.""Everyone back home is so happy for this big achievement for us being in the semi-final,"" Rashid said.""The only guy who put us in the semi-finals was Brian Lara, we proved that right. When we met him at a welcome party, I told him 'we won't let you down'.""Rahmanullah Gurbaz has been instrumental in Afghanistan's success, amassing a team-high 281 runs. His three century partnerships with Ibrahim Zadran at the top of the order have laid the foundation for their victories.On the bowling front, Fazalhaq Farooqi has been the standout performer with 16 wickets, closely followed by Rashid Khan with 14. The Afghan team will be counting on this duo to deliver another stunning performance in Trinidad.If Afghanistan emerges victorious, they will face the winner of the other semi-final clash between 2007 champions India and defending champions England. The highly anticipated encounter between these two cricketing giants is set to take place in Guyana on Thursday.""Being in the semi is big for us,"" Rashid added. ""But we have to go with a very clear mind and know what we have done so far which has worked for us. Keep things simple for ourselves and make sure we enjoy that big occasion.""","Afghanistan will face South Africa in the Twenty20 World Cup semi-final.

NEW DELHI: Austria 's relentless and energetic performance catapulted them into the round of 16 at the European Championship in Berlin on Tuesday. Their thrilling 3-2 win over the Netherlands not only secured their progression but also earned them the top spot in Group D.Despite conceding an early own goal, delivering a lackluster first-half display, and falling victim to a late sucker punch from Marcel Sabitzer , the Dutch also advanced as one of the four best third-placed teams.With France being held to a 1-1 draw by Poland in Dortmund, Austria claimed the top spot in the group with six points, followed by France with five and the Netherlands with four, reported Reuters.Austria took a surprising lead at the Olympiastadion when Donyell Malen inadvertently turned the ball into his own net just six minutes into the match.However, Cody Gakpo equalized shortly after the break. Romano Schmid put Austria ahead again just before the hour mark in a back-and-forth second half, but Memphis Depay leveled the score in the 75th minute.Ultimately, it was Sabitzer who sealed the victory for Ralf Rangnick's determined side, propelling them to the unexpected position of group winners. The final standings in the group fluctuated several times throughout the 90 minutes.Austria will face the Group F runners-up, which will be determined on Wednesday, while France and the Netherlands await the identity of their last-16 opponents.Malen squandered a golden opportunity in the 23rd minute, failing to convert a perfectly threaded pass that left him one-on-one with goalkeeper Patrick Pentz. Earlier, in the 14th minute, Tijjani Reijnders also missed the target after receiving a setup from Gakpo.Frustrated by the Netherlands' loss of key midfield battles and frequent turnovers, coach Ronald Koeman substituted Joey Veerman with Xavi Simons with 10 minutes remaining in the first half.Koeman's agitation was evident as he repeatedly leapt up from the bench in response to Austria's relentless pressing, which forced the Dutch into numerous mistakes.Austria could have extended their lead before halftime, causing the Dutch significant problems. Verbruggen made a sharp save to deny Marcel Sabitzer's powerful shot and then got a touch to prevent Marko Arnautovic from scoring.Presumably still feeling the effects of Koeman's halftime fury, the Dutch surged forward after the break, with Simons driving through the middle and passing to Gakpo. Given too much space by his marker Philipp Lienhart, Gakpo seized the opportunity and curled the ball into the net with finesse.However, just as the Dutch were gaining momentum, they were stung again in the 59th minute. Florian Grillitsch's pullback from the byline set up a header for the diminutive Schmid, whose effort was already on target but was inadvertently directed into the opposite corner by Dutch defender Stefan de Vrij.Substitute Wout Weghorst made an immediate impact after replacing Malen in the 72nd minute, with his header creating a close-range chance for Depay. Referee Ivan Kruzliak initially disallowed the goal, claiming Depay had handled the ball, but VAR overturned the decision after a two-minute review.However, the deadlock lasted only five minutes before Sabitzer restored Austria's lead. He initiated the goal with a burst through the middle and timed his run perfectly to receive a return pass, scoring from a tight angle.","Austria beat the Netherlands 3-2 to advance to the round of 16 of the European Championship in Berlin.

This marks the first time in 12 years under manager Didier Deschamps that France has failed to top their group at a major tournament.France put in another lackluster performance, lacking creativity throughout the team. Despite dominating possession, they were thwarted by Poland's outstanding goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski, who made several impressive saves to deny Mbappe, Theo Hernandez, Ousmane Dembele, and Bradley Barcola's close-range attempts.Following Poland's equalizer, France had to withstand a late surge from the energized Polish team, spurred on by their supporters who came alive after Lewandowski's goal, creating a boisterous atmosphere at Dortmund BVB Stadion.After three games, Deschamps appears to be still working out how to utilize his forwards, having chosen to start talisman Antoine Griezmann on the bench against Poland, leaving his role uncertain.","Kylian Mbappe opened the scoring in the 56th minute with his first European Championship goal, and the first by a French player at Euro 2024.

James Rodriguez played a pivotal role in Colombia's success, contributing to both goals.His performance highlighted his significant impact, despite a recent lack of regular playtime at his club, Sao Paulo. Rodriguez's involvement in the goals came first through an assist to Daniel Munoz and then via a free-kick that Jefferson Lerma redirected into the net, showcasing his skill and influence on the game.Colombia's win places them at the top of Group D, benefiting from the full three points available from the match. Despite Paraguay's efforts to mount a comeback in the second half, with Julio Enciso scoring in the 69th minute, Colombia managed to maintain control and appeared more likely to extend their lead, though a late penalty call in their favour was overturned after a VAR review.Looking ahead, Colombia are set to face Costa Rica in their next group match, followed by a highly anticipated clash with Brazil on July 2.

The charges include making misleading claims about the GPS vests ‚Äî lost by the airline in transit during team‚Äôs travel ‚Äî and misrepresenting facts to gain sympathy from other nation‚Äôs coaches at the reputational cost of India.Stimac had claimed at the 3rd AFC National Coaches Conference in Malaysia that he had only four support staff, ‚Äúwhen Stimac always had a contingent of between 13 to 16 support staff for every camp and tournament.‚ÄùThe AIFF claimed that three days prior to the World Cup qualifier against Kuwait in Kolkata, it received a legal notice from Stimac‚Äôs lawyer alleging that the AIFF had breached his contract by allegedly misquoting him in a press release made in September 2023, when he had thanked those who made the release of players for the AsianGames possible.‚ÄúIt appears that Stimac was more concerned about finding specious reasons to end his coaching stint in a manner favourable to himself rather than focusing on the team‚Äôs preparations for perhaps the most important match in the Indian team‚Äôs recent history.‚ÄùThe AIFF also responded to Stimac‚Äôs admission that he underwent heart surgery during his engagement with the Indian body.‚ÄúHe irresponsibly blamed the AIFF for causing his heart ailment, attempting to deflect the serious matter of his not having been medically fit to render coaching services and his failure to formally disclose the same to the federation.s‚ÄúIt is ironic that someone who was the prime person controlling the fortunes of the national team considers that Indian football is imprisoned and has not grown.
