'I won't forgive MS Dhoni': Yuvraj Singh's father Yograj criticizes former India captain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/i-wont-forgive-ms-dhoni-yuvraj-singhs-father-yograj-criticizes-former-india-captain/articleshow/112979881.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Yograj Singh , father of Yuvraj Singh , has once again criticized MS Dhoni , accusing him of negatively impacting his son's cricket career. Yograj's comments highlight a longstanding grievance which he believes curtailed Yuvraj’s career, despite his monumental contributions to Indian cricket, particularly in the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 ODI World Cup victories under Dhoni’s captaincy.Yuvraj Singh's cricket career spanned 17 years, marked by significant achievements including key roles in India's 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup triumphs. However, following 2014, his appearances for the national team diminished, with his last international match being in 2017 against the West Indies. Yograj Singh attributes this decline to Dhoni’s influence on the team’s selection decisions.In a recent interview on the Zee Switch YouTube channel, Yograj Singh expressed his strong feelings towards Dhoni, stating: ""I won't forgive MS Dhoni. He should look at his face in the mirror. He is a very big cricketer, but what he has done against my son, everything is coming out now; it can never be forgiven in life. I have never done two things in life - first, I have never forgiven anybody who has done wrong for me, and second, I have never hugged them in my life, be it my family members or my kids. That man (MS Dhoni) has destroyed the life of my son, who could have played four to five years more.""Yuvraj Singh is widely regarded as one of the most illustrious cricketers in Indian history, having amassed close to 12,000 runs and scored 17 centuries in 402 matches across formats. His all-round performance in the 2011 World Cup was particularly celebrated. Yuvraj scored 362 runs at an average of 90.50 and took 15 wickets, which earned him the Player of the Tournament award.Yograj Singh praised his son's resilience, notably during his battle with cancer, which Yuvraj fought while playing in the 2011 World Cup. He also called for Yuvraj to be awarded the Bharat Ratna , India’s highest civilian honor, for his contributions to the national team.""I dare everyone to give birth to a son like Yuvraj. Even Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag have said in the past that there won't be another Yuvraj Singh. India should award him the Bharat Ratna for playing with cancer and winning the World Cup for the country,"" Yograj added.Yograj Singh's comments have reignited discussions regarding Yuvraj Singh's career trajectory and the dynamics within the Indian cricket team during the latter stages of his career.","Yuvraj Singh's cricket career spanned 17 years, marked by significant achievements including key roles in India's 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup triumphs.

'Bangladesh aya hi record banane ke liye hai...': Pakistan cricket team slammed for conceding advantage in 2nd Test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/bangladesh-aya-hi-record-banane-ke-liye-hai-pakistan-cricket-team-slammed-for-conceding-advantage-in-2nd-test/articleshow/112979866.cms,"NEW DELHI: As Bangladesh fashioned a remarkable turnaround from a precarious 26-6 to 262 all out riding on Liton Das ' fighting hundred against Pakistan on Sunday, the second Test in Rawalpindi was left within either team's grasp.In 333 arduous minutes, the 29-year-old Liton Das struck 138 runs and with Mehidy Hasan Miraz , who scored a fierce 78, forced Bangladesh back into the game with a valiant 165-run seventh-wicket stand.With opener Abdullah Shafique out for three and nightwatchman Khurram Shahzad falling for a duck, Bangladesh responded at the end of the third day to leave Pakistan with a 9-2 deficit. Both dismissals came at the hands of bowler Hasan Mahmud Former Pakistan batsman Ahmad Shahzad , known for his no-holds barred criticism of the Pakistan cricket team and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), again slammed the dismal show of the team in the second Test.In a video uploaded on his official X handle, Ahmad Shahzad says, ""Pakistan have made another unwanted record against Bangladesh. It seems like Bangladesh cricket team has come only to make records. Pakistan bowlers did will to dismiss 6 Bangladesh batsmen for just 26 runs, but after that, you let a 150-run stand flourish. And this has happened for the first time in history that a team had taken 6 wickets inside 30 runs and then see a 150-run stand for the seventh wicket take the match away.""Praising Pakistan pacers Mir Hamza and Khurram Shahzad, Ahmad Shahzad says, ""At a time it was looking that things are under your control. These youngsters (Mir Hamza and Khurram Shahzad) who had toiled hard in domestic cricket and hadn't come from Mohenjo-daro, had been waiting for their chances for a long time and today they got an opportunity because some senior bowler was missing and they both delivered for you. Khurram Shahzad bowled well today, hitting the weak areas of the Bangladesh batsmen, exposing their weak techniques and dismissed them.""Das and Mehidy's match-turning stand was the day's high point.Additionally, Das tied the partnership record against Pakistan with tail-ender Mahmud (13 not out) for 69 runs in a 24.5-over ninth wicket stand, frustrating the home team.Das reached his fourth hundred in a Test match after being dropped by spinner Abrar Ahmed at ninety, following a late cut off the same bowler. After a while, he eventually caved in to Agha Salman.Arriving at the crease with Bangladesh reeling at 26-5, Das blasted 13 boundaries and four sixes en route to a massive 236 for the last four wickets.Pakistan lead by 21 runs, and will need to bat smartly to clinch a series-levelling win after losing the first Test, also in Rawalpindi, by 10 wickets.Bangladesh's win last week was their first in 14 attempts against Pakistan.",Pakistan lead Bangladesh by 21 runs after third day of second Test in Rawalpindi. Liton Das scores 138 runs as Bangladesh fight back from 26-6 to 262 all out.

Coco is an amazing player. I have a ton of respect for her and I know she's going to come back here and win this thing again.""Gauff's defeat dealt a further blow to the season's last Grand Slam event, with the elimination of reigning champion Novak Djokovic in the third round, his earliest exit since 2006.Alcaraz, a popular player who won in New York in 2022 and is currently the champion of the French Open and Wimbledon , was taken aback in the second round.Navarro, who had beaten Gauff at Wimbledon in July, dominated right away on Sunday as well.The 23-year-old broke for a 4-2 lead in the opening set and closed out the first game with a 27-shot rally in the ninth game.With a break in the second set, Navarro extended her advantage to 4-3 when Gauff made her fourth double fault of the match.But Gauff, who had trailed Elina Svitolina in her third round victory, rallied to win the next three games to even the match.The champion's temporary reprieve was short-lived, as she gave up three more double faults in the decider's third game, giving away another vital break point.Badosa, who was born in New York City as well, defeated Wang Yafan of China 6-1, 6-2 to advance to her maiden US Open quarterfinal.The first two games lasted seventeen minutes each, despite the lopsided result. All eight of Badosa's break points were saved.""It was so humid I thought I was going to die,"" said the 26-year-old. ""I knew she was tough but I'm tougher.""","19 double faults and 60 unforced mistakes led to a 6-3, 4-6,6-3 fourth round loss.

"Priyansh Arya smashes six sixes in an over, mirrors Garfield Sobers' iconic achievement exactly after 56 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/priyansh-arya-smashes-six-sixes-in-an-over-mirrors-garfield-sobers-iconic-achievement-exactly-after-56-years/articleshow/112951154.cms,"NEW DELHI: On August 31, 1968, West Indies legend Sir Garfield Sobers achieved an unprecedented feat by becoming the first batter to hit six sixes in an over. This remarkable accomplishment took place during a first-class match of the English County Championship, where Sobers was leading Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan.Exactly 56 years later, on August 31, 2024, another cricketer etched his name in the annals of cricket history.Priyansh Arya replicated Sobers' extraordinary achievement, joining the exclusive club of batters who have hit six sixes in an over.In a remarkable display of batting prowess, Priyansh from the South Delhi Superstarz team, participating in the Delhi Premier League , unleashed a barrage of sixes against Manan Bharadwaj, a spinner representing the North Delhi Strikers. He sent the ball soaring over the boundary ropes on six occasions within a single over, leaving spectators in awe.Bharadwaj, known primarily for his left-arm spin, even resorted to bowling a delivery with his right hand in an attempt to stem the flow of runs. However, his efforts proved futile as the South Delhi Superstarz batsman continued his onslaught.He soon reached his century in just 40 balls, but Priyansh's assault on Manan under the afternoon sky stole the show. Priyansh started by charging down the pitch, launching Manan over long-off for a towering six, and then dropped to one knee to clear the long-on fence for another maximum.The barrage seemed endless as the left-handed batter smashed two more sixes over long-on, followed by another pair over long-off, collecting an incredible 36 runs from Manan’s 12th over. Priyansh eventually notched up his second century of the tournament in the 15th over.Priyansh became part of an elite group that includes Ross Whiteley (2017), Hazratullah Zazai (2018), and Leo Carter (2020), all of whom have hit six sixes in a domestic T20 match. On the international stage, this rare achievement has been accomplished by Yuvraj Singh , Kieron Pollard, and Dipendra Singh Airee (twice).Eventually, Priyansh made 120 off 50 balls, laced with 10 fours and as many sixes at a strike rate of 240. Ayush Badoni, his batting partner at the other end, also struck a century for the South Delhi team, making 165 runs off 55 balls, hitting eight fours and ten sixes at a strike-rate of 300.The duo's efforts meant South Delhi Superstarz made a whopping 308/5, making it just the second time a 300+ score was achieved by a batting team in T20s. Priyansh and Badoni had a partnership of 286 from 103 balls, which is the highest partnership for any wicket in T20 cricket.","Priyansh Arya joins exclusive club of batters who have hit six sixes in an over.

Medals or no medals-Athletes are accountable to Taxpayer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/medals-or-no-medals-athletes-are-accountable-to-taxpayer/articleshow/112932833.cms,"Dr P S M Chandran

Dr PSM is former Director (Sports Sciences), Sports Authority of India.

He was Indian contingent doctor for the Olympics & Asian Games.

At present he is the President, Indian Federation of Sports Medicine

40 years ago, it was the Los Angeles Olympic Games. A two member Indian men weightlifting team lands at the Olympic village at USC two weeks before the games to acclimatize and train at the Olympic venue. Both the lifters were heralded as potential medal prospects. The Games started and the weight lifting event was scheduled at the beginning of the Games .The weighing-in was on. One of the weightlifters was found to be overweight by 2 kg. No commotion. The question came: how come he was overweight? The response from the lifter was simple. There was no coach or support system to monitor him on weight management. The coach of the weightlifting team had checked into the village and the very next day quietly he left for San Francisco to visit his relatives . On his return two weeks later on the day of the weighing-in, he could do nothing to help the overweight lifter to qualify for competing . The Contingent management showed no remorse and the coach went scot-free. No inquiry, no blame game.At the same Olympics , our legendary P T Usha missed an Olympic medal by a whisker , one hundredth of a second. The whole of India wept. Many explanations came on what went wrong with Usha’s strategy for the race. The US athletics team coach who was keenly following Usha’s race (Usha had beaten American Judy Brown in the semifinals ) and was sitting next to me in the athletes’ enclosure had this to say about Usha when she crossed the finish lane, “look at the girl, she looks so fresh, she can complete another lap”. What he meant was Usha had still some more reserve energy left in her which if used could have fetched her an Olympic medal. This is where sports science can make the difference. Unfortunately Usha or his illustrious coach, O M Nambiar did not receive any sports science back then.This is exactly where Usha as President of Indian Olympic Association made a difference while selecting the contingent for the recently concluded Paris Olympic Games. The athletes had the luxury of having the services of sports medicine doctors, physiotherapists, massage therapists, mental trainers, nutritionists and sleep therapists. It is believed that IOA had compulsions to take care of the interest of Corporate sponsors and include inexperienced and fresh professionals in the squad which subsequently proved disastrous with India landing at 71 position in the medals tally below even Pakistan.As the legendary badminton icon Prakash Padukone as well as P T Usha herself had pointed out, the onus of giving out one’s best ultimately rests with the athlete only. To quote tennis ace Leander Paes, “I can guarantee optimum performance, but not the results”. This applies to our Olympic contingent athletes too. Unfortunately in the present Olympic Games our athletes not only failed to deliver their best, but it was an abject surrender to their opponents in many of the sports they had competed in, which include the silver and bronze medal winners also . In sports the winner takes the gold and all other beaten guys share the silver and bronze medals. Those who are hungry for any medals glorify their medals, color does not matter for them. There were 329 gold medals at stake at the Paris games across 32 sports and 48 disciplines. India drew a big “Zero” on gold count and had to be satisfied with its haul of one silver and 5 bronze medals after spending Rs 470 crores in preparing and sending the team.Since it is taxpayers money which is spent on these Games, the IOA and Sports ministry need to constitute an inquiry committee which will come out with a detailed report on how and where we have flopped at the Paris Olympic Games.Lots of money has been spent on wrestler Vinesh Poghat. Her disqualification is a man-made disaster and a huge disappointment for the country. Those who are responsible for this debacle need to be identified and taken to task. Vinesh has overcome the trauma now if the smile on her face and her speeches are indications. It is reported that her endorsement fee has jumped from the pre Olympic rate of Rs 25 Lakhs to rupees one crore post games. She can be proud of this . But as a seasoned professional, she has to explain how she had failed to fall in line with the competition rules in wrestling and ranked last in her category before the govt considered spending another penny for her training in future.Another baffling mystery is Neeraj Chopra’s claim of his groin injury. He is a national treasure. According to him he has been nursing the injury for the last two years and goes against the doctors’ advice on surgery. At the same time he is consistently throwing his best in every competition. Neeraj has to come out clean and convince his fans about his fitness. The Govt should seek a report on his injury status and help him out before it gets messy.On 29 August , the nation will be celebrating the National Sports Day. The speakers will be shouting at the top of their voice about our glorious performance at the Paris Olympics. They may not be aware that the national flags of 62 countries were hoisted 329 times accompanied by the national anthems to celebrate the gold medal winners at various venues. But we, the unfortunate Indians, could not get a glimpse of our tricolour fluttering at the top of the flag mast accompanied by our national anthem “Jana Gana Mana” even once at the entire Games .Still we have the audacity to think of bidding for hosting the Olympic Games!","Dr P S M Chandran is the former Director (Sports Sciences), Sports Authority of India.

Their approach was aggressive, focusing on attacking rather than match preservation, which led to a flurry of wickets and boundaries throughout the fourth day. The aggressive play sometimes made it appear more like a limited-overs contest.During the morning session, Sri Lanka lost only nightwatchman Prabath Jayasuriya for 4 and Dimuth Karunaratne for 55.Karunaratne, who made the first half-century by an opener in the series, struck Atkinson for three fours in one over before edging a lifter from Olly Stone to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.After the lunch interval, Angelo Mathews looked assured with his 36 runs before chipping a catch to Chris Woakes at mid-on off the bowling of Shoaib Bashir.England's new frontline spinner, Bashir, initially struggled, conceding boundaries as Sri Lanka looked to force him out of the attack.Chris Woakes, on the other hand, delivered with typical precision on his favorite ground, bowling seven maiden overs and giving England control. Dinesh Chandimal, who raced to a half-century off just 42 balls, appeared to be out leg before wicket by Woakes. However, a review showed the thinnest of edges and he survived briefly before being caught by Dan Lawrence at short-leg from an Atkinson delivery.A notable aspect of the series was Sri Lanka's decision not to promote their most effective batsman, Kamindu Mendis, up the order.Mendis came to the crease with Sri Lanka at 192 for 6, but this time failed to make an impact, scoring just 4 before being caught by Ben Duckett in the slips off Atkinson's bowling.Captain Dhananjaya de Silva and Milan Rathnayake provided some resistance with a partnership of 73 runs. De Silva scored 50 while Rathnayake added 43, as they countered England's short ball tactics. However, Rathnayake eventually fell, swinging at a short ball and giving Atkinson his fifth wicket.Woakes then wrapped up the innings by inducing Lahiru Kumara to sky a catch, ending the proceedings.England’s dominant position in the match was bolstered by Joe Root , who scored centuries in both innings. With his second century in the match, Root achieved his 34th hundred in Test cricket, becoming England's all-time top scorer of hundreds in Tests.Despite the success on the field, there was a notable sore point for the game's administrators: the relatively sparse crowd.

The pair took advantage of the easing pitch conditions in the second session, batting with confidence and resilience.However, just before tea, pace bowler Khurram Shahzad , who had earlier decimated the Bangladesh top order, struck twice in quick succession. He first removed Mehidy for 51, caught and bowled off a miscued drive, and then dismissed Taskin Ahmed for one in the next over, finishing the session with career-best figures of 6-73.Earlier in the day, Bangladesh had resumed their innings at 10-0 but quickly found themselves in trouble as Shahzad wreaked havoc with the new ball. He had opener Zakir Hasan caught at short midwicket for one, before bowling Shadman Islam (10) and skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (4) in quick succession.Mir Hamza then joined the party, removing Mominul Haque and first Test centurion Mushfiqur Rahim, both caught behind, to leave Bangladesh reeling at 26-6.The partnership between Das and Mehidy has given Bangladesh a glimmer of hope in their quest to avoid the follow-on and potentially set a challenging target for Pakistan in the fourth innings.The hosts are looking to level the series after suffering a surprise 10-wicket defeat in the first Test, which was Bangladesh's maiden victory over Pakistan in 14 attempts.","Litton Das and Mehidy Hasan Miraz stage remarkable recovery for Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul 's leadership has been praised by Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ) fielding coach Jonty Rhodes , who acknowledged Rahul's efforts since taking charge of the franchise in its inaugural season in 2022.Under Rahul's captaincy, LSG made it to the playoffs in the first two seasons but finished seventh in the 2024 edition, raising questions about his future with the team.Discussions between team owner Sanjiv Goenka and Rahul about his potential retention have been reportedly positive.Rhodes, speaking to India Today, highlighted the challenges Rahul faced leading a new franchise and commended his ability to establish a competitive team culture.""I think if you look at a record as a captain of a brand-new franchise, getting into the playoffs every time like he has, it's been something that goes a long way towards his captaincy,"" Rhodes said. ""The way that he leads the team and the sort of setup and the approach that he has.""Rhodes noted that while other IPL captains like Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni have multiple trophies, Rahul's accomplishments with LSG should not be underestimated.""From LSG's point of view, it might just be one thing getting into the final, winning the trophy,"" Rhodes added, drawing parallels to Mumbai Indians ' early struggles before their eventual success.Rhodes compared LSG's current phase to Mumbai Indians’ initial years in the IPL, where they did not make the playoffs in the first two seasons and only claimed their first title in 2013.""It then turns out MI didn't win a trophy for quite a few years at the start. Once they learned how to win trophies, they kept going,"" Rhodes explained. ""I think from that point of view, he's done an excellent job at the helm, with a brand-new franchise, setting up a new culture, with new owners. And that I think is an indication of how well he's captained the team in a setup where there are players from all over the country in India who are very different and all over the world.""LSG's ownership now faces critical decisions ahead of the upcoming mega auction as they decide whether to retain Rahul. Given the end of the three-year cycle, the team's management will need to weigh Rahul's past successes against recent setbacks to determine the franchise's path forward.Despite the recent seventh-place finish, Rhodes' remarks emphasize confidence in Rahul's capacity to lead LSG effectively.",Lucknow Super Giants fielding coach Jonty Rhodes praises KL Rahul's leadership.

NEUFC hungry for more after Durand win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/neufc-hungry-for-more-after-durand-win/articleshow/112974236.cms,"“We are still in the cloud. We don’t believe it yet,” were Juan Pedro Benali ’s words at the post-match press conference in Kolkata.But just as he followed it up by reiterating as an afterthought, NorthEast United are Durand Cup champions and had a rousing welcome upon their return to Guwahati with the first trophy to add to their cabinet.“We are really hungry, you know.We are a young team. And till today (Saturday), we didn’t win absolutely anything,” he explained of their undying determination in etching a shoot-out win against a fancied Mohun Bagan Super Giant playing at home.Their failure to have qualified for the playoffs of Indian Super League last season seemed to have added to their resolve in ushering in the new season with a bang.“When you underestimate a team like us, you fail. And the players worked very, very hard. They beat themselves and the result came. I think everyone thought it was finished after Mohun Bagan took a 2-0 lead in the first half. But we are the wolves of the Northeast. We always go hunting. We are hungry. Till the last minute,” added Benali.Their consistent performance – both as a team and in individual brilliance – is vindicated by the fact that along with the champions trophy, the Highlanders have brought home the Golden Ball and Golden Glove for Jithin MS and Gurmeet Singh, respectively.It was also a reward for the belief shown in NEUFC by its sole owner, actor John Abraham, who is the only private owner in an ISL environment of large franchise owners.“The feeling of winning Durand Cup has not yet sunk in. This is just a lesson for all to never give up, to hold on to the team and support the team, not just in winning times but even when we are losing,” Abraham, who was at the Salt Lake stadium to savour every moment of the final, said in a video message on the club’s social media handle.“There’s light at the end of the tunnel and we proved it! Congratulations to the entire team and the staff… I am just a representation standing here talking on their behalf.

And the Spaniard at the helm of guiding them suggested it could be the path they take.“We are a club that develops, we are a club that who we are. We have our feet on the ground.

There are clubs like Sethu FC, Gokulam Kerala, Kickstart and HOPS who are doing a lot for women's football solely for passion and with nothing in return. So, this kind of a win gives them hope and satisfaction,"" Crispin told TOI from Jordan. ""It's also a platform for me as a coach to learn what the Indian players lack and work on that. And for the players, they will get to understand the difference between us and the best women footballers in Asia.""With Etihad starting Saturday's game with a better goal difference, their confidence was met by the grit of Odisha players. However, a misunderstanding between Taqi Ghazi and goalkeeper Sherin Shalabi led to the breakthrough in the 27th minute, with Yeboah guiding the ball into a gaping goalmouth.The tie then saw the two teams reduced to 10 players just before the break, with an off-the-ball altercation between Leen Al-Btoush and Grace Hauhnar resulting in referee Rebecca Durcau sending off both the players.Despite a couple of saves from goalkeeper Shreya Hooda, the hosts equalised in the 57th minute with Jordan's all-time top-scorer Maysa Jbarah curling in a low shot beyond Hooda from a Naima Bouhani long cross.The Indian side, however, took the lead again in the 71st minute, benefiting from another Etihad mistake when Shalabi missed her attempted clearance, allowing Odisha's Ghanaian recruit to slot home her second of the game and take Odisha into the group stage.""We had a gameplan for Etihad but it's the attitude of the players that won the match. We were monsters in the field,"" the Odisha coach said in his assessment of the game.While Crispin agreed that they might ""add a few players here and there"" to their squad, for the time being the coach stressed on the need for some time away from football for the team before they embark on their group-stage AFC campaign in Vietnam from October 6 to 12.","Odisha FC Women beat Etihad Club 2-1 at Prince Mohammed Stadium in Zarqa, Jordan.

Premier League: Liverpool demolish Man United to maintain perfect Arne Slot start,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-liverpool-demolish-man-united-to-maintain-perfect-arne-slot-start/articleshow/112973541.cms,"NEW DELHI: Arne Slot successfully managed his first major test as Liverpool manager with a resounding 3-0 victory against Manchester United on Sunday, with Luis Diaz scoring twice and Mohamed Salah adding a third.Slot, who replaced Jurgen Klopp, has now maintained a perfect record with three wins in the Premier League , placing Liverpool alongside Manchester City at the top of the table.United, on the other hand, faced their second consecutive defeat, putting United's manager, Erik ten Hag, under early-season pressure. Last season, Ten Hag oversaw United's worst-ever Premier League finish, landing in eighth place.An FA Cup final victory over Manchester City briefly revived his position, accompanied by a substantial £200 million investment in new signings.Despite the financial backing, United's weaknesses from last season were evident against Liverpool. Casemiro, in particular, struggled, being blamed for both of Diaz's goals and subsequently substituted at half-time for the younger Toby Collyer.Manuel Ugarte, a £42 million signing, was introduced to the crowd before the match. The club now hopes the Uruguayan can strengthen their midfield. In contrast, Liverpool made an effective internal adjustment by moving Ryan Gravenberch into a defensive midfield role, a decision by Slot that has already yielded positive results.Klopp's tenure saw Liverpool dominate United yet struggle to secure victories at Old Trafford, managing just two wins out of 11 away games. Notable past matches include last season's narrow FA Cup quarter-final loss and a league draw that hindered Liverpool's title bid.However, on Sunday, Liverpool's performance was clinical, nearly matching their record 5-0 win at Old Trafford in 2021. Liverpool displayed early dominance, though an initial goal by Trent Alexander-Arnold was disallowed due to Mohamed Salah being offside.Casemiro's early season form had shown promise, contrasting with his struggles last season. Nevertheless, his performance on Sunday suggested his peak might be behind him. A poorly executed pass by Casemiro led to Liverpool's first goal, with Gravenberch intercepting and passing to Salah, who set up Diaz.Shortly after, Alisson Becker made a critical save against Noussair Mazraoui. Yet United's defense crumbled after Liverpool's second goal just before half-time. Diaz capitalized on another Casemiro mistake and scored from Salah's cross.Salah extended Liverpool's lead on 56 minutes, scoring his 15th goal in 16 matches against Manchester United. His goal also continued his streak of scoring in each of his last seven appearances at Old Trafford.Salah could have increased his tally but missed a close-range opportunity while his teammates awaited a pass. Alisson further secured Liverpool's clean sheet with a fine save from Joshua Zirkzee's shot.Arsenal has often been viewed as Manchester City's main challenger for the Premier League title after four consecutive wins by Pep Guardiola's team. Yet, Liverpool’s early-season performance under Slot suggests they remain serious contenders, even in the absence of Klopp.","Arne Slot successfully managed his first major test as Liverpool manager with a resounding 3-0 victory against Manchester United on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Chelsea experienced disappointment with a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace while Newcastle earned a 2-1 win over Tottenham in Premier League on Sunday.Enzo Maresca's Chelsea have managed only one win in three league games under their new Italian manager after a turbulent off-season.Chelsea, beaten by Manchester City in their opening game, secured an impressive 6-2 victory at Wolves last weekend.However, they barely made it into the UEFA Conference League group stage, following a 2-1 defeat at Servette on Thursday.Former Leicester boss Maresca asserts that Chelsea's expensive rebuild, featuring numerous new signings, is progressing well despite their inconsistent results.The squad saw a significant addition with Jadon Sancho's loan move from Manchester United. Sancho was introduced to the Chelsea crowd before taking his place in the director's box next to co-owner Behdad Eghbali.However, the match against Crystal Palace showcased Chelsea's struggle as Noni Madueke set up Cole Palmer, whose pass was converted by Nicolas Jackson in the 25th minute. The team failed to maintain their lead, leaving Sancho potentially unimpressed with his new club's performance.Maresca was furious after Palace midfielder Will Hughes avoided a second yellow card for a foul on Palmer.Looking for their first point this season after defeats against Brentford and West Ham, Palace made the most of that escape to drew level in the 53rd minute.England midfielder Eberechi Eze unfurled a superb curling finish that flashed past Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez from 20 yards.Eze's eye-catching goal and a late close-range miss by Jackson ended Chelsea's run of 14 successive wins against Palace in all competitions.At St James' Park, Wilson Odobert, Pape Sarr and Pedro Porro all wasted good chances for Tottenham in the early stages.Newcastle took the lead in spectacular fashion in the 37th minute when Lloyd Kelly pulled the ball back to Harvey Barnes, who unleashed a sublime volley into the far corner from 10 yards.Tottenham equalised in the 56th minute as Newcastle defender Dan Burn accidently diverted the ball into his own net while trying to clear after Brennan Johnson's cross eluded Nick Pope, who had weakly parried James Maddison's shot in the build-up to the goal.Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali came on for his first Premier League appearance in over 10 months after his ban for breaching betting rules.The Magpies went back in front in the 78th minute when Jacob Murphy ran onto Joelinton's defence-splitting pass and laid on a tap-in for Alexander Isak.Unbeaten Newcastle's second win in three league games condemned Tottenham to a first defeat this term, with the north London derby against Arsenal next up after the international break.Liverpool travel to Old Trafford in Sunday's late game as Reds boss Arne Slot gets his first taste of the bitter rivalry with United.Hired from Feyenoord to succeed Jurgen Klopp in the close-season, Slot has overseen 2-0 wins against Ipswich and Brentford in his first two games.Slot's fellow Dutchman Erik ten Hag is already under pressure at United after their 2-1 defeat at Brighton last weekend.",Enzo Maresca's Chelsea have managed only one win in three league games under their new Italian manager.

Lynda picked out Yeboah, who capitalized on an error in judgment by the Etihad goalkeeper and slotted the ball into an empty net.The Juggernauts then focused on defending in numbers for the remaining 20 minutes of the match.India's goalkeeper Shreya Hooda also made a couple of remarkable saves in the dying minutes to ensure the win and cap off a historic night in Indian women's football.In the Group Stage of the AFC Women's Champions League, Odisha FC will travel to Vietnam to face Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies (Japan), Taichung Blue Whale Women's Football Team (Chinese Taipei), and hosts Ho Chi Minh City Women's FC (Vietnam).The Group Stage consists of three groups of four teams and will also be played in a centralized league format from October 6-12.The top two finishers of each group and the two best third-placed teams will advance to the quarterfinals, which will be played on March 22 and 23, 2025.A knockout stage draw will be conducted before the quarterfinals to determine the four pairings, which will be played in a single-leg format, with the higher-ranked team of each tie serving as the home side.This will be followed by a centralized finals, which will include the semi-finals and final, all single-leg ties -- being played out from May 21-24, 2025, to determine the inaugural champions of the AFC Women's Champions League.",Odisha FC advance to AFC Women's Champions League Group Stage.

Substitute Rafael Leao equalized for Milan, marking their third consecutive game without a win.Meanwhile, Romelu Lukaku scored on his debut for Napoli as Antonio Conte’s side came from behind to defeat a 10-man Parma 2-1 for their second consecutive win.In an effort to spark a response from his team, AC Milan coach Fonseca benched Rafael Leao, Theo Hernandez, and Davide Calabria. Despite this bold move, Milan began well with Pavlovic's early goal. However, Lazio turned the game around with second-half goals from Castellanos and Dia.Leao, introduced as a substitute, managed to level the score for Milan after Lazio’s two strikes.Leao and Hernandez, both brought on after the two Lazio goals, stayed on the far side of the field during a cooling break, seemingly isolated from the rest of the Milan squad.Fonseca said Leao and Hernandez didn't need to join the team for drinks because they had just come on minutes earlier.""Let's not create a problem because there is no problem. The reaction from the players was good,"" Fonseca said. ""When there's a problem, I take responsibility but right now there's no problem.""Tammy Abraham, making his Milan debut after moving from Roma, provided an assist for Leao's equalizer.Currently, Milan have two points from two draws and a loss, while Lazio have four points.Elsewhere, Parma's defender Enrico Del Prato had to fill in as goalkeeper after starter Zion Suzuki received two yellow cards and was sent off, with all five substitutions already made. Del Prato could only manage a weak touch on a shot from Lukaku and reacted late to a header from Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa during 15 minutes of stoppage time.Parma had initially taken the lead through Ange-Yoan Bonny's penalty.Lukaku, recently signed from Chelsea, reunited with Conte at Napoli and donned the No. 11 shirt instead of his customary No. 9. Victor Osimhen, who has not secured a transfer, remains sidelined from the squad. Napoli now have six points following their initial 3-0 loss to Hellas Verona.A tribute was made to former Lazio coach Sven-Goran Eriksson before the Lazio-Milan match. Eriksson, who passed away on Monday from pancreatic cancer, was honoured with a three-minute video of his years at Lazio displayed on the jumbo screens at the Stadio Olimpico. A banner in the center circle read, ""Sven Goran Eriksson forever.""Eriksson led Lazio to the Serie A title in 2000 and also secured a Cup Winner's Cup with the club. Lazio players wore black armbands, and a minute of silence was held before every Serie A game this weekend in his memory.Giovanni Fabbian and Emmanuel Gyasi scored early goals as Bologna drew 1-1 with Empoli, leaving Bologna, last season's fifth-placed team, winless. They host Shakhtar Donetsk in their Champions League opener on September 18.In another match, Lecce secured a 1-0 victory over Cagliari with a goal from Nikola Krstovic, even though they played the entire second half with 10 men.","AC Milan coach Paulo Fonseca benched Rafael Leao, Theo Hernandez, and Davide Calabria.

Maiden Durand Cup title for NorthEast United FC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/maiden-durand-cup-title-for-northeast-united-fc/articleshow/112961793.cms,"Goalkeeper Gurmeet steals the thunder from Bagan's Kaith in shootout

ROLL OF HONOUR

Golden Ball: Jithin MS (NEUFC)

Golden Boot: Noah Sadaoui (Kerala Blasters)

Golden Glove: Gurmeet Singh (NEUFC)

KOLKATA: In the end, it was a triumph NorthEast United FC seemed to have stolen straight from the page of Mohun Bagan 's script.It was history for them, their cup of joy --pure, maiden and magical. It was their goalkeeper Gurmeet Singh's turn to do a Vishal Kaith , pulling off two saves in the shootout to seal the deal.It was a what-could-have-been moment for Mohun Bagan SG as well.NorthEast United lifted the Durand Cup --their first trophy since their birth in Indian football a decade ago ---dramatically beating Mohun Bagan 4-3 in penalty shootout after coming back from 0-2 goal down to hold the defending champions 2-2 in regulation time at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Saturday.And how the Highlanders flourished on a stage which Mohun Bagan seemed to have made a part of their survival gene in this tournament. And how Bagan's art ofescapology failed to bear fruit in the most decisive stage of the tournament.In the back-to-back knockout matches leading to the final, Jose Molina's green-and maroon brigade made it a habit of surviving against the odds, clawing their way back from the jaws of death against Punjab FC and Bengaluru FC before seeing goalkeeper Vishal Kaith rising to the occasion and keeping his team afloat with two crucial in the penalty shootout on both occasions.The script underwent a complete change in the final. It was Mohun Bagan who claimed a 2-0 goal lead thanks to Jason Cummings' penalty in the 11th minute and Sahal Abdul Samad's first goal of the season four minutes into the first half injury time.Until then, it was smooth sailing for Mohun Bagan and their march to Durand Cup title No. 18 looked like theirs to lose. But NEUFC --with their co-owner John Abraham in attendance in the stands --turned the game on its head in a remarkable second-half resuscitation. Their coach Benali's introduction of Guillermo Fernandez and Louis Macarton paid off handsomely as the Highlanders took the wind out of Bagan's sails with two goals in a span of three minutes.Moroccan Alaaeddine Ajaraie reduced the margin, beating Vishal through his first post with a perfect right-footer in the 55th minute. Three minutes later, Ajaraie came calling again, this time sending a long cross from the left and Guillermo, following the ball's trajectory, met it with a sumptuous strike, giving the Bagan goalkeeper no chance to react.In a tale of two halves, NEUFC completely dominated the contest thereafter and when Dimitri Petratos --who came in the second half with Molina deciding to start with Greg Stewart --saw his scorcher miss the target by a whisker in the 87th minute, it was Bagan's first attempt at goal since Guillermo's goal, manifesting how the tide was turned.Yet, facing the third penalty shootout in as many matches, Vishal stood under the bar with the been-there-done that confidence. But his thunder was stolen by his opposite number in NEUFC.Bagan started the shootout ominously when Cummings blazed his shot over the bar, but referee Harish Kundu judged Gurmeet to have moved out of his line before the penalty and the Australian was spot on with his retaken kick. Lucky briefly seemed to be on the home team's side but Gurmeet came up with two stupendous saves, denying Liston Colaco and Subhasish Bose and setting his team on way to a history-oozing victory.",NorthEast United lift Durand Cup after beating defending champions Mohun Bagan 4-3 in penalty shootout.
