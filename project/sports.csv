In a stunning upset at the Guyana National Stadium on Friday, Afghanistan dominated a lackluster New Zealand, claiming the top spot in Group C at the T20 World Cup with an emphatic 84-run victory, which is also their first ever against the Kiwis in T20 internationals.Chasing a challenging target of 160, New Zealand faltered, collapsing to 75 all out in 15.2 overs.Rahmanullah Gurbaz set the stage for Afghanistan with a commanding 80 off 56 balls, supported by Ibrahim Zadran's 44, as they amassed 159 for six after being put in to bat. Their opening partnership of 103 by the 15th over laid a solid foundation for their challenging total.Fazalhaq Farooqi , continuing his stellar performance from the opening match against Uganda, wreaked havoc on the New Zealand batting lineup, claiming four crucial wickets for just 17 runs.Captain Rashid Khan , the champion leg-spinner, mirrored Farooqi's figures, also taking four wickets for 17 runs, including a pivotal dismissal of Kane Williamson with his first ball, effectively sealing the fate of the match.""We've been waiting for this moment for about three years,"" said a delighted 'Player of the Match' Gurbaz. ""We have the trust and belief that we can beat any team in this competition on this type or surface. At the start of the innings our target was around 130-140 and we played our part in getting there, but credit must go to the bowlers as well. To do this against a team like New Zealand...it's unbelievable"".New Zealand's evident collapse and apparent lack of form present a daunting task for the 2021 finalists as they gear up to face hosts West Indies at the Brian Lara Stadium in Trinidad next Wednesday.""This just wasn't good enough in terms of starting a tournament. It's very frustrating,"" admitted Williamson, reflecting on a forgettable night for New Zealand cricket.""We have to move on quickly from this because the matches now come thick and fast for us. Yes, we have to learn from so much that went wrong without over-analysing, but we have to turn it around as quickly as we can,"" he added.Williamson's somber demeanor stood in sharp contrast to his Afghanistan counterpart Rashid, who provided a perspective on the result.""It is one of the greatest performances for us in T20's against a big team like New Zealand,"" said Rashid. ""And it was great team effort, from the opening stand between Gurbaz and Ibrahim to the bowlers to the effort in the field from everyone. It's a great feeling to be leading this side.""While his bowling performance was commendable, the captain chose to highlight Farooqi's remarkable impact, noting his nine-wicket haul in the first two matches of the World Cup.Farooqi made a perfect start against the Black Caps, dismissing Finn Allen comprehensively with the very first ball of the New Zealand innings.""He is a very skilful bowler, but there's still lots of areas to improve,"" Rashid cautioned. ""Once he understands how skilful he really is he will be very dangerous in the future.""","Afghanistan beat New Zealand by 84 runs to top Group C at T20 World Cup. Victory is Afghanistan's first ever against New Zealand in T20 internationals. New Zealand collapse to 75 all out in 15.2 overs, chasing 160 target.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110811272,imgsize-47764,width-400,resizemode-4/110811272.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has labeled India's decision to open with Virat Kohli in the T20 World Cup as a significant mistake.In India's tournament opener against Ireland, Kohli, as an opener, was dismissed cheaply, scoring just 1 run off 5 balls. Despite this, the Indian team management appears set to continue with this batting order for their crucial match against Pakistan on Sunday.Akmal expressed his disagreement with this strategy, suggesting that Kohli should be positioned at No. 3, where he can anchor the innings and guide the team through the middle overs.""I don't think the batting order is correct. Virat Kohli can take the pressure at No.3 and finish the match. That is very important for Team India. Yashasvi Jaiswal should open the batting. Kohli should come at 3.

In the recently concluded IPL, Kohli won the Orange Cap, scoring 741 runs at a strike rate of 154.India delivered a comprehensive performance in their first match of the tournament, but their real test lies ahead against Pakistan. The Pakistan team, reeling from a shock defeat to the USA, will be eager to bounce back.""India will be confident. Bumrah bowled well, Siraj did well. Hardik Pandya also got wickets.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt did not hold back his criticism of Haris Rauf following the fast bowler's performance in Pakistan's T20 World Cup match against the USA in Dallas, Texas.Rauf, who was entrusted with bowling the final over with the USA needing 15 runs to win, faltered under pressure, leading to a dramatic finish.Butt expressed his frustration with Rauf on the ' Cricket Baithak' podcast, emphasizing the fast bowler's apparent lack of awareness and failure to bowl to the field.""It is not a surprise that he conceded so many runs because he is that kid who doesn't look at his field at all. Mid-off is inside the circle, and yet he bowls full and gets hit for a boundary on the last ball. You can see the captain also screamed at him. When you have mid-off up, then you don't bowl full balls. This is a basic of cricket,"" Butt said.Rauf was the most expensive among Pakistan bowlers who bowled more than an over, leaking 37 runs in his four-over spell. His erratic bowling drew criticism from Butt, who questioned Rauf's professionalism and ability to learn from his mistakes.""He (Haris Rauf) has some weird style when he bowls a ball and just sits on his knees with his hand on his head.

NEW DELHI: When asked if the IPL auction crosses his mind, Saurabh Netravalkar simply laughs on the other end of the phone before emphatically stating, ""No,"" in a resonant baritone.Netravalkar played a pivotal role in newcomers' USA's remarkable victory over former champions Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on Thursday.""It is just one match and we have done well.The focus should be on the next game and frankly speaking, all of us in the United States of America cricket team, are trying to come to terms with our achievements.""It is yet to sink in and things you are talking about, if it happens organically, it will happen. We are still trying to digest what happened,"" the former India U-19 left-arm pacer, who made the difference with a brilliant Super Over against Pakistan, told PTI in an exclusive interview on Friday.An alumnus of prestigious Cornell University and a senior software engineer at Oracle , Netravalkar adeptly balanced academics and cricket.""I have never felt the pressure. When you love something, it is never a job for you. So when I am out there on the field, I love bowling and trying to out-think a batter. When I am coding , I love doing that and hence it never feels like work,"" the left-arm seamer, who has suddenly become the talk of the town, couldn't have put it more lucidly.""Actually, we just flew down from Dallas to New York. I will be honest that it has been quite overwhelming. I wish I could personally thank each and everyone for their lovely messages. I feel blessed,"" one could sense the gratitude in his voice.What was the strategy for the Super Over, and when did he find out he would be bowling?""It wasn't pre-decided and only after the regulation 20 overs did skipper (Monank Patel) and coach (Stuart Law) informed me about it. I am thankful to them for showing faith in me.""He then gave an insight into the US strategy.""The plan was simple that I will try and bowl wide yorkers to the right handers and try to keep it out of his range as the boundary on that side was bigger. First ball the batter shifted and didn't get a wide and second ball, he stayed rooted and connected, and then, I got a couple of wides, as I was trying for wide lines.""But I must say that 18 runs helped and all those extra runs that Harmeet (Singh) and Aaron (Jones) ran, helped. Basically, if you are defending around 20, all you need is three good balls, and the job is done. It is one of the best matches I have played.""However, Netravalkar would matter-of-factly state that while opportunities in professional cricket are improving in the US, his primary source of income remains his day job at Oracle.""The best part is that I have got very supportive bosses at Oracle and I am allowed to work remotely when I am on tour, playing for the United States.""So on match days, I am excused from work but then there are scheduled project meetings which warrants my presence and then I work my practice schedule accordingly. I would also thank US Cricket board as they also are flexible if I have meetings lined up.""His is a fascinating story.""I can tell you that when I play local matches or club games in the United States, I have often logged in for a meeting at the lunch break and people have been very accommodating.""At Oracle, they all know by now I play cricket and everyone is happy to support. I work in team Oracle text and I am primarily a coder, who works on SQL and C (programming languages),"" he said.What are the prospects of a full-time cricket career in the United States?""Well, if you have a Major League Contracts, those are good and you can have a full-time cricket career.""Minor League Cricket is also seeing an upswing but another avenue is some weekend 'Pop-Up' tournaments, basically played from Friday to Sunday in Houston, Florida where you can actually earn well.""Come June 12, and Netravalkar will be facing the Indian team and he is quite emotional about it.""I know all of them and Surya (Yadav) and myself have played together for Mumbai U15s, U-17, U-19s. It is so good to see what he has achieved and it will be nice to catch up with them.

NEW DELHI: Skipper Brian Masaba and the Uganda cricket team celebrated their first-ever victory at the Twenty20 World Cup with style and exuberance, marking a significant milestone for the nation's cricketing journey.In a low-scoring thriller against Papua New Guinea , Uganda secured a dramatic three-wicket win, which they celebrated with their unique brand of joy and gratitude.The match, held in the Caribbean, saw Uganda bowl out PNG for a meager 77 runs. Despite the low target, Uganda's chase was fraught with challenges. They faced a precarious situation early on, losing their first three wickets in just 2.1 overs and further slumping to 26/5 by the seventh over.However, Riazat Ali Shah's composed 33 and Juma Miyagi's supportive 13 helped stabilize the innings. Their crucial 35-run partnership for the sixth wicket steered Uganda towards the finish line, achieving the target with 10 balls and three wickets to spare in only their second game at a T20 World Cup .Following the victory, the Ugandan team lined up on the boundary rope to bow and acknowledge the fans who had traveled from Africa to support them. This heartfelt gesture was a tribute to their supporters and a testament to their unity and gratitude.Their celebration didn't stop there. A video capturing their joyous song and dance on the field quickly went viral on social media, showcasing the team's infectious enthusiasm and the historic nature of their triumph.""First win at the World Cup — doesn't get more special than this,"" Masaba said after the match. ""I'm super proud of this group, the work they put in. To get a win for their country at a World Cup, it's pretty special.""Uganda's journey to this historic win included navigating through the African qualifying stages, ultimately securing their spot in the 20-team global tournament at the expense of Zimbabwe, a long-time full member of the International Cricket Council.","Uganda secured a dramatic three-wicket win against Papua New Guinea.

NEW DELHI: After a respectable first-class career, some were looking for greener pastures; others were hoping for a second chance at life; and still others were just talented enough to be forced to find an obscure cricket ground on a weekend.Meet the stars of the USA's T20 World Cup debut, which shocked the cricket world by defeating Pakistan, the finalists of the previous edition, in Dallas:The team's captain, who was born in Ahmedabad, is one of the few individuals who moved to essentially pursue his cricketing career. He was awarded player of the match for his half century. In 2010, he obtained a Green Card, and in 2016, he moved permanently to New Jersey.A powerful right-hander, when he's not playing for his country, he also teaches cricket to kids living abroad three times a week and runs coaching clinics. Turf wickets were scarce in the USA at first, and Monank has participated in numerous 20- and 30-over weekend club events throughout the nation in addition to playing a lot of matting cricket.Netravalkar is the epitome of a happy union between academia and athletics. He rose to prominence following a brilliant Super Over, and before that he squared up Mohammed Rizwan with an away swinger and tricked Iftikhar Ahmed with a low sinking slow full-toss.During the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand, he faced some of the best U-19 English cricket players, including Joe Root, Jos Buttler, and Ben Stokes. Known as ""Netra"" at the time, he combined well with fellow left-arm seamer Jaydev Unadkat and Sandeep Sharma of Punjab.But just like in Mumbai, one must be the best in order to live; being good is insufficient. The academically gifted young man, who already had an engineering degree in computer science, was awarded a scholarship to study for an MS at Cornell University.But sport never left him. To establish himself, he competed at all levels of US cricket and put on a respectable performance in Major League sport's inaugural season, which featured several of the best T20 players in the world.He works as a senior technologist at Oracle's Silicon Valley division, away from cricket.As with many young talents, he lost his way, but Ian Chappell wanted him to be inducted into the Indian team after his performances in the 2012 U-19 World Cup. When he was caught by the police driving inside a train station, rumors about his lack of discipline spread quickly, and Mumbai cricket turned its back on him.As a professional, he relocated to Tripura, but he had little luck there. He made the wise decision to immigrate to the United States. Including a recent series against Bangladesh, he has been among the most reliable players since finding his groove again. With the ball in Rizwan's hands, he swiped extra runs during the Super Over.Not sure if Kenjige has heard the well-known country song ""I come from Alabama"" by Stephen C. Foster, the father of American music, but being born in that well-known Southeast, Kenjige's story as a Tamil-American is intriguing.He used to be a left-arm medium pacer before learning to spin at the age of thirteen. He had moved to Ooty with his parents when he was a young child. Kenjige's parents sent him to Bengaluru when he was eighteen years old, where he participated in the KSCA's first division league.But after realizing how difficult it was to even get into the Karnataka state side, he made the decision to return home and enrol in a bio-medical engineering program.When he went for the United States, he had given up playing cricket and had not even bothered to pack his equipment. However, a cricket ball that his mother had hidden in his suitcase changed everything. After landing a position in Washington, DC, he played squash in the evenings and learned about club cricket in New York.After that, he quit his position as a Bio-Medical officer and joined the USA's WCL Division 4 team.When Milind Kumar first arrived, everyone in the Delhi circuit scene thought he was a good talent. However, after seven years, he was reduced to a supporting role and frequently left to bat with the tail in Ranji Trophy matches. Moving to Sikkim in the Plate League and scoring over 1300 runs did not prove to be the lucky break he had hoped for.He moved to the US after COVID-19 and performed well in local competitions to secure a spot in the 15. He was an excellent fielder, even for Delhi, and Iftikhar Ahmed would have learned his lesson the hard way in the Super Over. Pakistan's aspirations were dashed by the catch, leaping forward after racing ten yards from the long-off boundary.Whether you live in India or the US, now is a great time to be a Nitish Kumar. School-going Nitish set a world record in 2011 when MS Dhoni struck that massive six-ball to win the World Cup and Virat Kohli was just starting to make waves as the next big thing. At 16 years old, Nitish played a 50-over World Cup match for Canada against Zimbabwe, becoming the youngest player to do so.His moment of glory came thirteen years ago when he hit the boundary off Haris Rauf's final delivery. As Ian Bishop would have said: ""Remember the Name, Nitish Kumar.""Jessy, who was born in New Jersey, raised in a rural Punjabi household, and is currently in his teens, has spent a considerable amount of time in the land of opportunity.He was left out of the US squad that traveled to the West Indies to compete in a domestic 50 over competition in 2015. In order to double his practice hours, Jessy left everything.Former US coach Pubudu Dassanayeke organized five first-class matches in Sri Lanka in 2016, which is where he discovered the value of perseverance. He has become an essential member of Pakistani Ali Khan's speed attack over the last few years. Without a doubt, the delivery that struck Babar Azam out was the best of his career thus far.","The stars of the USA's T20 World Cup debut, which shocked the cricket world by defeating Pakistan, the finalists of the previous edition, in Dallas.

Under the leadership of Babar Azam , the team has encountered difficulties in finding their form, which has been evident since their 2-0 T20I series loss to England.Their attempt to build momentum against the USA, one of the tournament's co-hosts, unfortunately resulted in a surprising defeat for Pakistan in a Super Over.ALSO SEE: T20 World Cup Schedule Inzamam highlighted the significance of the upcoming game against India, suggesting that a victory could help in regaining the support of their fans.""To win fans back, Pakistan need to win the game against India. It's not like Pakistan cannot defeat India, they should keep everything aside and focus the game on Sunday. Everybody should believe that they can win the match. Everybody should try to win the game for Pakistan. Your body language and belief changes when you have confidence,"" Inzamam said on his YouTube channel.Pakistan's performance in the current edition of the World Cup has not mirrored their high-ranking status from the previous tournament, as they entered as the seventh-ranked T20I team. This decline has been attributed to frequent changes in management and an inconsistent lineup, particularly affecting the middle order.Shadab Khan , who has been a key player in Pakistan's batting lineup, has recently been underperforming, which was highlighted by his minimal run contribution against England and his less effective bowling.Furthermore, Inzamam has suggested that Abrar Ahmed be considered for inclusion in the team, pointing out the need for effective contributions from all players. ""Abrar should be given a chance, if six batters don't score then the seventh one can't save the game for you. Shadab is struggling with the ball,"" he added.","Former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has emphasized the importance of the Pakistani cricket team focusing solely on their imminent match against India.

NEW DELHI: Ex-Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh has expressed his opinion that India hold a favourable position for the upcoming match ahead of the eagerly anticipated T20 World Cup 2024 encounter between India and Pakistan at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium.This perspective comes as India enter the game following an 8-wicket victory over Ireland, while Pakistan face the challenge of bouncing back from a narrow super-over defeat to the US in their last outing at this prominent tournament.ALSO SEE: T20 World Cup Schedule Harbhajan highlighted the advantage India gain from having prior experience playing at the New York venue, in contrast to Pakistan, whose recent game was played on a significantly flatter pitch.""India will have an advantage because they have already played on this ground and Pakistan are coming into this game after playing on a flat pitch,"" Harbhajan told ANI.At 43, Harbhajan remains insightful about the game, pointing out that India's current form is another factor that could tilt the balance in their favour.""It will be a big challenge for Pakistan to settle in this condition after losing against the US. So, India have the advantage and they are playing well also,"" he added.Harbhajan also identified key players who could influence the outcome of the India-Pakistan clash. "" Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav will make the maximum impact in the upcoming match against Pakistan. These two players are match-winners,"" Harbhajan added, attributing their abilities to influence high-stakes matches.Furthermore, he advocated for the inclusion of spinner Kuldeep Yadav in the lineup against Pakistan, saying, ""Kuldeep Yadav is a wicket-taker and has variations so he should play. I think Axar Patel was included in the playing eleven since India needed a batting option in the 8th place.""","Harbhajan Singh believes India hold a favourable position ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024 encounter.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand's captain, Kane Williamson , won the toss and elected to field first against Afghanistan in the T20 World Cup Group C encounter held at the Guyana National Stadium.This decision set the stage for a keenly anticipated match-up. Afghanistan has been gaining recognition for their formidable presence in the white ball formats of international cricket This was evident from their commanding 125-run victory over Uganda, a team making its debut in the tournament, in their opening match at the same venue.Despite this strong start, Afghanistan was compelled to adjust their lineup due to Mujeeb ur Rahman , a pivotal spinner in their squad, being sidelined by a persistent hand injury. Noor Ahmad , another talented spinner from their ranks, was chosen to fill Rahman's spot for this crucial game.New Zealand, on the other hand, arrived at this tournament with high expectations, having finished as runners-up in the 2021 edition. Their campaign in the current tournament began almost a week after its commencement, marking a significant period of anticipation for the team and its supporters.In a notable selection decision, New Zealand opted to exclude Rachin Ravindra , one of their emerging batting talents, from their playing XI for this match. Mark Chapman was selected in Ravindra’s stead, indicating the team's strategy and preference for this particular game.The context of this match is framed by the contrasting yet compelling narratives of both teams. Afghanistan's recent ascendancy in international cricket, particularly in the shorter formats, has been a storyline of growing interest. Their ability to deliver decisive victories, as demonstrated against Uganda, underscores their potential to challenge established cricketing nations.New Zealand's consistent performance at the highest levels, including their near miss in the previous T20 World Cup, positions them as one of the favorites and adds an intriguing dynamic to the encounter.Finn Allen, Devon Conway(w), Kane Williamson(c), Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner, Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Lockie FergusonRahmanullah Gurbaz(w), Ibrahim Zadran, Najibullah Zadran, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Rashid Khan(c), Karim Janat, Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi.","Afghanistan beat New Zealand in T20 World Cup Group C encounter.

NEW DELHI: Canada skipper Saad Bin Zafar on Friday acknowledged that the pitch at the Nassau County ground slowed down in the second half of their T20 World Cup match against Ireland, which they managed to win by 12 runs.Canada posted 137 for 7 in the first innings and then restricted Ireland to 125 for seven, securing their maiden victory in the tournament.Zafar attributed their success to the decision to include an extra spinner, praising the performances of both himself and Junaid Siddiqui.The pitch at this venue has been under scrutiny for its challenging batting conditions, with low-scoring games being the norm, especially with the highly anticipated clash between India and Pakistan scheduled for Sunday.""The wicket got a bit slow today, so it worked to our advantage. We gambled with an extra spinner and I feel both myself and Junaid (Siddiqui) bowled really well,"" Zafar said at the post-match presentation.The pitch at this venue has been in spotlight for being tough to bat on, since it has produced very low-scoring games with the mega clash between India and Pakistan coming up on Sunday.Zafar, meanwhile, hoped that Canada will be able to carry the momentum into their next game against Pakistan.""One game at a time, we need to enjoy this win and come back strong against Pakistan. We are here to play positive cricket,"" Zafar said while talking about his team's show.Describing their win as a ""proud moment"", Zafar praised his side for a unified show.""(It's a) very proud moment for the team. The way Kirton and Movva batted, we knew we had a good total to defend. We needed a good performance from the bowling unit and I am so proud of my bowlers for putting their hand up and delivering,"" he said.Ireland skipper Paul Stirling, whose batting struggles continued with a meager score of nine, acknowledged that his team was not at their best and hoped for improvement in all aspects of the game.""(It was a) tough loss, we weren't at the races today. The target was gettable and we didn't think we'd struggle too much,"" he said.""We were off in all three facets today, we need to show a better game when we go to Miami and Florida. We don't want to look too far into the future, we've got USA next,"" Stirling added.Nicholas Kirton, who played a match-winning knock of 49 off 35 balls, emphasized the importance of Canada bouncing back after their heavy defeat against the USA in the tournament opener.He found the pitch to be generally good for batting, with only a small area in the middle causing some inconsistency.""Bouncing back from the first game was important. Trust me, it wasn't that easy. (I) just tried to get in, get the pace of the wicket. Honestly it wasn't that bad. There was an area in the middle of the wicket that was a bit up and down, but otherwise it was a good wicket to bat on,"" he said.""(It is) very good to get our first win in the World Cup. Hopefully we can continue from strength to strength. Our next focus is Pakistan. Two spinners bowled very well (as there was a) bit of purchase on offer,"" he added.(With inputs from PTI)","Canada posted 137 for 7 in the first innings and then restricted Ireland to 125 for seven, securing their maiden victory in the tournament.

KOLKATA: With his hands on the hip, Sunil Chhetri stood a little distance away from the pack of his teammates in the middle of the park. He stood motionless, as if dazed, for a few seconds, his eyes blank and without expression.

A few minutes ago, Chinese referee Fu Ming had blown the whistle to seal India's goalless draw with Kuwait in their second-round fixture of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, thus ringing the curtain on Chhetri's 19-year-old career in the Blue Tigers jersey.

Suddenly the Salt Lake Stadium stands roared into ""Chhetri, Chhteri"" chants, stirring the 39-year-old out of his trance as he was given a standing ovation He began a lap of honour around the ground. Then he broke down in tears as his teammates, coach Igor Stimac and his coaching staff members lined up to give him the guard of honour. After plethora of hugs and handshakes, he slowly walked down the tunnel, out of everyone's sight and into a new life, leaving behind a legacy Indian football has hardly experienced.

The build-up to Thursday's match was all about Chhetri's send-off. Before the kick-off, the famed Blue Pilgrims stand behind the goalpost unfurled a giant tifo, showing Chhetri holding the earth, a la Hercules. India failed to turn the occasion more memorable and meaningful for Chhetri following the stalemate but that tifo perhaps represents what Chhetri has stood for in Indian football in nearly two decades since making his senior de but against Pakistan in 2005.

He will be remembered as the defining player of his generation, someone who has transcended his sport more than any other, a reference point in Indian football in the true sense of the term.

Unlike IM Vijayan, he might not have an eye for the spectacular. Unlike Bhaichung Bhutia, he might not be a typical fox in the box. Chhetri's game has always been a fable of discipline, dedication and determination.

His goals were cheeky, audacious and brilliant - scoring from midfield to embarrassing the goalkeeper with a Panenka penalty. He made people fall in love with the game.

In a later post-match felicitation, organized by the Indian Football Association, he returned to the ground to receive accolades from the Big 3 clubs - East Bengal , Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting as well as the state government. A few former players like Vijayan, Mehtab Hossain, Alvito D'Cunha and Rahim Nabi then gave him a tight embrace one by one.

But not a welcome yet for India to a dream place in the third round of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers .India failed to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac 's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. As the tearful Chhetri left the international football stage after 151 caps and 94 goals and failing to make an impact in Thursday's game, India's chances of qualifying to the next round now hang in balance.With 5 points from as many matches, and both Afghanistan (4 points from 4 games) and Kuwait (4 points from 5 games) lurking close by, the Blue Tigers now have to beat the already qualified Qatar in their own den in the final Group A fixture next Tuesday to keep hopes alive.A top-two finish in the group is the prerequisite not only for opening the door for brushing shoulders with Asia's best in the third round of World Cup qualifiers, but also guaranteeing a berth in the next edition of Asian Cup .With stakes so high, it felt like a juncture match for Igor Stimac's side. Chhetri's farewell - which drew an official attendance of 58,921 in the stands - further elevated the sense of the occasion.But India never looked in sync with the challenge in question, dishing out another frustrating performance nearly three months after losing 1-2 to Afghanistan in Guwahati and making their job more difficult now.In fact, had Gurpreet Singh Sandhu not effected a string of saves, it could have been quite embarrassing for Chhetri and his team.Stimac started with a new and bold defensive set-up, giving FC Goa left-back Jay Gupta his debut in Blue Tigers jersey and pairing up Rahul Bheke with Anwar Ali in the heart of defence in absence of injured Sandesh Jhingan.But if the Croatian coach's 4-2-3-1 formation was meant to gain early ascendancy, it failed to instil the sort of organisation and obduracy that he would have expected to characterise his backline. The result was a streak of nervy moments invading the home team's play.The match was just four minutes old when Bheke failed to intercept a pass, allowing Mohammad Abdulah to stare at the goal with a world of time and space. But Kuwait's No. 9 ended up hitting straight at Gurpreet.Relieved and reprieved, India tried to make a statement, Liston Colaco seeing his cutback cleared by Kuwait defender Hasan Alanezi for a corner and Chhetri skying an attempt way over the bar.Just when India appeared to have started to establish a more recognisable rhythm, Kuwait shook the hosts out of a false dawn, threatening to upset the applecart.",India fail to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: England's manager Gareth Southgate has decided not to include left defender Harry Maguire and midfielder Jack Grealish in the 26-man squad for the upcoming European Championship. This decision comes as part of the team's strategic preparation for the tournament.Maguire, with a substantial experience of 63 international caps and a key player for Manchester United , was notably absent from the list due to selection criteria that also saw Manchester City 's Grealish, who has 36 caps for England, left out. Despite their considerable contributions to their respective clubs, their exclusion highlights the competitive nature of the selection process and the depth of talent available to the national team.The squad announced by Southgate features a robust attacking lineup, including Jude Bellingham , whose recent success with Real Madrid in the Champions League has been remarkable, and Harry Kane of Bayern Munich. Phil Foden , recognized for his exceptional season with Manchester City, and Bukayo Saka from Arsenal, are also among the key players expected to lead England's offensive efforts. These selections underscore the blend of youth and experience within the team, aiming to capitalize on dynamic and impactful performances.Injuries have played a role in shaping the defensive selections for the squad.Despite Maguire's exclusion, his Manchester United teammate Luke Shaw has been included, although he is currently managing injury concerns and did not participate in the team's training session ahead of the friendly match against Iceland at Wembley. This indicates the strategic considerations made by Southgate in balancing current form, fitness levels, and the potential impact of players on the team's performance.Additionally, the squad features 12 players who are yet to gain experience in major international tournaments, including Lewis Dunk, Joe Gomez, Marc Guehi, Ezri Konsa, and others.

NEW DELHI: India's 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Kuwait ended in a disappointing goalless draw, failing to provide a fitting farewell for the talismanic Sunil Chhetri in his last international match.The result leaves India in a challenging position to progress to the third round of the qualifiers, with only five points collected so far. India's final match is against Asian champions Qatar on June 11, while Kuwait, with four points, will face Afghanistan on the same day.Chhetri's international career spans an impressive 19 years, during which he scored 94 goals, making him the fourth most prolific scorer in international football, behind Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (128), Iran legend Ali Daei (108) and Argentine wizard Lionel Messi (106).This remarkable achievement is particularly noteworthy for a player from a country like India, and FIFA recognised Chhetri's legendary status upon his announcement of international retirement on May 16.Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium, with a capacity of 68,000, was packed with fans, officials, and former players who came to bid an emotional adieu to Chhetri.His parents, Kharga and Sushila, and wife, Sonam Bhattacharya, were also in attendance.

However, Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu made a crucial save to deny Mohammad Daham.India responded in the 11th minute with Liston Colaco's low cross, but Hasan Alanezi's sliding clearance prevented Chhetri from scoring his 95th goal.Debutant Jay Gupta was involved in the action, delivering a sublime low cross from the left in the 25th minute, but the Kuwait defense cleared it for a corner. India failed to capitalize on a freekick in the 28th minute, despite Poojary's impressive run and nutmeg.At the halfway mark, Thapa sent a fantastic ball into the box, which Kuwait cleared to deny Sahal Abdul Samad. The rebound fell to Liston Colaco, who fired a low strike into the side netting from a narrow angle.In the second half, Igor Stimac made changes to India's attacking lineup, introducing Rahim Ali, Brandon Fernandes, and Chheri. However, the desired result was not achieved, as Rahim failed to convert his chances.Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute when they were denied a penalty claim, leading to a confrontation between players and bench.Replays suggested a foul, but the referee deemed otherwise. Tempers flared up after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, resulting in a mini-brawl and yellow cards for both Edmund and Sultan Alenezi.Despite the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' poor delivery meant India's last hope for a win disappeared in the added seven minutes.Stimac handed left-back Gupta his international debut in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Chhetri as the sole striker.

""Then when I started to train to be a professional tennis player, I was dreaming to become a professional. I never dreamed to be No. 1, Grand Slam champion… Never dreamed so big.""""Step by step, I started to believe,"" the 28-year-old said. ""Step by step, I started to dream.""""For me it's surprising to see interviews from Nole (Djokovic) when he was a kid, saying that he wanted to be World No. 1, it's unbelievable to see Jannik (Sinner), when he was 15 years old, say that his dream was to be No. 1. It's unbelievable that you can dream (that big) as a child. I didn't dream it when I was a child.""Paolini has been busy on rest days too, making the doubles final with compatriot Sara Errani.""For me it's something different,"" Paolini said, shaking her head and beaming a smile. ""I never dreamed to be in a Grand Slam final , but I'm here. I'm a different kind of person I think.""Paoloni has Polish roots, and even speaks the language. Against the top-seeded Pole, going for a fourth Roland Garros title, the only language she can employ is consistency.""Iga is an unbelievable player. So young, but so many achievements and Grand Slams,"" Paolini said. ""She's doing well week by week, and that's not easy.

The 21-year-old then celebrated with a fist pump and a shout of ‘vamos’ that vibrated across the arena. The boy they call Carlitos was almost home.Alcaraz, the owner of a sparkling win-loss record in five-setters 9-1, coming into his Roland Garros semifinal, did well to push the match into the decider, which is increasingly looking like his backyard.Alcaraz -- who was creating points, pushing the pace in the fifth set, unlike the second-seeded Sinner -- powered into his first French Open final with a 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 result in 4-hours and 9-minutes.Alcaraz threw his arms in the air, letting out a victory cry after Sinner sent a ball wide on match point.Alcaraz, playing in bright yellow shorts and a dull grey tee, has now made a major final in all three surfaces – hardcourt, grass and clay.“You have to find a way to enjoy when you are suffering, (suffering) is even more on clay, in Roland Garros,” Alcaraz said. “You play long rallies, five sets, you have to fight. As I told my team many times, you have to enjoy suffering.”Alcaraz was quick to compliment Sinner following the semifinal that had championship match vibes.“The toughest matches I have played in my career are against Jannik. I hope to play many, many more matches like this against him. I learnt from last years’ match against Djokovic, in these moments, you have to keep calm, stay there fighting,” he said. “I’m really happy about everything I did today, waiting for the moment.”Sinner, 22, who will rise to No.1 in the rankings on Monday, led by a set and break in the second, and again by two-sets-to-one but like in their only meeting this year, in the semifinals of Indian Wells, the Spaniard produced champagne tennis to rally after the Italian had wrested early advantage.The start of this much-awaited semifinal – a clash of contrasts, style and personalities -- had full pendulum swings in momentum.First it was Sinner, who broke the Spaniard thrice in the opening set, then Alcaraz, who used his kick serve judiciously in the second, rallied from 0-2 down. Alcaraz won five straight games.The Italian, trying to stay in it, was broken early in the third set, dragged down by cramps which affected his hands and then hamstrings. He received treatment at the changeover. Fortunately for Sinner, his opponent’s returns were shorter than a blink, giving him space to take control of the set.There was an incident in the stands in the fourth set with the score at 4-4 (40-15). Sinner and Alcaraz offered suggestions on how they could help the elderly spectator, who needed medical attention. The break may have affected Sinner more than Alcaraz as momentum was with the Italian at that point.Whatever happens in the second semifinal between Alexander Zverev and Casper Ruud, Sunday’s final will be the first one without Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, since 2004 when Gaston Gaudio defeated Guillermo Coria.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner in five sets to reach French Open final. The 21-year-old Spaniard has now made a major final in all three surfaces.

NEW DELHI: Spain's Carlos Alcaraz overcame a rough start to defeat an inconsistent Jannik Sinner 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, securing his spot in his first French Open final after a thrilling see-saw match on Friday.The third seed struggled in the opening set, far from his usual brilliance, but capitalized on his Italian opponent's early cramps to level the match before it went into a decider.Australian Open champion Sinner, set to become world number one next week, bowed out when he returned a massive forehand down the line wide on the third match point on Court Philippe Chatrier.Double Grand Slam champion Alcaraz, aiming to add to his Wimbledon and US Open titles, will face either German Alexander Zverev or two-time runner-up Casper Ruud of Norway on Sunday.""You have to find the joy in suffering, I think that's the key, even more here on clay, here at Roland Garros, long rallies, four-hour matches, five sets, you have to fight, you have to suffer,"" said Alcaraz.""Probably, the toughest matches that I've played in my short career have been against Jannik, the U.S. Open 2022, this one, it shows the great player Jannik is... and I hope to play many, many more matches like this one against Jannik, but yes it's one of the toughest matches that I've played, for sure.""Sinner got off to an explosive start, with his poise, pace, and precision proving too much for an out-of-sorts Alcaraz as the Italian raced to a 4-0 lead.The Spaniard, however, responded by breaking back as Sinner's first-serve percentage dipped.Despite this, Alcaraz struggled to find his rhythm, and Sinner won another two consecutive games to take the opening set when Alcaraz netted an ill-timed drop shot.In the second set, an unforced error from Alcaraz gave Sinner an early break. However, the Italian, who hadn't played for nearly a month before the French Open due to a hip injury, suddenly lost his momentum. This allowed Alcaraz to capitalize, using his forehand to devastating effect and leveling the match.The Spaniard broke for 2-1 in the third set with a gravity-defying crosscourt passing shot as Sinner's freefall continued. Despite apparent hand cramps, the future world number one clawed his way back, saving break points in the fifth game to stay in the contest.Sinner then broke twice more to take the set - a scenario that seemed highly unlikely when he could barely hold his racket just minutes earlier.The match lived up to its billing in the fourth set, with both players trading impressive blows. Leading 5-4, Alcaraz rallied from 30-0 down on Sinner's serve, winning four points in a row and forcing a decider with a crosscourt backhand winner at the end of a spectacular point.Alcaraz snatched an early break by wrongfooting Sinner in the second game and never looked back, despite some nerves on the first two match points.",Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner in five sets to reach French Open final. The third seed will face either Alexander Zverev or Casper Ruud on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal breezed into the semifinals of the ATP 100 Challenger event in Heilbronn, Germany on Friday. He secured victory in his quarter-final match against Russia's Ivan Gakhov with a score of 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) in just 82 minutes.

Currently ranked 95th in the world, Nagal aims to maximize his ranking points to enhance his chances of qualifying for the 64-player men's singles draw at the Paris Olympics.

Despite his disappointing straight-set first-round exit from the French Open against Karen Khachanov , the Indian ace has shown strong form this week, advancing to the semifinals at the Euro 120,000 tour event.

In the match lasting 1 hour and 22 minutes, Nagal's impressive first and second serve percentages of 83% and 70%, respectively, proved pivotal against Gakhov's 51% and 57%.

Nagal capitalized on four break points while also saving two out of three crucial moments when facing potential breaks.

""From end of last year and till this year probably, I have been playing my best tennis. Before that I was out for 16-18 months due to a hip surgery and end of 2022, I could play freely and without any pain,"" Nagal said after the match.

NEW DELHI: Iga Swiatek 's dominance at the French Open has been unparalleled in recent years, with the Polish star aiming for her fourth title in five years as she faces Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's final.Swiatek's path to the final has been nearly flawless, with only a close call against Naomi Osaka in the second round, where she saved a match point to advance.The top seed's all-court game has been too much for her opponents to handle, and 12th seed Paolini will need to produce an exceptional performance to prevent Swiatek from claiming her third consecutive French Open trophy.Swiatek's current streak at Roland Garros stands at an impressive 20 matches, dating back to her maiden Grand Slam victory in Paris four years ago.Having already secured titles in Madrid and Rome this season, Swiatek is on the verge of extending her winning streak on clay to 19 matches.Her remarkable consistency and prowess on the surface have led fans and analysts to draw comparisons with Rafael Nadal , the 14-time French Open champion, suggesting that Swiatek is well on her way to becoming a claycourt legend in her own right.""We'll see in 14 years if the journey is similar,"" four-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek told reporters after thumping third seed Coco Gauff in the semi-finals on Thursday.""That's obviously really nice. I'd never expect anybody to compare me to Rafa because for me he's above everybody, and he's a total legend.""We'll see... but I'm proud of myself that I'm playing consistently here and that I'm mentioned in the same sentence as Rafa. That's cool.""Swiatek's victory in the semi-final secured her a remarkable achievement, joining a select group of players who have reached three consecutive French Open finals since the turn of the millennium. This exclusive club includes Justine Henin (2005-07) and Maria Sharapova (2012-14).Despite her young age of 23, Swiatek has already established herself as one of the most promising talents in the Open era. She stands as the second-youngest player to reach four championship matches, surpassed only by the legendary Steffi Graf, who accomplished this feat in 1990.""After the tournament it usually hits me what I achieved, but during it, I feel like I just need to play another match,"" said Swiatek.""Sometimes, it's hard not to see what's at stake and what the atmosphere is around these matches. I'm not used to it. It's not the routine. On the other hand, when I'm focused on work, I can make it a routine because that's easier to do.""Facing the tall task of toppling Swiatek at her favourite hunting ground is Paolini, the diminutive Italian with Polish roots who is in the midst of her most impressive season and eyeing a maiden Grand Slam trophy.The tenacious 28-year-old has enjoyed a favourable draw in Paris but showed she could pack a punch when needed by stunning fourth seed Elena Rybakina in the quarter-finals before beating 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva in the semi-finals.""Iga is an unbelievable player. So young, but so many achievements and Grand Slams,"" Dubai champion Paolini said.""She's doing well week by week and that's not easy. So I have huge respect for her but my goal is to step onto the court on Saturday and try to enjoy the match, enjoy that moment and try to play a good match.""With Jannik Sinner assured of the men's top ranking next week, Paolini will look to add the icing on the cake in what has already been a hugely successful tournament for Italy.",Iga Swiatek will play Jasmine Paolini in the French Open final on Saturday.

Crispy clean. The 23-year-old world No.1 had just 14 unforced errors in the Roland Garros semifinal against American Coco Gauff .Swiatek, who has won 20 straight matches at the French Open, came through 6-2, 6-4 in an hour and 37-minutes to make her fourth final here in five years.The match was going to plan for Swiatek, while Gauff, cheered on by the Philippe Chatrier crowd, couldn’t get her aggressive gameplan on the map.The athletic 20-year-old, who had lost ten of their 11 meetings coming into the semifinal, appeared to make some inroads in the second set.In the fourth game of the set, with Swiatek serving, a call on the serve was overruled by the umpire.Gauff argued that she had hit the ball after the call was made, but the umpire disagreed. Gauff, who was reduced to tears by the incident, lost the point, but won the game. She, however, couldn’t quite get going thereafter.The American justifiably reopened the debate of an appeal system that left no room for human error.“I think tennis is the only sport where not only we don't have the VR system, but a lot of times the decisions are made by one person,” said Gauff, who’ll move to No.2 in the rankings on Monday. “In other sports there's usually multiple refs in making a decision. I know the US Open brought some of it last year. I know we used it in our doubles at one point.”“It's almost ridiculous that we don't have it (in tennis). Not just speaking because of what happened to me, but I just think every sport has it,” she said. “Also, it sucks as a player to go back or online and you see that you were completely right.“In situations where you can call for the supervisor, there's not much they can do. I definitely think as a sport we have to evolve, and we have the technology. They're showing it on TV, so I don't get why the player can't see it.”In the final on Saturday, Swiatek, whose play is strung perfectly for this surface, will play the surprise package in Jasmine Paolini .The 12th-seeded Italian, whose ranking will now climb to No.7 on account of making the final here, beat the 17-year-old Russian Mirra Andreeva 6-3, 6-1 in the second semifinal.","Iga Swiatek beat Coco Gauff 6-2, 6-4 in the French Open semifinal.

NEW DELHI: Coco Gauff has reignited the debate surrounding the use of Video Review (VR) technology in tennis following a controversial call during her French Open semi-final loss to Iga Swiatek .During the second set, a line judge called a Gauff return ""out,"" a decision overruled by the chair umpire despite Gauff's argument that her shot was hampered during the point. This incident, which visibly upset Gauff, sparked a broader discussion about the need for technological assistance for officials in tennis.Gauff highlighted the disparity between tennis and other sports, emphasizing that tennis often relies on a single umpire's judgment, unlike sports with multiple officials.""Tennis is the only sport where not only we don't have the VR system, but a lot of times decisions are made by one person. In other sports there are usually multiple referees making a decision,"" Gauff said.""Also, there are so many decisions that are made, and it sucks as a player to go back or online and you see that you were completely right, and it's, like, what does that give you in that moment? In situations you can call for the supervisor, but there's not much they can do from that standpoint. I definitely think as a sport we have to evolve, and we have the technology. They're showing it on TV, so I don't get why the player can't see it,"" she added.The US Open's successful implementation of VR technology in 2022, coupled with its positive reception at ATP events, strengthens Gauff's call for wider adoption. She questioned the logic of withholding readily available technology, particularly when television replays often reveal the inaccuracy of on-court decisions.While acknowledging the potential benefits of VR, Swiatek expressed reservations about its logistical implementation, saying, ""Honestly, I don't know how it would look logistically. When can you ask an umpire to call a video replay or when is it up to her to do that. Because I think the umpire today was pretty sure with her call. So I don't know how that would look like.""","Coco Gauff has reignited the debate surrounding the use of Video Review (VR) technology in tennis.

Only Zverev plays it on loop.Consistency may well be the key to Friday's men's singles clash that pitches the German fourth seed, in his fourth-successive French Open semifinals, against Ruud, the seventh seed from Norway.Ruud, who wears an icy expression, is the owner of a fiery forehand, and is looking to make his third final in a row here.Zverev, who put out Aussie Alex De Minaur in straight sets in the last-eight late on Wednesday, and Ruud, who received a walkover from an injured Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals, have split their four meetings.Ruud claimed their most recent encounter, 12 months ago in the semifinals on Court Philippe Chatrier.The first of the men's singles semifinals, billed as the match of the tournament, will see Jannik Sinner, the second-seeded Italian, take on the popular third-seed Carlos Alcaraz.

PARIS: After falling short in their first two meetings of the year against the world No.2 pairing of India's Rohan Bopanna and Aussie Matthew Ebden , the all-Italian combine of Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori , found a way in their next outing in Rome.

The 11th-seeds, playing sharp tennis under a weak Paris sun, managed to replicate that effort in the Roland Garros semifinals on Thursday.

Bopanna and Ebden, who have struck consistent notes in the majors, making at least the semifinals of their last four Grand Slams, went down 5-7, 6-2, 2-6 in a shade under two-hours.

Bopanna and Ebden struck first in the fourth game of the match, Bopanna's forehand crosscourt opening up the court, giving the second seeds a chance to break. They made no mistake on the next point. The Italians hit back in the seventh game, before gaining the decisive break in the 11th.

Bopanna and Ebden, who had beaten Bolelli and Vavassori in the title round of the Australian Open in January, were broken early in the deciding third set and the Italians did well to steer clear of trouble, with Bopanna and Ebden winning just 19 points in the third set.

Bolelli and Vavassori, Italy's Olympic pairing, are in their second successive major final.
