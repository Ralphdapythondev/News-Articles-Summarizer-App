Obviously we're all in the zone when we're about to compete, and so that's different when you don't play anymore,"" said Caroline Wozniacki , Williams' longtime friend.""But at the end of the day, I think she's always been, you know, a happy and outgoing person.""Before the Pole's third-round match against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, Williams was seen conversing with world No. 1Iga Swiatek at the players' gym. Later, she was observed in the stands at Arthur Ashe Stadium , where she played her final match.The American witnessed American Jessica Pegula defeat Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro and Italian first seed Jannik Sinner defeat Australian Chris O'Connell.After defeating French qualifier Jessica Ponchet in her third-round match at the Grandstand, Wozniacki-who had Williams as a bridesmaid in her own wedding-joked that she was ""pretty mad"" that Williams had missed her match.""Serena is obviously still very busy. I think when you've been such incredible at something, I think you'll always have the opportunity, you'll always be great at whatever you put your mind to,"" said Wozniacki.""I love hanging with her.

Flashback: When Sri Lanka defied expectations to dominate a drawn one-off game against England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/flashback-when-sri-lanka-defied-expectations-to-dominate-a-drawn-one-off-game-against-england/articleshow/112961042.cms,"NEW DELHI: When Sri Lanka made their debut at the ""Home of Cricket"" in 1984, things were significantly different from how they are now playing the second Test against England at Lord's .Still a young Test team, the tourists surprised everyone by dominating a drawn one-off match, declaring 491-7 in their opening innings, powered by an outstanding 190 from Sidath Wettimuny .Recalling the scene forty years later, the then 28-year-old opener said it was a historic event for both his country and himself.""England is the home of cricket,"" Wettimuny told AFP in an interview at Lord's. ""We were very keen to show up and do something decent so that the world took notice of us.""In an apparently uncomfortable occurrence, Tamil demonstrators stormed the playing area before a ball was bowled, delaying the start of the Test.Wettimuny, however, insisted: ""That helped me tremendously. Not knowing what it was at first, I gradually moved towards the slip cordon because I was scared to be alone in the middle.""They (the demonstrators) were shouting and the (England) players asked me what this was all about and in that two or three minutes of conversation with them, I think it was like the fizz in a soda bottle going out.""I just forgot about cricket, forgot about batting and I was relaxed for a few minutes and then when I betted I just felt nice and relaxed.""With a string of perfect square-drives, Wettimuny punished an England attack led by Ian Botham several times.None more so than Wettimuny and his brothers, Sri Lankan cricketers have received their customary English education for a considerable amount of time.""I'll tell you, my father has to be given all the credit,"" said Wettimuny. ""He was a huge cricket enthusiast -- in fact he built the first indoor net in Sri Lanka.""And he was a fan of CB Fry (the 19th/20th century England batsman). He made us read CB Fry's 'On the Art of Batting'. My goodness, he used to grill us on that.""And he wanted us to play correct cricket.""Despite the present England team's aggressive Bazball strategy, the 1984 Sri Lankan team featured a captain named Duleep Mendis who was a really aggressive batsman.Mendis, who made 111, was diminutive but strong, hitting Botham bouncers for lofty sixes multiple times. When he fell for 94 in the second innings, the Sri Lankan captain was only a few runs short of reaching another hundred.""He was a phenomenal player when he got going,"" said Wettimuny of Mendis.""The instruction I got from him at the start of play was 'you bat through, you just hold your end'. It was very nice just to sit back and watch Duleep take the attack apart.""Wettimuny was so obedient to his captain's commands that he batted for almost 11 hours before cramps caused him to be out 10 runs short of a double century.""People say, weren't you unhappy about what you didn't get? I just say I was happy with what I got,"" explained Wettimuny.Many from an England team that had been 'blackwashed' 5-0 in a Test series earlier in 1984 by a West Indies team that included fast bowlers like Malcolm Marshall Michael Holding , and Joel Garner were not looking forward to a one-off match against Sri Lanka.However, England's fast Jonathan Agnew saw an opening.""I was very excited because it was just my second Test,"" Agnew told AFP.""But I was aware my team-mates were absolutely beaten up, they had had a very torrid time, there'd been a lot of injuries, nasty injuries, and they'd just been bombed, they were just out of it really.""Agnew, now the BBC's long-serving cricket correspondent, added: ""Sidath played really, really well, and he's become a good friend since. He batted immaculately and Duleep Mendis murdered 'Beefy' (Botham).""Another noteworthy aspect of the match was Arjuna Ranatunga , who at the age of 20 made an astounding 84.Ranatunga would go on to guide Sri Lanka to World Cup victory in 1996.""They've hardened up a lot,"" said Agnew. ""They played a bit like gentlemen then. When they first appeared, they sounded a bit old-fashioned, and played a bit old-fashioned.""But Ranatunga really sharpened them up and made them a fighting force.""","Sri Lanka made their debut at the ""Home of Cricket"" in 1984. The tourists surprised everyone by dominating a drawn one-off match. Sidath Wettimuny made 190 in Sri Lanka's opening innings. Tamil demonstrators stormed the playing area before a ball was bowled.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112961039,imgsize-115394,width-400,resizemode-4/112961039.jpg"

"Priyansh Arya smashes six sixes in an over, mirrors Garfield Sobers' iconic achievement exactly after 56 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/priyansh-arya-smashes-six-sixes-in-an-over-mirrors-garfield-sobers-iconic-achievement-exactly-after-56-years/articleshow/112951154.cms,"NEW DELHI: On August 31, 1968, West Indies legend Sir Garfield Sobers achieved an unprecedented feat by becoming the first batter to hit six sixes in an over. This remarkable accomplishment took place during a first-class match of the English County Championship, where Sobers was leading Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan.Exactly 56 years later, on August 31, 2024, another cricketer etched his name in the annals of cricket history.Priyansh Arya replicated Sobers' extraordinary achievement, joining the exclusive club of batters who have hit six sixes in an over.In a remarkable display of batting prowess, Priyansh from the South Delhi Superstarz team, participating in the Delhi Premier League , unleashed a barrage of sixes against Manan Bharadwaj, a spinner representing the North Delhi Strikers. He sent the ball soaring over the boundary ropes on six occasions within a single over, leaving spectators in awe.Bharadwaj, known primarily for his left-arm spin, even resorted to bowling a delivery with his right hand in an attempt to stem the flow of runs. However, his efforts proved futile as the South Delhi Superstarz batsman continued his onslaught.He soon reached his century in just 40 balls, but Priyansh's assault on Manan under the afternoon sky stole the show. Priyansh started by charging down the pitch, launching Manan over long-off for a towering six, and then dropped to one knee to clear the long-on fence for another maximum.The barrage seemed endless as the left-handed batter smashed two more sixes over long-on, followed by another pair over long-off, collecting an incredible 36 runs from Manan’s 12th over. Priyansh eventually notched up his second century of the tournament in the 15th over.Priyansh became part of an elite group that includes Ross Whiteley (2017), Hazratullah Zazai (2018), and Leo Carter (2020), all of whom have hit six sixes in a domestic T20 match. On the international stage, this rare achievement has been accomplished by Yuvraj Singh , Kieron Pollard, and Dipendra Singh Airee (twice).Eventually, Priyansh made 120 off 50 balls, laced with 10 fours and as many sixes at a strike rate of 240. Ayush Badoni, his batting partner at the other end, also struck a century for the South Delhi team, making 165 runs off 55 balls, hitting eight fours and ten sixes at a strike-rate of 300.The duo's efforts meant South Delhi Superstarz made a whopping 308/5, making it just the second time a 300+ score was achieved by a batting team in T20s. Priyansh and Badoni had a partnership of 286 from 103 balls, which is the highest partnership for any wicket in T20 cricket.","Priyansh Arya joins exclusive club of batters who have hit six sixes in an over.

Medals or no medals-Athletes are accountable to Taxpayer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/medals-or-no-medals-athletes-are-accountable-to-taxpayer/articleshow/112932833.cms,"Dr P S M Chandran

Dr PSM is former Director (Sports Sciences), Sports Authority of India.

He was Indian contingent doctor for the Olympics & Asian Games.

At present he is the President, Indian Federation of Sports Medicine

40 years ago, it was the Los Angeles Olympic Games. A two member Indian men weightlifting team lands at the Olympic village at USC two weeks before the games to acclimatize and train at the Olympic venue. Both the lifters were heralded as potential medal prospects. The Games started and the weight lifting event was scheduled at the beginning of the Games .The weighing-in was on. One of the weightlifters was found to be overweight by 2 kg. No commotion. The question came: how come he was overweight? The response from the lifter was simple. There was no coach or support system to monitor him on weight management. The coach of the weightlifting team had checked into the village and the very next day quietly he left for San Francisco to visit his relatives . On his return two weeks later on the day of the weighing-in, he could do nothing to help the overweight lifter to qualify for competing . The Contingent management showed no remorse and the coach went scot-free. No inquiry, no blame game.At the same Olympics , our legendary P T Usha missed an Olympic medal by a whisker , one hundredth of a second. The whole of India wept. Many explanations came on what went wrong with Usha’s strategy for the race. The US athletics team coach who was keenly following Usha’s race (Usha had beaten American Judy Brown in the semifinals ) and was sitting next to me in the athletes’ enclosure had this to say about Usha when she crossed the finish lane, “look at the girl, she looks so fresh, she can complete another lap”. What he meant was Usha had still some more reserve energy left in her which if used could have fetched her an Olympic medal. This is where sports science can make the difference. Unfortunately Usha or his illustrious coach, O M Nambiar did not receive any sports science back then.This is exactly where Usha as President of Indian Olympic Association made a difference while selecting the contingent for the recently concluded Paris Olympic Games. The athletes had the luxury of having the services of sports medicine doctors, physiotherapists, massage therapists, mental trainers, nutritionists and sleep therapists. It is believed that IOA had compulsions to take care of the interest of Corporate sponsors and include inexperienced and fresh professionals in the squad which subsequently proved disastrous with India landing at 71 position in the medals tally below even Pakistan.As the legendary badminton icon Prakash Padukone as well as P T Usha herself had pointed out, the onus of giving out one’s best ultimately rests with the athlete only. To quote tennis ace Leander Paes, “I can guarantee optimum performance, but not the results”. This applies to our Olympic contingent athletes too. Unfortunately in the present Olympic Games our athletes not only failed to deliver their best, but it was an abject surrender to their opponents in many of the sports they had competed in, which include the silver and bronze medal winners also . In sports the winner takes the gold and all other beaten guys share the silver and bronze medals. Those who are hungry for any medals glorify their medals, color does not matter for them. There were 329 gold medals at stake at the Paris games across 32 sports and 48 disciplines. India drew a big “Zero” on gold count and had to be satisfied with its haul of one silver and 5 bronze medals after spending Rs 470 crores in preparing and sending the team.Since it is taxpayers money which is spent on these Games, the IOA and Sports ministry need to constitute an inquiry committee which will come out with a detailed report on how and where we have flopped at the Paris Olympic Games.Lots of money has been spent on wrestler Vinesh Poghat. Her disqualification is a man-made disaster and a huge disappointment for the country. Those who are responsible for this debacle need to be identified and taken to task. Vinesh has overcome the trauma now if the smile on her face and her speeches are indications. It is reported that her endorsement fee has jumped from the pre Olympic rate of Rs 25 Lakhs to rupees one crore post games. She can be proud of this . But as a seasoned professional, she has to explain how she had failed to fall in line with the competition rules in wrestling and ranked last in her category before the govt considered spending another penny for her training in future.Another baffling mystery is Neeraj Chopra’s claim of his groin injury. He is a national treasure. According to him he has been nursing the injury for the last two years and goes against the doctors’ advice on surgery. At the same time he is consistently throwing his best in every competition. Neeraj has to come out clean and convince his fans about his fitness. The Govt should seek a report on his injury status and help him out before it gets messy.On 29 August , the nation will be celebrating the National Sports Day. The speakers will be shouting at the top of their voice about our glorious performance at the Paris Olympics. They may not be aware that the national flags of 62 countries were hoisted 329 times accompanied by the national anthems to celebrate the gold medal winners at various venues. But we, the unfortunate Indians, could not get a glimpse of our tricolour fluttering at the top of the flag mast accompanied by our national anthem “Jana Gana Mana” even once at the entire Games .Still we have the audacity to think of bidding for hosting the Olympic Games!","Dr P S M Chandran is the former Director (Sports Sciences), Sports Authority of India.

Take it in, Joe. We are watching a genius.""""I do not think there is a batsman that I can remember watching play (who shares) the sense of inevitability about scoring runs that Joe Root gives off. I called it when he was on about 6 today, that he was going to get 100. I know he is in great form, but it is just a pleasure to watch a master, a craftsman at work,"" said Cook.Cook reminisced about Root's early days, recalling their first encounter in a List A match in 2009 when Root made his debut with Yorkshire.Cook admitted he did not see Root as a 'great player' back then. ""He could not get the ball off the square,"" Cook recalled. ""Everyone said, 'he's a good player', but I did not see that,"" he added. Root scored 63 off 95 balls on his debut in List A format.Three years later, Cook was England's captain when Root made his international debut in the final Test of the 2012 series against India in Nagpur.Root scored 73 and 20* in a match that ended in a draw. Cook noted the mental readiness Root displayed for Test cricket from his first time at the crease.""The only check was when he walked out to bat for the first time, how he would handle it. The game was in the balance and he walked out to bat with his England cap on, looking 13, massive smile on his face. I watched his first few balls, and I was like, 'This bloke is here to stay.' I honestly said, 'He's scoring 10,000 runs.' I don't know who I said it to, but I know that I said it,"" he concluded.Root, now 32, has played 145 Test matches, accumulating 12,377 runs at an average of 50.93, with 34 centuries and 64 fifties.

I got to watch Rohit Shama practice and play cricket. He is so elegant,"" Rhodes told ANI.While Rhodes admires the elegance Rohit brings to the field, he doesn't believe Rohit's presence is essential for LSG's pursuit of success.""I mean, there's the balance of teams, who's in the side. I love watching Rohit Sharma bat, but I'm not saying he must come in and replace, and then suddenly we change our setup. So whatever, as I said, whatever happens, who is ever there? I'll be doing my best to support,"" he added.In addition to the speculation surrounding Rohit's future, the spotlight has also been on franchise captain KL Rahul 's uncertain situation.Rumors suggest that Rahul may not play again for LSG, following what appeared to be a reprimand from franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka after their defeat to Sunrisers Hyderabad.When asked about Rahul's future, Rhodes expressed relief that he wouldn't be responsible for making decisions regarding player retention.""Well, luckily, hypothetically, or in real life, that's as a fielding coach.

But I'm still really concerned about the role of the all-rounder, the importance of the role of the all-rounder in T20 cricket, and the Impact Player rule is certainly killing it,"" Rhodes added.Beyond the Impact Player debate, Rhodes also addressed the Right to Match (RTM) rule, which allows franchises to retain players by matching the highest bid made for them in the auction.While not overly concerned about RTM itself, Rhodes emphasized the importance of player retention for building team culture and consistency. He questioned the current limitations on the number of players a franchise can retain, arguing that losing a significant portion of the squad during mega auctions disrupts team dynamics and hinders long-term planning.The BCCI is yet to finalize the number of retentions and RTM cards for the upcoming IPL season. This decision carries significant weight, as franchises hold differing opinions.Teams like Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad , enjoying recent success, favour retaining a larger core group of players.

KOLKATA: In the end, it was a triumph NorthEast United FC seemed to have stolen straight from the page of Mohun Bagan 's script.It was history for them, their cup of joy --pure, maiden and magical. It was their goalkeeper Gurmeet Singh's turn to do a Vishal Kaith , pulling off two saves in the shootout to seal the deal.It was a what-could-have-been moment for Mohun Bagan SG as well.NorthEast United lifted the Durand Cup --their first trophy since their birth in Indian football a decade ago ---dramatically beating Mohun Bagan 4-3 in penalty shootout after coming back from 0-2 goal down to hold the defending champions 2-2 in regulation time at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Saturday.And how the Highlanders flourished on a stage which Mohun Bagan seemed to have made a part of their survival gene in this tournament. And how Bagan's art ofescapology failed to bear fruit in the most decisive stage of the tournament.In the back-to-back knockout matches leading to the final, Jose Molina's green-and maroon brigade made it a habit of surviving against the odds, clawing their way back from the jaws of death against Punjab FC and Bengaluru FC before seeing goalkeeper Vishal Kaith rising to the occasion and keeping his team afloat with two crucial in the penalty shootout on both occasions.The script underwent a complete change in the final. It was Mohun Bagan who claimed a 2-0 goal lead thanks to Jason Cummings' penalty in the 11th minute and Sahal Abdul Samad's first goal of the season four minutes into the first half injury time.Until then, it was smooth sailing for Mohun Bagan and their march to Durand Cup title No. 18 looked like theirs to lose. But NEUFC --with their co-owner John Abraham in attendance in the stands --turned the game on its head in a remarkable second-half resuscitation. Their coach Benali's introduction of Guillermo Fernandez and Louis Macarton paid off handsomely as the Highlanders took the wind out of Bagan's sails with two goals in a span of three minutes.Moroccan Alaaeddine Ajaraie reduced the margin, beating Vishal through his first post with a perfect right-footer in the 55th minute. Three minutes later, Ajaraie came calling again, this time sending a long cross from the left and Guillermo, following the ball's trajectory, met it with a sumptuous strike, giving the Bagan goalkeeper no chance to react.In a tale of two halves, NEUFC completely dominated the contest thereafter and when Dimitri Petratos --who came in the second half with Molina deciding to start with Greg Stewart --saw his scorcher miss the target by a whisker in the 87th minute, it was Bagan's first attempt at goal since Guillermo's goal, manifesting how the tide was turned.Yet, facing the third penalty shootout in as many matches, Vishal stood under the bar with the been-there-done that confidence. But his thunder was stolen by his opposite number in NEUFC.Bagan started the shootout ominously when Cummings blazed his shot over the bar, but referee Harish Kundu judged Gurmeet to have moved out of his line before the penalty and the Australian was spot on with his retaken kick.

And their ever-enthusiastic owner, John Abraham, too, was present at the venue to bask in the glory of the first title with his team.And even before the players and staff could lay their hands on the trophy, social media was inundated with videos of celebration and congratulatory posts for the club that enjoys one of the most ardent support base in the country.Theirs was also a win for the northeast as NEUFC also became the first team from the football-crazy region to win the coveted Durand Cup.Meanwhile, two of the three individual trophies, too, went to the Highlanders as custodian Gurmeet Singh took home the golden glove while the brilliant Jithin MS was named the best player of the tournament.",NorthEast United FC beat Mohun Bagan Super Giant to win Durand Cup.

Premier League: Declan Rice sent off as Arsenal held by Brighton,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-declan-rice-sent-off-as-arsenal-held-by-brighton/articleshow/112952638.cms,"- Rice sees red -

NEW DELHI: Arsenal drew 1-1 with Brighton on Saturday after Declan Rice was controversially sent off in the Premier League match.Kai Havertz had put Arsenal ahead, but Rice was sent off in the second half for delaying the restart after fouling Joel Veltman.Brighton capitalized on their numerical advantage to equalize through Joao Pedro, halting Arsenal's perfect start to the season.The incident occurred at the Emirates Stadium, where Rice was shown a second yellow card for a minor act of kicking the ball away and not retreating promptly. The decision baffled Rice and drew the ire of Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who sought clarification from the fourth official.Arsenal fans expressed their frustration with chants directed at referee Chris Kavanagh. ""You're not fit to referee,"" chanted Arsenal fans at Kavanagh.The Premier League later clarified that Rice's dismissal was due to 'delaying the restart'. The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) could not intervene as the decision involved a yellow card, not a straight red.Despite being down to ten men, Arsenal couldn't prevent Brighton from leveling the score.Joao Pedro's equalizer marked the end of Arsenal's winning streak, having started the season with victories against Wolves and Aston Villa. The draw was a setback in their bid to win the title for the first time since 2004.Rice's suspension means he will miss Arsenal's next Premier League match, a north London derby against Tottenham on September 15.Brighton, under new manager Fabian Hurzeler, extended their unbeaten run to three games. They followed up their recent 2-1 win against Manchester United with another solid performance.New Arsenal signing Raheem Sterling was present at the match, having joined on loan from Chelsea. Restricted by registration timelines, Sterling couldn't play but was warmly welcomed by the fans when his name was announced in the stadium.Bukayo Saka tormented Brighton defender Jack Hinshelwood with his pace and movement in the early stages, easing into space for a pair of shots that Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen repelled.Ben White tested Verbruggen, who also denied Martin Odegaard as Arsenal swept forward in a red wave.Arsenal were nearly punished for failing to turn their pressure into a tangible reward when Yankuba Minteh's header forced a good save from David Raya.But Arteta's belief that the inconsistent Havertz can be an adequate striker for a team with title ambitions looked well placed in the 38th minute as the German broke the deadlock.Havertz came in for criticism after scoring just 13 times last season following his move from Chelsea.But he showed composure and quality to deftly chip over the on-rushing Verbruggen from the edge of the area after Saka punished Lewis Dunk's hesitancy with a clever flicked pass.Rice escaped with only a yellow card after the Arsenal midfielder crunched into Veltman, a decision that saw Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler booked for protesting.But Rice wasn't so fortunate in the 49th minute when he was dismissed after kicking the ball away and failing to retreat before a Brighton free-kick.Rice had just conceded a foul with a challenge on Veltman, whose kick out at the midfielder in the aftermath looked the more significant offence.Pedro rubbed salt into Arsenal's wounds with his 58th minute equaliser.Dunk's superb pass split the Gunners defence and Minteh sprinted clear for a shot that was pushed out by Raya to Pedro, who fired home from close-range.It was the first goal Arsenal had conceded this season, but they should have regained the lead when Havertz broke free for a low shot that was too close to Verbruggen, who saved Saka's sliding effort seconds later.In a frantic finale, Raya saved Yasin Ayari's close-range effort and Carlos Baleba smashed over the bar as 10-man Arsenal held on.","Arsenal drew 1-1 with Brighton after Declan Rice was controversially sent off.

, blames exhaustion

Bopanna-Ebden pair advances

The multi-tier Arthur Ashe Stadium has a presence even when empty. The US Open 's show court, with a capacity of approximately 24,000, is the biggest of tennis' four majors. The other three have main arenas with just under 15,000 seating. More voices translates to louder atmosphere, a good section of which is fuelled by Honey Deuce, the cocktail of the championships.Ashe is a daunting experience, even as a spectator, but as a pro engaged in a weekend night session, there are few evenings in sport that compare.Some 20 minutes before the start of his third-round match, Alexei Popyrin wandered on to Arthur Ashe for the first time in his life. He wanted to see how big the stadium was, get a feel of size and stage. The world No. 28 may have come into the clash riding on the confidence he gained from winning the Montreal Masters 1000, but even he couldn't have visualized how it played out for him against the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic.The lanky 25-year-old ripped 50 winners to put out the defending champion 6-4, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 to claim the biggest win of his career, stalling the second seed's hopes of winning a historic 25th Grand Slam title. The last time Djokovic ended a season without a major crown was 2017. Not since 2002 has a tennis season gone by without one of the 'Big Three' - Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal - winning a major.Popyrin, who goes up against good friend Frances Tiafoe in the fourth round on Sunday, received considerable help from the Serb, who sent down a career-high 14 double faults (in a Grand Slam match), including four in the seventh game to hand Popyrin a double break at 5-2 in the fourth set.Djokovic, who was quick to applaud Popyrin, was frustrated by his form. ""The way I felt, the way I played from the beginning of this tournament, third round is a success,"" he said. ""I played some of the worst tennis I have ever played, serving by far the worst ever. If you play on a quick surface like this without the serve then you can't win, especially against the guys who are in form like Alexei.""The US Open lost two of its biggest draws on successive nights with Djokovic, the second seed, following No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz.The 37-year-old acknowledged that there were weeks like this, when a player reaches for the accelerator and finds he's running on empty. ""It was a big struggle mentally for me to play these three matches here, because I wasn't playing even close to my best,"" the Serb said. ""It's not good to be in that state where you feel okay physically, and of course you're motivated because it's a Grand Slam, but you are not able to find your game.""Popyrin had former No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt , his Davis Cup captain, in his box. The Aussie, whose ranking jumped from 62 to 23 after the Montreal triumph, kept his calm in tight situations early in the match. ""He (Djokovic) has come back from two sets to love down countless times, and I didn't want it to be one of those moments where Novak kind of stepped up and came back from two sets to love down,"" Popyrin said. ""It was extra motivation for me to win that fourth set. I had to pump myself up to get back into the mood of winning,"" he added. Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden, second seeds in the men's doubles, put out Spain's Roberto Caraballes Baena and Argentina's Federico Coria 6-2, 6-4 to move into the US Open third round.India's Yuki Bhambri made his first Grand Slam third round when he partnered Frenchman Albano Olivetti to beat 15th seeds American Austin Krajicek and Jean-Julien Rojers 4-6, 6-3, 7-5.Sriram Balaji and Argentina's Guido Andreozzi went down 6-7 (4), 4-6 to the eighth seeds Kiwi Michael Venus and Briton Neale Skupski.Bopanna had a busy day on Friday as he was back on court for the mixed doubles, teaming up with Indonesia's Aldila Sutjiadi to score a 7-6 (7), 7-6 (5) win over Demi Schuurs of the Netherlands and German Tim Puetz.","World No. 28 Alexei Popyrin beats defending champion Novak Djokovic 6-4, 6- 4, 2-6, 4-6.

Her six titles at the US Open tie her with Chris Evert for the most in the tournament's history.The 23-time Grand Slam champion last competed at the US Open in 2022, having already announced her intention to ""evolve away"" from tennis following the conclusion of that year's final Grand Slam event.""It was really nice to see her,"" Swiatek said. ""She has a lot of positive energy.

Novak Djokovic defeat at US Open leaves era of golden generation at crossroads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-defeat-leaves-era-of-golden-generation-at-crossroads/articleshow/112955569.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the first time in over two decades, the Grand Slam titles of the year will not be adorned by any member of tennis's esteemed ""Big Three"" – Roger Federer Rafael Nadal , and Novak Djokovic – marking a significant shift in the landscape of the sport.This unexpected turn of events was cemented after Novak Djokovic, a 24-time major winner, faced a surprising third-round exit at the US Open , his earliest departure from the tournament since 2006.Djokovic's loss to 28th-ranked Alexei Popyrin not only ended his title defence but also left him without a Grand Slam victory for the first time in seven years, a stark contrast to his illustrious career.The ""Big Three"" have dominated the Grand Slam scene since Federer's first win at Wimbledon in 2003, collectively securing 66 out of 84 Slams up to this year's Wimbledon.Federer, who retired in 2022 with 20 major titles, and Nadal, with 22 Slams, have been central figures in this golden generation.However, Nadal's recent years have been marred by injuries, limiting his appearances and victories, culminating in a first-round defeat at Roland Garros and an absence from Wimbledon.With Nadal's ranking dropping to 154th in the world, speculation about his retirement is inevitable.Djokovic, at 37, remains tied with Margaret Court for the all-time record of 24 Grand Slam titles.Despite his ambitions, Djokovic's year has been challenging, with losses that have seen him relinquish his Australian Open title and his world number one ranking.An injury forced his withdrawal from the French Open , and he suffered a defeat at Wimbledon, further indicating a possible decline in his once-unassailable dominance in the sport.Carlos Alcaraz , 16 years Djokovic's junior, has emerged as a new force, claiming the French Open title and defending his Wimbledon crown, signalling a shift towards a younger generation of champions.Djokovic's Olympic gold in Paris stands as a highlight in a year that has otherwise seen his aura of invincibility fade.The US Open has historically been a tournament of surprises, with 14 different men's champions since 2000, underscoring the unpredictability and competitive nature of the event. Djokovic and Alcaraz, both coming off their emotional highs from the Olympics, admitted to less-than-ideal preparations for the US Open, a factor that their competitors have not overlooked.","For the first time in over two decades, the Grand Slam titles of the year will not be adorned by any member of tennis's esteemed ""Big Three"" Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.

The match began in the early hours of Saturday morning, setting a new record for the latest start time in the tournament's history.Sabalenka and Alexandrova stepped onto Arthur Ashe Stadium shortly after fans had witnessed the stunning upset of defending champion Novak Djokovic by Alexei Popyrin.The two players commenced their match at 12.08 a.m., surpassing the previous latest recorded start at the U.S. Open, which occurred in 1987 when Gabriela Sabatini and Beverly Bowes began their match at midnight and concluded within 90 minutes.Initially, it appeared that a swift conclusion to the match was improbable, as Sabalenka, the reigning Australian Open champion and second seed, struggled with numerous unforced errors, causing her game to falter. As a result, she conceded the first set to Alexandrova in a mere 33 minutes.""I don't know what I did, I was just trying to stay low, put as many balls as I can back on that side. She played incredible tennis in the first set. It was really tough to change it,"" Sabalenka said.The 26-year-old rapidly regained her form and secured a break to establish a 3-1 advantage in the subsequent set. From that point forward, she never relinquished her lead.""I'm really happy I was able to turn around this match and get this really difficult win,"" said Sabalenka, as quoted by Reuters.Sabalenka experienced an unexpected setback when Alexandrova broke her serve, despite Sabalenka's commanding 5-0 lead in the final set. However, the Belarusian quickly regained her composure and delivered a decisive blow to her visibly tiring opponent. With a powerful backhand winner, Sabalenka sealed the match, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who remained in the stands until the very end.""Thanks so much for staying that late,"" Sabalenka said as the clock neared 2 a.m.","Aryna Sabalenka beat Ekaterina Alexandrova 2-6 6-1, 6-2 in the third round of the U.S. Open.

Djokovic had previously overcome two-set deficits on eight occasions in his career. Popyrin acknowledged, ""He wasn't playing his best tennis. I was waiting for him to kind of step up. I felt like he did in the third set. But my level went down. I didn't make too many first serves.""The Australian, who reached the last 16 of a major for the first time, also mentioned the extra motivation he had to close out the match in the fourth set, knowing Djokovic's history of comebacks. ""Also there are countless times when he's come back from two sets to love down, and I didn't want to be one of those moments where Novak kind of stepped up and came back from two sets to love down,"" he said. ""That was going through my head. It was kind of extra motivation for me not to do that and to win that fourth set.
