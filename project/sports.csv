SHORT TESTS A NORM

PUNE: When Rohit Sharma said he doesn't want to be too critical of his players after seeing India's invincibility at home end against New Zealand after 12 years and 18 series in Pune on Saturday, he may have had a point.A close look of this Test team in all conditions reveals a few serious shortcomings. Crucially, the commitment of the players and the stars to domestic multi-day cricket must be questioned.It starts with the batters appearing in no position to either hone or polish their defensive techniques or increase their ability to bat for long periods of time. Not just because they play a very high percentage of white-ball cricket where explosiveness is rewarded more than balance, technique and patience, the busy international calendar and star culture also means they hardly get to play domestic first-class cricket.Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have not played a first-class game this season. All other pure batters in the team picked for the Test series against NZ, had played at least a game - either in the Duleep Trophy or Ranji Trophy.The reason behind Rohit and Virat not playing any first-class game, be it either citing fitness worries or workload management, could be genuine and may have been recommended too by the medical team and team management. But not spending time in the middle, under the sun and in competitive environment can lead to failures. The runs, or lack of runs, indomestic cricket can help a player and his team to understand where he stands in terms of form and match-readiness.When Washington Sundar made a dramatic Test comeback on the first day of the Pune game, all experts were united in their opinion: He was ready after playing against Delhi only a few days ago.Besides Sundar, left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav also played a domestic First-Class game despite his chronic groin issue. And so did Rishabh Pant, Sarfaraz Khan, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Akash Deep, Dhruv Jurel and Axar Patel.Like Rohit and Virat, even Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohd Siraj did not play a domestic First-Class game before the Bangladesh series or before the first Test against NZ in Bengaluru.Rohit himself confessed that his reading of the pitch on the first day in Bengaluru was incorrect. The Pune pitch seemed to have slightly stumped him too as he took pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep out of the game in the second innings. The talk of playing five specialist bowlers in Indian conditions never rang so hollow.The Indian skipper with the hitherto Midas touch felt that there have been only two batting collapses, and the team should be allowed concessions after doing so well over the years at home.It would be good to remember that India were all out for 145 (vs England, Ahmedabad 2021) and 109 & 163 (vs Australia, Indore 2023) too. While a completely doctored pitch ensured that the Ahmedabad game got over within two days, the crushing Indore defeat had seen Rohit winning the toss and opting to bat first.When India won the 2020-21 Test series in Australia, Rohit Sharma missed the first two Tests and KL Rahul came back after missing the first Test due to injury. Virat too played just the Adelaide Test (all out 36); the game India lost.Now, the troika is expected to provide calming influence on India's batting Down Under which seems a tall ask. Especially going by the form and manner of dismissals of Rohit and Virat in the longest form of the game.To their credit, Rohit or coach Gautam Gambhir have not given the impression that they have not accepted the team's shortcomings - patience, technique, handling pressure and failure to bat out sessions consistently. Hence there is still optimism - for both the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under and WTC qualification .India had scored 387-4 for their most remarkable successful Test chase in recent years against England in Chennai in 2008. The target of 359 in Pune was similar. Virender Sehwag (83) had given India a blazing start in Chennai.Yashavi Jaiswal played a similar role in Pune with an attacking 77. But Rohit Sharma (8), Virat Kohli (17) and Rishabh Pant (0) failed to essay the kind of roles played by Gautam Gambhir (66*), Sachin Tendulkar (103*) and Yuvraj (85*) from the class of 2008.It was the third Test at the Gahunje stadium and none have gone into the fifth day. India added five more new Test centres, besides Pune, in recent years. They are Rajkot, Indore, Ranchi, Visakhapatnam and Dharamshala.These other five centres have hosted a combined 14 Tests with three lasting five days, seven four days and four three days. So, Tests ending early is an overall norm. The preceding Test in Bengaluru also lasted only four days with the first day being washed out.","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have not played a first-class game this season.

MS Dhoni 's stumpings have often left batsmen stunned, showing a blend of anticipation, sharp technique, and agility.In a video of a recent event that is now viral, Dhoni narrates an interesting conversation that transpired between him and his wife Sakshi while they were watching a cricket match.Dhoni says, ""We were watching an ODI at home, Sakshi was there with me. Usually me and Sakshi don't talk about cricket. The bowler bowled a wide, the batsman stepped out and was stumped. The on field umpire went for the third umpire. My wife started, 'It's not out and by the time she said that, the batsman had already started walking back. 'You just see they will call him back, one cannot get stumped on a wide ball'.""Dhoni continues, ""I said no, no a stumping can be done off a wide ball but not off a no ball. And she said, 'Tumko kuch nahi pata hai' (you don't know anything), you just wait, the third umpire will call him back.' And by the time this conversation is happening, the batsman has already reached the boundary line. And she's like, 'no, no, they have to call him back.' But finally when the next batsman came, she was like 'you know there is something wrong'.""The audience bursts into laughter at the anecdote narrated by Dhoni.Dhoni's stumpings are widely celebrated not just because they often come at crucial junctures, changing the course of matches, but also remain an inspiration for wicketkeepers worldwide.",MS Dhoni holds the record for most stumpings in ODI cricket.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar expressed his disappointment with the Indian team's batting performance during their loss to New Zealand in the second Test at Pune.The defeat led to India's first home series loss in 12 years, as the Kiwi spin attack, spearheaded by Mitchell Santner , who claimed 13 wickets in the match, outplayed the hosts in their own spin-friendly conditions.New Zealand secured the series 2-0 with a game to spare, winning the second Test by 113 runs.Manjrekar pointed out that Virat Kohli , once again, misjudged the length of Santner's delivery, while skipper Rohit Sharma appeared underconfident against spin.He believes that three out of the top four Indian batsmen lack confidence when facing spin bowling.Manjrekar suggests that India should have relied more on their defensive techniques and avoided losing early wickets.""Virat Kohli once again misread the length. The ball was much fuller than he anticipated and came back into him sharply. Rohit Sharma was not confident at the crease. There are a lot of guys, top 3 out of 4 who are short of confidence against spin. On pitches like these, you see that it is difficult to bat vs spin in first session and a half,"" Manjrekar said.""I think that if India backed their defence a little more, things could have gotten easier. If India had not lost too many wickets earlier, this game could have been much closer with Rishabh Pant , Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja being around,"" he said.Manjrekar also mentioned that he thought India could stage a surprise comeback when Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill were batting together.However, he observed that Gill struggles to read spinners and feels pressured when facing them on turning pitches.""When Yashasvi and Shubman were going together, I thought that there would be a surprise around the corner. Shubman Gill clearly does not have the feel for spinners.

T20I squad vs Zimbabwe:

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has announced the white-ball squads for the team's tour of Australia next month, with Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi making a comeback after being left out of the last two Tests of the home series against England.After losing the first Test, Pakistan made a remarkable comeback to win the next two matches and clinch the series 2-1.Following the victory, Pakistan named the T20I and ODI squads for their tour of Australia, beginning with the first ODI on November 4 in Melbourne. The three-match ODI series will be followed by three T20Is.Speaking about the squad and the new list of centrally-contracted players, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali said the selection mirrors India's approach.""The squads are good, except 3-4 names. Lekin pehli baar nazar aaya ke India ki copy ki gayi hai (for the first time it was seen that India's approach has been copied). It's not a bad thing, it's a good copy,"" said Basit in a video on his YouTube channel, without elaborating on that.The PCB also simultaenously announced the white-ball squads for the series in Zimbabwe after the Australia tour. .The two notable absentees in the squads are senior players Fakhar Zaman and Shadab Khan, while wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Rizwan has been appointed as the new white-ball skipper. Rizwan will be rested for the T20Is in Zimbabwe where Salman Agha will replace him as the captain.However, Shadab has retained his central contract but Zaman is out of that list as well, possibly as a result of his social media post in support of Babar Azam before the Test series again England. The PCB had issued a show-cause notice to Zaman after that.""Mazak Cup ki performance pe central contract diye gaye hain. Nobody will (dare) say that,"" said Basit about the domestic Champions Cup ODI tournament, which was organized by the PCB.He then added a touch of sarcasm related to Babar's inclusion in the T20I squad, while also poking his former teammate and current PCB selector Aaqib Javed.""I got a call from Australia, they said we won't dismiss Babar Azam in T20Is. I got surprised, and asked 'Why?'. They said Aaqib Javed asked for that,"" he said.""How could you select Babar in the T20 squad! The captain (Rizwan) demanded for it; that's the truth,"" said Basit, while adding that Rizwan must have said, ""if no, then I won't become the captain.""On the issue of opening batsman Zaman's exclusion, Basit challenged Babar to come out in the open and stand in support for his teammate, like Zaman did for him when he was dropped from the Test squad.""Babar sahab, hai himmat? Karo tweet Fakhar ke liye (Babar, do you have the courage to tweet for Fakhar Zaman?)...say Fakhar has been hard done by,"" said Basit.""You don't have that courage.

NEW DELHI: Gary Kirsten 's short tenure as Pakistan's white-ball head coach appears to be coming to an abrupt end, just a day after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) named Mohammad Rizwan as the new full-time white-ball captain and announced fresh central contracts. While there has been no official statement from the PCB , reports suggest Kirsten will not be traveling with the team for their upcoming tour of Australia and Zimbabwe.According to Cricbuzz, serious differences have emerged between Kirsten and the players, as well as disagreements with the PCB over coaching staff decisions. Kirsten had reportedly requested the appointment of David Reid as High Performance coach, a suggestion that did not align with the PCB's preferences, leading to tensions. The board allegedly proposed alternatives, which Kirsten found unacceptable.Kirsten, who did not respond to inquiries from Cricbuzz, is unlikely to join the team as Pakistan's 15-member ODI squad departs for Australia on Monday. It is also unclear whether Kirsten's departure is definitive, but he is not expected to travel to Zimbabwe for the three ODIs and three T20Is scheduled after the Australia series.Kirsten's tenure, which began in May following his role with Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League (IPL), has been marred by a lack of success on the field. Pakistan lost a bilateral series in England and suffered a disappointing early exit in the T20 World Cup, with losses to the United States and India derailing their campaign.With the ICC Champions Trophy less than four months away and Pakistan set to host an international tournament for the first time in over two decades, the PCB faces the urgent task of appointing a new white-ball coach.Speculation suggests that Jason Gillespie , Pakistan's red-ball coach, could temporarily take over both formats. However, Aaqib Javed , a former fast bowler and current national selector, is seen as the frontrunner for the position. Javed is credited with the team's recent success in the home Test series against England, which Pakistan won 2-1.An official announcement is expected soon as the PCB navigates this challenging coaching situation ahead of a critical period for Pakistan cricket.","Gary Kirsten's short tenure as Pakistan's white-ball head coach appears to be coming to an abrupt end.

""There is a show-cause notice pending against him, and we will see about that. The main issue with him is his fitness test, which he was not able to clear.""Zaman had criticized the selection committee’s decision to drop Babar mid-series, a move that did not sit well with the board. Naqvi made it clear that the PCB would not tolerate players publicly commenting on internal selection matters. ""It cannot happen that if the selection committee is not playing one player, then others start tweeting to express their displeasure. Players are not allowed to function like this, and we will never allow that,"" he added.Fakhar Zaman’s removal from the contracts list sees him omitted from Category B, which now includes Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah.

🔴 LIVE: India vs New Zealand: Another embarrassing show by India batters, series in danger

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali believes that India face an uphill task to make a comeback in the second Test against New Zealand at MCA Stadium in Pune.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit remarked, “Rohit Sharma aur Virat Kohli agar runs kare (If Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli score runs) — two big names who failed in the first innings—there might be a possibility (of a comeback). But the chances are very low right now. New Zealand are in a very strong position to win the match... Before the Australia tour, this is not a good sign for India. Let's see what happens.”New Zealand have taken control of the Test, leading by 301 runs at stumps on day two, thanks to a brilliant performance by left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner , who grabbed 7-53 to dismantle India's batting lineup.India were bowled out for just 156 in response to New Zealand's 259, giving the visitors a 103-run first-innings lead on a challenging Pune pitch.By the end of the day, New Zealand reached 198-5 in their second innings, with Tom Latham scoring a solid 86.Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell (30 not out) and Glenn Phillips (9 not out) remained unbeaten, steering New Zealand closer to what could be a historic Test series win in India.India’s bowlers, led by Washington Sundar , showed some resistance.Sundar picked up four wickets, bringing his match tally to 11, while Ravichandran Ashwin chipped in with a key breakthrough. However, New Zealand’s batters extended their lead, leaving India in a tough spot.India’s batting collapse in the first innings was another disappointment, following their 46 all-out debacle in Bengaluru.Ravindra Jadeja top-scored with 38, but wickets tumbled regularly. Santner’s spin exposed India's vulnerabilities, with crucial dismissals, including Virat Kohli for just one and Sarfaraz Khan for 11.With New Zealand already 1-0 up in the three-match series, Basit Ali’s doubts about India’s comeback seem justified.India's struggles with the bat are particularly concerning ahead of their upcoming Australia tour.

Pat Cummins on Selections, Leadership, India

NEW DELHI: Putting an end to the chatter around David Warner 's comeback for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , Australia skipper Pat Cummins said that the team loves the former opener but won't be considering him for the marquee series against India.Warner, who retired earlier this year after the Sydney Test against Pakistan, recently offered to make a comeback. Warner said that he is always available and is just a phone call away.In Warner's absence, Steve Smith has been opening for the side but the decision from the management hasn't quite worked out yet.Responding to the 37-year-old's comments on The Grade Cricketer podcast, Cummins labelled the offer a bit of a wind-up.

Can Washington succeed Ashwin?

Chennai: October 24, 2024, will undoubtedly go down as a red-letter day in Tamil Nadu cricket history as two ‘sons of the soil’ joined forces to bag all 10 wickets for India in a Test innings .On the opening day of the second match in Pune on Thursday, the returning Washington Sundar ran through the New Zealand middle and lower-order with a personal-best seven-wicket haul after fellow off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin removed the top-three.The masterclass from Washington and Ashwin effectively made it a mini contest between TN and NZ, with the finger spinners from the southern region of the country emerging well on top in the end. The ‘brothers of destruction’ brought huge cheer to everyone associated with cricket in TN, a state that has a history of producing fine slow bowlers.“It was fantastic to see two off-spinners from TN combine to pick up all 10 wickets in an innings. Washington was a surprise element; no one would have expected him to pick up seven wickets. It is a great thing for him as well as TN cricket. When it comes to Ashwin, he has been consistently doing well and is expected to be among the wickets,” M Venkataramana , former India off-break bowler and TN head coach, told TOI.With pride swelling in his voice, M Senthilnathan, a former TN player who coaches MRF Globe Trotters SC – theTNCA first-division team which Washington plays for – said: “Washington can be a lethal weapon with the ball on turning tracks. Washington and Ashwin have shown in this Test that they can play together. The TN guys did it (10 wickets) together. They bowled NZ out.”As Ashwin is at the twilight of his glorious career, the selectors and management are busy finding an able successor for the maestro. Washington fits the bill and has made a strong case on his Test comeback.Asked if Washington can be a like-for-like replacement for Ashwin after the latter hangs up his boots, Venkataramana said: “So far, he has proved himself in white-ball cricket. In international red-ball cricket , this is the first time he has performed so well with the ball. He has to keep improving. He has to work harder to have the skills to bowl well on good batting tracks. If he does that, he will be very good in the future. His past experience in the India team will help.”Senthilnathan said that Washington has the wherewithal to operate in a spin-heavy attack. “He will be a star performer for India in the years to come. Ashwin has been doing very well. There is an option to play both of them. If Ashwin continues to play like this, why not have both of them in the XI? When we can play two left-arm spinners in the XI, why cannot we have two right-arm off-spinners in the team?”",Washington Sundar and Ravichandran Ashwin took all 10 wickets in India's innings. The 'brothers of destruction' brought huge cheer to everyone associated with cricket in Tamil Nadu. Former India off-break bowler M Venkataramana said Washington can be a like-for-like replacement for Ashwin after he hangs up his boots.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114566767,imgsize-55024,width-400,resizemode-4/114566767.jpg"

India’s squad for the

Border-Gavaskar Trophy

:

Reserves:

Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) announced an 18-member India squad for the five-match Test series against Australia on Friday with Abhimanyu Easwaran, Harshit Rana and Nitish Rana included. The series begins in Perth on November 22.Arguably, the biggest talking point in the squad is the absence of Mohammed Shami , who had been working against the clock to get ready for the series. The match-changing seamer underwent ankle surgery earlier in the year and his rehabilitation process had appeared to be on track until a recent swelling to his knee.Kuldeep Yadav is also not in the squad to figure out a long-term solution for his chronic left groin issue. BCCI said in a statement, ""Kuldeep Yadav was unavailable for selection for the tour of Australia since he has been referred to The BCCI Centre of Excellence after the end of the ongoing Test series against New Zealand for long term resolution of his chronic left groin issue.""Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini and Khaleel Ahmed have been named as the reserves.Bengal's Easwaran has been rewarded for his success in domestic cricket as he becomes the third-choice opener alongside skipper Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal.India will also travel with a well-stocked pace attack alongside the leading pair of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Akash Deep has maintained his spot following impressive performances against England and Bangladesh, while Prasidh Krishna returns to the Test squad after debuting in South Africa.The Karnataka seamer underwent lengthy rehabilitation for a stress fracture. He was impressive in India A's Duleep Trophy title win last month.Seamer Harshit Rana gets to cap off an excellent year where he starred in an IPL title and now gets a Test call-up, after already being picked in the other two white-ball squads.Andhra Pradesh's medium-pace all-rounder Nitish Reddy is in the same boat as Rana, having impressed in the T20 league and stepping up to India level with his T20I bow in the Bangladesh series this month.Among the spin-bowling options, Washington Sundar, who took seven wickets in the first innings against New Zealand in the on-going second Test in Pune, has also been picked. But Axar Patel has been left out.Rohit Sharma (C), Jasprit Bumrah (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant (WK), Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel (WK), R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar.Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini, Khaleel Ahmed.","India announce 18-member squad for five-match Test series against Australia.

However, his fortunes declined during the 2017 season, and his role came under scanner due to shifting of power structure, as he revealed in his latest book. Virender Sehwag was roped in as mentor of Punjab and it was the time when Maxwell was named the side's captain. However, the duo found themselves at loggerheads with Sehwag asserting his authority and taking control of decisions, including selecting the playing XI.""When it came to selection, I thought it might be a good idea to bring the coaches into a WhatsApp group to make our decisions. Everyone agreed to this and shared their teams, with the exception of Sehwag,"" Maxwell wrote in his book, the excerpt of which was published on ESPNCricinfo.""At the end of the process, he made it clear that he would pick the starting XI, end of story. We were losing on and off the field by now, with Sehwag on more than one occasion making decisions that didn't necessarily make sense.""Maxwell revealed that his relationship with Sehwag deteriorated further after he publicly criticized him. This public criticism deepened the rift between the two, worsening their already strained dynamic.""The season came down to our final group game against Pune away from home, and we had a shocker batting first on a wet wicket, rolled for 73. It was all over. In the context of what was going on, I'm still quite proud of how we were able to broadly keep the show on the road until that stage,"" Maxwell wrote.""I was also happy with how I performed, doing the right thing as leader by giving myself the chance to influence games at the right time with bat and ball. Of course, we were all flat not to make the postseason, but it could have been so much worse.""I volunteered to do press that night, but Sehwag said he would instead. Upon getting onto the team bus, I found I'd been deleted from the main WhatsApp group. What was going on here? By the time we reached the hotel my phone was blowing up, with Sehwag having unloaded on me as a ""big disappointment"", blaming me for not taking responsibility as captain, and all the rest. It was unpleasant, especially when I thought we had parted on good terms.""""I texted him to say how much it hurt to read those comments and added that he had lost a fan in me for the way he had conducted himself. Sehwag's response was simple: ""Don't need fan like you."" We never spoke again. I knew my time was at an end and told the owners as much: if Sehwag was going to stick around, they were making a mistake and not to bother with me.

Brief scores (In Vadodara):

Baroda took a huge 161-run lead against Odisha at stumps on the second day of their Group A Ranji Trophy encounter in Vadodara on Sunday.Coming into the game on the back of two successive wins, the Baroda batters dominated the proceedings as they reached 354 for 6 in 107 overs in their third-round game.For the hosts, opener Shivalik Sharma continued from where he had left off on the opening day and played a well-controlled innings to put Baroda in control early on. Sadly, he missed a well-deserved century as he was dismissed for 96 off 209.Initially Shivalik got good support from Shashwat Rawat (34 off 81 balls), and later on with Vishnu Solanki , the duo added 121 runs. With 10 fours and two sixes he didn’t give the Odisha bowlers any respite and looked well set for a big one. However, Odisha captain Govinda Poddar was able to send him back to the pavilion when he caught him off his own bowling in the 74th over.However, Baroda continued to pile up the runs even after that as later in the day Solanki and skipper Krunal Pandya got together to stitch a partnership of 82 runs off 127 balls.The duo made quick runs and Solanki was in sight of the magical three-figure score. But just like Shivalik, he too failed to get there and was dismissed for 98 off 190 balls. This time it was Harshit Rathod, who had him trapped LBW.But Odisha’s plight did not end there as captain Pandya continued the rampage with NA Rathva for company. The pair added another 50 runs with the skipper himself making 40 off 28 balls. Towards the end of the day, Odisha were able to get the wicket of Rathva but by then it was too late.Baroda will now hope to add some more runs as quickly as possible on the third day and then have a go at the Odisha batters in the hope of making it three wins in a row. And with Pandya batting at 88, it surely won’t be too difficult.As for the visitors, they will be quite disappointed with their performance so far. Not only the batters, even the bowlers have been quite ordinary. Besides Poddar (4/96) only Rathod (1/34) and Sumit Sharma (1/51) got a wicket each.

NEW DELHI: The Indian women's cricket team faced a setback as skipper Sophie Devine led New Zealand to a series-levelling victory with a 76-run win in the second ODI in Ahmedabad on Sunday.Opting to bat first, Devine scored 79 off 86 balls, featuring seven fours and a six. She formed a crucial fifth-wicket partnership with Maddy Green , who contributed 42 off 41 balls, to help New Zealand amass 259 for nine.Devine also shone with the ball, claiming 3/27 as New Zealand bowled India out for 183, with No. 9 batter Radha Yadav top-scoring with a gritty 48.Lea Tahuhu also took three wickets for New Zealand, finishing with figures of 3/42. Jess Kerr (2/49) and Eden Carson (2/32) chipped in with essential wickets.Chasing 260, India struggled at the outset, quickly falling to 26 for 3 within the first five overs. They were further reduced to 102 for 7 in the 26th over. Radha Yadav and Saima Thakor (29) provided some resistance, putting together a 70-run stand for the ninth wicket.Kerr broke this partnership by dismissing Thakor, and India were all out in 47.1 overs, enabling New Zealand to tie the series at 1-1.Smriti Mandhana's rough patch continued as she got out after just two balls, dismissed by Tahuhu. Fellow opener Shafali Verma scored 11 with two boundaries before being adjudged LBW by Kerr. Yastika Bhatia also fell early, becoming Tahuhu's second victim, leaving India's top order in disarray.Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur , back from a minor injury, scored 24 runs and teamed up with Jemimah Rodrigues (17) to add 38 runs before both were dismissed.Tejal Hasabnis (15) and Deepti Sharma (15) couldn't capitalize on their starts, leaving India in a precarious position at 102 for 7 in the 26th over.Earlier, New Zealand started strong, with openers Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer adding 87 runs in under 16 overs. Bates scored 58 off 70 balls while Plimmer contributed 41 off 50.India managed to fight back by taking three quick wickets. Radha Yadav also pulled off a remarkable catch, running backward to give leg-spinner Priya Mishra her maiden international wicket.Yadav played a key role in three of the first four New Zealand wickets, seeming to tilt the game back towards India when Brooke Halliday was walking back to the pavilion.Then Devine stepped in and, with the support of Green, helped New Zealand regain control. Maddy Green's innings included five boundaries, bolstering the visitors who had lost the first ODI of the three-match series.Radha Yadav finished with four wickets, but conceded 69 runs in her 10 overs, while off-spinner Deepti Sharma ended with figures of 2/30.","New Zealand beat India by 76 runs in the second ODI in Ahmedabad.

Brief Scores

JAIPUR: One can see an unusual tension in both the camps after the end of the second day’s play at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium here on Sunday. At the halfway stage, the Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match between Rajasthan and Gujarat was evenly poised with both the teams trying hard to grab that all-important first innings lead.When the stumps were drawn, Rajasthan were 180 for the loss of five wickets in reply to Gujarat’s first innings total of 335. The home team are still trailing by 155 runs with five wickets in hand.Kunal Singh Rathore and Zubair Ali were batting at the crease on 26 and 18, respectively. They have already stitched together a crucial partnership of 40 runs for the unfinished sixth wicket after the hosts were reduced to 140 for 5 midway through the last session.The first couple of hours on Monday will decide the course of the match. While Rajasthan are hoping that their lower-order would bail them through, Gujarat would try to polish off the tail as quickly as possible.Resuming at their overnight score of 285/7, Gujarat added 50 more runs to stretch their total 335 before being all out in 97.4 overs.Jaymeet Patel , who was not out on 26 on Saturday, did bulk of the scoring and was the last man to get dismissed. His 61 (105b, 8x4) gave Gujarat innings much-needed stability. Deepak Chahar picked up a couple of wickets, while fellow seamer Arafat Khan added one more wicket to return with 4 for 50.Rajasthan got off to a solid start with both the openers Abhijeet Tomar and Yash Kothari batting sensibly to put on a 50-run partnership.Trying to pull Arzan Nagwaswalla, Kothari perished as the ball took the top edge and ballooned to gully region where Manan Hingrajia gladly accepted an easy catch.Salman Khan joined Tomar and strengthened the innings by mixing caution with aggression. At tea-break, the hosts were strongly placed at 122/1.The first over bowled by Jaymeet after the resumption was the most dramatic of the day which changed the situation rapidly. Salman slashed the first ball which just went over the slip cordon. On the next ball, he tried to do the same but this time he was caught in the gully by Priyam Panchal.Deepak Hooda well-left the three deliveries but Jaymeet quite smartly brought the ball in which found enough space between former’s bat and pad before hitting the middle stump.Tomar, who was batting nicely at the other end, couldn’t keep the ball down and was caught at long-leg off Tejas Patel . Tomar’s 77 came off 156 balls and studded with 11 boundaries and a six to long-on. All-rounder Jaymeet rounded off his fruitful day by trapping Mahipal Lomror quite cheaply. For the addition of just 14 runs, the home side lost 4 wickets.Tomar was upset with the timing of his dismissal. “I should have played out those critical moments when we were losing wickets fast. It was a terrible time to get out as my team was expecting me to carry on.

NEW DELHI: After being appointed as Pakistan’s new white-ball captain, wicket-keeper batsman Mohammad Rizwan delivered a powerful message about leadership and expectations.Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Rizwan said, ""If I start considering myself a king as captain, then everything will fall apart. As a leader, I am here to serve the 15 men of the team. This is how it should be.""Rizwan emphasized the importance of team unity and fighting spirit. ""Inshallah, we have the messages and support from everyone, and they are only asking us one thing: fight, fight, and fight. This message keeps coming, and we will try our best to show the nation that there is no shortage of fight in us,"" he added.Rizwan also underlined the importance of humility and leaving results in the hands of Allah. ""We have left the results to Allah, and whatever the outcome, we will accept it. But one thing we guarantee is that our fighting spirit will never waver.""The Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) announced Rizwan’s appointment as the captain for the upcoming white-ball tours of Australia and Zimbabwe on Sunday, following Babar Azam ’s resignation earlier this month.Rizwan, 32, has previously captained Pakistan in two Tests during a tour of New Zealand in 2020 when Azam was injured but had not led in limited-overs formats until now.PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi explained that the decision to appoint Rizwan came after consulting key stakeholders. “We carefully evaluated all options before choosing Rizwan as skipper for the white-ball team,” Naqvi said.Rizwan will have Salman Ali Agha as his vice-captain. Azam and Shaheen Afridi , meanwhile, will be rested for the Zimbabwe tour. However, both will feature in Pakistan’s ODI and T20I series against Australia.Pakistan will kick off their Australia tour with three ODIs starting November 4, followed by three T20Is.

'Biggest example is Ajinkya Rahane': Harbhajan Singh blames rank turners for damaging batters' confidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/biggest-example-is-ajinkya-rahane-harbhajan-singh-blames-rank-turners-for-damaging-batters-confidence/articleshow/114660001.cms,"(Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images)

It's a theory that some players are irreplaceable

NEW DELHI: India's star batters have lost a lot of confidence over the years by playing on rank turners, with their home averages taking a beating and affecting their careers adversely, feels former off-spinner Harbhajan Singh Harbhajan said Ajinkya Rahane is a case in point after India lost their first Test series in 12 years.On a Pune turner against New Zealand, India lost a crucial toss and managed only 156 and 245 with the Black Caps' lead spinner Mitchell Santner taking 13 wickets.""If you have had great record at home for so long and if you lose, obviously there will be chatter. Credit to New Zealand for playing the way they did and these were alien conditions and also not a pitch where wear and tear was natural.""It was a tailor-made condition for spinners where ball was supposed to turn from first hour,"" Harbhajan told PTI in an interaction.A straight shooter, Harbhajan questioned the thought process of the Indian team, which is proving to be counter-productive.""Look at the trend during last decades. We are playing mostly on turners through the last decade with the hope that we will win the toss, score 300 and control the game.""But we don't know if we are at the receiving end, if we have the batting to wriggle out on turners. Our batters have lost a lot of confidence playing on these tracks. The biggest example is Ajinkya Rahane, a fine player. His career suffered because of these kind of surfaces,"" Harbhajan was cut-throat in his assessment.One of the country's finest off-spinners, he elaborated how batters lose confidence.""We always get into whataboutery that they (SENA countries) also prepare pitches as per their needs but those aren't pitches where you can't even bat. Those pitches go through natural wear and tear over time.""Here if you don't know which one will turn and which one will go straight, you are forever fighting doubts whether to attack or defend. Even Virat Kohli has fared well abroad in last few years where the ball comes onto the bat.""Now you have three bad home Tests on these tracks but selectors know that you are a good player and take you on overseas tour, but by then, not having runs under your belt has started playing havoc with your mindset.""You also fail in a couple of overseas Tests, and suddenly, you are out of the team. Is that a good thing?"" the 'Turbanator' asked.Harbhajan couldn't hide his sarcasm when he spoke about the kind of result-oriented pitches that the Indian team management in past few years have gone for.""If you prepare rank turners, you don't play spinners who can turn the ball on flattest of decks. All you need is bowlers who are accurate. Washy (Washington Sundar) and Axar (Patel) can do the job, and you won't need Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja 's quality.""You had Joe Root getting five wickets here some years back. Bring Varun Chakravarthy, who is a white-ball specialist. He will run through sides,"" Harabhajan said.Harbhajan has witnessed a transition in Indian cricket between 2011-2013 when stalwarts like Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman retired with Virender Sehwag, Zaheer Khan , current coach Gautam Gambhir and him being phased out.""Look age is a factor for some in this team but then Virat and Jaddu are extremely fit guys. Yes, age, fitness and form are criteria but the questions crop up once you start losing. The onus obviously comes on seniors in the team. It happened in that phase,"" he recalled.But he absolutely detests the theory that certain players can't be replaced.""Kaun kehta hai bharpai naahi hoti. Bharpai bilkul hoti hai. Gavaskar saab gaye, Tendulkar saab aaye, Tendulkar saab gaye, humein Kohli mila aur bhavishya mein bhi aisa hoga. (Who says you can't get replacements? You got replacements in past and you will get in future). The game will move on and we will get replacements.""Are there enough talents in domestic cricket?""Of course there's talent in domestic cricket. How did you get Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and now Sarfaraz Khan. It is from domestic cricket only. It is about getting right opportunities at right time.""If you get chance at right time, you can become Virat Kohli or else you could be Amol Mujumdar or Amarjeet Kaypee,"" said the man with 700 international wickets.""It took Virat 15 years to become what he has become. So you need to look at the talent and may be have an idea that, yes, this boy, if persisted with, can become a match-winner for a decade.""When we were playing, we heard that Rohit is an enormous talent. How did people know? Because of domestic cricket, and even after first few years of inconsistency, the system backed him. So we will get replacements.""But does he see transition happening?""Not immediately, as you have a big Australia series and WTC final at stake. But yes, this Australia series will be a make or break for many in the team,"" he concluded.",India's star batters have lost a lot of confidence playing on rank turners. Former off-spinner Harbhajan Singh says Ajinkya Rahane is a case in point. India lost their first Test series in 12 years against New Zealand.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114660032,imgsize-57822,width-400,resizemode-4/114660032.jpg"

Bayern Munich reclaimed the top spot in the Bundesliga with a decisive 5-0 victory over Bochum on Sunday. This win came after a tough 4-1 loss to Barcelona in the Champions League midweek.RB Leipzig had temporarily topped the table on Saturday with a 3-1 win over Freiburg, but Bayern's triumph on Sunday brought them back to the summit on goal difference. Five different players scored for Bayern in the match.""It's fun to score goals,"" said Jamal Musiala to DAZN. He added, ""We can be happy today -- and take the rhythm and flow with us in the next few games.""Bayern's performance under new coach Vincent Kompany had been inconsistent, with the team winning only one of their last six matches in all competitions prior to this game. Reflecting on the recent loss, Musiala said, ""It was hard to take and it hurt. We have to look ahead -- it's still early in the season.""Bochum had an early chance when Moritz Broschinski outpaced Minjae Kim and got the ball past Manuel Neuer , but his shot lacked power and was cleared off the line by Kim.Bayern took the lead with a free kick from Olise that found the net after Bochum's goalie, Patrick Drewes, was out of position. Musiala doubled the lead 10 minutes later with a header from a Joshua Kimmich free kick.In the second half, Bayern added three more goals. Harry Kane scored his ninth goal in eight league games, followed by goals from Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman.""Bayern simply showed their quality,"" said Bochum’s Maximilian Wittek. With this result, Bayern sits at the top on goal difference, while Bochum remains at the bottom with just one point from eight games.In other matches, Union Berlin and Eintracht Frankfurt played to a 1-1 draw. Union's Benedict Hollerbach equalized after Mario Goetze's opening goal for Frankfurt. Union had a potential winning goal disallowed by VAR for offside, which Hollerbach criticized as ""scandalous.""Heidenheim will host Hoffenheim later on Sunday in the final match of the round.",Bayern Munich defeats Bochum 5-0 to reclaim top spot in Bundesliga.

Liverpool 's Mohamed Salah scored a late goal to secure a 2-2 draw against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on Sunday. The result keeps Manchester City on top of the Premier League standings.Liverpool were on the brink of losing when Salah netted with nine minutes left. Arsenal took the lead early with a goal from Bukayo Saka, but Virgil van Dijk quickly equalized for Liverpool. Arsenal regained the lead through Mikel Merino just before halftime.Salah's goal came in the closing stages, helped in part by Arsenal's defensive injuries, which saw Gabriel Magalhaes and Jurrien Timber leave the field in the second half.Manchester City benefited from the draw, maintaining their first-place position after a 1-0 win against Southampton on Saturday. They are one point ahead of Liverpool, with Arsenal trailing five points behind.This draw marks only the second game Liverpool has not won since Arne Slot took over from Jurgen Klopp. Slot started his tenure with 12 wins from 13 games.Arsenal faced multiple challenges, including the absence of Riccardo Calafiori, and William Saliba due to suspension. The injuries and lack of recent victories complicate their pursuit of a league title.Saka put Arsenal ahead in the ninth minute after a long pass from Ben White. Van Dijk equalized for Liverpool in the 18th minute with a header from a corner.Arsenal regained the lead in the 43rd minute with Merino heading in a free kick from Declan Rice.

Silence the Bernabeu

Robert Lewandowski struck twice in three minutes as Barcelona crushed rivals Real Madrid 4-0 on Saturday, inflicting the Spanish champions' first La Liga defeat in over a year.Teenage winger Lamine Yamal and Raphinha completed the rout, while Madrid superstar Kylian Mbappe had two goals ruled out for offside on a frustrating first Clasico appearance for Los Blancos, who now trail league leaders Barcelona by six points.France captain Mbappe was consistently outwitted by the visitors' high defensive line to the chagrin of the exasperated Santiago Bernabeu crowd, whose mood darkened as Barcelona hit four second half goals.Barcelona snapped Madrid's 42-match unbeaten streak in La Liga, one game short of the Catalan giants' all-time record, adding further shine to their triumph.Hansi Flick has whipped Barcelona into shape in just a matter of months and in ending a run of four Clasico defeats, his young side made a statement victory to show how far they have come.Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti opted for more muscle in midfield by selecting Eduardo Camavinga over Luka Modric, with his team's game-plan clear -- defend in numbers and try to spring Mbappe or Vinicius with a long ball into the space behind Barcelona's high defensive line.It led to an intense but repetitive first half, with Barcelona's defence catching Madrid offside on eight occasions.Mbappe hit the side-netting and lobbed over but was offside on both occasions, while Jude Bellingham forced a superb save from Barcelona goalkeeper Inaki Pena, but it would also have been disallowed for offside.At the other end Barcelona's teenage star Yamal sent a soft effort at Andriy Lunin when put through on goal by a superb Lewandowski flick.Raphinha fired over and Lunin also saved from the Brazilian winger, but Barcelona were not playing with the fluidity they have demonstrated in recent weeks, culminating in the impressive 4-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday.Mbappe thought he had broken the deadlock when he got in behind and produced a fine dinked finish over Pena, but yet again the forward was marginally offside and his celebration was cut short.Despite the feeling they were constantly menacing Barcelona, Madrid only produced one legal shot in the first half, with Vinicius dragging into the side-netting when he tried to catch Pena out at the near post.Eager for more control Flick replaced Fermin Lopez with Frenkie de Jong at half-time and Barcelona soon took the lead.Casado slipped Lewandowski through and with Madrid defender Ferland Mendy a step behind his team-mates, the Pole was onside.The 36-year-old slotted low past Lunin to silence the Bernabeu, and two minutes later he pounced again.Lewandowski headed home Alejandro Balde's cross to double Barcelona's advantage and net his 14th league goal in 11 games, continuing his stunning revival under Flick afer struggling last season.Mbappe had a second goal ruled out for offside as Madrid struggled to find a way back in and Pena kept out a low stinging effort from the former Paris Saint-Germain forward.Lewandowski spurned two golden chances to complete his hat-trick, shooting against the post from Raphinha's lay-off and then blazing over after good work by Yamal.Spain's Euro 2024 star Yamal plundered Barcelona's third by rifling home after the surging Raphinha teed him up, with Flick celebrating jubilantly in the dugout.Raphinha completed the rout with a lob over Lunin to leave the Bernabeu reeling.",Barcelona crush rivals Real Madrid 4-0 in Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu.

EPL: Manchester City move top as early Haaland strike secures win over Southampton,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/epl-manchester-city-move-top-as-early-haaland-strike-secures-win-over-southampton/articleshow/114630144.cms,"(AP Photo)

MANCHESTER (England): Manchester City 's Erling Haaland scored an early goal to take the champions provisionally top of the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over lowly Southampton at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.Pep Guardiola 's team have 23 points after nine games, two ahead of Liverpool, who visit Arsenal on Sunday. Southampton are still without a win in their first season back in the top flight after a season away and sit bottom on one point.While Haaland scored a stunner in Wednesday's 5-0 Champions League thrashing of Sparta Prague, he had gone three Premier League games without a goal but ended that drought in the fifth minute on Saturday.Wrestling with defender Jan Bednarek, the 24-year-old Norwegian, a master of scoring from difficult angles, stabbed the ball into the roof of the net with a toe while falling onto his backside.Southampton had a terrific chance to level right before the break when Cameron Archer was one-on-one with keeper Ederson -- and Saints boss Russell Martin already had his hands raised in celebration -- but the forward smashed his shot against the bar.Haaland, whose 11 goals top the league scoring chart, had a flurry of near-misses in the second half, including a sitter from close range that he poked just wide and then buried his head in his hands in disbelief.The afternoon was a tale of teams heading in opposite directions, with City stretching their unbeaten streak in the Premier League to 32 games. They have not lost a league game at the Etihad since a defeat by Brentford in November 2022.Southampton have not won at City since 2004.The win for Guardiola's side was not particularly pretty.They did just enough to beat a Southampton team who were pinned back in their own half for much of the afternoon. Russell Martin's side will have to take comfort from conceding just one goal after allowing 18 in their previous eight league matches.""We're used to that when teams defend deep against us which makes it more difficult, we have to be patient,"" City midfielder Bernardo Silva said.""We had our chances to score three or four goals to make it, but (Southampton) deserve a lot of credit for what they did here today.""",Erling Haaland scores the only goal in Manchester City's 1-0 win over Southampton.

Getting a pass from Buanthanglun Samte on the left in the fifth minute, a few feet outside the box, the 31-year-old centre forward chose to take the shot from the distance that magically flew over everyone, including the diving Jamshedpur custodian, into the top right corner of the goal.While Ajaraie missed a goalmouth chance from a Jithin MS cross a few minutes later and NEUFC kept growing into the match, the action took a diametric shift in the 29th minute as Jamshedpur's defensive mainstay Stephen Eze - already on a yellow for a foul on Gogoi in the 13th - was sent off with a second yellow as his feet inadvertently hit Muthu Mayakkannan's face while receiving a high cross.Jamshedpur coach Khalid Jamil was forced to change his tactic early on and the hosts pounced on the opportunity to up the ante in the Jamshedpur half. And it paid off just a minute before half-time as Ajaraie sent a perfect through to Gogoi from inside the box that the youngster converted with a confident touch that grazed past Albino Gomes into the net.After the change of ends, it seemed just a matter of time before NEUFC increased their lead. It came in the 55th minute and golden boy Ajaraie was involved this time with his defence piercing long through for Jithin inside the box, who did well to control it in the midst of the defenders and fed it to Gogoi near the goal who slotted it home for his 10th ISL goal - the most among U22 players in the league.The fourth goal came from a swerving finish by 20-year-old sub Louis Macarton Nickson with an assist from co-substitute Hamza Regragui.And while he saw an earlier attempt hit the woodwork, Ajaraie was undaunted in his constant attacks and produced another magical run from a Michel Zabaco pass on a counter-attack in the 90th minute and added the fifth to the NEUFC tally converting it with a defender close on heels and past the reach of the outstretched Gomes.",Alaeddine Ajaraie scored a brace and assisted in one of Parthib Gogoi's two strikes in NorthEast United's 5-0 win over Jamshedpur FC. The victory - their second this season - took them to the fourth spot with eight points from six games.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114629887,imgsize-41278,width-400,resizemode-4/114629887.jpg"
"East Bengal halt losing run, but fail to beat Paro FC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/east-bengal-halt-losing-run-but-fail-to-beat-paro-fc/articleshow/114627789.cms,"(East Bengal Photo)

East Bengal FC managed to halt their 8-match losing streak across tournaments when they rallied to hold Paro FC 2-2 in their AFC Challenge League opener in Thimphu on Saturday.Facing cold weather and playing on an artificial pitch at the Changlimithang Stadium, East Bengal took the lead in the fifth minute when Madih Talal - set up by Saul Crespo - came up with a composed finish. But Paro came back immediately into the contest thanks to their two Ghanaian attackers. Evans Asante first drew a foul from East Bengal full-back Provat Lakra inside the box and his teammate William Opoku - who had once plied his trade for Bhawanipore FC in Kolkata - converted the resultant penalty.And things became worse for East Bengal who finished the first half trailing. After surviving an onslaught, the Bhutan champions launched into a quick counter-attack and Asante raced forward with the ball, sprinting past a hapless Talal and with defender Lalchugnunga nowhere to challenge him, he calmly drilled the ball in past goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Gill, who came out of his position to close the gap but in vain.Dimitri Diamantakos eventually salvaged a point for Oscar Bruzon’s side when he tapped home a deft lay-off from Nandhakumar Sekar in the 70th minute.East Bengal kept the pressure on and missed several chances to clinch the win. Diamantakos could have also killed the contest with a stoppage-time winner but the Greek striker failed to go past Paro goalkeeper Milos Cupic in a one-on-one situation.The draw might have ended a wretched run for the red-and-gold team, which has lost six matches in a row in the ISL season and two more before the start of the domestic league. But the players' inability to live up to expectations against a Bhutanese side should leave a lot to be desired for the team management.","East Bengal FC held 2-2 by Bhutanese side Paro FC in their AFC Challenge League opener in Thimphu on Saturday.

You need to get to a situation for luck to play a role: Arjun Kadhe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/you-need-to-get-to-a-situation-for-luck-to-play-a-role-arjun-kadhe/articleshow/114661630.cms,"Arjun Kadhe

PUNE: It was his grandparents who sowed the seeds for Arjun Kadhe ’s career as a professional tennis player.More than two decades ago, when Arjun was taking baby steps in tennis, his paternal grandfather decided to sell their house and set aside the proceeds exclusively to help his grandson follow a dream.“I remember when I was eight years old … at that point we were not financially so super to think about tennis as a viable option for my career. But my granddad had a vision. He told me, ‘Okay, I will do anything. You just play tennis, you want to represent India, you want to play a Grand Slam ’. My parents were living on rent. It was unbelievable,” an emotional Kadhe, 30, said as he jogged his memory back.All the sacrifices, of his and of those around him, and the years of tireless pursuit of excellence bore fruit last week when Arjun claimed his first ATP Tour doubles title , in partnership with Rithvik Choudary at the Almaty Open in Kazakhstan last week.“The credit goes first to my parents, they've made huge sacrifices, then my coaches. Obviously, it's a team effort,” he said.""Obviously, Balu sir (coach M Balachandran) traveling with us, (former South African player) Raven (Klaasen) traveling with us, the Double Dream of India programme is helping us a lot.“And as you said, the journey is long, but it feels really, really good, because you get rewarded. In doubles you're playing 35 weeks alone on the road, and it can be really brutal sometimes.“So this win, we both want to take it in, get confidence, enjoy and go ahead again.”The Indian combination beat three teams ranked in the top-30 on the ATP Tour, including No. 13 pair Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul of France in the second round.In a thriller of a final, Arjun and Rithvik saved five match points in the super tiebreak to beat Germany’s Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, ranked 26th, 3-6, 7-6 (3), 14-12. Remarkably, the Indians won only 68 points to their rivals’ 80 in the match.Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard to get there in the first place.“I think luck played a big part. But at the same time, we were just talking, the coaches were telling us we lost two finals in the super tiebreak, where we were the better team, in the Challengers. As (personal coach) Hemant (Bendrey) sir was also saying, luck is there, but you have to get yourself into that situation for luck to play it out,” Arjun said.The Punekar, supported by Punit Balan group , rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win.“I'm really grateful that it has happened, but at the same time, I feel I was playing a good level,” he said.“It's about, you know, being there, giving yourself that chance, getting rejected, at some point it will come.“It's not in your hands when that click comes. For some people, it comes early. If they can sustain it, they move to the next level.“Some people get rejected, and get that breakthrough. It's about working hard and trying to improve, and take the next step. Everyone has their own journey, in my opinion.“I feel we deserve it, because I truly believe we have the level. Now it's about going the long way and trying to improve every day and not be satisfied with this one tournament.”Arjun had partnered Rithvik in the latter half of last season but parted ways at the start of 2024. Even before they combined, the Telangana lad had mentioned to Arjun of his desire to play with his previous partner Niki Poonacha whenever he decided to focus on doubles. So, the Maharashtra player was understandably cautious when Rithvik reached out to him in the middle of this season.“I feel like every challenge brings opportunity. At that point (when Rithvik chose to go back to Niki at the start of 2024), I was like, ‘oh my God. we are doing well, blah, blah, blah, what is happening?’ But then, if I look back now, I won (two Challenger) titles (with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Anirudh Chandrasekar),” Arjun said.“So it was really good for me.”This time around, Arjun said, the two were in for the long haul. And long-term partnership is something he strongly believes in.“To develop a good team, you need time,” he said, “because if you keep switching partners, the first few weeks of understanding how we want to play, understanding how my partner wants us to play in the future, what is our best?“For all that to align it takes a little bit of time, and in doubles you have super tiebreak. Sometimes you are winning from (facing) match points, sometimes losing from match points.”The Almaty title had given a pleasant surprise for both Arjun and Rithvik in terms of ranking jump — the latter had broken into the top-100 for the first time in his career, reaching 85 in the ATP charts.That means they will now give it a shot to make the Australian Open cut before closing the season.“Now it's about planning it smartly, taking care of your body, because it's the end of the year, you don't want to overplay,” he said.“If we want to be top-50 in the world, we need to improve a lot. We won this tournament, but those teams are doing so many things better than us. So, it’s important also to play the big events, lose, and then realize this is where we are at.“So, we are not thinking too far ahead, just trying to think next week. How can we try and make Australia? If we don't make it, we still have to try and make French.“The plan will go forward from there.”","Arjun Kadhe claims his first ATP Tour doubles title with Rithvik Choudary at Almaty Open in Kazakhstan. The 30-year-old rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win. Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114661721,imgsize-157286,width-400,resizemode-4/114661721.jpg"
My fighting spirit helped me win my first ITF title: Tanisha Kashyap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/my-fighting-spirit-helped-me-win-my-first-itf-title-tanisha-kashyap/articleshow/114554193.cms,"Tanisha Kashyap in action during the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru last week. (Photo Credit: KSLTA/Deepthi Indukuri)

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured. I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week.

The organization stresses feedback gathered from key stakeholders, including players, coaches, and umpires.According to the ITF, players perceive the change positively. Coaches view it as beneficial for player development and professional recognition. Umpires appreciate the shift, claiming it allows them to focus on officiating rather than policing coaching violations.However, the decision has drawn criticism from some prominent players.World number six Taylor Fritz took to social media platform X to express his disapproval, stating, ""Can we stop ruining the 1v1 mental/strategic aspect of the sport PLEASE.""Fritz, a US Open finalist, has previously voiced concerns about off-court coaching, believing it diminishes the individual strategic and mental battle inherent to tennis.Former world number 10 Denis Shapovalov echoed Fritz's sentiment, expressing disappointment on X, stating, ""Not just as atennis player but as a fan of this sport it’s sad to see this new off-court coaching rule. Tennis is special because you are out there alone. Why are you trying to change the beauty of this game.""Shapovalov's statement underscores the perspective that off-court coaching undermines the unique solitary nature of tennis, potentially impacting the sport's core appeal.The ITF's decision to formally implement off-court coaching marks a significant shift in the sport's landscape.While the organization emphasizes positive feedback from stakeholders and potential benefits, vocal opposition from high-ranking players like Fritz and Shapovalov highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the rule change and its potential long-term impact on the sport's fundamental dynamics.","The ITF has officially approved off-court coaching, starting January 1, 2025.

The Mumbai girl, who rallied from 1-3 down, taking the next three games, was consistent with her groundstrokes, landing winners from the baseline. On the contrary, Kashyap, who called for a medical timeout after the ninth game to attend her injury, had nine doubles faults -twice in the tie-break -helping Nitture take the set.""I've been suffering from an injury this whole week - stiff neck, it has been strained. Physically, it was tough, but I am proud of the way I handled the situation,"" Kashyap said, adding ""Winning this title feels special. I think it is the first of many more to come. Now, I will go back and recover.""In the second set, Kashyap started playing better and Nitture's level dropped. The latter made errors and looked down while Kashyap, who tackled her opponent's dangerous drop shots smoothly, took a 4-0 lead. Kashyap did well to keep the ball in play and Nitture's rising unforced error count made the Assam player's task easier. Even encouraging words from the Mumbai girl's mother and coach, who were in the stands, did not help her case.The deciding set was a repeat of the second in that Kashyap just couldn't get back into the contest.","India's Tanisha Kashyap beats Akanksha Nitture in three sets to win ITF Open title in Bengaluru.
