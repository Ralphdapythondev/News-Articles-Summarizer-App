'Aapne pahle innings dekh li India ki...': Misbah-ul-Haq criticizes Pakistan's batting strategy after narrow loss to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/misbah-ul-haq-criticizes-pakistans-batting-strategy-after-narrow-loss-to-india/articleshow/110887964.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq has criticized the Pakistan team management following their narrow six-run defeat to India in the T20 World Cup match on Sunday. Despite a strong bowling performance that restricted India to just 119 runs, Pakistan's batting lineup failed to capitalize, jeopardizing their chances of progressing in the tournament.Misbah pointed out critical errors in Pakistan's approach during the run chase, particularly the underutilization of middle-order batter Iftikhar Ahmed , who came in to bat at No.7 despite being the lone specialist batter in the middle order.""Middle order par confidence nahi hai. Seedhi si baat hai. Hum unko jis tarike se utilize karte hai, Iftikhar hai or jo bhi khelta hai middle order me. Hum jab unke number jis tarah se hai, run-a-ball bhi hai toh hum unko nahi bhejte. Saal me unki baari aati hai do, woh bhi aisi situation mein pariyaan dete hai ki. Aapne agar middle order ki batsmen khilaya hai toh bhai uska jo number hai usme aap kyun nahi bhej rahe usko,"" Misbah said on Hum Sport.Elaborating on the batting order decisions, Misbah questioned the rationale behind sending all-rounders ahead of Iftikhar on a challenging pitch in New York. He stressed that on such surfaces, where power hitting is less effective, situational assessment is crucial.""Simple si baat hai, Iftikhar agar khel raha hai, batsman woh hena. Imad [Wasim] ussey pahle gaya, uske baad Shadab [Khan] ussey pahle gaya and he was the last. Aap unko 7th number par bhej rahe hai, aur yeh throughout chal raha hai. Aisi pitch par jahaan aapko pata hai power hitting ki jarurat nahi hai. Situation ko assess karne ki jarurat hai,"" Misbah added.Misbah also criticized Pakistan's inability to learn from India's innings, where their power hitters struggled to score.""Aapne pahle innings dekh li India ki, once you have to score over run-a-ball aakhri 10 overs me woh bada mushkil hai. Humne isko 6 ya under 6 rakhna hai, iske uper le jaake, chahe unke paas jitne bhi damage karne wale batsmen ho - Hardik Pandya , jeetne bhi aaye [Shivam] Dube, unse nahi huwe hai runs. Hit nahi lag rahi thi. Toh hume ye sochna chahiye tha ki Iftikhar ko bacha ke rakhne ka kya faida. End me toh aapse hit nahi lagegi. Jahaan 6 ya 7 nahi ho raha, toh ek dafa 9-10 me le jayenge toh woh kya karega. Agar aapne bhejna hi tha, okay fine Shadab ko run-a-ball tha, pichle match me usne perform kiya huwa hai toh usko uper bhejte phir. Uske baad Iftikhar aata,"" Misbah said.He further questioned the decision to send Imad Wasim ahead of Iftikhar and criticized the team for playing fewer batters on a bowling-friendly pitch.""Imad ko bhej rahe hai, theek hai ki jao abhi normal khelna hai. Yeh pitch nahi hai ki jahaan end pe maarke aap poora kar logey. Usko left hander ke liye bheja aur woh left-hander ka hi poora over dot khel gaya. Basically, you are building pressure aur apne batsman ko woh confidence nahi de rahe hai. Phir toh baat simple si hai ki aap specialist teen batsmen se khel rahe hai, bowling pitch pe. India 6 batsmen ke saath khelke bhi 2 all-rounder khela rahe hai. Sochne ki baat hai ki mushkil pitch pe, jo batting ke liye mushkil hai, under pressure kaun hoga - batting hogi. Humne toh ulta batting resources hamare kam hai,"" Misbah concluded.The former captain's critique underscores the need for better tactical decisions and confidence in the batting order to optimize performance in crucial matches.",Former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq criticizes team management.

‘Bat vs bat’ bores Bumrah

NEW YORK: A day has gone by, but we are still in a bit of a daze. Under a brilliant Sunday sun in New York , India engineered a magnificent come-from-behind win against Pakistan that was one of their best in recent times.The win is, probably, at par with what the same bunch did against Pakistan in Melbourne in their T20 World Cup opener one-anda-half years ago.On that day it was the best batsman in modern cricket — Virat Kohli — who cornered all the glory. This time, it was down to India’s greatest match-winner with the ball, Jasprit Bumrah , who was not part of the 2022 team due to a career-threatening back injury.At one stage, the match was slipping out of India’s grasp. With Pakistan needing 40 off 36 balls and Mohammed Rizwan fighting it out, it seemed game over for Rohit Sharma’s men, until Bumrah (3/14) decided he wouldn’t let that happen.His last two overs — the 15th and the 19th of the innings — cost merely five runs as Pakistan choked in the chase of 119.“That third over of mine, if that had gone Pakistan’s way, the game would have gone in their favour. We were very happy that we pulled it off and I think at that moment the game shifted our way,” Bumrah said about the game-changing 15th over, in which he dismissed Rizwan.Bumrah was the leader of the pack, guiding the bowlers on how to go about things when things looked to be spiralling out of control. The pitch had quite a bit in it but the challenge was to not get carried away or try for the magic ball that could well be counter-productive.“We had to be accurate because if we go for magic deliveries and try to be too desperate, run-making could become easy because they knew the target. So, we had to be very mindful of not overdoing it and add up to the pressure by using the big boundaries. We were able to create that and everybody got wickets,” Bumrah said.While the 30-year-old was more than happy to share the accolades with his teammates, there is no denying that the paceman has been in the form of his life in the last few months across formats.He was brilliant in the ODI World Cup last year, followed it up with match-winning spells against England in Test matches on pitches that had nothing for the faster bowlers. In the IPL, where his team Mumbai Indians played some of their worst cricket, Bumrah was the lone standout, taking 20 wickets at an economy rate of 6.48. And now he has got two back-to-back 'Player of the Match' awards on the biggest stage.Is the paceman in the best phase of his career?A smiling Bumrah said, “A year ago, the same people were saying that I might not play again and my career is over and now the question has changed. I don’t look at it that way. For me it is about bowling at the best of my ability and trying to solve the problem that is there in front of me.”When the outside noise becomes too much, Bumrah believes in creating “a bubble” for himself and tries to “control the controllables”.“I know this ‘sticking to the process’ idea is a cliché, but all I try is trying to find the best option for myself. If I look at people and pressure, then emotion takes over and it doesn’t work for me. So, I create my own bubble and try to do my best,” the champion bowler said.The bowlers are enjoying a great run and Bumrah doesn’t mind that one bit.“Our country is a batsman-loving country but I feel it’s good that bowlers are coming to the fore. I enjoy it when there is a challenge between bat and ball. When it becomes bat versus bat, I switch off the TV,” Bumrah said.","Jasprit Bumrah has been in the form of his life in the last few months across formats.

However, they fell short in the 20th over, chasing a modest 114.With six needed off the last two balls, Mahmudullah was caught brilliantly by Aiden Markram near the ropes off Keshav Maharaj (3/27), who emerged as South Africa's most successful bowler.

NEW DELHI: India's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah couldn't help but laugh at the drastic shift in narratives about his career over the past year. Once doubted for his ability to return to form following a lower back stress fracture, Bumrah has now firmly reestablished himself as one of the world's leading fast bowlers.In 2022, Bumrah underwent surgery for a lower back stress fracture, causing him to miss the T20 World Cup in Australia.Just before his comeback, he suffered a strain, leading to an absence of more than ten months. This led to widespread skepticism about his capacity to manage the workload of playing in three formats.However, Bumrah has silenced his critics with his performances in the last one year.""See a year ago, the same people were saying that I might not play again and my career is over and then now the question changed,"" Bumrah said, addressing those who doubted his resilience and determination.Bumrah's return to form has been a masterclass in handling pressure and focusing on the controllables. ""I am not looking at whether I am bowling at the best of my ability. I try to solve the problem that is there in front of me,"" he explained. ""I know it's a cliched answer... but I was trying to focus on what is the best option over here on a wicket like this.""Avoiding external pressure has been key to his success. ""Because if I look at the outside noise, if I look at people and pressure and emotion takes over, then things don't really work for me,"" the 30-year-old said.Despite the challenges of the IPL, where bowlers faced tough conditions, Bumrah and the Indian bowling unit have adapted well to the T20 World Cup pitches. ""Obviously, the IPL that we played was not very bowler-friendly but we are very happy that we didn't come here with that baggage,"" Bumrah noted.Bumrah's deep understanding with captain Rohit Sharma , developed over years of playing together for Mumbai Indians , has been crucial. ""We were very clear the message in the huddle was that now that is over, what is next? What are the things that are in our control? So, we will try to focus on that and not to create panic,"" he said.In low-scoring matches, maintaining composure is essential. ""If we go for magic deliveries and try to be too desperate, run-making becomes easy and they know the target.

'Arrogance and recklessness': Sunil Gavaskar rips apart Indian batters after dismal show against Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/arrogance-and-recklessness-sunil-gavaskar-rips-apart-indian-batters-after-dismal-show-against-pakistan/articleshow/110853869.cms,"NEW DELHI: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar strongly criticised the Indian batters following their poor performance against arch-rivals Pakistan in the T20 World Cup game at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York.India experienced a mid-innings collapse on a two-paced track, managing a meager 119 against Pakistan on Sunday. Despite a valiant effort from Rishabh Pant , who scored a fortuitous 42 off 31 balls at the new number three spot, the rest of the star-studded line-up struggled to adapt to the challenging surface.Pakistan's bowlers, led by Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf with three wickets each, bowled out India with an over to spare. India's innings crumbled as they lost seven wickets for just 30 runs, falling from a solid 89 for 3 in the 12th over.The legendary cricketer expressed his disappointment over their lackluster display, calling it unacceptable. He highlighted the batsmen's inability to handle pressure and questioned their technique and shot selection.""Disappointing batting performance. It bordered on arrogance and recklessness, if I might use the word. Because there was arrogance at the start of the innings as well. They were looking to hit every ball. This is not an Ireland attack. This is not an ordinary bowling attack,"" Sunil Gavaskar said during the mid-innings interaction on Star Sports.Gavaskar emphasised that such performances are not up to the standards expected at the international level, urging the players to take responsibility and improve their game.""I don't mean any disrespect to Ireland, but Pakistan is a very, very experienced attack. It should have been just that little bit of respect given when the ball was doing a little bit.

Today was one of those days where the seamers were bowling well, we wanted to drag it to the end where anything could happen in the last over,"" he explained.Despite a challenging day with the bat, South Africa's innings was bolstered by a vital 79-run partnership between David Miller and Heinrich Klaasen , leading to a defendable score of 113/6.

They've gone back-to-back with crucial partnerships, and got us to a score that's lucky enough to win but still one we could defend.

NEW DELHI: Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti clarified on Monday that the Champions League winners would not refuse to play in next season's expanded Club World Cup, stating that his comments made to an Italian newspaper had been misinterpreted.""In my interview with Il Giornale, my words about the FIFA Club World Cup have not been interpreted in the way I intended,"" Ancelotti posted on X.""Nothing could be further from my interest than to reject the possibility of playing in a tournament that I consider to be a great opportunity to continue fighting for great titles with Real Madrid.""Ancelotti had been quoted in Monday's edition of Il Giornale saying that ""players and clubs will not participate"" in the new tournament.""A single Real Madrid match is worth 20 million euros and FIFA wants to give us this amount for the entire Cup,"" he is quoted as saying. ""So no. Like us, other clubs will refuse the invitation.""Real Madrid, the reigning champions of both La Liga and the UEFA Champions League , swiftly distanced themselves from Ancelotti's comments. The club, which secured its 15th European Cup and Champions League title last season under the Italian manager's guidance, sought to clarify its stance on the matter.""Real Madrid C.

NEW DELHI: A Spanish court has handed down prison sentences to a trio of Valencia supporters for their involvement in racist abuse directed at Real Madrid 's Vinicius Jr .The court's announcement revealed that the three individuals were given eight-month jail terms for committing hate crimes against the player. This landmark ruling marks the first time in Spain that anyone has been convicted for hurling racist insults within a football stadium.""The ruling handed down today, which is final, establishes as proven that the three defendants insulted Vinicius with shouts, gestures and chants referring to the colour of his skin,"" the court said in a statement.""These shouts and gestures of a racist nature, consisting among other things in the repetition of the sounds and imitating the movements of monkeys, caused the footballer feelings of frustration, shame and humiliation, with the consequent undermining of his intrinsic dignity.""In Spain, individuals who are convicted of non-violent offences and receive prison sentences shorter than two years are unlikely to serve time behind bars, provided they have no prior convictions.As a result, the trio is expected to remain out of custody unless they engage in additional criminal activities.The supporters, having admitted to the offences, were handed a two-year ban from attending football matches and were also required to cover the expenses associated with the legal proceedings.""This ruling is great news for the fight against racism in Spain as it repairs the damage suffered by Vinicius Jr and sends a clear message to those people who go to a football stadium to insult that LaLiga will identify them, report them and there will be criminal consequences for them,"" LaLiga president Javier Tebas said.In May previous year, a league match at Valencia's Mestalla stadium was marred by a disturbing incident. Vinicius, a Black Brazilian forward, was subjected to racist slurs throughout the game. The abhorrent behavior displayed by some individuals in the crowd was deeply troubling and unacceptable.The incident sparked a wave of support for Vinicius from various quarters. People from all walks of life came together to condemn the racist abuse and stand in solidarity with the young player. The outpouring of support was a testament to the collective desire to combat racism and promote equality in sports and society as a whole.""During the hearing, the defendants read a letter of apology to Vinicius Jr, LaLiga and Real Madrid,"" LaLiga said in a statement on Monday.Real Madrid said the defendants had shown repentance and, in their letter, had ""asked fans that all traces of racism and intolerance should be banished from sporting competitions.""""Real Madrid, which together with Vinicius Jr has acted as private prosecutor in these proceedings, will continue to work to protect the values of our club and to eradicate any racist behaviour in the world of football and sport,"" the club added in a statement.Vinicius, at the age of 23, played a crucial role in Real Madrid's successful campaign, securing both the LaLiga title and the Champions League trophy. His outstanding performance earned him the prestigious title of Champions League's player of the season.Additionally, he is considered a top contender for the Ballon d'Or award, which recognizes the world's best player and will be presented in October.Over the course of the last two seasons, LaLiga has reported a total of sixteen instances of racist abuse directed towards Vinicius to Spanish prosecutors.""In March, Vinicius broke down in tears at a press conference and said he was struggling to stay motivated and enjoy playing football due to the recurring abuse, urging Spanish authorities to take action.""""People should know that this type of act is punishable, punishable as a hate crime, because the conviction is for crimes against moral integrity but with the aggravating circumstance of hatred,"" state prosecutor Susana Gisbert told reporters.In a recent incident, German Burgos, an analyst for the Spanish television network Movistar Plus+, was dismissed from his position. This decision came after both Barcelona and Paris St Germain declined to provide interviews to the network, following a remark made by Burgos about Lamine Yamal, a Barcelona player. The comment was perceived as racist in nature.During the same month, LaLiga took action against Atletico Madrid and Getafe, mandating partial closures of their stadiums. This disciplinary measure was in response to incidents of racist and xenophobic abuse that occurred during a match between the two teams.Additionally, a third-division encounter between Rayo Majadahonda and Sestao River was halted when Cheikh Kane Sarr, the Senegalese goalkeeper for Rayo, confronted an opposing fan who he accused of subjecting him to racial abuse.",A Spanish court has handed down prison sentences to a trio of Valencia supporters for their involvement in racist abuse directed at Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr. The three individuals were given eight-month jail terms for committing hate crimes against the player.

KOLKATA: With his hands on the hip, Sunil Chhetri stood a little distance away from the pack of his teammates in the middle of the park. He stood motionless, as if dazed, for a few seconds, his eyes blank and without expression.

A few minutes ago, Chinese referee Fu Ming had blown the whistle to seal India's goalless draw with Kuwait in their second-round fixture of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, thus ringing the curtain on Chhetri's 19-year-old career in the Blue Tigers jersey.

Suddenly the Salt Lake Stadium stands roared into ""Chhetri, Chhteri"" chants, stirring the 39-year-old out of his trance as he was given a standing ovation He began a lap of honour around the ground. Then he broke down in tears as his teammates, coach Igor Stimac and his coaching staff members lined up to give him the guard of honour. After plethora of hugs and handshakes, he slowly walked down the tunnel, out of everyone's sight and into a new life, leaving behind a legacy Indian football has hardly experienced.

The build-up to Thursday's match was all about Chhetri's send-off. Before the kick-off, the famed Blue Pilgrims stand behind the goalpost unfurled a giant tifo, showing Chhetri holding the earth, a la Hercules. India failed to turn the occasion more memorable and meaningful for Chhetri following the stalemate but that tifo perhaps represents what Chhetri has stood for in Indian football in nearly two decades since making his senior de but against Pakistan in 2005.

He will be remembered as the defining player of his generation, someone who has transcended his sport more than any other, a reference point in Indian football in the true sense of the term.

Unlike IM Vijayan, he might not have an eye for the spectacular. Unlike Bhaichung Bhutia, he might not be a typical fox in the box. Chhetri's game has always been a fable of discipline, dedication and determination.

His goals were cheeky, audacious and brilliant - scoring from midfield to embarrassing the goalkeeper with a Panenka penalty. He made people fall in love with the game.

In a later post-match felicitation, organized by the Indian Football Association, he returned to the ground to receive accolades from the Big 3 clubs - East Bengal , Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting as well as the state government. A few former players like Vijayan, Mehtab Hossain, Alvito D'Cunha and Rahim Nabi then gave him a tight embrace one by one.

as India fluff their lines in must-win tie against Kuwait

KOLKATA: Goodbye Sunil Chhetri. But not a welcome yet for India to a dream place in the third round of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers .India failed to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac 's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. As the tearful Chhetri left the international football stage after 151 caps and 94 goals and failing to make an impact in Thursday's game, India's chances of qualifying to the next round now hang in balance.With 5 points from as many matches, and both Afghanistan (4 points from 4 games) and Kuwait (4 points from 5 games) lurking close by, the Blue Tigers now have to beat the already qualified Qatar in their own den in the final Group A fixture next Tuesday to keep hopes alive.A top-two finish in the group is the prerequisite not only for opening the door for brushing shoulders with Asia's best in the third round of World Cup qualifiers, but also guaranteeing a berth in the next edition of Asian Cup .With stakes so high, it felt like a juncture match for Igor Stimac's side. Chhetri's farewell - which drew an official attendance of 58,921 in the stands - further elevated the sense of the occasion.But India never looked in sync with the challenge in question, dishing out another frustrating performance nearly three months after losing 1-2 to Afghanistan in Guwahati and making their job more difficult now.In fact, had Gurpreet Singh Sandhu not effected a string of saves, it could have been quite embarrassing for Chhetri and his team.Stimac started with a new and bold defensive set-up, giving FC Goa left-back Jay Gupta his debut in Blue Tigers jersey and pairing up Rahul Bheke with Anwar Ali in the heart of defence in absence of injured Sandesh Jhingan.But if the Croatian coach's 4-2-3-1 formation was meant to gain early ascendancy, it failed to instil the sort of organisation and obduracy that he would have expected to characterise his backline. The result was a streak of nervy moments invading the home team's play.The match was just four minutes old when Bheke failed to intercept a pass, allowing Mohammad Abdulah to stare at the goal with a world of time and space. But Kuwait's No. 9 ended up hitting straight at Gurpreet.Relieved and reprieved, India tried to make a statement, Liston Colaco seeing his cutback cleared by Kuwait defender Hasan Alanezi for a corner and Chhetri skying an attempt way over the bar.Just when India appeared to have started to establish a more recognisable rhythm, Kuwait shook the hosts out of a false dawn, threatening to upset the applecart.",India fail to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: England's manager Gareth Southgate has decided not to include left defender Harry Maguire and midfielder Jack Grealish in the 26-man squad for the upcoming European Championship. This decision comes as part of the team's strategic preparation for the tournament.Maguire, with a substantial experience of 63 international caps and a key player for Manchester United , was notably absent from the list due to selection criteria that also saw Manchester City 's Grealish, who has 36 caps for England, left out. Despite their considerable contributions to their respective clubs, their exclusion highlights the competitive nature of the selection process and the depth of talent available to the national team.The squad announced by Southgate features a robust attacking lineup, including Jude Bellingham , whose recent success with Real Madrid in the Champions League has been remarkable, and Harry Kane of Bayern Munich. Phil Foden , recognized for his exceptional season with Manchester City, and Bukayo Saka from Arsenal, are also among the key players expected to lead England's offensive efforts. These selections underscore the blend of youth and experience within the team, aiming to capitalize on dynamic and impactful performances.Injuries have played a role in shaping the defensive selections for the squad.Despite Maguire's exclusion, his Manchester United teammate Luke Shaw has been included, although he is currently managing injury concerns and did not participate in the team's training session ahead of the friendly match against Iceland at Wembley. This indicates the strategic considerations made by Southgate in balancing current form, fitness levels, and the potential impact of players on the team's performance.Additionally, the squad features 12 players who are yet to gain experience in major international tournaments, including Lewis Dunk, Joe Gomez, Marc Guehi, Ezri Konsa, and others. This inclusion is indicative of England's forward-looking approach, aiming to integrate emerging talents and provide them with the platform to gain valuable experience at the highest level of competition.Other players not making the squad this time are James Maddison, Jarrad Branthwaite, James Trafford, Curtis Jones, and Jarrell Quansah, highlighting the depth of talent available and the tough decisions involved in squad selection.England are set to commence their Euro 2024 campaign against Serbia on June 16, with the squad selections reflecting a strategic mix of experience, current form, and potential, as they aim to navigate the challenges of the tournament.Dean Henderson, Jordan Pickford, Aaron RamsdaleLewis Dunk, Joe Gomez, Marc Guehi, Ezri Konsa, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Kieran Trippier, Kyle WalkerTrent Alexander-Arnold, Conor Gallagher, Kobbie Mainoo, Declan Rice, Adam WhartonJude Bellingham, Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze, Phil Foden, Anthony Gordon, Harry Kane, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka, Ivan Toney, Ollie Watkins","England manager Gareth Southgate has named his 26-man squad for Euro 2024.

NEW DELHI: India's 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Kuwait ended in a disappointing goalless draw, failing to provide a fitting farewell for the talismanic Sunil Chhetri in his last international match.The result leaves India in a challenging position to progress to the third round of the qualifiers, with only five points collected so far. India's final match is against Asian champions Qatar on June 11, while Kuwait, with four points, will face Afghanistan on the same day.Chhetri's international career spans an impressive 19 years, during which he scored 94 goals, making him the fourth most prolific scorer in international football, behind Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (128), Iran legend Ali Daei (108) and Argentine wizard Lionel Messi (106).This remarkable achievement is particularly noteworthy for a player from a country like India, and FIFA recognised Chhetri's legendary status upon his announcement of international retirement on May 16.Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium, with a capacity of 68,000, was packed with fans, officials, and former players who came to bid an emotional adieu to Chhetri.His parents, Kharga and Sushila, and wife, Sonam Bhattacharya, were also in attendance.

The first half was action-packed, with both teams creating chances but failing to find the back of the net.The crowd remained engaged, chanting ""Sunil, Sunil"" and ""Vande Mataram"" throughout the match.Kuwait's best chance in the first half came in the fourth minute when Eid Al-Rashidi set up Daham with a perfect through ball. However, Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu made a crucial save to deny Mohammad Daham.India responded in the 11th minute with Liston Colaco's low cross, but Hasan Alanezi's sliding clearance prevented Chhetri from scoring his 95th goal.Debutant Jay Gupta was involved in the action, delivering a sublime low cross from the left in the 25th minute, but the Kuwait defense cleared it for a corner. India failed to capitalize on a freekick in the 28th minute, despite Poojary's impressive run and nutmeg.At the halfway mark, Thapa sent a fantastic ball into the box, which Kuwait cleared to deny Sahal Abdul Samad. The rebound fell to Liston Colaco, who fired a low strike into the side netting from a narrow angle.In the second half, Igor Stimac made changes to India's attacking lineup, introducing Rahim Ali, Brandon Fernandes, and Chheri. However, the desired result was not achieved, as Rahim failed to convert his chances.Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute when they were denied a penalty claim, leading to a confrontation between players and bench.Replays suggested a foul, but the referee deemed otherwise. Tempers flared up after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, resulting in a mini-brawl and yellow cards for both Edmund and Sultan Alenezi.Despite the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' poor delivery meant India's last hope for a win disappeared in the added seven minutes.Stimac handed left-back Gupta his international debut in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Chhetri as the sole striker.
