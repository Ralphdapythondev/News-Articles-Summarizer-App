Vandersay then delivered a spectacular performance, taking 6 wickets for 33 runs, which stifled India's chase and secured a memorable 32-run victory for Sri Lanka at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.Since making his debut in December 2015, Vandersay has featured in 22 ODIs, often finding himself in and out of the team.However, in Sunday’s match, he emerged as the hero, dismissing Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, Shivam Dube, Virat Kohli , Shreyas Iyer, and KL Rahul in just 29 balls. His efforts earned him the seventh-best figures by a Sri Lankan bowler in ODIs and gave Sri Lanka a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Vandersay, named Man of the Match, attributed his confidence to the dismissal of Rohit Sharma.“There was some assistance from the wicket, so I focused on hitting the right areas and sticking to the basics. This was my first game in a while, so I knew I needed to bowl accurately,"" Vandersay said after Sri Lanka won the match.“Once I took the first wicket (Rohit), my confidence grew. I continued to bowl in the right areas and, with a bit of luck, managed to secure six wickets,” he added after receiving the Player of the Match award.The third and final ODI will be played on Wednesday at the same venue.India had previously won the T20I series 3-0 under the captaincy of Suryakumar Yadav.",Sri Lanka beat India by 32 runs in second ODI.

Jeffrey Vandersay grabs six as Sri Lanka sink India in second ODI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/jeffrey-vandersay-grabs-six-as-sri-lanka-sink-india-in-second-odi/articleshow/112269362.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka secured a notable 32-run victory over India, thanks in large part to Jeffrey Vandersay 's exceptional performance in the second ODI in Colombo on Sunday. The leg-spinner's six-wicket haul for just 33 runs played a crucial role in dismantling the Indian batting lineup, ultimately leading Sri Lanka to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, following a tied opening game.The match saw India chasing a target of 241 on a pitch that was conducive to spin bowling.Despite a promising start, India were bowled out for 208 in 42.2 overs.Rohit Sharma 's aggressive 64 off 44 balls, featuring five fours and four sixes, initially set a strong foundation for India. Alongside Shubman Gill, who contributed a steady 35, the pair propelled India to 97 for one in just 13.3 overs.However, the dismissal of Sharma, caught off a reverse sweep by Vandersay, marked the beginning of a dramatic collapse for the Indian batting order.From a comfortable 97 for one, India's situation quickly deteriorated to 147 for six, losing six wickets for just 50 runs within a span of 10 overs.Vandersay, stepping in for the injured Wanindu Hasaranga , was the architect of this collapse, effectively exploiting the conditions and the Indian batsmen's vulnerabilities. Notable dismissals included Shivam Dube , Virat Kohli , and Shreyas Iyer , all falling to Vandersay's spin, highlighting the challenges posed by the pitch.Despite the top-order collapse, Axar Patel attempted a counter-attack with a resilient 44 off 44 balls, including a brief partnership with Washington Sundar .However, his effort was cut short when he was caught off the bowling of Charith Asalanka, concluding any realistic chance of an Indian comeback.Earlier in the day, Sri Lanka's batting effort was characterized by a challenging start against India's spinners, particularly Washington Sundar, who finished with figures of 3/30. Kuldeep Yadav also contributed with 2/33, applying pressure on the Sri Lankan batters.Despite struggling at 136 for six, a crucial 72-run partnership between Dunith Wellalage and Kamindu Mendis provided the hosts with a competitive total of 240 for nine. This partnership, alongside some late-order hitting, allowed Sri Lanka to post a challenging total on a difficult pitch.",Sri Lanka beat India by 32 runs in the second ODI in Colombo.

"Lovlina Borgohain exits arena, but not without a fight at Paris Olympics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/lovlina-borgohain-exits-arena-but-not-without-a-fight-at-paris-olympics/articleshow/112275751.cms,"PARIS: Lovlina Borgohain entered the arena with a smile, and with a strange, awkward looking sway to the music almost as if she was willing herself to be in the zone that was required of her. She smiled through almost all of her bout with old foe Li Qian , showing even through the exaggerated pouts that mouth guards give boxers - once even offering to help pick up the Chinese when the double Olympic medallist and the world No 1 found herself on the floor during a second round brawl.The last Indian boxer in the fray here, was she not aware of the task ahead of her in Paris? Or was appearing blissfully oblivious her way of deflecting all things mental in boxing?Maybe, that is how she is made. Is Lovlina too much of a nice guy in this grab and smash world of Olympic women's boxing ? It was an aspect that she may have perhaps needed to conceal, disguise in this high stakes bout with Qian, one that would grant her entry to the Roland Garros venue as a semifinalist in the women's 75kg, and ensure her of a medal, her second at the Olympics.Because at some level there was disappointment too, and overnight anger. Disappointment because Lovlina was the last of the Indian boxers here in Paris, after a shrill campaign that had promised much but unfortunately delivered little. And anger from overnight, because many in the Indian camp felt that late evening fighter, Nishant Dev was robbed of a genuine win against Mexico's Marco Alvarez in the strangest of split decisions in Saturday's men's 71kg quarterfinals, after he had taken the lead in the first round and had looked the better puncher in the final third.Lovlina entered the ring with a smile, but left with a little tear in her eye. Because, it would go in similar fashion on Sunday morning as well, the Indian being edged out in a 4-1 split decision in a close fight to a familiar foe.The bout began with Lovlina needing to stay out of the Chinese's reach, not get too close and get ensnared in a scrap which would allow Qian employ her clinching tactics. But just the reverse happened. Lovlina was drawn into the fight at the level and nature that Qian would have liked, the holding and clinching ensued leaving Lovlina having to drag herself from it. Still, it was a close verdict - 3-2 - in the Chinese boxer's favour.Realising that she may have a chance if she reverted to her type, Lovlina began Round Two in just that way. Like she did with her easy-looking manner in the last bout against Norway's Sunniva Hofstad , Lovlina kept away forcing Qian to charge. The taking over of momentum worked, as Lovlina seemed much more in control, dictating the fight her way.It was the best round of boxing of the bout with the two gangly 75 kg boxers sizing each other up, parrying and trading punches. It was again 3-2 in favour of Qian, but a much-improved show from Lovlina - two of the judges who had ruled in favour of Qian in the first round choosing to award the Indian here. It gave much hope for the final three minutes, where maybe there lay in store, a semifinal entry for Lovlina, and her own second Olympic medal.She had to fight to recover, to draw level and to take the lead. In the third then, dropping her defences Lovlina waded in, in an attempt to turn the tide but Qian was more than prepared. Trailing after the first round has afflicted the Indian boxers here in Paris, leaving them with having to do the rallying in the second and fight for parity and hope for an inch-close win off the final. More often than not that will not work at this highest level of competition, and certainly not for India at Paris here.","Lovlina Borgohain beaten 4-1 by China's Li Qian in women's 75kg quarterfinal.

How Lakshya Sen lost the semifinal against Victor Axelsen at Paris Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/how-lakshya-sen-lost-the-semifinal-against-victor-axelsen-at-paris-olympics/articleshow/112275449.cms,"Indian shuttler throws away opportunities to lose semifinal, will now play World No. 7 Jia for bronze

PARIS: ""The real test begins now,"" Lakshya Sen had said on Friday evening after making the semifinals of the men's singles. The Indian shuttler found out that it was indeed real, and mentally bruising, at the Porte de la Chapelle arena on Sunday. The 22-year-old was up against world's No.2 Victor Axelsen of Denmark. World champion, defending champion, towering over his rival at six feet four, the 30-year-old Dane was a formidable, intimidating opponent.Sen knew that. He had won just one in eight encounters against the Dane before this and taken just three games off him.But the Indian was fearless when he went in there. He gave it his all, left his heart out there on the court. He walked away with several unanswered questions ringing in his head. He had lost 20-22, 14-21 and it would take time to sink in.Sen was in control of the first game. After fighting with all his skills and courage, he had the Dane cornered, having scored six points in that game at one stage to go up 17-11. He finally had three game points in his hands. 20-17. He had to go for the kill. Something snapped. He lost it there.Sen was probably thinking too much, too hard. He made a service error. You don't do that against a player who has often come back from the dead in hostile arenas across the world. This was the lifelineAxelsen needed. He could see that the Indian across the net was nervous. It was his turn to go for the kill. Axelsen drove the knife in hard, taking the game at 22-20, reeling off five straight points.The tone of the contest was set. Or was it? Sen returned to serve in the second game and looked unaffected as he scored seven straight points. 7-0. This was unreal. Axelsen looked a bit unsettled as he kept making unforced errors, sending his returns long or wide. Sen was cruising. He served well, returned well, had a couple of delectable drop shots and a few smash hits too.But the fans in Sen's corner were probably thinking too far ahead. Probably so was Sen. Axelsen being a champion of comebacks, got a foot in the door when a Sen return went wide. Down 1-7, the Dane slowly started catching up.Sen was the better player at the net throughout the contest. He kept trying to draw his tall rival in with his drop shots. The Indian won some crucial points at the net and his experienced rival realised that he needed a change in strategy. Instead of playing the drop shot contest, he hit out long and took control from the backcourt. From there came the half smash, the flick and the stinging powerful smash.Axelsen caught up with Sen at 10-10 with his trademark smash. Lakshya stayed in the game till 12-12 and then suddenly lost rhythm. He was losing control. Axelsen sensed it and knew just what to do. Suddenly, he looked to be in a hurry. He smashed at will, hard and brutal. Sen had no more answers. He kept making unforced errors and threw in the towel.After the match, Axelsen admitted that Sen played better on the day. ""He could have won today. Four years down the line he will be a better player, I am sure,"" he said.So, what was he thinking when he was down 17-20 in the first game? ""I tried not to think. I was blank. He thought a lot. It is natural. He got nervous and I had to strike. He made mistakes due to his nerves. My experience helped me.""When asked about Sen's game, Axelsen said: ""He played better than me. But I won it here,"" he said, pointing to his head.And what was his weapon against the Indian? ""Good badminton ,"" said the Dane with a smile as he walked away.And what did Sen think of the missed opportunity. ""I should have won the first game. Overall, it was a good match, and I am already looking ahead,"" he said, not wanting to speak about the bitter defeat.""I have to learn to be a bit more patient. I made errors but honestly, I played what I thought was the best in that situation on the court. There are many lessons for me from this match. But there is no time to think about them now. I have to forget this and the earlier matches,"" he said.He will be back on the court on Monday. He still has a date to keep - the bronze match against World No. 7 Lee Zii Jia of Malaysia.","Lakshya Sen loses 20-22, 14-21 to world No.2 Victor Axelsen of Denmark. Sen will now play World No. 7 Jia Jia of Malaysia for bronze. Sen had won just one in eight encounters against the Dane before this.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112275379,imgsize-78932,width-400,resizemode-4/112275379.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Indian men's hockey team delivered an outstanding performance to secure a spot in the Olympic semifinals for the second time in a row while Lakshya Sen 's dreams of gold medal shifted to a potential bronze on a mixed-result day for India at the Paris Games.India's 53rd position in the medal tally did not improve on Sunday as no new medals were added but the hockey team's incredible shoot-out win over Great Britain turned out to be the highlight of the day.India's current tally includes bronze medals, all in shooting events -- from the women's 10m air pistol, 10m air pistol mixed team, and men's 50m rifle three positions.In boxing, Lovlina Borgohain, a bronze medalist in the welterweight category at the Tokyo Games, faced disappointment. Borgohain lost in the quarterfinals to Chinese veteran Li Qian in the women's middleweight (75kg) category.Lakshya Sen also faced a setback in his bid for gold, losing 20-22, 14-21 to defending champion Viktor Axelsen.However, Sen has another chance for a medal as he will compete against Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in the bronze playoff scheduled for Monday evening.Despite the challenges, the Indian contingent had a reason to rejoice.

Both boxers received repeated cautions for clinching and holding during the contest.India was represented by a six-member boxing contingent at the Games, consisting of four women and two men. Four of these boxers were eliminated in the preliminary stages.India's pursuit of a historic first Olympic gold in badminton was dashed when Lakshya Sen lost to Viktor Axelsen in the men's singles semifinals.The 22-year-old Sen, who previously won a bronze at the World Championships, could not hold onto his early leads in either game of the 54-minute match against the two-time world champion.Sen initially had a three-point advantage in the first game and followed with a 7-0 lead in the second game.Despite the promising starts, he ultimately succumbed to Axelsen's prowess, leaving the dream unfulfilled.India is yet to clinch an Olympic gold in badminton.PV Sindhu won a silver and bronze in the 2016 Rio and 2020 Tokyo Olympics , respectively, while Saina Nehwal secured a bronze at the 2012 London Games.Shooters Vijayveer Sidhu and Anish Bhanwala put up commendable performances in the qualifications of the 25m rapid fire men's pistol event in Chateauroux but fell short of making it to the finals.Vijayveer and Anish displayed brilliant shooting skills over the two stages of qualification.They remained strong contenders until the final 10 shots of the second rapid-fire stage.However, they shot scores of 92 and 93, finishing in ninth and 13th places respectively.

Rashid Khan keeps moving from one T20 league to another around the globe and the bowling all-rounder from Afghanistan continues to expand the array of his shots, which saw an astonishing ' helicopter shot ' on the off-side for a six in a match of ' The Hundred ' in England.The helicopter shot -- an aerial whip from the off and middle stump to a delivery pitched up -- was made famous by former India captain MS Dhoni, who is known to have invented it during his heydays.But batsmen across the world, especially Afghanistan captain Rashid, continue to evolve it and take it to a different level.It's easier for the bottom hand on the bat handle to rotate the wrist inward and hit the ball on the on-side. But to make your wrist do that in the opposite direction and still put the same power into the shot is almost unthinkable, but Rashid did it.That's why almost every helicopter shot ends up somewhere between deep mid-wicket and long-on. But Rashid's helicopter landed over long-off.Batting for Trent Rockets in the unique 100-balls-a-side format in England, called 'The Hundred', Rashid's solitary six during his 8-ball 13 against Welsh Fire made jaws drop.Last month, playing in the Major League Cricket for MI New York, Rashid pulled off a helicopter shot with horizontal bat, which was also a never-seen-before version of it.",Afghanistan's Rashid Khan pulls off a helicopter shot on the off-side for a six in a match of'The Hundred'in England.

Receiving a pass at the top of the box between two defenders, Haaland deftly flicked in a left-footed shot, giving City an imposing 4-0 lead a mere 25 seconds after the restart.Chelsea managed to pull one back through Raheem Sterling in the 59th minute, and Noni Madueke added a consolation goal in the 89th minute, but their efforts proved insufficient to mount a meaningful comeback against the dominant Manchester City side.",Erling Haaland scored a hat trick in Manchester City's 4-2 victory over Chelsea.

Will 'Skeleton bone test' be able to end the age fraud menace in Indian grassroots football?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-skeleton-bone-test-be-able-to-end-the-age-fraud-menace-in-indian-grassroots-football/articleshow/112229085.cms,"What is a skeleton bone test?

NEW DELHI: If you google "" age fraud in Indian football "", you'll find countless entries, articles, short-form, long-form, evidence-driven ones, written by countless writers, journalists, and observers of the beautiful game of football.One can find the news of the Indian under-15 football team's captain turning out to be almost eighteen months over the age limit for the Asian under-16 championship in April 2019 or an under-17 player initially rejected by coach Nicolai Adam for his ""unnatural height"" at age 14 was later accepted into the team under Luis Norton de Matos, everything is already so well-documented.While age fraud remains a persistent issue in Indian football, we should now be looking for a more permanent and accurate solution to fight it.And it should begin early, from the grassroots level of Indian football, like the Subroto Cup , an annual school football tournament held in India, named after Subroto Mukerjee, the founder of the Air India Football Club. The prestigious tournament, established in 1960, was once graced by players like Baichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri and will enter its 63rd edition on August 5.Aimed at promoting the sport at the grassroots level, it will host a jaw-dropping 111 teams across three categories, with the sub-junior (under-15) category introduced for the first time this year. It will also have some teams from foreign countries too.To fight the demon of age fraud, the organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament, offering a promising solution to address this issue effectively.During the opening press conference of the Subroto Cup, TimesofIndia.com raised concerns about age fraud. Answering, an Air Force Sports Control Board (AFSCB) spokesperson stated, ""All and every footballer (who will be participating in the Subroto Cup) is registered on the AIFF website. And each of them gets a unique code. We also want to avoid age fraud. As per the AIFF guidelines, a skeleton bone test will be done for the under-15 boys category. For the under-17 category, it will be normal medical. The skeleton bone test or the age-detection test will all be done under the guidelines of AIFF.""The skeleton bone test, commonly known as a bone age assessment, estimates a person's age, especially in children and adolescents, by analyzing their bones.This process typically involves taking an X-ray of the left hand and wrist, as this area contains bones that undergo predictable developmental changes with age. The X-ray is then compared to standard reference images, such as those in the Greulich-Pyle Atlas, to determine the bone's developmental stage, including the appearance of growth plates and the fusion of epiphyses.It is understood that 22 teams in the under-14 category were disqualified and did not participate in the Subroto Cup after failing the age-determination test last time. According to AIFF guidelines, if four or more players from a team are found to be over-aged, that team will be immediately disqualified and barred from the tournament.""Apart from that, all the players who have already registered through AIFF and CRS (central registration system), have their age verified. The people who are coming are less in numbers. So, in times to come, age fraud, which is prevalent in football, is likely to reduce,"" he ended on a positive note, sounding hopeful, as we all are, of a better future.","The Subroto Cup is an annual school football tournament held in India.
