PUNE: A Test match loss at home is a rarity in Indian cricket. The defeat in the first Test to the Kiwis will have an impact on how the Indian team management goes about its task ahead of the second Test in Pune starting on Thursday.""India won't be bogged down after their defeat in Bengaluru despite getting all out for 46,"" said former India opener and former women's team coach WV Raman. ""This team has shown that it can bounce back quickly. They will continue to play aggressive cricket.""A change in the playing XI will be almost forced for the second Test. Not just because India are trailing and the Gahunje pitch is likely to be different than Bengaluru's, but also due to the Shubman Gill factor. The 25-year-old top-order batter is expected to be fit and available for the Test. And if India are to continue with the five batters, 'keeper and five specialist bowlers' combination, the axe will have to fall on KL Rahul after Sarfaraz Khan 's belligerent 150.""It's a good headache to have,"" said Raman. ""A young man (Sarfaraz) doing well at the start of his international career is always a good sign."" Though Raman said that India should look at ""one thing at a time"" (implying winning this Test and levelling the series), he also added that if India are looking at Rahul as a crucial member on the tour to Australia, he should be given some game time. ""He is a capable batter, who needs to get his form and confidence back.""This was always going to be a bilateral series with multiple layers. India need to keep an eye on the World Test Championship (WTC) table and Australia series. And they must manage the workload of Rishabh Pant and Jasprit Bumrah.Skipper Rohit Sharma has already hinted at the need to be extra careful with Pant, who did not keep wickets in the first Test but contributed a vital 99 with the bat. Will the management risk him in Pune?India adding Washington Sundar - a left-handed batter and off-spinner - to the squad has added to the intrigue. But he gets a look-in only at the expense of either offie R Ashwin or left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, especially if both Pant and Rahul are not in the XI.Sundar (152 and 6/88 in both innings against Delhi in the Ranji Trophy) will boost the middle order and add flexibility. And we have not discussed left-arm finger spinner Axar Patel yet.Raman said, ""I look at Sundar as a batting allrounder. One way to play him is by asking him to open the innings."" But resting Yashasvi Jaiswal at this juncture may not make any sense.Giving Akash Deep a go in place of below-par Mohammed Siraj may look like a desperate act. But it has long-term gains considering the question mark over Mohammed Shami's availability for the tour Down Under. If Akash Deep is going to play as a third pacer in Australia, he would need game time too.The Bengaluru defeat means Bumrah cannot be rested now to give both Siraj and Akash game time together. Pant's 99 came after taking injections.While India wait for Rishabh Pant to recover from the knee injury, TOI has learnt that the wicketkeeper had taken injections on his knee to bat in the second innings of the Bengaluru Test.However, BCCI's medical team is confident he will be ready to keep wickets in the second Test in Pune starting Thursday.""He was in some pain after getting hit on the right knee during New Zealand's first innings. He was given injections. The limp while running between the wickets came from numbness in the affected region. He just has a bruise now and should be fit in a day or two,"" a BCCI source told TOI.",Rishabh Pant is expected to be fit and available for the second Test in Pune. Dhruv Jurel will replace KL Rahul in the playing XI if Pant is rested. Washington Sundar will replace Kuldeep Yadav if Pant and Rahul are not in the XI.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114444203,imgsize-52856,width-400,resizemode-4/114444203.jpg"

Two balls for only first 25 overs in ODI matches

ICC chairman's tenure increased to three years

NEW DELHI: In its bid to promote Test and ODI formats , the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) has come up with key recommendations which could see every World Test Championship (WTC) series having minimum three Tests, and two balls being used for only the first 25 overs in ODIs.TOI has learnt that the ICC's cricket committee came up with these suggestions recently at the board meetings in Dubai.The committee has also suggested that host nations must try to accommodate more day-night Test matches when drawing fixtures for home season in the next cycle.Sources said ICC strongly feels that there should be a minimum of three Tests if a series is played in the WTC from the next cycle.""Some countries like South Africa, New Zealand and Sri Lanka mostly play just two Test series . Only India, England and Australia play long Test series. That doesn't help in promoting Test cricket and the point distribution becomes very unfair. The recommendations are targeted at wiping out such disparities,"" an ICC source told TOI.The ICC cricket committee is headed by former India captain Sourav Ganguly and also consists of former players Mahela Jayawardena, VVS Laxman , Shaun Pollock, Daniel Vettori and Roger Harper besides BCCI secretary and soon-to-be ICC chairman Jay Shah As for day-night Tests, Cricket Australia is the only board which hosts pink-ball Tests regularly during its home season. BCCI has not hosted a pink-ball Test in two years.""The ICC committee feels the pink-ball Tests have brought more people into the stadiums. Recently, one saw very poor turnouts in Pakistan. The three pink-ball Tests in India sold more tickets than usual. Test-playing nations must be encouraged to schedule more pink-ball Tests,"" the source said.Another suggestion has been to have two balls only for the first 25 overs of ODIs. After that only one ball will be used. It has been widely debated that playing with two balls in ODIs has taken bowlers out of the game in the last decade as the balls remain hard for the batters to keep hitting through the line.""The recommendation will be sent to the captains. A consensus must be achieved on this. But this looks the best option to bring reverse swing and finger spinners back into the game,"" the source said.In a major development, the ICC board has decided to change the tenure of ICC chair and independent director to two terms of three years from two-year tenures.That means Shah, who is slated to take over as ICC chair, can hold the post for six years. Shah is slated to go into mandatory cooling-off period in BCCI next year.",ICC's cricket committee came up with these suggestions recently at the board meetings in Dubai.

PUNE: After Pune was awarded a Test match against New Zealand , a recce team from the BCCI came calling to check the facilities at the Gahunje stadium .""Keep the grass on the pitch,"" was one of the instructions. Now, after the defeat in the first Test in Bengaluru, the tone of the message has slightly changed - ensure that the pitch will help spinners too.With no Mohammed Shami and a struggling Mohammed Siraj in the ranks, India are not in a position to beat NZ with only pace, unless Bumrah comes up with magical spells.And if the wicket is too spin friendly, it can backfire too.The authorities are understandably tight-lipped about the instructions coming from the Indian camp and no one was willing to speak on record about it. It is learnt that the BCCI curator has taken the charge of the pitch. Local curators are loath to share much information on the nature of the track.The stakeholders are aware that the nature of the pitch cannot be changed dramatically in a short time. With Pune hosting only two Tests so far - Australia winning in three days in 2017 and the hosts beating South Africa in four days in 2019 - there is not much of history.Sachin Muley, the MCA apex council member who looks after the infrastructure, said the pitch will be ""positive"".The Gahunje pitch - used for white-ball internationals and IPL - has always offered something for the bowlers.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has voiced his disappointment over a heated on-field incident between Pakistan A ’s Sufiyan Muqeem and India A ’s opener Abhishek Sharma during the ACC Men's T20 Emerging Teams Asia Cup 2024.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit criticized Muqeem’s behaviour, emphasizing that young cricketers need to learn sportsmanship and respect for opponents.“The cricket was top-class, but one thing that really upset me was the incident involving Sufiyan Muqeem and Abhishek Sharma. If I were sitting in the dugout or the team manager, I would have told Sufiyan, ‘Son, pick up your things and go back.’ You haven’t even played proper cricket for Pakistan yet, and you’re already using abusive language—what kind of behaviour is this?” Basit said.Referring to Muqeem’s send-off gesture after dismissing Abhishek Sharma, Basit added, “You’re hurling abuses—did you take a hat-trick or something? (Aap gaaliyan de rahe hai, kya aapne hat-trick leliya?) You’re not at that level yet. The management needs to teach young players how to respect the opposition.”The controversial moment occurred during a tense clash between India A and Pakistan A at Al Amerat.Abhishek Sharma had gotten off to a flying start, scoring 35 off 22 balls, with five boundaries and two sixes. However, his innings came to an end in the sixth over when he mistimed a shot off Muqeem’s bowling, leading to a sharp catch by Qasim Akram.After the dismissal, Muqeem made a “silence gesture” toward Abhishek, which infuriated the Indian opener, leading to a heated exchange. Umpires Chamara de Zoysa and Rahul Asher had to step in to restore order.Despite the tension, India A held their nerve to secure a narrow 7-run win, posting 183/8 and restricting Pakistan A to 176/7.",Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has voiced his disappointment over a heated on-field incident between Pakistan A's Sufiyan Muqeem and India A's Abhishek Sharma.

NEW DELHI: After India's first Test loss to New Zealand in Bengaluru, former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar questioned captain Rohit Sharma 's tactical choices.After New Zealand added 137 vital runs for the eighth wicket in their first innings, Rohit came under heavy fire for his captaincy. On the fifth day of the contest, the criticism persisted.Only after 10 runs had been scored did Rohit decide to bring on Ravichandran Ashwin , India's most effective bowler at home, with New Zealand requiring 107 runs to win.Rather, he used Mohammed Siraj , who failed to produce any returns in two spells of seven overs and was wicketless.""The thing with pacers, you might get wickets, but there are always runs coming through edges. I was a bit surprised, I think tactically for Rohit Sharma, this Test match wasn't his greatest. I can understand Siraj getting one or two overs and Bumrah getting a long spell. But Siraj getting 6 overs in that spell, I think that is far too many and already a lot of runs on the board, and you had that little margin to chase,"" Manjrekar said, as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.""And another part is Aswhin. When there is no lavish turn on the pitch, the captain tends to use him with a new ball. He would have been tough for the Kiwi batters had he started off with Bumrah, and even if he had come in the fourth over of the inning,"" he added.He drew attention to India's crucial tactical mistakes on the last day. It was only New Zealand's third Test victory overall and their first in India since 1988.Rohit Sharma commended his team's tenacity, especially their comeback in the second innings, despite the shocking eight-wicket defeat. India demonstrated incredible tenacity by scoring 462 to set a target of 107 for New Zealand despite trailing by a significant 356 runs at the end of the first innings.""It was a good effort with the bat in the second innings. We didn't bat well in the first innings. So knew what was ahead and couple of guys stood out. When you are 350 behind you can't think too much about it. just got to see the ball and bat. Couple of partnerships were really exciting to watch and got us back in the game. We could have easily been bowled out cheaply but proud of the effort,"" Rohit said at the post-match presentation.India needs to win the next two Test matches to keep up their remarkable 18-match winning streak in home Test series .

How much did India women earn at T20 World Cup?

Members of the New Zealand women's cricket team, which beat South Africa by 32 runs in the final of the Women's Twenty20 World Cup in Dubai on Sunday, will split prize money of around US$2.3 million (Rs 19 crore) for clinching the tournament. The $2.3 million prize money is a 134 percent increase from the 2023 edition. Runners-up South Africa pocketed $1.17 million (Rs 9.8 crore) for their run to the title showdown.That works out at around US$155,000 (Rs 1.3 crore) per team member, a huge windfall for players who for years have struggled for years to achieve financial parity with their male counterparts.New Zealand's first-ever victory in the T20 World Cup was a massive surprise. The White Ferns had lost 10 consecutive T20 matches coming into the World Cup.Their pre-tournament success, against South Africa, proved a turning point for New Zealand who beat India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, losing only to Australia on the way to the semifinals.South Africa sent packing six-time champions Australia in a massive upset in the semi in which New Zealand beat the West Indies.The overall prize money pool of $7.95 million (about Rs 66.5 crore) was an increase of 225 percent from the previous edition. From the pool, the two semi-finalists - Australia and the West Indies - took home $675,000 (Rs 5.7 crore) each.Meanwhile, teams that finished ranked fifth to eighth, which essentially means the three best teams in the group stage, will earn $270,000 (Rs 2.25 crore) each.India, who were sent packing from the group stage, fall in this category. Harmanpreet Kaur-led India couldn't progress from Group A after two wins (against Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and two losses (against New Zealand and Australia).In the final, New Zealand made 158/5, batting first, helped by Suzie Bates who made 32, Amelia Kerr who made 43 and Brooke Halliday who made 38. Kerr then took 3/24 and Rosemary Mair 3/25 as New Zealand restricted South Africa to 126-9.""Pretty unbelievable to be honest,"" Mair said. ""Coming into the tournament all the odds were against us so for the group to bounce back like they have is unbelievable.""We just care so much about each other. We've been through a lot of lows in the last 18 months, and we've just stuck by each other and kept working hard for each other.""Captain Sophie Devine was leading the New Zealand team for the last time. She and Bates have played in all nine T20 World Cups since the inaugural edition in 2009. New Zealand reached the final of the first two tournaments - in 2009 and 2010 - losing to Australia on both occasions.""This means everything to us,"" Bates said. ""When you play team sport, you want to be a world champion.""We've fought our way back to the top. (Devie) has been so outstanding leading this team... so calm and believing in us. We'll probably have a cuddle for even longer later because there's been some dark times that only the people in the (locker room) understand.""The White Ferns' success was praised by the country's Sports Minister Chris Bishop. It came on a weekend where New Zealand won sailing's America's Cup and the men's cricket team beat India in a Test in India for the first time in 36 years.""And then to round out a truly amazing sporting weekend, at 3am Monday morning (NZT) the White Ferns, led by Sophie Devine, stepped up to face South Africa in the women's T20 World Cup final in Dubai and absolutely smashed it, bringing home their first World Cup since the One Day International in 2000,"" Bishop said.""Amelia Kerr's 43 runs off 38 balls and then taking 3 wickets for 24 set our team up for their magnificent performance.""",New Zealand beat South Africa by 32 runs in Women's T20 World Cup final.

Brief scores:

There were two mindsets on the field at Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on Monday.Having lost out on a crucial first-innings lead, Jammu & Kashmir were desperate to return home with a positive result from their second Ranji Trophy Group A match this season. But hosts Odisha , who have already registered three points from their first essay, were just fighting for a draw on Day 4 of the fixture.And at the end of the final day, it was the hosts who held fort and deprived the visitors of an outright win as J&K fell short by two wickets to garner any point and settled for a draw.The result meant that Odisha — having had to settle for a shared point with Tripura after a washout in their domestic season opener — climbed to the sixth spot on the eight-team list while J&K had to be content with a place on the second half of the Group A table on fifth.Resuming the day on 198/5, the visiting J&K were keen to put up a big score and at a fast pace to eke out an improbable victory on the final day. Aided by Sahil Lotra at the other end, their fighter-in-chief in both innings, Abdul Samad , raced to his second century of the match.Samad added 38 runs to his overnight score of 70 in a hurry and stayed unbeaten on 108 as the visitors looked eager to go all out for a win declaring on their identical first-innings score of 270, but for seven wickets. It took Samad and his lower-order companions 24.2 overs to add 75 runs and set Odisha a target of 272 to clinch all the points. Suryakant Pradhan was the most successful of the Odisha bowlers with three dismissals for 46 runs.However, already in the second session of the final day, Odisha were in no mood to go all out and played a defensive innings as the visiting bowlers put in a cumulative effort to dismiss them and win the match in less than two sessions.Just the stats for Sandeep Pattnaik , Odisha’s highest scorer in the second innings, made evident their strategy as he stayed unbetaen on 55, playing 222 balls. It was the same for all eight Odisha batters — with skipper Govinda Poddar amassing the highest strike rate of 27.27 for his nine runs.Four J&K bowlers claimed a wicket each as Odisha stood firm on 112/8 when stumps were called in their Ranji Trophy fixture.J&K 270 & 270/7 decl (A Samad 108 n.o., S Lotra 28; Pradhan 3-46).

NEW DELHI: New Zealand Cricket ( NZC ) faced backlash from Indian fans after posting a map of India on social media that depicted inaccurate borders of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh regions.The map was part of a creative announcement detailing the Kiwis' travel plans to Pune for the second Test against India, scheduled to begin on October 24.The now-deleted post drew heavy criticism across platforms, with many fans expressing anger over the incorrect depiction of India’s northern borders.Several users took to X (formerly Twitter) to demand corrections, with one fan tagging India’s External Affairs Minister, Dr. S. Jaishankar, and calling for action. ""Please look at this map, posted by New Zealand Cricket handle. They are showing the wrong map of India,"" the fan wrote.Another user commented, ""We can't imagine how you could post an incorrect map. Please correct this.""A different fan added, ""Do not post an incorrect map of India's northern border.""Following the uproar, NZC promptly deleted the post, but the controversy continued to brew online.The controversy follows New Zealand’s memorable eight-wicket win over India in the first Test at Bengaluru. The victory was New Zealand's first Test win on Indian soil since 1988.Rachin Ravindra, who was a standout performer in the match, anchored the chase with 39 not out, alongside Will Young’s unbeaten 48.India’s bowlers had briefly raised hopes on the final day after dismissing Tom Latham for a duck and trapping Devon Conway for 17, but the 75-run stand between Ravindra and Young sealed the game for the Kiwis.With the second Test starting in Pune on October 24, India will look to bounce back.","New Zealand Cricket posted a map of India on social media that depicted inaccurate borders of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh regions.

NEW DELHI: South Africa's Kagiso Rabada etched his name in the record books on Monday, becoming the fastest bowler to reach 300 Test wickets in terms of balls bowled, during the first Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka.This achievement led to a dominant performance by the Proteas, who bowled out Bangladesh for a paltry 106 before building a 34-run lead by the end of day one.Rabada reached the milestone in the 41st over of Bangladesh's innings, dismissing Taskin Ahmed to finish with figures of 3/34. This feat, achieved in just 11,817 deliveries, sees him surpass bowling legends like Waqar Younis (12,602), Dale Steyn (12,605), Allan Donald (13,672), and Malcolm Marshall (13,728).Despite the personal accomplishment, Rabada remained focused on the team's objective.""I was more focused on how we were going to win this Test, especially after losing the toss and bowling first. But when it happened, it was just a relief. Everyone plays for milestones, but it was a relief. The way my teammates support me, we support each other, and that felt really good,"" Rabada said after the end of play on the first day.Rabada also shared his observations on the Dhaka pitch, noting the unexpected seam movement despite initial expectations of turn.""We thought it was going to turn, and not really nip, but with the new ball, there was a bit of movement. Not really much swing, but off the wicket, there was quite a bit of seam movement,"" he added.Bangladesh, opting to bat first after winning the toss, struggled to build partnerships and were undone by a disciplined South African bowling attack. Opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy top-scored with a patient 30 runs, but the rest of the batting lineup crumbled under pressure.Wiaan Mulder and Keshav Maharaj complemented Rabada's three-wicket haul by picking up three wickets each, while Dane Piedt chipped in with one wicket.The Proteas' bowlers consistently challenged the Bangladeshi batsmen, exploiting the conditions effectively.South Africa's reply got off to a shaky start, losing skipper Aiden Markram early. However, a composed 30 from Tony de Zorzi and contributions from Ryan Rickelton (27) and Tristan Stubbs (23) steered them to 140/4 at stumps.Taijul Islam provided Bangladesh with a glimmer of hope, claiming a remarkable five-wicket haul, including the wickets of de Zorzi, Rickelton, and Stubbs. Hasan Mahmud also contributed with one wicket.As day two dawns, South Africa will aim to build on their lead and put the match beyond Bangladesh's reach.

Vice-captain and opener Abhishek Sharma starred with a 24-ball 58.But before that, Rasikh Salam (3 for 15) led the Indian bowling attack with an unplayable spell of fast bowling. However, Badoni stole the limelight in the 15th over of the UAE innings bowled by Ramandeep Singh (2 for 7).UAE tailender Jawadullah hit an aerial shot to long-on, and it looked destined for a boundary until Badoni, running to his right, dived full-length in the air to pluck the ball out of thin air.Later in the UAE innings, Rasikh ripped through the UAE's top order in a single over, triggering a collapse that saw the Emirates team fall like a pack of cards.The 24-year-old pacer started the over by dismissing Nilansh Keswani for 5 off 9 balls, with Vaibhav Arora taking a sharp catch. On the very next delivery, Rasikh had Vishnu Sukumaran caught behind by wicketkeeper Prabhsimran Singh, which put him on a hat-trick.Though he missed the hat-trick, 'Man of the Match' Rasikh bowled Syed Haider on the fifth ball of the over, claiming his third wicket.",India A beat UAE A in the Men's T20 Emerging Teams Asia Cup on Monday.

Khalid Jamil may be a man of few words but evidently not a man of few feats. And on Monday, at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur, his men took another leap of success as Jamshedpur FC overtook Mohun Bgan Super Giant on the Indian Super League (ISL) table with a 2-1 win against Hyderabad FC .The win — scripted with first-half strikes from Rei Tachikawa and Jordan Murray — took the Men of Steel to the second spot on the table, banishing the Kolkata giants to third place with 12 points from five matches and staying just a point behind current leaders Bengaluru FC Hyderabad, meanwhile, could not climb out of the penultimate position with just one point from four games.The southern visitors’ desire to rise from their 12th spot on the table was evident from the beginning as Lenny Rodriguez, Ramhlunchhunga and Abdul Rabeeh all had shots on target in the opening 25 minutes.However, the deadlock was broken a little against the run of play in the 29th minute when Jamshedpur winger Sanan Mohammad sent a cross from the left of the box that reached Imran Khan at the other end of the box. But the midfielder’s shot was saved by Hyderabad custodian Arshdeep Singh before the rebound reached the feet of an onrushing Tachikawa, who ran in with the ball for his second goal of the season, continuing his goalscoring touch against the same opponents.The goal seemed to have raised the home side’s confidence as they went on the lookout for more. While Arshdeep was able to save an optimistic shot from Tachikawa in the 34th minute, he was not able to repeat the feat 10 minutes later.This time, too, it was Sanan who was the provider as he sent a through to Murray after a good transition and a pass from Tachikawa. The Australian was exquisite in his finish as he chipped the ball with his right feet over the reach of the onrushing Arshdeep.Hyderabad were more determined for a comeback after the change of ends as they produced some exciting moves that didn’t take long to attain the desired result. However, it was as much the miscommunication between the Jamshedpur backline as was the presence of mind of Cy Goddard that earned them the goal.The miscommunication led defender Pratik Chaudhari to duck the ensuing header in the box from a throw-in on a verbal call from Albino Gomes and Japanese Goddard made no mistake to sneak into the goalmouth medley and send it past the goalkeeper.The goal raised hopes in the Thangboi Sinto-coached side for an equaliser even as Jamshedpur began to get their act together after the shock of conceding. And, in the end, it was Jamil’s men who came out on top and made a statement and a place for themselves among the title contenders this season.","Jamshedpur FC overtook Mohun Bgan Super Giant on the Indian Super League (ISL) table with a 2-1 win against Hyderabad FC.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian superstar Neymar Jr marked his return to professional football after a year-long absence due to injury, featuring in Al-Hilal 's dramatic 5-4 victory over Al-Ain in the Asian Champions League group stage on Monday.The high-scoring encounter at the Hazza bin Zayed Stadium saw Al-Hilal establish a commanding 5-3 lead by the 77th minute, fueled by Salem Al-Dawsari's hat-trick and goals from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Renan Lodi .It was at this point that Neymar replaced the injured Nasser Al-Dawsari, marking his first appearance since suffering a cruciate ligament injury during a World Cup qualifier with Brazil in November 2022.Despite the lengthy layoff, Neymar displayed glimpses of his trademark flair and nearly found the back of the net late in the game, only to be denied after a swift counter-attack.Al-Ain, led by Soufiane Rahimi's own hat-trick, mounted a late comeback, converting a penalty in stoppage time to reduce the deficit to a single goal. Al-Hilal, however, weathered the storm in a tense period of added time to secure the victory and maintain their position atop the West Asian group standings.This win further solidifies Al-Hilal's dominance, as they also currently lead the Saudi Pro League with a comfortable 21 points.Understandably emotional after the final whistle, Neymar expressed relief and satisfaction with his return, stating, ""I feel good, it's so hard. I always have a good team. But I'm so happy. I'm back.""Neymar's return is a significant boost for Al-Hilal, who acquired the Brazilian forward from Paris Saint-Germain for a reported €90 million in August 2022.Prior to his injury, Neymar had only featured in five games for the Saudi Arabian club, grappling with persistent muscle issues.His return injects a much-needed dose of star power and attacking prowess into Al-Hilal's lineup as they aim to conquer both domestic and continental competitions.",Al-Hilal beat Al-Ain 5-4 in the Asian Champions League on Monday.

Learning lessons from last campaign

CHENNAI: Chennai will play host to the Indian Women’s League ( IWL ) for the first time as Tamil Nadu-based club Sethu FC will hold their home matches at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium .Last season, when the home-and-away format was introduced in the IWL, Sethu played their home games at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco after Chennai’s Nehru stadium was made unavailable.Since the venue hosted the Khelo India Youth Games and Indian Super League (ISL) club Chennaiyin FC’s matches in the early part of the year, Sethu were forced to shift base.This time, Sethu, over the coming months, will share the Nehru stadium with Chennaiyin, who are currently competing in ISL Season 11. It is to be recalled that the IWL fixtures are yet to be announced by the All India Football Federation (AIFF).“We approached the Tamil Nadu government (which owns the venue) and the process was completed swiftly. For every game, we will rent the stadium for the matchday and the day prior to the matchday,” Sethu founder and owner M Seeni Mohaideen told TOI on Monday.Seeni said that the club would benefit from playing on home soil. “We are the only team from TN in the IWL; we have been playing for the last eight years. There was no home-and-away format in the IWL until last season; when we won the title in the 2018-19 season, we did not get to play at home. We have been one of the most consistent teams in the league. Playing at home will be a good thing and will give us exposure,” added Seeni.After an underwhelming campaign last season, finishing fourth, Sethu are keen to perform much better. They have made big changes behind the scenes, including the appointment of Shareef Khan, who has replaced Kanan Priolkar as the head coach.“Last season, we had a few setbacks like injuries to key players and unavailability of some players due to other reasons. To ensure that we have a good matchday squad for every game, we have decided to include 30 players in the squad. We have made good foreign signings and the announcements will be made soon. All IWL teams are well balanced and I feel that there will be stiff competition for the title,” said Seeni.","Chennai will play host to the Indian Women’s League ( IWL ) for the first time.

Mohammedan SC fail to protect lead as Kerala Blasters take home full points,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/mohammedan-sc-fail-to-protect-lead-as-kerala-blasters-take-home-full-points/articleshow/114411940.cms,"Kerala Blasters (PTI Photo)

Kolkata: Mohammedan Sporting faced some home truth again as Kerala Blasters rode a second-half fightback to beat the Indian Super League debutants 2-1 at the Kishore Bharati Stadium on Sunday.The hosts went ahead in the 28th minute when Brazilian Carlos Franca earned a penalty and his Uzbekistani teammate Mirjalol Kasimov converted it much to the joy of the partisan crowd.But Kerala Blasters stormed back into the contest through goals from Kwame Peprah (67) and Jesus Jimenez (75).This was the first victory in three consecutive matches on the road for Mikael Stahre ’s Blasters, who had earlier drawn their clashes with NorthEast United FC and Odisha FC.Mohammedan SC , on the other hand, remain winless at home, their latest setback coming after a 0-3 mauling at the hands of Mohun Bagan SG two weeks ago. Their defensive frailties came to the fore again as they lost another plot after taking the lead. Andrey Chernyshov ’s side suffered an early jolt when Ghanaian defender Joseph Adjei had to leave the ground with a serious leg injury, thus paving the way for new recruit Frenchman Florent Ogier to make his debut in the black-and-white colours.The hosts, however, took the lead deservedly when Franca latched on to a brilliant ball from his half and fell under the challenge of Blasters custodian Som Kumar, leading to the penalty. Kasimov sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot.Blasters announced their intention of a comeback when they finished the first half with Jimenez hitting the crosspiece.Franca missed a golden chance to extend the lead on the hour mark when he went for glory himself instead of sending the ball to an unmarked Fanai at the other end. Thus reprieved, Blasters came calling, Adrian Luna whipping in a long cross and Noah Sadaoui — who was a constant threat to the hosts’ box from the left — sent it back across the six-yard box for Peprah to make it 1-1, two minutes after replacing fellow defender Alexandre Coeff.Sadaoui then missed a sitter, failing to beat Mohammedan SC goalkeeper Padam Chhetri from a one-on-one situation. But it didn’t prove costly as Jimenez rose to the occasion, meeting Huidrom Naocha’s cross with a perfect header, taking Ogier’s challenge in his stride.Fanai could have salvaged a draw deep in stoppage-time but Blasters goalkeeper Som produced a brilliant save to ensure that his team returned home with a win.",Kerala Blasters beat Indian Super League debutants Mohammedan Sporting 2-1 at the Kishore Bharati Stadium.

They could make the most of the break time on offer, and on Monday, Jamshedpur FC and Hyderabad FC will retake the field in the last fixture of the fifth round of Indian Super League with a sense of optimism reigning at both ends.It will be another opportunity for Jamshedpur to continue their best ISL start in front of the home crowd at JRD Tata Sports Complex . With nine points from four matches, the Khalid Jamil-led side has surpassed their preceding league campaign so far and the Indian head coach backed his team to maximise the familiar conditions at home.“It is a very important game for us.We are playing in front of our home crowd. They’re a good team. They’re stronger than before. We must prepare well and take a positive result from this match,” Jamil said in the pre-match press conference on Sunday.Jamil’s stress on “a positive result” is guided by the fact that — currently lying in third spot — a win against Hyderabad on Monday would take the Men of Steel above Mohun Bagan Super Giant and a point behind leaders Bengaluru FC on the second position.With Jamshedpur’s creator-in-chief Imran Khan leading the charts among Indian players producing most goal-scoring chances, the likes of Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio are expected to be provided with ample scope to convert upfront. Jamil will also have the dependable Stephen Eze in backline to lead their defence.However, the hosts will take on a Hyderabad side — led by the only other Indian coach in the league Thangboi Singto — that secured a clean sheet in their last match against Chennaiyin FC , breaking a run of five games where they conceded at least two goals. They will be eager to build on it and achieve back-to-back clean sheets for the first time since March 2023.However, their attack — with the likes of youngster Devendra Murgaonkar — will need to step up as they remain winless this season.“The players have become stronger as a group, in terms of respect and camaraderie. Football is a team sport. If they can relate that respect on the pitch, then the results will speak for themselves,” head coach Singto said on Sunday.But an in-form Jamshedpur will be in their way with the aim of continuing their run this season, rejuvenated by a much-needed break. “It is good for everybody. They recovered. Everyone went for a break for a few days and then came back. The players who were not fit are fit now. So we are ready,” added Jamil ahead of their return to action at the Furnace.","Jamshedpur FC and Hyderabad FC will meet in the fifth round of the Indian Super League on Monday. The hosts are currently third in the table, a point behind leaders Bengaluru FC. Hyderabad are yet to win a game in the league this season and remain winless.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114411165,imgsize-78186,width-400,resizemode-4/114411165.jpg"

He has 14 goals in 11 matches in all competitions this season.Lewandowski, who received a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 65th, nearly got his hat track against Sevilla in a one-on-one situation in the first half.Pedri scored with a curling shot from outside the area in the 28th and Torre added to the lead from inside the area in the 82nd and with a free kick in the 88th. Raphinha had a 49th-minute goal disallowed for offside.Barcelona has outscored its league opponents 33-10 this season.Sevilla, which had no attempts on target in the first half, scored its lone goal in the 87th with 19-year-old substitute Stanis Idumbo.Barcelona also saw Lamine Yamal return from a muscle strain that saw him leave Spain's squad during the international break.Barcelona defender Eric Garcia hurt a muscle in the team's warmup and did not play.Atletico's stadium partially closed Fewer fans than normal watched Atletico Madrid beat Leganes 3-1 in a match played in a partially closed stadium because of recent fan trouble.Alexander Sorloth scored twice and Antoine Griezmann once after the visitors took the lead in the first half at the Metropolitano stadium, which had an empty fan section behind one of the goals as punishment after Atletico fans threw objects on the field during a city derby against Real Madrid last month.The section is where the club's more radical supporters usually gather.Atletico had been originally ordered to close the section for three matches but appealed the decision and the punishment was reduced to a single match. The derby was interrupted for more than 15 minutes after fans threw the objects near Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in a game that ended 1-1.Sunday's victory, which ended Atletico's three match winless streak in all competitions, moved Diego Simeone's team to third place in the league. It trails Barcelona by seven points.Atletico midfielder Pablo Barrios and defender Clement Lenglet both got injured.Griezmann was sent off late in the game after he slid into an opponent, but the red card was changed to a yellow after video review.Other results Villarreal is in fourth place after conceding an 87th-minute equalizer in a 1-1 draw against Getafe.

Rayo stayed ninth.Lautaro Martinez made sure that Inter Milan kept pace with Serie A leaders Napoli by netting the Italian champions' only goal in Sunday's 1-0 win at Roma.Argentina striker Martinez lashed home his fourth goal of the season in all competitions on the hour mark after a poor clearance from Zeki Celik to give Inter a hard-fought win at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.Inter remain two points behind Napoli, 1-0 winners at Empoli, as Italy's top four all won this weekend, with a huge match against Juventus at the San Siro coming up in a week's time.Before that Inter will try to continue their positive start to their Champions League campaign in Bern, where Simone Inzaghi's side will take on Young Boys potentially without Hakan Calhanoglu and Francesco Acerbi who both forced off with injuries in the first half.Inter will however be buoyed by a solid performance in the Italian capital which could have easily ended with a bigger win as Roma goalkeeper Mile Svilar did well to charge off his line and keep out Marcus Thuram and Denzel Dumfries.""The boys played well... once we broke the deadlock we had chances to score again and should have,"" said Inzaghi to DAZN.""I'm very happy with what the boys showed me today.""Roma meanwhile are lagging behind in 10th following a second league defeat of a what is already a troubled season for the capital club.The match began in a strange atmosphere as Roma's hardcore fans stayed outside the ground for the first 15 minutes in protest at the direction of the club under billionaire American owner Dan Friedkin.Fans are still unhappy about idol Daniele De Rossi being sacked last month and frustrated by the management of Roma, who last qualified for the Champions League in 2018.""We created chances but didn't take advantage of them... to give away a goal the way we did in a match like this is a real shame because the team played well,"" said Roma coach Ivan Juric.Khvicha Kvaratskhelia struck the only goal, and his fourth of the season, from the penalty spot in the 63rd minute to give Napoli their fourth straight win in all competitions.Empoli beat Napoli home and away last season and their victory in Naples last November cost Rudi Garcia his job as coach, as a disastrous league title defence ended with southern Italy's biggest club in 10th.And the hosts were the better team for large portions of the match, with Kvaratskhelia's winning spot-kick Napoli's only shot on target in front of thousands of enthusiastic travelling supporters.Napoli don't have European football as a result of their collapse following a first Scudetto since 1990 and the days of Diego Maradona.And under Antonio Conte Napoli have quickly re-established themselves as title challengers, with the advantage of not having the expanded Champions League jamming up their schedule.""We're trying to build something here, something that isn't just a flash in the pan but lasts long-term,"" said Conte to DAZN.Fiorentina hammered 10-man Lecce 6-0 to move up to fifth and six points behind Napoli with their best performance since Raffaele Palladino took over in the summer.Braces from both Danilo Cataldi and Andrea Colpani, the latter's first goals since following Palladino from Monza, drove Fiorentina to a thumping away win which also featured strikes from Lucas Beltran and Fabiano Parisi.Fiorentina were helped by Antonino Gallo being harshly sent off for fouling Dodo with the score 2-0, the offence considered the denial of a clear goalscoring opportunity despite the presence of other defenders.Level on points with Fiorentina in sixth place are Atalanta who eased to a 2-0 win at bottom side Venezia thanks in large part to in-form striker Mateo Retegui.Italy attacker Retegui helped Mario Pasalic open the scoring early on and then sealed the points two minutes after the break with a delightful chipped finish.Retegui, who only signed for Atalanta after Gianluca Scamacca suffered a serious knee injury before the start of the season, leads the Serie A scoring charts with eight goals.Young players made their mark as Union Berlin's resurgence in the Bundesliga continued with a 2-0 win over struggling Holstein Kiel on Sunday.Nineteen-year-old wing back Tom Rothe crossed for 20-year-old midfielder Aljoscha Kemlein to score his first senior goal with a header in the 18th minute. Rothe — who played a key role in Kiel earning promotion last season — made sure of the win when he headed in Union's second goal at a corner in the 85th.The win lifts Union to fifth in the Bundesliga, three points off leader Bayern Munich. Union recorded back-to-back wins in the league for the first time since February.Union stunned German soccer by finishing fourth in the Bundesliga to qualify for the Champions League in 2023 but last season was a failure. Union was winless on its Champions League debut and finished 15th in the Bundesliga.Promoted Kiel is in the relegation zone and is the only team yet to earn a point at home this season in the Bundesliga after losing its fourth home game in a row.Also Sunday, Werder Bremen recovered from 1-0 down to beat Wolfsburg 4-2 and rise to eighth.Tiago Tomas gave Wolfsburg the lead with his heel as the ball ricocheted around a packed penalty area, but Mitchell Weiser's volley deep into first-half added time got Bremen back into the game. Second-half goals from Bremen's Felix Agu, Marvin Ducksch and Marco Grüll secured the win.Wolfsburg coach Ralph Hasenhüttl will also have to do without attacking midfielder Patrick Wimmer, who faces a suspension after being sent off for a desperate lunging tackle on Grüll.Wolfsburg is 13th and has scored the opening goal in each of its last four Bundesliga games but won only one of them. It also has only one point in its four home games.Marseille got back to winning ways in style with a 5-0 thumping of Montpellier on Sunday to move within three points of Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain.A fast start to the season had raised hopes of Marseille challenging for a first title since 2010 under Roberto De Zerbi before they dropped off with a defeat by Strasbourg and draw with Angers.But OM were at their best at bottom club Montpellier, cutting the gap to PSG and Monaco who are separated by goal difference at the top of the table.Marseille will have the chance to draw level on points with PSG when they host their rivals next Sunday.""We know who we are, what our path is and what we still need to improve to reach their (PSG's) level. But we will prepare to win, like in every match,"" said De Zerbi, who took over at the Stade Velodrome in the close season after leaving Premier League club Brighton.The visitors got off to a flying start in Montpellier, as Elye Wahi nodded home Jonathan Rowe's header across goal in the first minute.Amine Harit added a second in the 36th minute, before Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg effectively wrapped up the points before half-time.Mason Greenwood collected Wahi's through ball and drove forward before picking out the bottom corner to score his first goal since August.Luis Henrique completed the scoring with 17 minutes left after Montpellier youngster Stefan Dzodic had been sent off.Montpellier sacked coach Michel Der Zakarian just a few minutes after the final whistle, with the team only on four points after eight matches.""He is no longer the coach of the first team.

Down the other hand, her opponent, the seventh seed, tossed her cap down and buried her face in her towel.Nitture's reaction was understandable. In the first set, she showed her all-round skills to wrest the early advantage after one hour and 13 minutes of action. The Mumbai girl, who rallied from 1-3 down, taking the next three games, was consistent with her groundstrokes, landing winners from the baseline. On the contrary, Kashyap, who called for a medical timeout after the ninth game to attend her injury, had nine doubles faults -twice in the tie-break -helping Nitture take the set.""I've been suffering from an injury this whole week - stiff neck, it has been strained. Physically, it was tough, but I am proud of the way I handled the situation,"" Kashyap said, adding ""Winning this title feels special. I think it is the first of many more to come. Now, I will go back and recover.""In the second set, Kashyap started playing better and Nitture's level dropped. The latter made errors and looked down while Kashyap, who tackled her opponent's dangerous drop shots smoothly, took a 4-0 lead. Kashyap did well to keep the ball in play and Nitture's rising unforced error count made the Assam player's task easier. Even encouraging words from the Mumbai girl's mother and coach, who were in the stands, did not help her case.The deciding set was a repeat of the second in that Kashyap just couldn't get back into the contest.","India's Tanisha Kashyap beats Akanksha Nitture in three sets to win ITF Open title in Bengaluru.

It is really, really upbeat right now,"" the 30-year-old, who jumps 15 spots in the ATP charts to better his career-high ranking to 77.Barrientos and Mansouri came into the final after upsetting top seeds Nathaniel Lammons and Jackson Withrow of the US in the second round and fourth seeds Sriram Balaji and Guido Andreozzi of Argentina in the semis.They dominated the stats on Sunday — 10 aces to five from the Indians, they faced no break point in set play, and won more points overall too, 80 to 68.Kadhe and Rithvik, 23, were broken in their very first serving game to trail 0-2 in the opening set. But that was the only break they faced during the remainder of the match.The Indian combo stayed with their rivals in an evenly fought second set before switching gears in the tie-break.They took 3-0 lead and maintained the advantage to take the second set.In the nerve-jangling super tiebreak, the 37-year-old Barrientos, world ranked 51, and Mansouri, aged 29 and ranked 66, had a triple match-point at 9-6 and then two more while averting one themselves in between.But Kadhe and Choudary showed steely nerves to convert their second match point for the biggest win of their career yet.","Arjun Kadhe and Rithvik Choudary win ATP 250 Series event in Almaty.

The second seed didn't let that affect her as she began to dictate terms and took the issue to the decider.She wasn't the same player in the final set, as she was broken in the fourth game, serving a double fault at breakpoint.Akanksha, whose previous best was a semifinal appearance in Ahmedabad two years ago, didn't prolong her rival's agony, closing out the match by breaking Vaishnavi's serve again in the eighth game.","Akanksha Nitture beat Pune's Vaishnavi Adkar 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 in the semifinals of the hard court event.

Every kid watches cartoons, right? But I didn’t watch cartoons. I just used to watch sports, tennis specially.“So, my parents were like, ‘she likes it.We have to put her on to that’. So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.
