IPL 2024: Sensational Stoinis helps Lucknow Super Giants pull off a rare double over Chennai Super Kings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2024-sensational-stoinis-helps-lucknow-super-giants-pull-off-a-rare-double-over-chennai-super-kings/articleshow/109541457.cms,"(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Sensational Marcus Stoinis pulled off one of the best batting performances of his career, firing a maiden Indian Premier League ton as Lucknow Super Giants stunned Chennai Super Kings by six wickets at the Chepauk on Tuesday.The Australian all-rounder smashed an unbelievable unbeaten 63-ball 124 as Lucknow pulled off a double over CSK this IPL season.It was a second win for LSG over CSK in just 5 days.After pulling off an eight-wicket win over CSK at the Ekana last week, LSG did it once again, this time, breaching the fortress Chepauk, riding on a jaw-dropping ton in chase of a tough 211.The win was Lucknow's fifth of the season while Chennai suffered their fourth defeat in 8 games. The win was also Lucknow's first ever at the Chepauk.Stoinis made a bustling unbeaten hundred, a perfect anti-thesis to Ruturaj Gaikwad's classy century as LSG made the highest successful 200-plus run-chase at the venue.Gaikwad (108, 60b, 12x4, 3x6) and Shivam Dube (66, 27b, 3x4, 7x6) added 104 runs for the fourth-wicket stand to power the Super Kings to a competitive 210 for four.Stoinis' innings was in direct contrast to the silken smooth knock of Gaikwad.The Australian's 6'1 inch frame is a storehouse of power and he made no effort to hide it too, crunching some fours and sixes, and nothing was more special than his maximum off pacer Mustafizur Rahman, who had earlier consumed LSG skipper KL Rahul cheaply.Rahman pitched an off-cutter slightly fuller on the off-stump from over the wicket, but Stoinis produced a physics-defying straight crunch over the bowlers' head for a six.At the other end, Pooran was on overdrive from ball one, partly because of the linear 55-run stand between Stoinis and a struggling Devdutt Padikkal (13, 19b), whose misery was ended when Pathirana produced a 151 kmph scorcher to uproot the batter's leg stump.It mandated that Pooran, who added 70 with Stoinis, did not have the luxury of taking his time to settle in, but he was up to the task and smoked Shardul Thakur for 20 runs in the 16th over including two sixes and a four.Pooran's dismissal by pacer Matheesha Pathirana left the task of taking LSG home to Stoinis, who reduced the equation robbing 15 runs off the 19th over bowled by the Lankan.Stoinis needed to take 17 runs off the last over bowled by Rahman and did the job with three balls to spare, smashing the Bangladesh left-arm quick for 6, 4, 4 (+1NB) and 4.Earlier, Gaikwad and Dube gave steam to Super Kings (213 for four) innings after a rather subdued Power Play (49/2) and the middle passage.The CSK should primarily thank Gaikwad, who played an innings which was a connoisseur's delight, for that total after the early departure of Ajinkya Rahane, who was caught superbly by stumper KL Rahul off Matt Henry.The batting in this iteration of the IPL has been all about scorching the ball far and wide but Gaikwad took a classic route, timing the ball through the gaps for fours.In fact, his first fifty contained no fours but still he managed to maintain a strike-rate of above 180 during that phase.The fifty came off just 28 balls. The most spectacular shot that Gaikwad played on the night was a slice-cut off pacer Mohsin Khan that beat the point fielder for a boundary.However, his focus was also on constructing useful alliances with his teammates as 45 runs were made with Daryl Mitchell and 52 were made alongside Ravindra Jadeja (17).However, both Mitchell (11), who was dropped on four, and Jadeja would rue missing out on a chance to chip in with a far bigger knock.While Gaikwad was the main contributor in those partnerships, the pressure was slightly lifted off his shoulders once Dube arrived at the crease.The left-hander played some powerful hits around the field and, not so surprisingly, fetched CSK's first six of the innings in the 13th over off Stoinis.Gaikwad soon slammed the first six of his innings in the 45th ball he faced –pulling Stoinis' half-tracker over mid-wicket.However, Dube seamlessly slipped into his six-hitting avatar and pacer Yash Thakur bore the brunt as the left-hander smashed him for three successive sixes.Gaikwad, who reached 99 with a six off Thakur over extra cover, reached his second IPL hundred with a four in the next ball off the same bowler as he made 16 runs in the 18th over.Gaikwad and Dube brought up 100 of their partnership in just 46 balls.",Lucknow Super Giants beat Chennai Super Kings by six wickets at the Chepauk. Marcus Stoinis hit unbeaten 124 as LSG made highest successful 200-plus run- chase at the venue. Ruturaj Gaikwad and Shivam Dube added 104 runs for the fourth-wicket stand to power the Super Kings to 210 for four.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109541418,imgsize-120610,width-400,resizemode-4/109541418.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Big hitting Aussie all-rounder Marcus Stoinis ' pulled off a match-winning 63-ball-124 not out to outmuscle Chennai Super Kings at their den in an IPL thriller on Tuesday.Stoinis' maiden ton in the league trumped Ruturaj Gaikwad 108 not out as Lucknow Super Giants secured a rare double over CSK this season -- winning two in two against the 5-time champions.As Stoinis miracle secured a famous win for Lucknow, skipper KL Rahul was all praise for the all-rounder as he snatched a win in a game where the hosts were favourites.Rahul, who once said strike-rates are over-rated in T20s, admitted that a total like 180 which was considered challenging might not be enough in the day and age of 'Impact Player'.“Very special (win), especially when it is a game like that. It felt like we were way behind the game in the chase. Just to pull off a victory feels special,” Rahul said at the post-match presentation ceremony.Rahul said their win against CSK in Lucknow had little context on a very different Chennai deck.“These were different conditions. They got off to a good start and put pressure on the bowlers. I didn't think it was a 210 wicket.“They batted really well. All credits to Stoinis. He was phenomenal to watch. It was not just power hitting, but was smart batting.”Sending Stoinis at No.3 was a smart move by LSG management and Rahul feels they had to take a ""brave"" call.“We wanted to be a lot braver as a team. We had three games, a couple at home, and some away where we couldn't go past 170. We needed one power hitter in the top three. That was the thought process.“I have also realised that T20 cricket has changed in the last couple of years – 170-180 does not always cut it. You have to go harder in the powerplay.“The Impact player gives you depth and that gives you more freedom. I have not played T20 cricket in a long time.”Asked if Nicholas Pooran can play up the order, the skipper said save him and Quinton de Kock as openers, none of the other positions are fixed.“There is no set plan. Apart from the openers everyone is set to go at any point. The last game, Pooran walked in at three. Hope I get the fielder of the award.”CSK skipper Gaikwad, whose century went in vain felt that dew played a big role towards the latter half of the match.“Tough pill to swallow but LSG played a good game at the end. We had the game in hand around the 13th over, but hats off to Stoinis.“There was a huge part that the dew played. It took the spinners away from the game. We could have taken the game deeper. But it is a part of the game, you can't control the uncontrollable.”Player of the match Stoinis said: “It is not just a go go. It was ebb and flow. There were some bowlers we targeted, some against whom we were cautious. Nicky Pooran played a good innings, Hooda also.“It ebbed and flowed. From the inside you are always structuring. You are liking some bowlers, not liking others much.""",Marcus Stoinis scores match-winning 63-ball-124 not out for Lucknow Super Giants. Stoinis' maiden ton trumped Ruturaj Gaikwad's 108 not out.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar expressed deep sadness while commenting on Mumbai Indians ' fifth loss in the ongoing IPL 2024 season.The defeat came at the hands of the formidable Rajasthan Royals (RR), who continued their exceptional performance with a comprehensive nine-wicket victory over Mumbai in their last home game in Jaipur.Led by Sanju Samson , the Royals maintained their dominance, securing a double triumph over Mumbai and solidifying their position at the top of the points table.Meanwhile, MI suffered a setback, slipping to the seventh position in the standings.Gavaskar observed a critical moment in the match during his commentary and couldn't stop himself from making a comment. It occurred when MI's Tim David dropped RR captain Samson on 19 runs during their chase of 180. The missed opportunity arose from a delivery byHardik Pandya , adding to Mumbai's woes.In another incident, Mohammad Nabi 's lacklustre fielding effort off a delivery from Jasprit Bumrah allowed Samson to secure a boundary, compounding Mumbai's frustration.Gavaskar's commentary likely reflected the significance of these lapses in a high-stakes encounter.""It's hard to recognise this team. I have been following Mumbai Indians ever since 2008. Got to say that this is not the team that I know,"" he said.In a comfortable chase, RR cruised to victory, propelled by Yashasvi Jaiswal's magnificent unbeaten century, securing the win with 10 balls to spare. Jaiswal's stellar performance stood out, particularly considering his earlier struggles in the opening seven games of the season.Jaiswal silenced the doubters with his second IPL century, both of which were against the Mumbai side.","Sunil Gavaskar expresses deep sadness while commenting on Mumbai Indians'fifth loss in the ongoing IPL 2024 season.

NEW DELHI: With reinforced skill sets and a keen ability to discern the nuances of a match, Kuldeep Yadav has evolved into a formidable player. However, back in 2019, the left-arm wrist spinner felt the necessity of a guiding presence as his form waned during his time with the Kolkata Knight Riders Following his Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) surgery in 2020, Kuldeep's career took a positive turn after joining the Delhi Capitals His performance for both the national team and in the IPL saw a remarkable improvement, solidifying his position as the first-choice spinner across formats.Since joining DC, Kuldeep has claimed 41 wickets in 33 matches. He credited his transformation to the months of hard work under the guidance of coach Kapil Pandey, where he diligently developed new skills post-surgery.""In KKR , I needed guidance but now I don't need it, as now I dictate terms. In 2019, Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni, his national team mentor) had retired that year and I needed guidance. The idea that I have now, has come with experience,"" Kuldeep said about his success in the last one and half years.Kuldeep shoulders the responsibility of bowling the most demanding overs, including those in the Powerplay. When questioned about his recipe for success, he attributes it to his willingness to confront challenges head-on.""I still regret my time in KKR (from 2016-2020) and feel whatever I am doing now, wish I could have done it back then.IPL: Points Table ""It still hurts me that had I worked on those skills back then, I could have dominated even more,"" Kuldeep said during a select media interaction.""But it didn't happen back then as experience is something that you get only when you play a lot. When you encounter failure in life, then only you learn and now I am more confident about my skills and at the same time respectful of the fact that opposition can be good too,"" the wily spinner said.Maturity is something that has had its positive effect over the years on him.""Back in the day, I didn't do (respect opposition) that. I believed in my skills but then at the same time you need to understand how the batter is playing and that maturity has come, knowing my strength and where to bowl so that it is difficult to hit, and I am working on that,"" said the Kanpur man.Post surgery, Kuldeep changed his run-up from diagonal to a much straighter one and also increased the pace on his delivery with more drift and prodigious turn in his break-backs.""The difficult part was before I got that knee injury (surgery for ACL), I wasn't bowling well. It is very important that there is someone in your life who supports you.""It was at that time he went back to the drawing board and worked with his early coach Pandey.""It could be your coach or your parents, and my coach supported me and reminded me that you shouldn't back-track.""It is because you can be out of sight. During injury time, I was relaxed. I was thinking how can I get better?There were apprehensions about how things can go astray when one tries to add new things into his armoury.""If I introduce new things in my bowling, there is fear of it affecting the turn and drift. Those aspects can get reduced while bringing a new facet.""I did try it earlier but perhaps didn't try in the correct manner. I tried increasing the pace in my deliveries but it didn't work.""Then my NCA physio gave me some tips and in a practice game, I tried to bowl with increased pace and did long sessions with Pandey sir,"" he said.Kuldeep also thanked head coach Ricky Ponting and former DC assistant coach Shane Watson for helping him when his rhythm was a bit off.Recently, Dinesh Karthik, Kuldeep's former KKR skipper in a podcast with Ravichandran Ashwin spoke about his ""tough conversations with the bowler"" which he felt that the chinaman bowler might not have appreciated.Kuldeep seemed non-fussed about it.""Obviously, it's an old thing. If you have six quality spinners, you can be confused while choosing and Varun Chakravarthy was bowling well and I wasn't. The skipper (Karthik) had a difficult job and did as per what he felt,"" the 29-year-old said.But he gave an interesting theory as to why Karthik, perhaps, placed confidence in him.""I did well under DK bhai. In 2019, I didn't play a lot. I feel DK bhai plays spinners really well. I might be wrong but I feel he thinks some others also play spin as well as him,"" said a smiling Kuldeep.He also thanked Indian skipper Rohit Sharma, who didn't want Kuldeep to once again prove his mettle at domestic level before summoning him for national duty.""I am grateful that he got me in the team post injury and told me that I would only be played gradually since I was coming back from injury.""Now Rohit bhai doesn't talk about my bowling as I deliver what he wants. Now, he is after me to improve my batting,"" he laughs.Also See: CSK vs LSG Live",Kuldeep Yadav is the first-choice spinner for India in all formats.

Venting his frustration on Cricbuzz, Tiwary questioned Pandya's choice to open the bowling himself against Rajasthan instead of entrusting the new ball to Jasprit Bumrah, widely regarded as the top pacer in the world.""If you have Jasprit Bumrah in the line-up why will you not bowl him in the first over? Buttler came off a hundred, Jaiswal was not in the best form, you need to give your best bowler the best chance of picking a wicket.When Hardik Pandya came in, he got hit for 2 boundaries and that took the shine away from the new ball slightly, and the margin of swing reduced. Things got easier for the batter,"" Tiwary said.""I don't see MI progressing in the points table because these silly mistakes are being made,"" Manoj Tiwary added.Tiwary wrapped up his analysis by highlighting MI's significant issue: having played 8 games while teams above them, including Pandya's side, had only played 7 matches. MI currently sit in 7th position on the league table with 6 points.""If this kind of captaincy continues, MI are not making the playoffs. Previously, players were with Rohit Sharma .

NEW DELHI: Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru director of cricket, Mike Hesson , shed light on the decision not to retain Indian spinner Yuzvendra Chahal ahead of the IPL 2022 season auction, as Chahal achieved a historic milestone of 200 wickets in the IPL during the ongoing season.Hesson, who helmed the franchise's cricketing affairs from 2019 to 2023, disclosed the rationale behind Chahal's departure during an interview on JioCinema.He explained that not retaining Chahal allowed RCB additional financial flexibility, aiming to secure both Chahal and pacer Harshal Patel in the auction.IPL 2024: POINTS TABLE ""We didn't retain Chahal because retaining just three players gave the team an extra four crore rupees to spend, through which we aimed to buy back both Chahal and Harshal Patel,"" Hesson revealed.However, RCB's plans encountered a twist during the auction when Chahal's name emerged late, coinciding with their pursuit of Sri Lankan spin all-rounder Wanindu Hasaranga to bolster their squad.RCB prioritized Hasaranga when his name appeared earlier in the auction, inadvertently missing out on Chahal, whose name surfaced later.""Yuzi (Chahal) is one I will be frustrated with until I have finished my career and probably beyond. He is an outstanding bowler,"" expressed Hesson.In 153 IPL matches, Chahal has scalped 200 wickets at an impressive average of 21.60, including six four-wicket hauls and a five-wicket haul. His historic milestone came during the IPL clash against the Mumbai Indians at Sawai Man Singh Stadium when he dismissed Afghanistan all-rounder Mohammed Nabi to claim his 200th wicket, the first bowler to achieve the milestone.Chahal's journey in the IPL saw stints with the Mumbai Indians (2011-13) and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (2014-2021) before joining the Rajasthan Royals in 2022. While he had a brief stint with MI and a prolific spell with RCB, Chahal continues to excel in his new role with the Rajasthan Royals, having claimed 61 wickets in 39 matches for the franchise.","Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru director of cricket, Mike Hesson, shed light on the decision not to retain Indian spinner Yuzvendra Chahal ahead of the IPL 2022 season auction.

NEW DELHI: A sensational unbeaten century by captain Ruturaj Gaikwad , coupled with Shivam Dube 's aggressive fifty, anchored the Chennai Super Kings to a formidable total of 210 for four against the Lucknow Super Giants in Chennai on Tuesday.Gaikwad's innings of 108 runs from 60 balls, including 12 boundaries and 3 sixes, alongside Dube's brisk 66 runs from 27 balls, embellished with 3 fours and 7 sixes, formed the backbone of the Super Kings' innings.The duo orchestrated a scintillating fourth-wicket partnership of 104 runs, injecting momentum into the innings following a relatively subdued Power Play (49/2) and middle overs.CSK owe much of their total to Gaikwad, whose innings was a treat for cricket enthusiasts, especially given the early dismissal of Ajinkya Rahane, brilliantly caught by wicketkeeper KL Rahul off Matt Henry.While this IPL season has seen aggressive hitting dominate the batting, Gaikwad opted for a more traditional approach, skillfully maneuvering the ball through the field for boundaries.In fact, his first fifty contained no fours but still he managed to maintain a strike-rate of above 180 during that phase.The fifty, the right-hander's 17th in the IPL, came off just 28 balls. The most spectacular shot that Gaikwad played on the night was a slice-cut off pacer Mohsin Khan that beat the point fielder for a boundary.However, his focus was also on constructing useful alliances with his teammates as 45 runs were made with Daryl Mitchell, who replaced an out of touch Rachin Ravindra, and 52 were made alongside Ravindra Jadeja (17).However, both Mitchell (11), who was dropped on four, and Jadeja would rue missing out on a chance to chip in with a far bigger knock.While Gaikwad was the main contributor in those partnerships, the pressure was slightly lifted off Gaikwad's shoulders once Dube arrived at the crease.The left-hander played some powerful hits around the field and, not so surprisingly, fetched CSK's first six of the innings in the 13th over off pacer Marcus Stoinis.Gaikwad soon slammed the first six of his innings in the 45th ball he faced –pulling Stoinis' half-tracker over mid-wicket.However, Dube seamlessly slipped into his six-hitting avatar and pacer Yash Thakur bore the brunt as the left-hander smashed him for three successive sixes.Gaikwad, who reached 99 with a six off Thakur over extra cover, reached his second IPL hundred with a four in the next ball off the same bowler as he made 16 runs in the 18th over.Gaikwad and Dube brought up 100 of their partnership in just 46 balls.Dube hammered Mohsin for a four and six off successive balls to reach his fifty in 22 balls as CSK plundered 71 runs off the last five overs.","Ruturaj Gaikwad scores 108 runs from 60 balls, including 12 boundaries and 3 sixes.

NEW DELHI: Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting showered praise on the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) on Tuesday, labeling it as the premier domestic T20 competition globally ""by a long way.""Ponting emphasised that the IPL provides an exceptional learning platform for budding talents, citing young cricketer Jake Fraser-McGurk as an example.Ponting, who serves as the head coach of the Delhi Capitals, expressed admiration for Fraser-McGurk's remarkable performance.Despite Delhi Capitals ' loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad in the match, Fraser-McGurk's explosive innings of 65 runs off just 18 balls caught Ponting's attention and earned his commendation.This acknowledgment from a seasoned figure like Ponting underscores the significance of the IPL in nurturing and showcasing emerging talent on the global stage.""There is no doubt about it that he (Fraser-McGurk) is a highly talented young man but he is by no means a finished product yet. There are a lot of things to improve in his game and there are not many better places to learn than IPL because it is the best domestic T20 competition in the world by a long way,"" Ponting said.""The other day he made 65 off 18 balls but it is important he learns from that. He needs to make a 100 like (Yashasvi) Jaiswal did last night.""Top-order batsmen, when they get an opportunity to make big scores, they should go and get it, that's the difference between winning and losing games,"" the World Cup-winning Australian skipper added.Ponting emphasised the critical importance of execution across all facets of the game, highlighting the need for a strong start, a lesson learned from Delhi Capitals' previous encounter against Sunrisers Hyderabad.In that match, DC chose to field first, but their bowlers faced a relentless onslaught from Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma , the opening pair for Sunrisers Hyderabad. Despite their best efforts, DC struggled to contain the opposition's batting momentum. SRH ultimately posted a formidable total of 266/7, securing a commanding victory over DC by a significant margin.""The important thing is to look back and understand what things worked for us and what didn't work.""We didn't play as well under pressure as we would have liked. We knew the way Travis and Abhishek will come out and play, we planned for it but we got a little bit confused about what we were trying to do,"" Ponting said on the eve of DC's match against Gujarat Titans.""Leaving the power play we did a really good job in the whole game, the last 14 overs to restrict them to 266 was actually a pretty good effort. And our batting in the last couple of overs we were on track.""So there are positives to take from that game but we can't start a game of cricket like that, we can't be that far off from execution because in this competition, against good players, these things will count,"" he added.Coming back to Fraser-McGurk, Ponting expressed his desire to work with the 22-year-old and help him polish his skills.""He is learning and I would like to work with him more for the next couple of years. He is just a terrific kid. He has simple game plan, hit the first ball for 6, second ball for 6, and we are letting him go and play as he wants to,"" he said.Ponting also talked highly of young wicketkeeper-batter Abishek Porel, who played a few cameos for DC while coming in as an impact player.""We have seen Porel on a couple of occasions going in at No. 3. I think he is a future star. He has got real talent.""He is still leaning every day, he is learning about his training, he is learning about different phases of the game,"" the coach said.","Ricky Ponting praises Indian Premier League ( IPL) as premier domestic T20 competition globally ""by a long way"" Ponting emphasised that the IPL provides an exceptional learning platform for budding talents, citing young cricketer Jake Fraser-McGurk as an example.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109539276,imgsize-38380,width-400,resizemode-4/109539276.jpg"

It was Ahmed Jahouh, with his third assist of the season, who sent in a cross in front of goal from a corner and the dependable Carlos Delgado was there to meet it with his body and send the ball in.The equaliser got Sergio Lobera ’s team more pumped as Roy Krishna , Amey Ranawade and Isak Vanlalruatfela kept piling pressure on the Bagan defence with runs down the middle and the flanks. The Shield winners, too, kept pushing for another goal but the Delgado and Fall-led Odisha defence kept the dangers at bay.On the other hand, Odisha’s chief playmaker Jahouh fell to Habas’s plan of not being given the space for his long balls and his frustration led to a yellow card in the 23rd minute.But it was Juggernauts’ custodian Amrinder who became the provider in the 39th minute and sent a long ball ahead of the half line. Odisha’s top scorer, Krishna, received the ball with a header and on finding Subhasish Bose a bit out of position, beat Hector Yuste with his pace to send the ball in with a clinical finish between the legs of Vishal Kaith rushing from the goal and become the joint-top scorer in the league.Petratos and Manvir had chances to level the score soon after but the home side went into the break with a one-goal lead.Lobera’s men came back with new vigour after the change of ends but could only create half chances as Odisha held fort at the back.The second half, however, was put in the spotlight for the wrong reason as both teams saw themselves go down by a player to red cards.Armando Sadiku, who received a yellow for an outburst of frustration in the first half, got shown the red card for an aerial tackle on Jahouh in the 67th minute. Seven minutes later, it was Delgado who received the marching orders for a second yellow shown for what appeared to be a harsh penalty for an unintentional handball just outside the box.With both teams a man down, the coaches resorted to more cautious approach with a slew of substitutions and the best attacking chance after that went to Bagan who saw the ball hit the crossbar after a goalmouth melee.The scoreline, however, stayed 2-1 in Odisha’s favour ahead of Sunday’s second leg in Kolkata.",Odisha FC maintained their unbeaten streak at home as they got the better of Shield winners Mohun Bagan Super Giants 2-1 in the first leg of their ISL semifinal in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. Both teams saw the red card and losing a vital cog in their second leg plans.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109540637,imgsize-36068,width-400,resizemode-4/109540637.jpg"

I faced in Milan what Vinicius is facing in Madrid: Marcel Desailly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/i-faced-in-milan-what-vinicius-is-facing-in-madrid-marcel-desailly/articleshow/109517434.cms,"(The writer's in Madrid on the invitation of Laureus)

MADRID: The city is still reeling under the Clasico hangover and everyone is praising Jude Bellingham . Marcel Desailly , the former captain of France and a World Cup-winner, did not miss out on joining the chorus on England’s new-found ace who decided the Clasico at the Bernabeu on a raucous Sunday night.What makes Desailly stand out, apart from his outstanding physical appearance, is his composed articulation on matters others are apprehensive talking about.TOI asked about Vinicius ' offfield challenges with racism while playing for Real Madrid and Desailly spoke his mind.""He's ambitious and he's a bit too touchy. But he's right at the same time. I experienced this at the time when I was playing for Milan. He doesn't understand. I understand the situation because I'm originally from Africa. You see where he's coming from, Brazil, where it's completely different, the approach. So it's not surprising that he has made the noise. Because it's not about him, it's about the La Liga .""We have the power to change things, but we are not doing enough. Samuel Eto'o had the same issue at his time. So Vinicius is also part of these players who will suffer because the administrative people are not willing to hit harder. Otherwise, we are happy about his growth,"" he said.""Vinicius is 24. I think he has improved. Remember when he came? Four years ago. He didn't have the ability to finish. You see now his clinical assist and finishing."" Immediately his French soul took over and he referred to Dembele. ""The stats are very poor. Two goals or three goals, but he has great potential.""The one player who is living up to potential is Bellingham . With Euro 2024 round the corner, Desailly feels the Real Madrid star will influence Gareth Southgate's forever underachieving bunch rather positively.""I don't think that he was outstanding last night, but he's been key for his team. (Carlo) Ancelotti could have substituted him. But he took Vinicius out because he knew Bellingham had the legs to defend and to position himself and identify the correct moment to find the killer goal. He is just a good player for now. You try to compare him with Zidane. It's difficult for us to accept that. The use of the ball is different with Zidane and Bellingham. Jude is a bit more straightforward on acceleration. Zizou was more pattern-weaving, ballet-like. But the potential of the talent is quite similar.""With his experience of English football while playing for Chelsea, Desailly is cheekily penetrative in his assessment.""Quality kills the quality. That is England's problem. The Dutch were having this kind of problem too. They all have a high expertise, they all have their own belief every time. It was difficult for them to unite all together at the same moment to perform. So England might have to improve on this aspect because the talent is there. So let's see how the coach is going to be able to adjust and make the choice.""Desailly was born in Accra, Ghana but moved to France with his mother when he was just four.","Marcel Desailly believes Jude Bellingham is living up to his potential.

Odisha have never beaten MBSG in their past nine ISL encounters, having gone down on four occasions out of those.Sergio Lobera ’s boys will certainly leave no stone unturned to break that winless streak against their much-fancied, confident opponents at home before travelling to the Mariners’ Kolkata citadel for the second leg. Though the Purple brigade can take heart from their 5-2 away win over the green and marrons to knock them out of the AFC Cup group stage.In ISL, Bagan are in the midst of a terrific run, winning four of their last five league games, including the last-day victory over 2022-23 Shield Winners Mumbai City to pip the Islanders to the Shield, the only missing silverware in their cherished trophy cabinet until then.Odisha, on the other hand, had a great start and steady momentum midway through the campaign, only to see it lose steam towards the end which saw them finish the league in fourth place. They secured their historic semis berth with a thrilling 2-1 comeback win against Kerala Blasters in the playoffs at home.Ahead of taking on the Shield Winners, Odisha FC head coach Sergio Lobera banked on their record at home this season. “Tomorrow’s game will be a difficult game. We are going to play against the current shield winners’ team. They have a very good team, but we also have a very good team and we are unbeaten in Kalinga. We want to keep the momentum in terms of our results at home. Our target is to finish the season unbeaten (at home),” Lobera said ahead of the game on Monday.Asked how special it will be to reach the ISL final, the Spanish coach said, “It will be very special for us to reach the semifinals. We are creating a lot of pages in terms of creating a story in the club. We want to do one step more. It will be amazing to reach the final.”Praising their opponents, Mohun Bagan coach Antonio Lopez Habas said ahead of the game, “For me, the past is not one to think about. I have to live in the present. Odisha are a very difficult opponent because they have a good coach, they have players with experience, and it will be a difficult match for us.”About their preparations for the semis clash, the Spanish gaffer said, “We need to prepare for this match as any league match, we need to win this match in the 90 minutes. We can’t think about the second leg, that is how we think about it. This semifinal is very difficult to win in the first leg, but we should not lose it in the first match.”With great tacticians at the helm of two talented bunch of players fighting for supremacy, Tuesday’s clash at Kalinga calls for an exciting first part of the two-legged battle for a berth in the final.","Odisha FC host Mohun Bagan Super Giant in the first leg of the high-octane last- four clash in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Jude Bellingham 's dramatic late winner in the El Clasico clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona on Sunday has virtually sealed the La Liga title for Los Blancos. The 19-year-old English midfielder's stoppage-time strike secured a 3-2 victory for Real Madrid, extending their lead at the top of the table to a commanding 11 points with just six matches remaining.The match was a thrilling encounter, with both teams displaying resilience and determination.Barcelona took the lead twice, through Andreas Christensen and Fermin Lopez, but Real Madrid fought back on both occasions, equalizing through Vinicius Junior and Lucas Vazquez . It was Bellingham's decisive goal in the dying moments that ultimately settled the contest in Real Madrid's favour.Bellingham's performance in his debut season in Spain has been nothing short of remarkable. With 21 goals across all competitions, he has emerged as Real Madrid's top scorer, showcasing his prowess and maturity beyond his years. His brace in the reverse Clasico fixture against Barcelona in October further underscored his ability to rise to the occasion in high-stakes matches.The victory at the Santiago Bernabeu was a testament to Real Madrid's grit and determination, qualities they have consistently displayed throughout the season. Their ability to bounce back from setbacks, as they did against Manchester City in the Champions League, has been a hallmark of their campaign.Lucas Vazquez, who played a pivotal role in all three of Real Madrid's goals, praised the team's resilience and acknowledged the significance of the win in their pursuit of the La Liga title. ""We've had a very good season, we're on a very good path, now we just have to polish it off and we'll go for everything,"" he told Real Madrid TV.For Barcelona, the defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, especially after their impressive performance following their Champions League exit at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain. Head coach Xavi expressed his frustration with the lack of goal-line technology in La Liga, which denied them a potential goal when Lamine Yamal's flick appeared to have crossed the line.Despite the setback, Barcelona showcased their fighting spirit and determination, with youngsters like Yamal and Pau Cubarsi impressing against the seasoned Real Madrid side. The future looks promising for the Catalan club, but for now, they must focus on securing their position in the league and preparing for the next campaign.Real Madrid find themselves in a commanding position, thanks in no small part to the exploits of Jude Bellingham.

Despite initially cruising to a commanding 3-0 lead against their second-tier opponents, with goals from Scott McTominay , Harry Maguire , and Bruno Fernandes , United's vulnerability in recent weeks was evident as Coventry mounted a stunning comeback.Second-half strikes from Ellis Simms and Callum O'Hare injected new life into the contest, before Haji Wright's 95th-minute penalty leveled the scores, completing a remarkable turnaround.Coventry supporters, buoyed by their team's resurgence, taunted Ten Hag with chants of ""you're getting sacked in the morning,"" adding to the drama of the occasion.In an enthralling period of extra time, both teams struck the woodwork, but it was United who ultimately held their nerve, prevailing in the penalty shootout.Rasmus Hojlund 's decisive spot-kick sealed a dramatic victory for Manchester United, ensuring their progression to yet anotherFA Cup final amidst a season filled with twists and turns.""We put ourselves in a difficult position and should have killed it earlier but we didn't,"" said United captain Fernandes. ""We have to do so much better.""Coventry manager Mark Robins famously played a key part in United's FA Cup final win in 1990, a victory that launched two decades of success under Alex Ferguson.But his team's push to reach the Championship play-offs has faded in recent weeks and they travelled to Wembley as underdogs despite United's stuttering season.United, 12-time winners of the competition, settled early and took the lead in the 23rd minute after a fine move down the right.Alejandro Garnacho fed the overlapping Diogo Dalot, whose cross went under the hands of the diving Bradley Collins and was tapped in by McTominay from close range.Manchester United, 12-time winners of the competition, asserted their dominance early on, taking the lead in the 23rd minute through a fine move down the right flank.

Despite Coventry's spirited display, Fernandes added a third goal for United in the 58th minute, his shot deflecting off defender Bobby Thomas and finding the net.Coventry, however, refused to back down, pulling a goal back through Ellis Simms in the 71st minute and reducing the deficit further when Callum O'Hare's shot deflected off Aaron Wan-Bissaka and past Andre Onana in the 79th minute.As the match intensified, Coventry was awarded a penalty for a handball by Wan-Bissaka, which Haji Wright converted to level the scores and force extra time.In the additional periods, both teams came close to clinching victory, with Fernandes hitting the crossbar for United and Simms striking the woodwork for Coventry.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi showcased his brilliance by scoring twice and setting up another goal for Sergio Busquets , leading Inter Miami to a 3-1 victory over Nashville on Saturday in a captivating Major League Soccer encounter and maintaining their top spot in the Eastern Conference .Miami faced an early setback when defender Franco Negri inadvertently deflected a corner into his own net in the second minute, giving Nashville an early lead.However, Messi quickly turned the tide in Miami's favor, equalizing in the 11th minute after Luis Suarez directed a loose ball back to him following a parried shot.Despite hitting the post shortly afterward, Messi continued to orchestrate Miami's attacks, providing opportunities for his teammates and creating chances with his exceptional playmaking skills. In the 39th minute, his former Barcelona teammate Busquets nodded in a fine glancing header from Messi's corner to put Miami ahead just before halftime.The home side suffered a setback as Paraguay international Diego Gomez was stretchered off with an ankle injury just before the break, adding to Miami's injury woes.Nashville pushed for an equalizer in the second half but failed to capitalize on their dominance in possession. Miami sealed the victory in the 81st minute when Leonardo Afonso was brought down inside the box, allowing Messi to convert the penalty and secure his ninth goal in as many games for Miami in all competitions this season.Despite the win, Inter Miami head coach Gerardo Martino expressed dissatisfaction with his team's slow start, highlighting the need for improvement despite their depleted squad due to injuries.Inter Miami currently sits atop the Eastern Conference with 18 points from their opening 10 games, a commendable achievement considering the challenges they have faced. Martino emphasized the importance of accumulating points early in the season to avoid a repeat of last year's dramatic playoff chase.In other MLS fixtures on Saturday, reigning champions Columbus Crew salvaged a 2-2 draw against Portland Timbers, while Cincinnati secured a remarkable 2-1 comeback victory against Atlanta United, with Luciano Acosta playing a pivotal role in the win.",Lionel Messi scores twice as Inter Miami beat Nashville 3-1 in Major League Soccer.

Just for the sole purpose that it requires less adjustment for me because I've played on it all my life,"" he said.""So, no matter how many titles I am gonna win on clay or grass, hardcourt is going to be the preference.""It (doubles) is a bit different compared to singles. Doubles is less movement, which makes it a bit easier but there's still technical aspects of doubles, which in general doesn't involve so much side to side movement.""There is a lot of serving and volleying, and returning fast points. So you have to be good at that, regardless of any surface if you want to succeed in doubles.""Given the necessities of the modern game where entries into big tournaments breaks and makes partnerships, Bhambri, who decided to focus on doubles only two seasons back, has become adept at playing on both sides of the court.""Yuki plays ad court with Olivetti. He played deuce with Robin Hasse in Dubai and reached semis. In Madrid last week he played deuce with Arel Behar too,"" Balachandran said.""Now he is comfortable playing on either side. Just that he has played more on ad court, and people recognise him as an ad court player. That will change soon as he plays on either side with different partners.""Known for avoiding late hours, playing on the Tour has also brought a bit of change to Bhambri's personal side.""Well, I've been part of the Tour for a long time now. So I know most of them. Of course, I miss partying with with Roger (Federer) and Rafa (Nadal), enjoying nights out with them. Since they are not much around on the Tour, it's not the same,"" he said.""Maybe the next generation I can hang out with more, stay out late and socialize with them more – the Alcaraz's and the Kyrgios's of the tour.""",Yuki Bhambri won his second Tour title with a win at the BMW Open in Munich. The 31-year-old has won his first two titles on the doubles Tour on grass and clay.

NEW DELHI: Casper Ruud 's triumph at the Barcelona Open final against Stefanos Tsitsipas marked a significant milestone in his career. After suffering a defeat at the hands of the Greek player in the Monte Carlo Masters final just a week prior, Ruud exacted his revenge by claiming his biggest career title to date.The Norwegian secured a straight-sets victory, winning 7-5, 6-3, and converting three of the six break points he earned.This victory not only ended Tsitsipas' impressive 10-match winning streak on clay but also marked Ruud's first title of the season, following three previous final losses.Ruud's elation was palpable as he expressed his joy at winning on the ""Rafa Nadal Court,"" a court named after his childhood idol. The significance of this triumph was amplified by the fact that Ruud had visited the tournament as a 13-year-old spectator, admiring the likes of Nadal and others.With his sights set on the upcoming French Open , where he finished as the runner-up in 2022, Ruud's victory in Barcelona serves as a confidence booster. The 25-year-old Norwegian has now amassed 11 career titles, with 10 of them coming on clay courts, solidifying his prowess on the surface.For Tsitsipas, the loss marked his third consecutive Barcelona final defeat, having previously fallen short in 2018, 2021, and now in 2023. Despite his impressive 10-0 record on clay this season and his pursuit of a 12th career title, the Greek player was unable to overcome Ruud's determination.Ruud's triumph in Barcelona not only provided him with his biggest career title to date but also served as a testament to his resilience and ability to bounce back from setbacks.","Casper Ruud beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-3 in the Barcelona Open final.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one and two-time Grand Slam champion Garbine Muguruza announced her retirement from tennis on Saturday, following a hiatus of over a year without competing.Speaking at a press conference during the Laureus Awards, the 30-year-old reflected on her illustrious career, stating, ""The time has come to say goodbye. It has been a long and beautiful journey, but I feel that the moment to retire has arrived.""Muguruza's decision marks the end of a remarkable tenure in professional tennis, during which she achieved significant milestones and left an indelible mark on the sport.""It's a decision that I've been taking little by little.""Muguruza's last official match was at the Lyon Open in January 2023, marking her temporary departure from the sport. Following this event, she refrained from competing, leading to her eventual retirement announcement.""When I stopped competing, I returned home and I welcomed the break with open arms,"" said Muguruza who ends her career with 10 singles titles.""Every day that went by I felt better and I didn't miss the discipline and the difficulty of the life I had before, so it has been a progressive thing.""Muguruza's WTA main-draw debut occurred in 2012, marking the beginning of her professional journey. Her breakthrough on the Grand Slam stage came in 2015 when she reached her first final at Wimbledon , where she faced Serena Williams but was unable to clinch the title.However, she swiftly bounced back, securing her maiden Grand Slam victory at the French Open in 2016 by defeating Serena Williams. The following year, Muguruza continued her success by triumphing over Venus Williams to claim the Wimbledon title.These victories solidified her place in tennis history, as her French Open win made her the first Spanish woman to win a Grand Slam since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998, while her Wimbledon triumph made her the first Spanish female champion at the All England Club since Conchita Martinez in 1994.Martinez's influence played a significant role in Muguruza's success, as she coached her to the Wimbledon title.

I think after winning the first (singles) match against New Zealand, we should have won the tie,"" said AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar on Thursday.India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week.Winning the tie would have placed the team second in final standings, thereby securing them a spot in the Playoffs in November.""We are remaining in Group 1, but I was expecting to qualify,"" said Dhupar but then switched to highlighting the association's efforts in hosting tournaments through the season to help players gain ranking points.""The association has done everything. The girls have had the opportunity to get a lot of points, and we had organised a camp in China.""And they were all playing well. Ankita had just won a tournament (in doubles) in Japan just the week before.""Dhupar, however, brushed aside the questionable team combinations fielded by the captain and the coach.After entering Sahaja Yamalapalli in singles and pairing Rutuja Bhosale with Prarthana Thombare against the strong Chinese team, the team's think-tank opted to put Rutuja in singles and hand Ankita the additional duty of doubles for the remaining three ties.It proved to be disastrous as it left Ankita with little time to recover with only a 30-minute gap between second singles and the decisive doubles matches. Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective. ""If I were the coach or the captain, and if I find my No. 1 player not performing, I would put my No. 3 or any other player in,"" Bal, a former Davis Cup player, said.""Try something different, think out of the box. It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players.
