India vs Bangladesh: Why the pressure is back on Rohit Sharma and Team India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/india-vs-bangladesh-why-the-pressure-is-back-on-rohit-sharma-and-team-india/articleshow/113441967.cms,"The captain is aware any slip-up against

Bangladesh

will spur severe criticism, never mind the recent World Cup win

CHENNAI: The monkey is never off the back. The albatross of the ICC trophy that had been hanging around the neck of Indian cricket for a decade might have been dealt with on the shores of Barbados a couple of months ago, but that doesn't mean Rohit Sharma & Co.can breathe easy.The captain has dealt with pressure for a long time now and he knows that everything will be forgotten in a hurry if a result goes wrong here and there.""I don't know how it works for other countries, but for India it is a different ballgame. If we don't win the bilateral series (against Bangladesh), we know how it works. The (negative) talk will start happening all over again. So for us, it can never be that now we have won an ICC trophy, we can relax and enjoy,"" Rohit said ahead of a practice session at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Tuesday.On Thursday, the Test series against Bangladesh will start. It is the first stop towards India's push for a place in the WTC Final .Rohit knows that he doesn't have a lot of time on his side - he is 37 now - and this may well be his last chance to win the WTC title.""For us cricketers, we've got limited time to play the game, to make an impact in the sport. So, you've got to try and do your best, try and possibly win everything you can, whatever is in front of you,"" the skipper said.Just as the WTC Final tune kept playing through the interaction, the discussions around the impending Australia series also came up. But Rohit kept reminding one and all that it is important to stay in the moment.""It doesn't matter where we play in two months' time, we want to win here. In modern-day cricket, a break of one month is a long time, so it's nice to have everyone back and then start the season on a high,"" Rohit said.While the core of the Indian team has remained more or less the same over the last few years, it's the exterior that has changed. Rahul Dravid , with whom Rohit used to share great camaraderie, is gone and it's Gautam Gambhir who is in charge now.The new coach, along with his new support staff of Abhishek Nayar Morne Morkel and Ryan ten Doeschate, have come in with fresh ideas and it is the Indian skipper's turn to adapt.""I have known Gautam and Abhishek very well over the years. And against Morne, I have played a lot of very tough cricket. As far as Ryan goes, what I experienced in Sri Lanka (during an ODI series last month), I felt he is a very sensible and understanding personality. Having said that, these people will be different from Rahul bhai, Vikram Rathour and Paras Mhambrey. Their way of running the team will be different and having played 17 years under different coaches, I know that. It is very important for you to understand that every coach comes in with a different perspective and different methods. So it is very important for you to adjust,"" Rohit said.While the Mumbai right-hander seemed pretty chilled out about most issues, there seemed to be a bit of history with him and Bangladesh, something that dates back to the 2015 ODI World Cup.When asked about the opposition, the captain quipped: ""Look, all the teams want to defeat India. Let them have fun, but our job is to win the match. When England came here, they also talked a lot in press conferences. But we did not focus on that.""",Rohit Sharma is aware any slip-up against Bangladesh will spur severe criticism. The captain knows that everything will be forgotten in a hurry if a result goes wrong here and there. Rohit knows that he doesn't have a lot of time on his side and this may well be his last chance to win the WTC title.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113441876,imgsize-55570,width-400,resizemode-4/113441876.jpg"

Iyer had a chance for a comeback, but his disappointing performance in the ongoing Duleep Trophy, where he scored only 104 runs in four innings, has further diminished his prospects.The rise of young talents like Sarfaraz Khan and Dhruv Jurel, who impressed during the series against England earlier this year, has pushed Iyer down the pecking order. BCCI official has expressed doubts about Iyer's place in the current Test team, citing concerns over his shot selection during the Duleep Trophy.""At the moment, there's no room for Shreyas to be in the Test team. Who will he replace? Besides, his shot selection has been a concern in Duleep, especially yesterday (Sunday),"" the official told Telegraph.""He (Iyer) was well set and then suddenly played such a shot (off left-arm spinner Shams Mulani). When you are set and then batting on a flat deck, you need to make the best use of that opportunity,"" the official added.Another board official hinted that Iyer will continue playing in the domestic circuit and suggested his inclusion in the five-match Test tour of Australia later this year is unlikely.However, the official also mentioned the possibility of Iyer participating in the Irani Cup and the Bangladesh T20I series, depending on his performance and availability.The official emphasized the need for Iyer to regain form while acknowledging his past achievements, particularly his batting during last year's ODI World Cup.""Now, if he doesn't fire in Irani too, he still has the Ranji Trophy to get runs. It wasn't too many days ago when he was batting so well in last year's ODI World Cup. He suffered an injury too, which needs to be considered. Also, with still one round left in Duleep, you never know he might score a hundred. He needs to regain form. Most likely he won't go to Australia for his problems against the short ball, but one can't just ignore his runs at home,"" the official added.","India's star batsman Shreyas Iyer is currently not in contention for a spot in the Test cricket team.

Border Gavaskar Trophy: When Rahul Dravid notched up one of the greatest performances by an Indian batsman overseas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/border-gavaskar-trophy-when-rahul-dravid-notched-up-one-of-the-greatest-performances-by-an-indian-batsman-overseas/articleshow/113441096.cms,"NEW DELHI: India batting great Rahul Dravid has a stellar record against Australia , one of the most dominant teams during his era. His performances, especially in Test cricket, are particularly memorable, with several iconic innings against the Aussies.Dravid's first tour to Australia in 1999 was nothing short of disastrous with a highest score of 35 in the first Test in Adelaide.But by the time the 2003-04 tour came along, Dravid had enhanced his reputation of being one of the finest Test batsmen in the world and had also played the greatest supporting act in the history of Indian cricket in the previous series against Australia (2001) - a momentous 180 at the Eden Gardens, when India won the match after following on.Batting first in the second Test of the series in 2003, Ricky Ponting smashed 242 as the Aussies racked up 556 runs on the board. India were reeling at 85/4 when VVS Laxman walked out to join Dravid at the crease.And together the 'Aussie tormentors' replayed their legendary Eden partnership with a 303-run stand for the fifth wicket.Dravid reached his century off 223 balls on Day 3 and kept going great guns after the dismissal of Laxman (148), notching up his fourth Test double hundred off 386 deliveries on Day 4. Dravid hit 23 fours and a six in his 233-run knock and his was the last wicket to fall with India having scored 523 runs in their first innings.Dravid followed up his first innings marathon effort with an unbeaten 72-run knock in the second innings as India chased down a 230-run target to win the match by 4 wickets and take a 1-0 series lead against Australia in Australia for the first time ever.Dravid's performance in the Adelaide Test is one of the most iconic innings in Indian cricket history. The match is often remembered for Dravid's remarkable batting and India's historic victory.Dravid's 233 in the first innings and 72* in the second exemplified his reputation as ""The Wall"", a batsman known for his patience, technique, and ability to perform under pressure. His heroic efforts in this match are often regarded as one of the greatest performances by an Indian batsman overseas.Dravid consistently performed against Australia across formats. His solid technique and temperament made him one of India's most dependable batters against the strong Australian bowling line-ups featuring the likes of Glenn McGrath Shane Warne , and Brett Lee Dravid's ability to bat long periods, his resilience, and his hunger for runs earned him great respect from Australia's players and fans alike.","Rahul Dravid has a stellar record against Australia.

Champions League: Harry Kane scores four as Bayern Munich put nine past Zagreb,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/champions-league/top-stories/champions-league-harry-kane-scores-four-as-bayern-munich-put-nine-past-zagreb/articleshow/113440303.cms,"NEW DELHI: Harry Kane led Bayern Munich to a 9-2 victory over Dinamo Zagreb at home on Tuesday, scoring four goals, including three penalties, to make history as the first team to score nine goals in a Champions League game.Kane scored the first goal of the match from the penalty spot after 19 minutes, and he surpassed Wayne Rooney 's record of 30 goals to reach 33 Champions League goals overall in the second half with a hat trick in Munich.After the break, Zagreb recovered and scored two goals in the space of two minutes to narrow the lead to 3-2 after five minutes of play, but Bayern's comfortable lead concealed a difficult spell. Manuel Neuer was injured, as per AFP.On his Champions League debut, former Crystal Palace forward Michael Olise scored twice, while Bayern also had goals from Raphael Guerreiro, Leroy Sane, and Leon Goretzka.The six-time Champions League champions had won each of their previous 20 competitive opening games, going all the way back to 2002-03.The result is one goal higher than Bayern's record-breaking 8-2 victory over Barcelona in the competition's quarterfinals in 2020.The German powerhouses gained more than just bragging rights from the huge victory, since goal differential will probably be even more crucial in the new Champions League single league system.Early on, Bayern dominated play, but their dominance went unrewarded. Goals from Serge Gnabry and Jamal Musiala were disallowed for little offsides, and Kane was eventually awarded a penalty after VAR flagged a foul on Aleksandar Pavlovic.Ivan Nevistic was sidelined by the England captain's successful penalty kick. Then, late in the first half, Bayern took control of the game with two goals in a five-minute span.On the 33rd minute, Guerreiro scored with a well-executed chested pass from Musiala, and on his Champions League debut, Olise headed in a corner from Joshua Kimmich After being pulled at halftime, Neuer, who had gone dangerously close to the halfway line to thwart a Zagreb counterattack in the opening minutes, appeared to unnerve the home team.The goal in the 48th minute was unexpected as Bruno Petkovic converted a feed from Ronael Pierre-Gabriel.Two minutes later, Takuya Ogiwara scored on the counter, and the home crowd started to question whether Bayern's trophy-less season from the previous year was returning.The next to score, though, was Kane, who scored three goals in 22 minutes in the second half to bring his total with Bayern to 53 goals in 50 games. Goretzka, Sane, and Olise also scored goals to ensure a convincing victory for the home team.After surpassing Barcelona's Xavi, Thomas Mueller-a two-time Champions League winner-was substituted in the second half for his 152nd appearance in the competition, making him the club's most active player.","Bayern Munich beat Dinamo Zagreb 9-2 to make Champions League history.

Among the many examples of athletic excellence and personal bonds, five iconic sports couples — Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf , Bastian Schweinsteiger and Ana Ivanovic , Bart Conner and Nadia Comaneci , David Lee and Caroline Wozniacki , Jozy Altidore and Sloane Stephens — showcase the perfect marriage of success in both love and their respective sporting careers.Their journeys, filled with triumphs and shared experiences, highlight how passion for sports can translate into strong, enduring relationships.Few couples in sports have achieved as much individual success as Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf. With a combined 30 Grand Slam singles titles, the tennis duo stands as one of the most successful pairs in sports history.Agassi, known for his powerful baseline game and charismatic personality, was a dominant force in tennis during the 1990s, while Graf’s elegance and dominance on the court earned her 22 Grand Slam titles.The couple, who married in 2001, initially kept their relationship low-key despite both being global superstars. Agassi and Graf have since focused on their family and philanthropic efforts, founding schools and engaging in charitable work through the Agassi Foundation.Schweinsteiger, the German football icon who lifted the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and Ana Ivanovic, a Serbian tennis star and former world No. 1, are one of sports' most adored couples. Their romance began after they both reached the pinnacle of their respective careers and culminated in a beautiful wedding in 2016.Schweinsteiger enjoyed a celebrated football career, winning titles with Bayern Munich and representing Germany on the international stage. Known for his leadership and midfield mastery, he was a key figure in Germany's World Cup-winning squad. Ivanovic, meanwhile, took the tennis world by storm when she won the French Open in 2008 and reached the top of the WTA rankings.The couple has since focused on family life, with Ivanovic retiring from tennis to prioritize motherhood, while Schweinsteiger pursued a brief career in broadcasting after his football retirement.Bart Conner and Nadia Comaneci’s love story is steeped in Olympic history.

Raina predicts a run-fest from the star batsman.""Rohit is a fantastic captain and he proved it when the Indian team lifted the T20 World Cup Trophy. But the focus will be on Virat Kohli's return to Red-ball cricket. He loves Test matches and gives a lot of respect to them. Leading to the WTC, India will play around 10 matches and I believe Virat will score a hell of runs in this Test cycle,"" Raina told IANS.This anticipation is fueled by Kohli's track record of thriving under pressure, evident in his recent performances at the T20 World Cup. Raina believes that the challenging bowling attacks of Bangladesh, New Zealand, and Australia will only serve to elevate Kohli's game.“Virat thrives under pressure, and this whole Test season will see him at the centre of action. Bangladesh has strong pacers, but Kohli has shown his prowess against bowlers like Haris Rauf. Challenges boost him, and I expect him to shine,” Raina added.While Rohit Sharma 's captaincy has been instrumental in India's recent successes, including their T20 World Cup victory, Kohli's return is an invaluable asset for India as they aim to solidify their position at the top of the WTC standings.India currently lead the WTC table with a commanding 68.52% win percentage, a testament to their dominance in the format.However, the scars of two consecutive WTC final defeats, against New Zealand and Australia, remain. This season presents an opportunity for India to exorcise those demons and claim the coveted Test mace.The upcoming series against Bangladesh, New Zealand, and Australia are not mere stepping stones for India.

It was a fiercely contested Ashes series , remembered not just for England's victory but for the controversial tactics employed by their captain, Douglas Jardine , to counter the batting brilliance of legendary Australian batter Don Bradman At the heart of the controversy was the ""Bodyline"" bowling strategy, in which England's fast bowlers, particularly Harold Larwood and Bill Voce , delivered short-pitched balls aimed at the batsman's body.With fielders positioned close on the leg side, the plan was to force the Australian batsmen into defensive positions or induce catches from their evasive shots. While this approach was technically within the laws of the game, it was viewed by many as unsportsmanlike due to its physical danger.Australia, especially Bradman, struggled to cope with the hostile bowling, leading to lower scores and England gaining a decisive advantage in the series.England ultimately won the five-match Test series 4–1, but the victory was overshadowed by the controversy and escalating tensions between the two teams. Several Australian players were injured, and the Australian public was outraged, accusing England of playing a dangerous and unethical brand of cricket.The Bodyline series strained diplomatic relations between England and Australia, with Australian officials protesting the tactics to the MCC ( Marylebone Cricket Club ).The episode prompted significant changes to cricket's rules, including restrictions on leg-side field placements and short-pitched bowling. While Jardine and Larwood defended their approach as a legitimate strategy to neutralize Bradman, the legacy of Bodyline remained contentious.Even today, the Bodyline series is remembered as a pivotal moment in cricket history, marking a turning point in the spirit of the game and highlighting the fine line between tactical brilliance and unsporting behavior.","The 1932–33 Bodyline series between England and Australia remains one of the most infamous episodes in cricket history.

Champions League: Kylian Mbappe strikes on Real Madrid debut in win over Stuttgart,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/champions-league/top-stories/champions-league-kylian-mbappe-strikes-on-real-madrid-debut-in-win-over-stuttgart/articleshow/113440443.cms,"NEW DELHI: Real Madrid defeated Stuttgart 3-1 on Tuesday to begin their trophy defence, with Kylian Mbappe scoring on his first Champions League game for the club.After Deniz Undav leveled Mbappe's opener moments into the second half, Antonio Rudiger headed home for the record 15-time champions in the 83rd minute.Endrick, a different rookie in the Champions League, completed Madrid's victory in stoppage time with a low drive, as per AFP.Stuttgart had a more interesting first half, but despite the visitors' valiant efforts, Carlo Ancelotti's club has a tendency of grinding out wins when the chips are down, and they still managed to take the three points.Eder Militao was deemed too injured to play from the start, therefore Ancelotti started full-back Dani Carvajal in central defense, with Jude Bellingham and Aurelien Tchouameni coming back from injury to play in midfield.After veteran Toni Kroos retired in the summer, Madrid lacked a certain balance, and the match swayed from end to end under the lights at Santiago Bernabeu.In the first half, Stuttgart of the Bundesliga, with a large contribution from Enzo Millot, enjoyed greater possession of the ball and the most promising opportunities.The French midfielder missed an early chance and had Thibaut Courtois tip over his threatening long-range attempt, which was the best of the Belgian's few stops.Alexander Nubel stopped two of Mbappe's attempts on goal as he attempted to score Madrid's first Champions League goal.While Maximilian Mittelstadt appeared to catch Rudiger with an awkward swipe, Rodrygo's effort was narrowly deflected over, and Madrid was given a penalty. However, the referee overturned the judgment after a VAR referral revealed no contact had occurred.Stuttgart's efforts were stopped by Courtois, and although Undav struck the crossbar, they were brought to earth at the beginning of the second half.Mbappe scored his fifth goal for the team, set up selflessly by Rodrygo, just 21 seconds after the break. Many others were still making their way back to their seats from the Bernabeu bars, so it was a case of blink and you'll miss it.The former striker for Paris Saint-Germain is as obsessed with lifting the cup as Real Madrid is, even though he was unable to win the top award in the club game while playing in France.Stuttgart failed to get the notification, and the German side leveled after Vinicius smashed a shot against the crossbar.After making several quick attempts to get near, Jamie Leweling hooked a corner back into the dangerous area, allowing Undav to go past Courtois.For the last ten minutes, Ancelotti substituted in 18-year-old Brazilian attacker Endrick in an attempt to win the game and launch the holders' title defense off to the ideal start.The goal came in the 83rd minute, but it wasn't from Madrid's galactic offensive players. Instead, it came from center-back Rudiger, who nodded in Luka Modric's corner.Vinicius squandered a fantastic opportunity to give Madrid the victory, but his countryman Endrick took full most of his one and only chance, finishing with a powerful shot from the edge of the box.",Real Madrid defeated Stuttgart 3-1 in their Champions League opener. Kylian Mbappe scored on his first Champions League game for the club. Deniz Undav and Antonio Rudiger scored for the record 15-time champions.

Their relentless pressure on the Jamshedpur defence eventually paid dividends in first-half stoppage time.A lapse in concentration from Jamshedpur goalkeeper Albino Gomes gifted Armando Sadiku a golden opportunity, which he clinically converted to give FC Goa a deserved lead going into the break.The second half witnessed a shift in momentum. Jamshedpur FC coach Khalid Jamil , renowned for his tactical acumen, introduced Jordan Murray into the fray, a substitution that would prove decisive.Meanwhile, Javier Siverio , a constant threat throughout the match, showcased his predatory instincts by earning and converting a penalty in the 75th minute, leveling the score for Jamshedpur.As the clock ticked down, both teams pressed for a winner, but it was Murray who emerged as the hero. In a moment of individual brilliance, the substitute, returning to his former club, curled in a stunning strike deep into stoppage time, silencing the home crowd and securing a dramatic victory for Jamshedpur.FC Goa, despite dominating for large periods, were made to rue missed opportunities. Jamshedpur, on the other hand, demonstrated their ability to weather storms and capitalize on crucial moments, a testament to their championship-winning pedigree.Jamshedpur FC will look to build on their opening day victory when they face Mumbai City FC on Saturday, while FC Goa will aim to bounce back against Mohammedan SC in Kolkata on the same day.","Jamshedpur FC orchestrated a stunning comeback to defeat FC Goa 2-1 in their Indian Super League opener at the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Fatorda.

However, as the sport grew in popularity, there was increasing demand for a more dynamic and inclusive competition.By the early 1990s, European football had evolved.Clubs, sponsors, and broadcasters were pushing for greater exposure and revenue.In response, UEFA, the governing body of European football, decided to rebrand and expand the European Cup. Thus, in 1992, the UEFA Champions League was born, replacing the old format with a more lucrative and widely-watched tournament.The name change wasn't just cosmetic; it signified a shift in structure and approach. The Champions League introduced a group stage format, allowing more teams to participate beyond just domestic champions.This made room for high-profile clubs from stronger leagues, who may have finished second or third in their national competitions, to compete on the continental stage.The group stages guaranteed more matches, ensuring fans, broadcasters, and sponsors more content and advertising opportunities.The rebranding also tapped into the growing commercialization of football. With bigger sponsorship deals, enhanced television rights, and global marketing, the Champions League quickly became the most prestigious and financially rewarding club competition in the world.Teams like Real Madrid , AC Milan , and Manchester United gained even more international fame through repeated successes.Today, the UEFA Champions League is synonymous with elite football, as the 2024-25 season extends to 36 teams and more matches, including the best clubs, players, and unforgettable moments.","The European Cup, established in 1955, initially featured a knockout format with only the domestic league champions from European countries.

There is no room for complacency and we need to remain alert throughout the 90 minutes,"" East Bengal coach George said after the game.Aman started the demolition job at the East Bengal ground, latching on to Jesin’s brilliant through-ball down the ball and dinked it over rival goalkeeper Laltu Mondal in the 9th minute.Jesin provided the assist to Vishnu for the second goal as well before joining the scoring party himself, giving finishing touch to a Vishnu pass.East Bengal finished the first half with 4-0 lead on the back of a ferocious counter-attack. East Bengal goalkeeper pulled off back-to-back saves denying Suruchi’s Debjit Basak and Faruk Sekh.

According to McGaha, the glittering ""angel hair"" was likely spider silk, carried by the wind during the arachnids' seasonal migration.Despite the scientific theories, those who witnessed the phenomenon remain convinced that what they saw was otherworldly.Sixty years later, the mystery of the UFOs over Florence endures, leaving the question—did aliens visit that day, or was it just nature playing tricks on the eyes?","Sixty years ago, a match between Fiorentina and Pistoiese came to a standstill when unidentified flying objects were spotted in the sky.

For that matter, we are representing eight states which I think is an additional responsibility. And when almost 60-62% players in ISL, I-League, second and third-division I-League are represented by players from this region, it's an even bigger responsibility,"" began Tamhane.""For me, that was the reason why I felt I should take up this offer at NEUFC because it's more challenging. If we can contribute even 50% of the work that we did at Bengaluru with regards to grassroots work, I think it will take Indian football a long way.""And the former BFC CEO has already put in place a long-term plan for NEUFC to nurture the raw and immense football talent in the region.""In the last 15 months, we have reached out to three state govts and are working together at a level where we can make meaningful contributions. For example, we are working with the Meghalaya govt and they are very enthusiastic about football in general. And we have signed a MoU with the govt and have been given 15 acres of land just outside Shillong to build our own residential Centre of Excellence for football and maybe next year, we will be able to start work on the academy,"" he explained.Admitting his joy at having their vision being supported by a state govt, Tamhane further added, ""The performance of the first team will always be our flagship goal but as a club how we can make these contributions at grassroots, in youth development and in the player pathway across the eight states is the plan.""We want to create small academies - what could be called satellite centres - where boys and girls belonging to U7, U9 and U11 age groups can come and train during the day and go back home. And once we have the Centre of Excellence in Meghalaya, the best players in the age groups from the eight states will graduate into U13, U15 and U17 residential setup in Shillong. So that's the larger goal which will maybe get done within the next five years.""While NEUFC start their eleventh season at ISL on Monday with the goal of repeating their Durand Cup feat, the whole of northeast will not just wait for the Highlanders' success in the field, but will also be eager to see the club and its CEO's vision replicated into success for the entire football-crazy region.",NorthEast United FC have won the Durand Cup for the first time.

Then in the 2020-21 season, he helped NorthEast United FC reach the playoffs of Indian Super League ( ISL ).It was the first time an Indian coach achieved the feat and considering Khalid had taken over the team midway into the season, it was quite an impressive accomplishment.The following season he was handed the reins of the team on a permanent basis and once again it was the first for an Indian coach.Sadly, despite the successes, the going hasn't always been easy for the former India player. ""Career has been tough and I haven't always got the chance,"" said Khalid during a brief interaction with TOI on the sidelines of the ISL media day held in Kolkata earlier this month.But after being named head coach of Jamshedpur FC for a period of two years, he has a chance to reclaim the glory and show what he is capable of achieving. ""I want to do something good. It's a great opportunity and it's quite incredible that I have been given this chance. So now that I have got the chance, I want to prove myself,"" said Khalid.To make sure he is able to do that, it's important that Jamshedpur FC begin their campaign on a positive note in the 11th edition of ISL.It's not going to be easy though since their first game of the season on Tuesday will be away to FC Goa , who had made it to the semifinals last season, followed by a home game against defending champions Mumbai City FC , and even Khalid acknowledged that.Also, they haven't had the perfect preparation in the leadup to the tournament as they failed to make it to the knockouts of Durand Cup after going down to Indian Army 2-3 in their final group game at home, which was quite shocking to say the least.Moreover, as Khalid said he didn't get to sign all the players he wanted because they weren't available and the club also lost a number of key players like Daniel Chima Chukwu, Elsinho, TP Rehenesh and Jeremy Manzorro.But on the positive side, they were able to get hold of some big names like Jordan Murray, Stephen Eze, Javi Hernandez, Lazar Cirkovic and Ashutosh Mehta.And the club also was able to retain two of their foreign stars from last season - Rei Tachikawa and Javier Siverio - both of whom sounded more than pleasedworking with Khalid.""Our style is very similar. Like me, he also wants to attack from the very first minute and it feels great to play under him,"" said Siverio, who won the ISL Trophy with Hyderabad FC in his debut season.""I think having Jamil from the start gives us an advantage from the last time. We have enough quality this season to reach top 6 of ISL and we are training everyday with the plan of the coach to win, that's our goal,"" he further added.As for Japan's Tachikawa, he also made it quite clear that he stayed in JFC only because of Khalid and is once again looking forward to playing with the youngsters. There are quite a number of them in the squad like Mohammad Sanan and Nikhil Barla and they didn't fail to impress last season.""They are young but they are not afraid to play. They work hard and I really like to play with them,"" added the Japanese midfielder.This mix of youth and experience will indeed be something to watch out for in the coming days and hopefully it will help the team finish among the top-six teams in the league. The last time they achieved it was in the 2021-22 season, when they won their maiden Shield under Owen Coyle, and it will be something that the Red Miners will be happy to repeat under Khalid after two below-par seasons.",Khalid Jamil won the I-League in 2016-17 with Aizawl FC.

Number two, Davis Cup is definitely a very important. It's more than a tournament, every player who is an Indian should participate if selected. So why not?"" Dhupar remarked. ""He (Nagal) said that he had a back injury and now he has entered this Hangzhou Open. He has become alright. My good wishes to him. Let the country decide. Let the people of India decide.""The AITA claims to have made efforts to persuade players, including Mukund Sasikumar, who is currently serving a suspension, to participate. However, these efforts were unsuccessful. ""And it is not the first time that Mukund refused, three times before. Let the people decide, the players decide what can we do? We tried our best to bring these people on board.

That's the good news. That the game in the country could be rapidly barrelling down a bottomless pit is the disturbing part. Until last week Sumit Nagal was the only Indian ranked in the top-300 of the singles ranking on the men's and women's Tours.That piece of statistic is abysmal by itself but hold it up against India being the only Asian nation to have made a Davis Cup final, not once, but thrice (1966, 74 and 87) and it's discomfiting.This week, Sahaja Yamalapalli cracked the top-300 at No. 298 on the WTA list. She's the India No.1.Outside of Nagal, there's little to inspire hope in singles on the ATP Tour. India has enjoyed success in doubles this year with Rohan Bopanna rising to No.1 in the individual doubles ranking, and with ten Indians logged in the top-150 things are looking good in the two-man act. But doubles is not the power index of the sport. That's precisely why an Indian side, sans the 27-year-old Nagal, failed to win so much as a set against Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group 1 tie over the weekend in Stockholm.Playing the singles for the hosts was Elias Ymer ranked 238 and Leo Borg 603. For the visitors it was Ramkumar Ramanathan, ranked 334 in singles and 144 in doubles, and Sriram Balaji, unranked in singles, and No 65 in doubles, playing singles and doubles.It was not the result so much but some of the choices made by non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal that sent shock waves through the fraternity. Playing 34-year-old Balaji, a doubles specialist, in a live singles rubber when 18-year-old Aryan Shah, the most improved of the Indian players in that bracket, was on the bench. Shah may not even have got the purchase Balaji managed in the match, but it would've counted as investment. Experience is real.Siddharth Vishwakarma, who replaced Balaji for the reverse rubber, turns 30 in a couple of weeks and is ranked just 46 slots higher than the teenager.The player community is not amused. They are all over social media and podcasts, exercising their vocal chords, taking on the All India Tennis Association .The timing is particularly sweet given that one of the most poorly performing associations in Indian sport has elections and the AGM scheduled for Sept 28. A 56-member Electoral College will decide on the posts of president, secretary and treasurer while also filling in the Executive Committee for a four-year term.Nagal, recovering from a back injury, joined Somdev Devvarman and Purav Raja on their podcast. The trio spoke on a range of issues from the anaemic levels of trust between players and officials to coaches dozing off during Davis Cup ties when players are on court and the dismal state of the National Tennis Centre in New Delhi. If it weren't real, it would make for good comedy.Over the weekend Bopanna called for a 'cultural shift in the sport', former pro Vishnu Vardhan followed up with a 'comprehensive plan' on X (formerly Twitter).Is AITA listening?When asked to comment on AITA's dismal track record the IOA and the sports ministry preferred silence.Does anyone care?Still should the rumbles from the player community come together in a united voice, it will be hard to muzzle.AITA will look to divide and rule as it has always done, offer a section of the players sops. It's up to the players to stand up not just for themselves, but for the generations to come.Using words is a good beginning, but they will need to do more. Be the change they wish to see.

"Grievances, yes, you still play for the country: Nandan Bal tells players",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/grievances-yes-you-still-play-for-the-country-nandan-bal-tells-players/articleshow/113411831.cms,"PUNE: Nandan Bal , the chairman of the national tennis selection committee , has lamented players making themselves unavailable for national duty due to their disenchantment with the national federation.A depleted Indian team suffered a humbling 0-4 rout to Sweden in Stockholm over the weekend, and it came after top singles players Sumit Nagal and Mukund Sasikumar as well as leading doubles player Yuki Bhambri were not available for selection for different reasons.While Nagal cited a back strain he had picked up during the US Open, Mukund was apparently banned for two ties - which even the player was not aware of - whereas Bhambri's reasons were not known.Nonetheless, it is understood that the trio as well as a few other players are upset with the national association's ( AITA ) way of functioning, the key aspect being a lack of professionalism in the team set up.For instance, the team doesn't have a designated professional manager and instead a state association official or an AITA office-bearer travels with the squad. AITA secretary Anil Dhupar accompanied the team to Sweden, in the latest instance.Bal admitted the players' grievances were genuine but still believed that those factors should not come in the way of representing the country.""I don't agree when a player says that, because the team atmosphere is not good or they are not happy with the association, that he will not play,"" Bal said.""When I play, I play for my country, I am not playing for AITA. Maybe I am from a different generation or think differently, but even after all those arguments, I will still play for my country.""Bal also did not agree that the players didn't find it worth taking a break from their professional careers, only to find that professionalism of the personnel attached to the team were not upto the standard expected at the top level.""I was part of the squad picked for the 1982 Asian Games (in Delhi). We were called for six two-week camps that year. That's 12 weeks, and here we are talking about 12 days a year,"" he said.""We were also making a living out of playing tennis. As a result, one can check the records, my ranking was somewhere around (a career-high 309) at the start of the year (1981), and then it dropped (to 503 at the end of 1983).""And the next year, I still played for my country.""Against Sweden, both the team selection and match tactics have come under scrutiny.After Nagal withdrew, the selection committee opted to bring in 16-year-old Manas Dhamne - ahead of 21-year-old Karan Singh, who was also ranked higher - as reserve while 18-year-old Aryan Shah, previously the reserve, became part of the nominations.Eventually, Rajpal played doubles specialists Ramkumar Ramanathan (who has not won a singles match on the ATP circuit since May), Sriram Balaji in both singles and doubles.Bal said the committee chose to give Dhamne the exposure once it became clear that the captain was ""reasonably certain"" to play Ramkumar and Balaji, and to some extent Niki Poonacha.""As much as I agree (with fielding Aryan in singles with an eye on future), he is also ranked higher, as a captain you would go with a player who has the experience of 30-40 ties, how the surface is playing, all that would have made an impact (on Rajpal's decision),"" he said.""He has played a lot of tennis. He has travelled a lot, he knows his tennis.""Ram and Balaji knew what the battle was, what they were getting into. They were dignified and fought it out.""Asked to sum up his thoughts on India's performance in Stockholm, Bal said, ""Disappointing.""""When you are playing with a half deck, the way we crumbled, says it all. Even with Sumit, Sasi and Yuki in the mix, Sweden would have been tough to beat at home anyway,"" he added.""Don't know if we can blame the players, or the captain or the coach, when we have two doubles players playing singles, it had to happen.""Doubles could have been closer, but when you are 0-2 down it is not easy to fight back. You need extra-ordinary players who can say, 'let's take it one match at a time'.""We did it against Brazil (in Chennai in 2010) when we had the class of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi .""",Top singles players Sumit Nagal and Mukund Sasikumar as well as leading doubles player Yuki Bhambri were not available for selection for different reasons.

"India fall to Sweden, face Davis Cup relegation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/india-fall-to-sweden-face-davis-cup-relegation/articleshow/113380459.cms,"RAJPAL LOSES COOL

India's lack of depth in singles and questionable team selection stood glaringly exposed on Sunday after Sweden completed a 4-0 rout over them in the Davis Cup World Group I tie in Stockholm.Trailing 0-2 after losing both the singles on Saturday, India faced a herculean task at the Royal Tennis Hall indoor stadium, and they simply capitulated.Ramkumar Ramanathan and Sriram Balaji went down 3-6, 4-6 against Andre Goransson and Filip Bergevi in an hour and 19 minutes in the doubles before Siddharth Vishwakarma, playing his maiden tie, was overwhelmed by Elias Ymer 6-2, 6-2 in the inconsequential reverse singles.The dead fifth rubber was called off, saving Rohit Rajpal 's team from further embarrassment.The result meant Sweden advanced to the Qualifiers next year while India are back to World Group Playoffs. The win also saw Sweden maintain their unbeaten record against India in six meetings, stretching back to their first encounter in a World Group quarterfinal in Bengaluru in 1985.The Scandinavians have lost only two rubbers and just one of them - Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi's win over Jonas Bjorkman and Simon Aspelin, Sweden's current captain, in their last meeting in New Delhi in 2005 - was a live one.The chemistry between Goransson and Bergevi, both 30-year-olds but ranked 66 and 125 respectively, belied the fact that they have played only five times as a team in Davis Cup and their last pairing on the pro circuit was in 2018 in the Futures.""We have known each other from the age of 10, that's 20 years now,"" Bergevi said.Ramkumar and Balaji speak the same language and hail from the same state, too, but the partnership lacked the intensity and spark the Swedes displayed.More interestingly, Goransson revealed both play on the ad-court and yet, such is the understanding between them that it didn't stop them from dominating the Indians on Sunday.The home pair saved a breakpoint early on in the third game before breaking Ramkumar to go up 4-2 before taking the first set.Goransson and Bergevi then had a tiny opening in the third game of the second set when they put Balaji's serve under pressure.They then turned up the heat in the seventh game, again on Balaji's serve, producing two devastating service returns down the line in a row. The Indians saved two breakpoints before Balaji put a volley on Bergevi's service return into the net to go down 3-4. There was no coming back from there.India's Davis Cup captain Rohit Rajpal reacted angrily to criticism after the team's abject surrender to Sweden in Stockholm. ""You know, since I took over, they have been saying something negative in order to get a reaction out of me,"" Rajpal said when a reporter mentioned about comments in social media calling for a change in captaincy. ""I am here for my country. I have just one thing to say (to critics on the outside), shut up. If you really care, then don't sit there. Get out of here.""","India lose 4-0 to Sweden in Davis Cup World Group I tie in Stockholm. India's lack of depth in singles and questionable team selection exposed.
