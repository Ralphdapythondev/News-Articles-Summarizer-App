BENGALURU:was Hardik Singh's emotional appeal to his then skipper Manpreet Singh as the Indian flag went up in Tokyo during the medal ceremony in 2021. He meant they had to convert the bronze medal to gold in Paris. Manpreet has gone from skipper to a senior statesman as India will take the field under the leadership of Harmanpreet Singh .But Hardik's words still echo in the midfield stalwart's ears. That, along with his soon-to-be three-year-old daughter Jasmine Kaur , fuelled the 32-year-old's desire to give the Olympics one last shot.Manpreet along with star custodian PR Sreejesh will make his fourth Olympics appearance. From the low of finishing last at the London Games in 2012, to leading India to the podium in Tokyo, the Jalandhar-born seasoned campaigner has seen it all. Although the captain's armband has switched hands, Manpreet reiterates, ""that hasn't changed the commitment or responsibilities I shoulder"".Speaking to TOI about the senior team's journey that began in 2011, Manpreet said, ""It has been a rollercoaster ride. My first Olympics in London was a nightmare. After that we progressed to winning, making the quarterfinals and eventually the podium finish in Tokyo.""Manpreet has realistic targets, and the 2028 Los Angeles Games are not really on the radar.""This is probably my last Olympics. I want to give my best as I don't want to leave with any regrets,"" he remarked. In Paris, Manpreet, a blend of speed and skill, will play a key role as a playmaker. Superior game awareness, effective communication and the ability to switch roles in quick time are Manpreet's qualities which will hold India in good stead.Also, under coach Criag Fulton, Manpreet has evolved. His ability to effect accurate passes is being put to good use and he has also been stepping back to allow youngsters Vivek Sagar and Hardik Singh to move deeper into the opposition's half. ""This is almost the same team that has been playing together since the Asian Games . The youngsters have got enough game-time to blend in. We have been able to understand each other well,"" said Manpreet.Off the field, Manpreet is among the seniors in the team preparing the five debutants for the sporting extravaganza.""Some of us have been sharing our experiences and the challenges from the previous Olympics. At the Games Village, there are thousands of athletes, meeting some of them is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but the message to the youngsters is clear. '(don't get lost in the carnival). This is the most important 15 days of our life.""Among those in the stands in Paris will be Manpreet's wife Illi Saddique and Jasmine. The veteran wants to pull all stops to ensure his daughter remembers him as a hero on the field.""The medal in Tokyo was the beginning of a bigger dream and we have all worked towards it. My daughter will be at the Olympics. I want her to cheer for the country and watch us win a medal. I want her to be proud of me. I sacrificed a lot to be here and serve my country. I want to make that count and leave behind a lasting legacy,"" Manpreet said.",Manpreet has gone from skipper to a senior statesman as India will take the field under the leadership of Harmanpreet Singh.

Shafali Verma stars as India thrash Nepal to qualify for women's Asia Cup semifinals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/shafali-verma-stars-as-india-thrash-nepal-to-qualify-for-womens-asia-cup-semifinals/articleshow/111968229.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's explosive batter Shafali Verma led the charge with a remarkable 48-ball 81, her career-best, propelling the defending champions to a decisive 82-run victory over Nepal In a commanding display at the Women's Asia Cup T20 tournament at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla on Tuesday.This win ensured India's progression to the semifinals.The match witnessed India experimenting with their batting lineup, with Shafali Verma and Dayalan Hemalatha opening the innings. The duo provided a stellar start, amassing 122 runs in the first 14 overs, setting a strong foundation for India's innings.Opting to bat first after winning the toss, India capitalized on the opportunity with Hemalatha contributing a valuable 47 runs. The partnership's aggressive approach was instrumental in India reaching a competitive total of 178 for three. Jemimah Rodrigues further bolstered the innings with an unbeaten 28 off 15 balls, enhancing the score with three boundaries in the concluding over.Facing a challenging target, Nepal's pursuit was hindered by India's proficient bowling attack, limiting them to 96 for nine in their allotted 20 overs. The requirement for Nepal to surpass Pakistan's net run rate and secure a semifinal berth necessitated achieving the target within 10 overs, a feat they were unable to accomplish.Deepti Sharma emerged as the standout bowler for India, claiming three wickets for 13 runs. She was well-supported by Radha Yadav and Arundhati Reddy, who took two wickets each, contributing to a formidable bowling performance that stifled Nepal's chase.Nepal's innings was characterized by regular wicket losses, with their top order struggling against India's seam and spin attack. Arundhati Reddy's early dismissal of Nepal's openers set the tone, while Deepti Sharma's all-round performance, including a direct hit, showcased India's dominance in the field.Shafali Verma's innings was a highlight, featuring an array of shots that put the Nepalese bowlers under pressure. Her aggressive batting, marked by 12 fours and a six, was particularly punishing against medium pacer Kabita Joshi and off-spinner Sabnam Rai. Hemalatha, despite a slower start, managed to support the innings effectively, contributing with both boundaries and a six.The match also witnessed moments of resilience from Nepal, including a missed catch opportunity that could have broken the opening partnership earlier. However, India's batting prowess and disciplined bowling ultimately proved too strong for Nepal, confirming India's place in the semifinals alongside Pakistan from Group A.",India beat Nepal by 82 runs to reach semifinals of the Women's Asia Cup T20 tournament. Shafali Verma scored a career-best 81 off 48 balls.

ICC board pushes for forensic audit into T20 World Cup financial fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/icc-board-pushes-for-forensic-audit-into-t20-world-cup-financial-fraud/articleshow/111962215.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a latest development, the three-member committee, appointed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), to conduct the review into the delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 , is in favour of a thorough forensic audit and is likely to appoint an external company specifically for this purpose.The development comes a day after ICC appointed Roger Twose , Lawson Naidoo and Imran Khwaja to probe the matter and has been reportedly given a free hand to conduct the investigation.The ICC members have reached a consensus, with all votes cast in support of launching an investigation into the recently concluded T20 World Cup held in the United States and West Indies. The governing body suspects that the tournament suffered from fiscal impropriety and poor financial oversight.“It was unanimously decided to give the committee a free hand to conduct the review. There is a bright possibility of an external company conducting a thorough forensic audit of the 2024 T20 World Cup. Every detail will be looked into and every transaction will be thoroughly checked,” News18 quoted an official in the know of things.Two high-ranking officials at the ICC tendered their resignations last week following extensive periods of service. Chris Tetley, who oversaw events, and Claire Furlong, responsible for marketing and communications, both stepped down from their positions at the governing body for cricket. The departures of these long-serving executives mark a significant change in the ICC's leadership structure.The reasons behind their decisions to leave the organisation have not been publicly disclosed. However, their contributions to the ICC over the years have been notable, with Tetley and Furlong playing key roles in shaping the organization's events and communication strategies.The ICC held its four-day Annual Conference in Colombo, Sri Lanka, which ended on Monday. The conference included meetings of the Chief Executives' Committee (CEC) and the Finance & Commercial Affairs Committee.According to reliable sources, the ICC members hold a firm belief that if the ongoing investigations uncover any instances of financial impropriety, the consequences will extend to the highest levels of leadership. This would include the necessity for both the ICC chair, Greg Barclay, and the CEO, Geoff Allardice, to resign from their positions.Moreover, it has been reported that the committee has been granted full authority to closely monitor the roles of Tetley and Furlong. The committee will decide whether it is necessary to restrict their workplace access immediately or place them under suspension while the investigation is ongoing.“Two ICC employees have already submitted their resignations but the committee will look into their roles during the World Cup. The committee will be given a free hand to decide whether there is a need to place them on suspension or restrict access to work. The idea is to not have any sort of hindrance or roadblocks during the thorough investigation,” the official further added.“Not only is there a need to do the right thing but to also ensure that the ICC is also seen as doing the right thing. As the global governing body of the game, the ICC is accountable to its members and fans all over the world. Transparency has to be the key at all times and unfortunately, it was missing in many ways all this while,” say those tracking developments.","ICC members have reached a consensus, with all votes cast in support of launching an investigation into the recently concluded T20 World Cup held in the United States and West Indies.

COLOMBO: As was widely expected, the International Cricket Council ( ICC ), soon after the conclusion of its four-day Annual Conference here on Monday, announced that it had formed a three-member committee to ""review the delivery"" of the T20 World Cup which was co-hosted by the USA and the West Indies last month.The committee includes three directors-former New Zealand batsman Roger Twose , Lawson Naidoo and Imran Khwaja, who is the deputy chair of the ICC.""The ICC Board confirmed that there will be a review into the delivery of the ICC T20 World Cup,"" the ICC stated in a release soon after the conclusion of its Annual General Meeting (AGM).Reportedly, the ICC has incurred losses over $20m for conducting matches in New York, Florida and Dallas. Apparently, the tournament's expenses for the US leg overshot the allocated budget by a long margin, something that was pointed out by Pankaj Khimji of Oman.It was reported that the resignation of two ICC officials was related to the conduct of the World Cup, although a reliable source in the ICC has maintained that both Claire Furlong and Chris Tetley had made up their mind to quit last year itself but were asked to stay back for the Women's T20 World Cup (Furlong), and the Champions Trophy next year (Tetley).Meanwhile, TOI understands that there was no discussion on theICC Champions Trophy , to be held in Pakistan in 2025, or India's participation in the tournament.In what is certainly a big setback for cricket in the United States just a few days after their national team stunned everyone by beating Pakistan and making it to the T20 World Cup Super 8s, USA Cricket, along with Cricket Chile, has been formally put on notice and given 12 months to comply with ICC's Associate Membership criteria.Apparently, the USAC has been in breach of Associate Members Protocols on two counts - not having a fulltime CEO and not having recognition of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee.The ICC Board has approved an expansion of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup to 16 teams in 2030, aligning with its ongoing commitment to equity between the men's and women's games.The CEC approved the appointment of ex-Australian pacer Paul Reiffel to the Cricket Committee as the Elite Panel representative.","International Cricket Council forms three-member committee to ""review the delivery"" of the T20 World Cup.

As the rock, Root is obviously key to that, and I love that he kept the reverse-scoop in the locker until he was past 100 and England’s lead was massive.""Against an attack like the West Indies in these conditions, you expect him to get a century.

With 11,940 runs and 32 centuries to his name in Tests , he is on the verge of breaking several English records currently held by Alastair Cook , including most Test hundreds (33) and highest run-scorer (12,472).Root is also poised to become only the seventh batter in history to score 12,000 Test runs, having recently overtaken Brian Lara 's tally.While Vaughan's claim is bold, Root's recent form and career trajectory suggest he has the potential to challenge Tendulkar's record.

I felt that a lot.""Dravid, a batting legend, had never won an ICC title during his playing career.In the days following the T20 World Cup triumph, it was announced that former India opening batsman and double World Cup-winner Gautam Gambhir would succeed Dravid as the new head coach.Gambhir is set to commence his tenure with the upcoming white-ball tour of Sri Lanka, which is scheduled to begin on July 27.Ashwin acknowledged Dravid's accomplishments, even in the face of adversity and disapproval throughout his playing and coaching career, such as the early elimination from the 2007 50-over World Cup.""I want to talk about a person who is sacred. 2007, 50-over World Cup. India gets knocked out. Rahul Dravid, the captain at that point in time. He does not captain the one-day side after that. He has been with the Indian team. If something does not go well, if the Indian team goes out, if they lose a match, immediately, they ask what Dravid is doing,"" said Ashwin.""I know what he has been doing with this team for the past two-three years. I know how balanced he has been. I know how hard he has worked to change this approach. I know what he has given each of his players. Even when he is just sitting at home, he has been planning how to do this and that,"" he concluded.In the thrilling conclusion of the T20 World Cup 2024, India's batting duo of Virat Kohli and Axar Patel played crucial roles in setting a competitive target. Kohli's impressive knock of 76 runs, combined with Patel's quick-fire 47, helped India reach a total of 176 for 7, bringing them closer to realizing their dream of lifting the trophy.The Indian bowlers faced a challenging task in defending the total, but they held their nerves in a tense finish. The pace trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya and Arshdeep Singh proved instrumental in securing the victory. Bumrah's miserly spell of 2/18, Pandya's crucial 3/20, Arshdeep's euqally critical 2/20 in the death overs suffocated the opposition's chase, ultimately leading to a narrow seven-run win for the 'Men in Blue,' as they clinched their second T20 World Cup title.",Ravichandran Ashwin says he was deeply moved when Rahul Dravid embraced the ICC T20 World Cup trophy and shed tears after guiding the team to their first ICC title in 11 years. India beat South Africa by seven runs in the final on June 29. Former India batsman and double World Cup-winner Gautam Gambhir will take over as head coach.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111944544,imgsize-91316,width-400,resizemode-4/111944544.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has expressed strong opinions regarding India's reported reluctance to travel to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025.Speaking on his official YouTube channel, Ali criticized several international cricket boards for aligning with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).""5-6 boards jo haina dum hilate huye woh baat karenge jo Jay Shah bolenge (Those 5-6 boards just follow whatever Jay Shah says).If he says the Champions Trophy will be in Pakistan, they’ll agree. If he says it’ll be a hybrid model, they’ll go with that too. It’s because when their players play in the IPL, BCCI pays their boards a huge amount whether it’s the English board, New Zealand board, West Indies board, or Australian board,"" Ali stated.Ali also commented on the recent developments involving the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) and its Chairman Mohsin Naqvi .""PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi has been given a lollipop. Basically, he's been told (by other boards) that after the Champions Trophy, we (Pakistan) should play a bilateral series against India. Whether it's in Australia or England, they'll (other boards) convince India to play.""Expressing his personal stance, Ali argued that Pakistan should not concede to playing the bilateral series in a third country if India are unwilling to play in Pakistan.""I think that if the bilateral series isn't happening in India or Pakistan, the Pakistan board should say no to playing in a third country. If India are not willing to play in our country, then we shouldn't agree to play the series in another country either,"" he added.The reaction comes amid reports that the Indian cricket team is unlikely to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025.The BCCI plans to request the International Cricket Council (ICC) to adopt a hybrid model, potentially relocating India's matches to Sri Lanka or Dubai.The ICC Champions Trophy is scheduled for February to March 2025 in Pakistan.Due to tense political relationships, Team India has not played in Pakistan since the Asia Cup in 2008. The last bilateral series between the two nations occurred in 2012-13, with India hosting Pakistan for two T20Is and three ODIs. Since then, their encounters have been limited to ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup.A similar situation arose during last year's Asia Cup, initially planned for Pakistan. However, all of India's matches, including those against Pakistan, were held in Sri Lanka, with the final taking place in Colombo, where India emerged victorious.",Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has expressed strong opinions regarding India's reported reluctance to travel to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025.

Players won't be able to pick and choose series under Gautam Gambhir and Ajit Agarkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/players-wont-be-able-to-pick-and-choose-series-under-gautam-gambhir-and-ajit-agarkar/articleshow/111928397.cms,"NEW DELHI: Both the new head coach and the chairman of selectors appeared entirely in sync as they made it clear that the days of cherry-picking series by citing workload management could be over. Gautam Gambhir 's plain-speak and Ajit Agarkar 's lucidity are going to make for a heady combo.They clarified certain difficult decisions, but in other cases, they were vague enough to leave room for interpretations.Although neither Gambhir nor Agarkar are particularly large on the outside, anyone in the Indian cricket community will attest to the fact that these are two well-observed, intelligent people whose opinions don't easily shift.They appeared to be prepared to back up their words as they presented a united front at their first joint press appearance.Although Agarkar is officially starting his second year as chairman, this is actually a fresh start for both of them, much like it is for Gambhir, where they can work together to develop a plan for the 2027 ODI World Cup What did one learn most from the joint news conference between Gambhir and Agarkar prior to their Sri Lankan tour?The largest one appears to be workload management.Indian cricket's thorny word will once more control the air, but this time, it's obvious that the rules for bowlers and hitters will differ.""I've said it before, workload management for someone like (Jasprit) Bumrah is important. If you are a batter who is in good form, might as well play all the games,"" Gambhir was as straight as ramrod in his reply when asked about his take on the issue, according to PTI.Although it was widely anticipated that ODI and Test captain Rohit Sharma and top batsman Virat Kohli would miss the three matches in Sri Lanka, their attendance ultimately suggests that both seniors will likely play as many series as feasible.""Now that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will play only two formats, I expect them to be available for most games,"" Gambhir addressed the issue with a lot of clarity just like chairman Agarkar was up and ready to explain what went against Hardik Pandya , who was considered to be a natural successor to Rohit, at least in the T20 format.""You (would) want a captain that's going to be more likely to play all the games,"" one couldn't get a more crystal clear answer to a pointed question.What was even more encouraging was that, in contrast to previous selection committee chairs, Agarkar considered the view of the changing room in addition to his instincts on leadership abilities.""""Why Surya was made captain? Because he is one of the deserving candidates. The one we know has been around the dressing room over the last one year, you get feedback from the dressing room a lot.""He has got a good cricketing brain and he is still one of the best T20 batters in the world,"" Agarkar elaborated.One point was made repeatedly during the 27-minute press conference. Stars can't just pick and choose anymore.Pandya's skill set is rare, and Agarkar acknowledged that, but he also made it clear that the selection committee is not to be taken for granted.""Fitness, obviously, has been a challenge for him over the last few years and then it becomes a little bit more difficult for him and even as selectors,"" he said.With same elegance, Agarkar addressed the difficult question about KL Rahul being passed up for captaincy.""I wasn't there when KL was superseded; I wasn't the selector firstly.""Subsequently, the Duleep Trophy came up, and Agarkar made it quite evident that the majority of Indian Test squad candidates, if not all of them, will participate in at least one match of the competition prior to the start of India's unprecedented 10-Test season on September 19.Regarding Ravindra Jadeja , Agarkar clarified that the veteran all-around player was not removed from the ODI squad; nevertheless, his justification did suggest that two players with very similar skill sets might not be included in an ODI lineup.""It would have been really pointless to take both him and Akshar for this short series...So, no, not at all dropped,"" he said on Jadeja.After that, Gambhir had to face the unspoken but significant topic of speculation regarding his connection with Kohli, which the straight shooter dismissed as ""good for TRP.""Although Gambhir may come across as a ""My Way or High Way"" kind of guy, his message was that he wanted to be the one who made sure everyone in the dressing room was pleased.And what qualifies as a happy dressing room?""A winning dressing room,"" as Gambhir put it.",Gautam Gambhir and Ajit Agarkar hold joint press conference ahead of Sri Lanka tour. Both appear to be in sync on key issues such as workload management and captaincy. Both believe Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will play as many series as possible.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111928328,imgsize-65968,width-400,resizemode-4/111928328.jpg"

The duo laid a solid foundation with a 122-run partnership in 14 overs.Subsequently, S Sajana (10) and Jemmimah Rodrigues (28) contributed to India's total of 178/3, which proved sufficient as Nepal could only manage 96/9 in their 20 overs, resulting in an 82-run defeat.Mandhana acknowledged the importance of providing game time to the middle-order batters, who had limited opportunities in previous matches and the recent South Africa series.""As an opener, you don't get a lot of games where you don't bat. Much needed game time for all the other batters. The middle order hasn't batted in the previous games. The conditions were different and it is always good to have game time under your belt. The middle order didn't get time in the South Africa series as well, so good they could spend some time in the middle,"" Mandhana said during the post-match presentation.Despite India's comprehensive victory over Bangladesh in a recent away series, Mandhana cautioned against complacency, emphasizing the need to approach each opponent with equal focus and preparation.""Not only this tournament, but also in the last five or six months, the preparations started post WPL, there are a lot of fine tuning to be done and we have to keep improving, cannot go into a World Cup under prepared. You don't take any team (semifinal opponents) lightly, we have two days to rest and practice before we go out and apply ourselves,"" she added.Shafali Verma, adjudged the player of the match for her blistering 48-ball 81, attributed her consistent performance to backing her strengths and executing her plans effectively.""Double hundred is big for any batter and I got plenty of confidence from that innings, I wasn't in good form before that but the innings helped me get back my confidence,"" Shafali stated.Nepal's captain, Indu Barma , expressed pride in her team's efforts and acknowledged the valuable lessons learned from their matches against India and Pakistan.""I am proud of my team. The effort we put in, we realised our weakness and will come back stronger. It was a great exposure to play against India.

He can also be considered as a giant killer as his opponent fought under the banner of the Ashish Shelar Group.Shelar is the treasurer of the BCCI and among the prominent BJP leaders in the state. Of the 373 eligible voters, 335 voted during the elections which included the representatives of the maidan clubs, office clubs, school and college clubs and the international players.Ajinkya said that a lot of “unseen powers” backed him during the elections when quizzed about not fighting the election under any banner like his opponent.“It was cricket that was backing me and there were a lot of unseen powers in the play as well. Slowly you will know the unseen powers who were backing me. Our mentor is Sharad Pawar. We have been following him for long,” said Ajinkya.He added: “This is the victory of maidan cricket. It’s a triumph of all the maidan club secretaries, schools and college, gymkhana secretaries and the former cricketers.

We will plan a career fair, wherein we will invite all the government organisations, corporates and we as the MCA apex council will request HR departments to offer permanent jobs to our players.

He met Manolo during training camps in Finland and Sweden during the Covid-19 pandemic, and has been with him since his first season at Hyderabad FC in 2020.Barroso was part of Cesar Ferrando’s coaching staff at Jamshedpur and has extensive experience of working in India.The only new member of Manolo’s coaching staff, outside Goa, would be goalkeeper’s coach Marc Gamon , who worked for two seasons with the Spaniard at Hyderabad FC before taking up a job in Belgium.Manolo is already preparing for his first assignment with the national team in Sept and will most certainly skip the Bhausaheb Bandodkar Memorial Trophy where part of the dates clash with the international window.“The AIFF will confirm the teams for the Sept window in the next couple of days but most certainly the two opponents will be from Africa and Oceania,” said a senior official. “Since it’s already late in confirming the teams, they won’t be from the top 100. In fact, most certainly lower ranked than India.”The AIFF is expected to host the matches in Hyderabad.For the October window, India will travel to Vietnam for a friendly tri-nation series which also involves Lebanon. As per the latest FIFA rankings, Vietnam (116) and Lebanon (117) are placed ahead of India (124).“Manolo has to strike a balance between club and country commitments, but he’s taken up the job knowing he is ready for it. For the first few windows, there will be little time for preparations since the Indian Super League (ISL) will be in progress. He has to be ready for the challenge,” said the official.The experienced Spanish coach has trained teams at all levels, including grassroots, youth, third division, second division and the LaLiga with Las Palmas in 2017. He has taken up a national team job for the first time in his over two-decade long coaching career.","Manolo Marquez will have Benito Montalvo as his assistant and Jose Carlos Barroso as the strength and conditioning coach, both working with Goa at the moment.
