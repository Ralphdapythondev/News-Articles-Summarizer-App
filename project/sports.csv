NEW DELHI: When the Indian T20 team takes on Zimbabwe in a five-match series that begins in Harare on Saturday, they will be going on a voyage of self-discovery without their regular talismans, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, in an attempt to uncover their future treasures.Shubman Gill , a reserve on the T20 World Cup team, and a number of IPL players will press the refresh button even as the excitement of winning the T20 World Cup spreads around India.During the series, which is totally slated to be played in Zimbabwe's capital, all of the newcomers are anticipated to make their international debut.Two youngsters who could make their debuts are Riyan Parag , a young Assamese player who has shown much of potential as a T20 hitter, and Punjab's Abhishek Sharma , who had an amazing IPL season with Sunrisers Hyderabad. They both meet every requirement for this format.Even both Rohit and Kohli have missed a number of bilateral series in the last few years, particularly in the shortest format, their official departure from the format will undoubtedly be felt more keenly.It will be difficult to match the abilities and qualities that the two contemporary greats brought to the table, but as is the way of things, the old guard must give way to the new one.Zimbabwe isn't the strongest opponent by any means, but in the Twenty20 format, the difference between the two teams isn't as great as it is in the other two formats.The hosts, led by the fearless Sikandar Raza , a former IPL player for the Punjab Kings, could be quite the force on windy days at the Harare Sports Club, where the ball will jiggle around as the afternoon progresses.These youngsters will remain in the running when the world champion team's first team members return to national service thanks to a few strong performances in this series.From the third match onwards, Shivam Dube, Sanju Samson, and Yashasvi Jaiswal will be available; some of the young men will only have a few games to demonstrate their abilities.There won't be many openings in the starting eleven as players like Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya , and Suryakumar Yadav, who is expected to be his deputy, return to T20Is in the future. In the shortest format, the national team will play 34 games from now until the 2026 T20 World Cup in India.Although captain Gill is anticipated to open, it remains to be seen if his closest friend Abhishek earns his first India cap or if seasoned CSK captain and captain of the squad that won gold at the Asian Games, Ruturaj Gaikwad, is selected.Gaikwad might bat third or switch places with the Punjab southpaw if Abhishek begins. Compared to Abhishek, Parag has a better chance of making his debut because he can bat at No. 4, a position he has carved out for the Royals.In this new look lineup, Rinku Singh-the Indian T20 team's designated finisher for years to come-is projected to bat at No. 5, with Dhruv Jurel or Jitesh Sharma batting at No. 6 and wearing the huge gloves.Based on the selection pattern, Jurel started this series as the backup keeper behind Sanju Samson, but Jitesh was a late addition due to the World Cup squad players' unavailability.As a result, Jurel, who had a strong Test debut against England, would probably start the first two matches before Samson gets there.A highly consistent death bowler, Mukesh Kumar, might be the third seamer to surpass Harshit Rana, who is a superior slogger with the willow, in the bowling department. Avesh Khan and Khaleel Ahmed are the two standbys during the T20 World Cup.With his versatility, Washington Sundar will keep his position until Dube gets there, while leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi is anticipated to participate in every match.Shubman Gill (c), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Abhishek Sharma, Rinku Singh, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Riyan Parag, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Khaleel Ahmed, Mukesh Kumar, Tushar Deshpande, Sai Sudharsan, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Harshit RanaSikandar Raza (captain), Faraz Akram, Brian Bennett, Johnathan Campbell, Tendai Chatara, Luke Jongwe, Innocent Kaia, Clive Madande, Wessly Madhevere, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Wellington Masakadza, Brandon Mavuta, Blessing Muzarabani, Dion Myers, Antum Naqvi, Richard Ngarava, Milton Shumba",The Indian T20 team takes on Zimbabwe in a five-match series that begins in Harare on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Star India batter Virat Kohli had a torrid run throughout the T20 World Cup , scoring 5 single digit scores. But in the final against South Africa in Barbados, the veteran rose to the occasion in style, scoring a superb knock that helped India win the title.When the chips were down and India were reeling early, Kohli hit a perfect 76-run knock to take India to a solid total.The bowlers then successfully defended the total in a thrilling finale as India ended an over-a-decade long ICC title drought.After clinching the T20 World Cup title, the team on Thursday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi , where he asked Kohli about his see-saw journey at the World Cup.Taking the PM through his title journey, Kohli admitted that he was not confident while batting throughout the World Cup but surrendered himself to the situation in the final.""I will always cherish that day (of the final). Throughout the tournament, I was not able to make the contributions that I wanted to make. At one time, I told Rahul bhai, 'I haven't done justice to myself and the team till now'. He said, 'when the situation will arise, I trust that you will perform', Kohli said.""The way my tournament was going, I didn't have that much confidence when I was going in to play. Had doubts whether I would be able to perform the way I wanted. When we went in to play (in the final), and when I got three boundaries in first 4 balls, I told Rohit, 'what a game this is. One day you feel you won't be able to score a single run, and the other day, everything falls into place and good things happen'.""When wickets fell early, I understood that I had to surrender to the situation, for the team. The only thing I was focussing on was what's necessary for the team. I felt, I was pushed into that zone. I was into that moment.Later I realised that whatever is supposed to happen, it happens. It was bound to happen to me and to the team (title win). From the situation we won the final, we lived each and every single delivery towards the end. From the point where the final turned around. What was going through us, we cannot explain,"" Kohli said.The PM hosted the T20 World Cup-winning Indian cricket team for breakfast during which, he said, there were 'memorable' conversations on the side's experiences through the marquee event co-hosted by USA and the West Indies.The Rohit-led squad, that won the title after defeating South Africa by seven runs in the final last week, arrived in Delhi early Thursday morning after being stranded in Bridgetown, Barbados for five days due to a category 4 hurricane.The PM was flanked by Rohit and outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid in the group picture.Several players later shared photos with the PM.","Virat Kohli had a torrid run throughout the T20 World Cup, scoring 5 single digit scores.

The emotions could be seen this time and the way you shook your legs when you went to take the trophy,"" Modi asked Rohit.""Sir, this was a day we had been waiting for a long time so I was told by my teammates don't go for a simple walk, do something different when you go to lift the trophy, "" Rohit responded.The PM then hilariously asked if it was Chahal's idea.

Euro 2024: France beat Portugal on penalties to set up semi-final against Spain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/euro-2024-france-beat-portugal-on-penalties-to-set-up-semi-final-against-spain/articleshow/111526922.cms,"NEW DELHI: Theo Hernandez 's successful penalty kick secured France's hard-fought victory over Portugal in a tense Euro 2024 quarter-final match on Friday. The game ended 0-0 after 120 minutes, with France prevailing 5-3 in the shoot-out. This match is likely to be remembered as Cristiano Ronaldo 's final appearance in the tournament.France converted all their penalties, setting up a semi-final clash with Spain.Portugal's Joao Felix was the only player to miss, hitting the post with his team's third attempt.The shoot-out triumph was a welcome change for France, who had previously suffered penalty heartbreaks in major tournaments. They lost the 2022 World Cup final to Argentina and were eliminated from the last Euros by Switzerland in the round of 16, both via penalties. Additionally, they were defeated by Italy in the 2006 World Cup final, which was also held in Germany.Kylian Mbappe, who had missed the decisive penalty against Switzerland, was substituted by Bradley Barcola during extra time and did not participate in the shoot-out. Barcola, along with Ousmane Dembele, Youssouf Fofana, and Jules Kounde, successfully converted their spot-kicks for France.""I am proud of my players. Even if we are not doing everything perfectly we don't give up,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps.""Once again we are in the semi-finals. I will savour this a little even if we have another game coming up.""Mbappe struggled to find his rhythm throughout the match, as he continues to adapt to playing with a protective mask covering his recently fractured nose, an injury sustained during France's initial encounter against Austria.Despite the setback, the young forward will have another opportunity to showcase his talents in the upcoming semi-final. On the other hand, Ronaldo, at the age of 39, seems to have made his final appearance in the European Championship.This tournament marked Ronaldo's sixth European Championship, but he was unable to contribute to his record-breaking tally of 14 goals in the competition, having failed to find the back of the net in all five of Portugal's matches in Germany.Although Ronaldo successfully converted his penalty, which was Portugal's first, Roberto Martinez's squad has been eliminated after failing to score in over six hours of play. They advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating Slovenia on penalties following a goalless draw in the round of 16, but this time, they fell short in what turned out to be a lackluster match in Hamburg.""In the same way that it was maybe cruel for Slovenia in the last 16, today it was cruel for us. That's football ,"" Bernardo Silva told CNN.France and Portugal, both underperforming in the tournament, faced off in a match that lacked intensity but had moments of excitement in the second half.Portugal started to threaten with midfield runners getting into the box, as Bruno Fernandes and Vitinha tested Mike Maignan, who was determined to maintain his clean sheet in open play. Ronaldo nearly scored from close range, but Maignan reacted quickly to deny him.France countered with Kolo Muani and Kounde combining, but Ruben Dias made a crucial interception.Deschamps brought on Dembele, who immediately set up a golden opportunity for Camavinga, which the midfielder missed. The game drifted towards extra time, where Ronaldo missed a good chance from Francisco Conceicao's cutback.Mbappe, France's captain, watched the end of extra time from the bench as Maignan denied Nuno Mendes at the very end of 120 minutes, leading to a penalty shoot-out.The shoot-out took place at the Portugal end of the Volksparkstadion, with Maignan not making any saves but not needing to. Despite Diogo Costa's heroics in the previous round, saving three Slovenia penalties, he could not stop any this time.","France beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties in Euro 2024 quarter-final match.

The bowlers then produced an all-ound effort in the Proteas win.South Africa's innings was kickstarted by a solid partnership between Brits and skipper Wolvaardt.Brits scored an impressive 81 off 56 balls, hitting 10 fours and three sixes. Kapp contributed significantly with a rapid 57 off 33 balls. Despite a cautious start, they reached 50 in 43 balls.India's poor fielding contributed to their woes as Wolvaardt, Kapp, and Brits were all dropped at various stages of the innings.Brits and Kapp’s partnership, alongside India's missed fielding opportunities, propelled South Africa to post their highest total in T20Is against India. Wolvaardt was dropped in the 4th over, Kapp in the 10th, and Brits in the 16th over.The lack of bounce on the pitch allowed the South African batters to utilize sweep shots effectively.In response, the Indian openers got off to a strong start. Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana built a 56-run stand in just 32 balls, with Verma scoring 18 off 14 balls before falling to Ayabonga Khaka in the sixth over.Mandhana continued to anchor the innings, scoring 46 off 30 balls. She was later joined by Dayalan Hemalatha, who scored 14 off 17 balls.Together, they put on a 31-run partnership before Mandhana was dismissed by Chloe Tryon in the 10th over, leaving India at 87 for three.Hemalatha was cleaned up by Nadine de Klerk in the following over.

Brits was also stretchered off the ground with severe cramps.India's bowlers Pooja and Radha did manage to take two wickets each, with Pooja maintaining decent economy.However, their efforts were overshadowed by their team's fielding lapses and the resilient batting display by South Africa.India's fightback was commendable, yet South Africa's overall stronger execution and India's fielding errors ultimately determined the outcome of the match.","South Africa women beat India by 12 runs in opening T20I in Chennai.

He simply didn't deserve what he went through, and as a brother, I felt very, very bad for him.""From booing, to people saying all kinds of nasty things, at the end of the day, we all forgot that he is just a human being who also has emotions,"" Krunal added.An injury had cut short Hardik's ODI World Cup campaign in November 2023 and his struggle during the IPL season added to his difficulties.Despite the challenges, Hardik's pivotal performance during the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies showcased his resilience, especially in crucial games including the final.""He somehow passed through all of this with a smile, though I know how hard it was for him to put on a smile. He kept working hard and focusing on what he needed to do to get the World Cup since that was his ultimate objective.""He has now played his heart out to realise India's long standing dream - And nothing has ever meant to him more. From the age of 6 - It's playing for the country and winning the World Cup that's been the dream.In the final, Hardik’s performance was instrumental. He took key wickets, including that of Heinrich Klaasen, and successfully defended 16 runs in the last over to lead India to victory by seven runs.Throughout the tournament, he scored 144 runs at a strike rate of 151.57 across six innings and claimed 11 wickets.""I just want to remind people that what Hardik has done in such a short span in his career is unbelievable. His efforts for the national team have never been compromised. Every time, at every stage of Hardik's life, people have written him off, and that has only motivated him to come back even stronger.""For Hardik, it has always been country first, and it will always be that way. For a young boy coming from Baroda, there can be no bigger achievement than helping his team win the World Cup.""Hardik, I am so, so proud of you. I love you so much, and you deserve every bit of happiness and all the good things that are coming your way.""I have immense respect for you, my bachhu,"" Krual signed off.",Krunal Pandya praises brother Hardik's comeback during India's T20 World Cup win. All-rounder says people overlooked that Hardik is a 'human being with emotions' Hardik played a crucial role in securing India's first ICC title since the 2013 Champions Trophy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111521129,imgsize-34812,width-400,resizemode-4/111521129.jpg"

So, I think I will want to open in T20Is,"" Gill said, as quoted by PTI, during the pre-match press conference.Gill expressed his desire to chase his personal ambitions without burdening himself with the expectation of equaling the achievements of Kohli and Rohit.Asked how he will deal with the burden of expectations, Gill said: ""Pressure and expectations...they I think always remain. But what Virat Bhai and Rohit Bhai have achieved, if I look to achieve that or reach that, it will be very difficult for me.""Every player has his own goal, where he wants to reach. That is the pressure. If you want to reach where other people have reached, then you have more pressure,"" he said.The 24-year-old expressed his admiration for Kohli and Rohit, considering them as role models for aspiring players in the sport.""Obviously there is pressure. But what they've achieved or what they did for India...they are both idols and legends of Indian cricket.

I got to know a lot more things about myself and a lot more things about the leadership perspective,"" he said.""I felt most of the challenges that you face as a captain are more mental, how you prepare the boys.

There are a lot of young players in the team, including myself.""We just want to give the players experience and what it is like to play at the international level because a lot of the players haven't played that many matches and some of the players haven't even made their debut.""I think that is our aim for the series to give them more international exposure and experience.""Talking about Zimbabwe, Gill said: ""I think you guys have got a good T20 team.

Robin Peterson's coaching style boosts confidence of MI New York's domestic players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/major-league-cricket/robin-petersons-coaching-style-boosts-confidence-of-mi-new-yorks-domestic-players/articleshow/111520085.cms,"NEW DELHI: Last year MI New York celebrated an improbable championship win, but amid the ecstatic scenes, head coach Robin Peterson withdrew to a windowless dressing room, reflecting on his success before joining the team.In his first stint as a franchise head coach, South African Peterson demonstrated his effective leadership and management skills.Peterson's appointment as MINY head coach, connecting seasoned internationals like Kieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran, and Trent Boult with inexperienced domestic players, proved to be strategic.His approach prioritized empathy and understanding, creating an environment conducive to maximizing players' potential. Known as a 'players' coach', Peterson's ability to manage his team’s dynamics was crucial.Peterson’s calm and composed demeanor, even amid failures, significantly contributed to the success of MINY's domestic players. His support helped players like Nosthush Kenjige, Monank Patel, and Shayan Jahangir deliver impactful performances after initial setbacks. By fostering an atmosphere immune to the fear of failure, Peterson enabled his players to thrive.""When you've been a player before, you understand performance anxieties and nervousness. It's about making them feel comfortable and confident that they've got talent and that's the reason why they've been picked. Your main job as a coach is to build players' confidence. I think that as a coach, you have to have a level of calm and just be pragmatic. You can't be too emotional, of course, we get emotional behind the scenes sometimes because that's also important. We're not robots"" said Peterson.Peterson emphasized the human aspect of coaching, regularly reflecting on his own performance and seeking feedback from his players. His commitment to building strong interpersonal relationships extends beyond cricket, as he maintained year-round contact with his players and even the team’s social media staff.""I got along very well with the domestic players last year, and they know they can contact me at any point in time. I call them to just see how their lives are changing. A lot can happen in a year. I don't want to come to a franchise event like most events, where you just all of a sudden, you come together for a couple of weeks. I like to stay in touch with people and make sure that everything is alright"".According to Peterson, there is a noticeable change in the body language and confidence of the domestic players compared to the previous season. While the success of the World Cup contributed, Peterson believes the foundation was laid during MINY's title win last year. The players are now more self-assured and clear-headed.“Last year everything was new. It was different from the environment they were used to at USA cricket in general. So coming to a franchise that is very professionally run was a bit of an eye opener for them and something that they got accustomed to. A year on, now you can see the belief in their ability is totally different. There's no doubt that coming into the environment this year, they are walking a little bit taller, they know they belong. That speaks to the underlying belief and confidence,” he noted.Looking ahead, Peterson understands the challenges that come with defending the title. He is particularly focused on nurturing the talent of 21-year-old Dewald Brevis, who has yet to achieve a breakthrough season with Mumbai Indians.""People forget he's only 21 years old. He's still learning his craft. When you learn your craft, it's not only about cricket, it's about how you deal with ups and downs. It's more the emotional maturity that you want to work through with a player, which is the longest, which is the most difficult one to help a player with. Everybody's different, Everybody matures differently, in terms of your life experiences, Dewald Brevis is going to be a fantastic player, one day, he's got a unique skill set. It's my role to make sure that I create the environment for him to learn, and not be scared to make mistakes.""""So with him, I think he's on the right trajectory. Once he comes out of that plateau, you're gonna see a superstar in world cricket. It's just a matter of being patient with him, and allowing him the space to fail a little bit, because that's gonna be his biggest learning, through his failure, not only success"".Peterson's rapid rise in the cricket coaching domain, from general manager to head coach of MI teams in both America and South Africa, signifies his growing influence. In an industry dominated by renowned coaches, Peterson is establishing a distinct identity through his unique approach.","Peterson's appointment as MINY head coach proved to be strategic.

Is cricket, and T20 cricket in particular, gaining popularity in the US?

How do you measure the T20 World Cup success in the US as co-hosts?

How does cricket fit into the business landscape in the USA?

What is the interest of advertisers in a country where NBA, NFL and MLB rule?

What motivated Infinite Solutions to invest in a cricket team?

The ICC has granted MLC List-A status. What are your thoughts on this?

Your thoughts on USA's cricket sensation Saurabh Netravalkar, who left an impact on the T20 World Cup...

With cricket set to be part of the Olympics in LA 2028, how significant will that be for the sport in the US?

NEW DELHI: Washington Freedom reached the Eliminator of the Major League Cricket ( MLC ) last season but lost to MI New York (MINY). However, team owner Sanjay Govil is confident that new captain Steve Smith will lead the team to glory in the second edition of the tournament beginning July 5, while expressing optimism about their chances of success this time around.Washington will begin their campaign against MINY on Saturday, July 6, at Church Street Park in Morrisville.Govil, who is also the founder and chairman of Infinite Computer Solutions, spoke to TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview about the Washington Freedom team, captain Smith, pace sensation Saurabh Netravalkar, cricket in the USA and much more.We are part of the six teams in the MLC. The concept of MLC was actually started by Satyan Gajwani, Vice Chairman of the Times Internet, and the former founders of Willow. They got it going, and now six teams are part of it. We own the Washington Freedom team, based in the US capital. We are very excited about our second season and feel that we have a great team. We have Ricky Ponting as our coach and Steve Smith as our captain. Our roster includes both international and domestic players.The format allows six international players and five domestic players. We have notable international players like Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Maxwell, and, as mentioned, Steve Smith. Our bowling lineup includes Marco Janssen, Lockie Ferguson and others. On the domestic side, we have Saurabh Netravalkar, who has become a sensation (through his T20 World Cup heroics for USA) and Andre Gaus. We also have Amila Aponso from Sri Lanka.We have a very competitive team, which was our goal. All teams in the MLC are highly competitive, and our objective was to ensure we put out a product that is meaningful and competitive, not overshadowed by the IPL teams. Last year, we made it to the playoffs, and this year we're taking it one game at a time with the same goal in mind.Absolutely, it is becoming big. A recent CBS news story showed that over 35 million people are watching cricket in the US, making it the fifth largest cricket media market for the ICC. The India-Pakistan match held in New York, along with other matches in New York, Dallas and Florida, has significantly increased awareness...the overall impact has been substantial.USA's win against Pakistan was a watershed moment for USA Cricket , generating a tremendous amount of awareness, publicity and coverage. I equate that to the US victory over Russia in ice hockey during the Olympics. Suddenly, people are taking notice. The US has a huge appetite for sports. Despite having the NFL, NBA, NHL and many other leagues, there is always a demand for more sports because they serve as great unifiers and promote team building.India's recent win in the T20 World Cup is a perfect example of teamwork, with every player contributing to the victory. If any one player had not contributed, it could have led to a loss. This aspect of cricket, where everyone has specialized roles and works together like a well-oiled machine, is truly remarkable.I think it was very successful. I wish the stadium they built (in Nassau County) had survived because it would have been a great opportunity for young kids to grow up and play cricket there for generations to come. There are so many academies, and it would have been wonderful to see the stadium where the first India-Pakistan match in America was held. Nonetheless, it was a great opportunity to showcase cricket.Leading into MLC and the Olympics in 2028, we have some really exciting developments happening. I would love to see a Women's World Cup in the US at some point soon. We are building stadiums across the country, which we desperately need to propel the sport further. We are well on the path to achieving that. In every city, you can see the progress cricket lovers have made in terms of having fields customized for cricket. This (cricket) is now becoming, I wouldn't say mainstream, but it's getting there.So, the good news is that everyone involved in the sport is willing to invest in the business. I always believe that passion is the most important thing. If you have passion, everything else follows. If you start a business with the sole intent of making money, you will never succeed, in my opinion. Every idea has a passion behind it. You execute that idea, and business and profits follow. That's what every owner is doing; they are all willing to make the investment and have been making investments. In MLC, we see a very promising path to success over the next few years.We have already started to get good sponsors. Advertisers are great. For example, we have Verizon as our sponsor, which is one of the biggest brands in America. I know other teams also have very good sponsors. So the interest is definitely picking up more and more from an advertising perspective. Advertising dollars are invested to target a certain audience, and as we become more mainstream and reach beyond the diaspora from cricket-loving countries, we (will) start seeing more and more advertising dollars flow in.If there are 40 million people who watch cricket, that's a very significant segment of the US population. Moreover, this segment of the population is not just large, but also very successful. They are among the highest taxpayers in the country, making their economic impact substantial. We only see this growing.When I look at other sports leagues like football and the NHL, I don't have the exact numbers for how many people follow those sports, but it's not the entire US population. Whether it's 40 million, 50 million, or 60 million, I don't have that data. However, 40 million people is not a bad start for any sport.It was more luck and opportunity that led to this. For the record, Infinite Solutions does not own the cricket team; they are two separate, independent entities. Infinite Solutions is a sponsor of the cricket team. It's the passion that drives us. We all grew up watching and playing cricket.I grew up in Delhi, where my father was a professor at IIT Delhi, so I spent my childhood on the campus. We didn't have a lot of money, but we had all the facilities to play sports. Inside the IIT campus, there were tennis courts, cricket fields, swimming pools and badminton courts. We were exposed to every sport, but cricket was always at the top.Thanks for bringing that up. The T20 World Cup, the List-A status and the Olympics all show the ICC's commitment to the USA as a market and as a future cricketing powerhouse. We are very grateful for that. Having List-A status motivates players to perform at their best regardless. They are professionals. Even last year, they gave their all, playing in this heat and all the challenges. It's extra motivation knowing that their statistics count towards their international numbers, which is great.He is a once-in-a-generation kind of individual. He is part of the Washington Freedom team and played Under-19 cricket for India alongside players like KL Rahul. At one point, he decided, for good reasons, to step away from cricket and pursue academics. He attended Cornell University, an Ivy League school, where he completed his master's degree. He then moved to Silicon Valley to work in technology before rediscovering his passion for cricket and excelling in it. He even dismissed Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma with his bowling skills.Aside from cricket, he is also a superb musician. We recognized his talent before he gained widespread recognition, and we have a special fondness for him because he is such a genuinely nice person. His wife is equally kind-hearted. Despite achieving great success in the World Cup and reaching the peak of his career, whenever I called to congratulate him, he always answered the phone and spoke to me. He is a superb team member—calm, composed, humble, and grounded. He exemplifies kindness and is a multi-talented individual.Huge! I think there's going to be a lot of impetus now for dollars coming in to promote cricket in the US. The US wants to excel in every sport it plays, and there's already so much infrastructure built here in terms of academies, etc. For example, in our team, we have a player who was born in the US and was a reserve for the US national team. That by itself is a significant statement. We're going to see more and more of such developments.There's a lot of interest because these kids have grown up watching their parents play cricket and watching cricket matches at 3 a.m. It's already ingrained in their muscle memory. They see a future in cricket where they have a chance to become the next Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma, and there are many avenues for them -- playing in the IPL, MLC, other leagues, representing the USA team and securing big sponsorships. There's a clear path now, and we're very grateful to the ICC, the Times Group, and everyone else involved for their support.","Washington Freedom reached Eliminator of Major League Cricket last season but lost to MI New York.

Lead spinner Deepti Sharma will be joined by left-arm tweaker Radha Yadav, who is yet to fire and will look to cash in on the Chepauk pitch, which traditionally assists the slow bowlers.India batter Jemimah Rodrigues , who is a live wire on the field, outlined the team’s focus on consistency. “We just want to keep doing what we are doing consistently. Consistency and doing well each time we are on the field – that is what we are striving for. We are going to take most of the experience,” Jemimah said.SA’s fortunes could revolve around their top-order batters Laura Wolvaardt and Marizanne Kapp and the tourists have enough firepower to upset the hosts in their own backyard. Right-arm medium pacer Kapp, who is yet to bowl in the tour, could also come in handy with the ball. There are chances for rain to lash the city and the weather might play spoilsport in the series opener.",The three-match T20I series gets underway at the MA Chidambaram Stadium here on Friday. The series will be a dress rehearsal for both the teams in the run up to the Asia Cup and T20 World Cup. India – the defending champions – will travel to Sri Lanka for the T20 Asia Cup after the series.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111518513,imgsize-1248185,width-400,resizemode-4/111518513.jpg"

Lillian Thuram is a former French defender who won the 1998 World Cup and also the 2000 Euro. He scored 2 goals in the 1998 semifinal against Croatia. Marcus Thuram, who is leading the line with France captain Kylian Mbappe , is still a work in progress.""I'm proud to wear the Thuram name on my back,"" said Marcus.Francisco Conceicao has already shown glimpses of his lineage when he scored a last-minute goal against Czech Republic and helped Portugal win the game. Old-timers watching the youngster were reminded of a similar looking right winger who was part of Portugal's Golden Generation. Sergio Conceicao, Francisco's father, even has a Euro hat-trick against his name vs Germany in the 2000 edition.In true Dutch and Ajax tradition, Daley Blind is a true disciple of Total Football just as his father Danny was. A long-serving Ajax faithful, Danny was the defensive anchor in a terrific Dutch and Ajaz generation of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Son Daley is an equally unflappable presence in the heart of the Dutch midfield.Enrico Chiesa was a former striker in the 1990s for a team that was always more famous for its defenders. Enrico made his presence felt at Euro 96 with his runs with Pierluigi Casiraghi before fizzling out. With Federico spearheading Italy's title charge at the last Euro, you could say the son has already surpassed his dad's legacy. This time, an unimaginative Italy gave way to Switzerland in the Round of 16.For Kasper Schmeichel, Denmark captain, it was his third Euro. A top keeper, Kasper is yet to reach the heights that his father Peter did with Denmark in 1992 when they won the Euro.Ianis Hagi, the Romanian midfielder, is the son of the great Gheorghe Hagi. The Maradona of the Carpathians as Hagi Sr is called is inarguably Romania's greatest. Ianis has shown similar flashes of intelligence and skill that made his father so famous, though even he knows he has huge, huge boots to fill.","Lillian Thuram is a former French defender who won the 1998 World Cup and also the 2000 Euro.

IMPORTANT RESULTS (DAY 4, ROUND 2)

Men:

Women:

LONDON: As if one reckless dive wasn't bad enough, given that it forced Hubert Hurkacz to take a medical timeout and return with a knee sleeve on his right leg, the seventh-seeded Pole was airborne and horizontal again on the very next point. Not surprisingly, Hurkacz was forced to retire (at match-point down) against the young Frenchman Arthur Fils in the Wimbledon second round.It was a bizarre end to what looked like a promising encounter with the 20-year-old Fils taking a two-sets-to-love lead. Fils then advanced 7-6 (7-2), 6-4, 2-6, 6-6 (9-8) and will face Russian Roman Safiullin in the third round on Saturday.Hurkacz, who was serving to level set scores in the 10th game of the fourth set, saved a breakpoint, but couldn't serve it out. A forehand error of a bad bounce then pushed the set along to tie-break, slippery ground in challenging conditions where the sun was out, but the westerly was stiff.Hurkacz, who fell to the ground clutching his right knee when trying to stand up after the dive, received help from Fils, who crossed over and stretched out his hand to the Pole. He helped his opponent get back on his feet before the trainer arrived and commenced treatment.Fils, from Bondoule, a commune in northern France, made light of his action. ""It's completely normal for me,"" he said. ""I saw a friend. He was in pain, and he couldn't move. I didn't care about the score. I was just hoping that the guy is well, and he can still walk and everything. He told me that he felt something in his knee. I forgot the score at this point.""Even though Fils took the first two sets and eventually the match, it was Hurkacz who won more points (148 to 140). The Frenchman, ranked 34, struck on the big points to become the youngest player to beat a top-10 men's player at Wimbledon in 10 years since Nick Kyrgios took down Rafael Nadal in 2014.The 20-year-old is in the third round of a major for the first time. ""When I got on the court, I was trying my best to at least try to win one set, and to get him in one tie-break. I was feeling great. I was playing quite okay. I won the first set. Then I broke early in the second one, won the second set. Then you think, like, ""Okay, I can win this match.""Meanwhile, seven-time champion Novak Djokovic was far from his best on the day, but still found a way of coming through.

Andy Murray's long farewell begins with emotional doubles defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/andy-murrays-long-farewell-begins-with-emotional-doubles-defeat/articleshow/111500316.cms,"NEW DELHI: Andy Murray , one of Britain's greatest sportsmen, received an emotional farewell at Wimbledon after he and his brother Jamie were defeated in the first round of the men's doubles on Thursday. The 37-year-old had returned just weeks after surgery to remove a spinal cyst, an injury that has prevented him from making a final singles appearance before retirement.Despite his injury, Murray was determined to step onto Wimbledon's grass one more time, partnering with his brother Jamie in a Grand Slam for the first time.The Australian duo Rinky Hijikata and John Peers, who eventually won 7-6(6) 6-4, provided the opposition. For once, the result seemed less significant, although Murray’s competitive spirit was clearly visible.The crowd, including Murray’s wife Kim, daughters Sophia and Edie, and parents Judy and William, watched anxiously as he appeared to injure his back early in the match. However, Murray continued to play, showcasing flashes of brilliance that had seen him become the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years in 2013. He also won the U.S. Open and an Olympic gold in 2012 and clinched another Wimbledon title in 2016.As Murray’s final Wimbledon appearance loomed, the moment was opportune to celebrate his illustrious career. Sue Barker of BBC sport presented, while former champions such as Novak Djokovic , Martina Navratilova, Conchita Martinez, and John McEnroe joined a gathering of British players on court.A video montage of Murray's career highlights featured tributes from Djokovic, Roger Federer, and Rafa Nadal, three of the sport's greats with whom Murray frequently competed. Murray wiped away tears as he recounted some of his most cherished moments in his career.Reflecting on his historic 2013 Wimbledon victory, he commented, ""I didn't enjoy the final against Novak that much, I was pretty stressed the whole time.""The self-deprecating Murray also shared some lighter moments from his career, demonstrating how he eventually won the hearts of the British public.The first-round doubles match, although a loss, was more about commemorating Murray's contribution to tennis . Though Murray is still set to play mixed doubles with Emma Raducanu, the event provided the perfect backdrop to honor a remarkable career. The atmosphere on Centre Court encapsulated the respect and admiration for Murray, who overcame numerous injuries and setbacks to compete at the highest level.The collective sentiment on Centre Court was one of admiration and respect, not only for Murray’s skills but also for his resilience and dedication to the sport, marking a fitting celebration for a distinguished career.""I felt way less pressure and I enjoyed it more and that was the favourite of my Slams,"" Murray said of his 2016 Wimbledon final triumph over Canadian Milos Raonic which was followed months later by his ride to world number one.""I don't remember much of that night. I had a few drinks and I did unfortunately vomit in the cab on the way home.""Murray, reflecting on his career, expressed a desire to ""play forever"" but acknowledged his body could no longer sustain him due to past injuries, including a significant hip surgery in 2019.""Physically it's just too tough now. All of the injuries have added up. I love this sport. It's given me so much, taught me loads of lessons over the years that I can use for the rest of my life. I don't want to stop so it is hard.""

Djokovic's ground-shaking roar after breaking for a 3-2 lead in the third set was a significant highlight. Another memorable moment came when Fearnley earned a break point with a screaming crosscourt winner, earning applause from Djokovic himself.The Briton also broke Djokovic’s serve for the first time when the Serb sent a backhand into the net, receiving a rapturous standing ovation from the crowd.Fearnley's high-risk strategy paid off in the final game of the third set as Djokovic’s forehand went wide, giving Fearnley the set to the delight of the crowd.Fearnley had another opportunity after a double fault from Djokovic handed him two break points at 3-2 up in the fourth set. However, Djokovic managed to dodge this danger. It was evident that Fearnley had affected Djokovic, as the Serb attempted to shush the noisy, partisan crowd by holding his finger to his lips.Despite his efforts, the crowd continued to support Fearnley, celebrating each winner. But Fearnley, who had never won a main tour match or competed at a Grand Slam until this week, couldn't overcome Djokovic's experience and skill. Djokovic sealed his win with a forehand winner, maintaining his perfect Grand Slam record against British players, excluding Andy Murray.""Huge congrats to Jacob for an amazing match.

LONDON: Daniil Medvedev was having a meltdown of sorts on Centre Court in his Wimbledon second-round match against the 102nd ranked Frenchman Alexandre Muller .The fifth seed was unhappy it seemed on several counts - including bounce and tactics - gesturing to his box, pointing at his French coaches Gilles Cervara and Gilles Simon and shadowing backhands.The Russian was beside himself.Medvedev - both maverick and mercurial - bizarrely raced to his courtside chair at 6-3 in the first set tie-break, thinking the set was done. The chair umpire repeatedly called the tie-break score '6-3', trying to get the player back on court. Medvedev, in the middle of a rant, finally heard the umpire and quickly returned to the middle.The world No.5, who trailed by a set and a break against Muller, managed to steady the boat on a day when whimsical weather continued to disrupt the schedule on outside courts, eventually coming through 6-7 (3), 7-6 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in 3-hours and 28-minutes, playing under the roof.The 28-year-old, who has a love affair going with Court No.1, which he amorously called 'very different' from Centre Court, which he thought was 'slower', though the ball 'bounced higher'. It might have something to do with the result of his semifinals 12 months ago, his only outing at the centerpiece of this venue, while he has never lost on Court No.1.""I didn't play the best match, but I won,"" Medvedev said of Wednesday's effort. ""For whatever reason Centre Court feels much slower, really slow bounce, not like grass where it is sliding. You need to get used to it. The more matches I play on it the more chances I have to play better and better. Definitely always happy to play on Centre Court, but more happy when I win.""Medvedev, who has struggled to back up his strong start to the year after making the final at Melbourne Park and then again at Indian Wells a month later, hasn't been able to go for more on his serve in the spring swing.Medvedev has worked his serve at practice.""I felt very good in Roland Garros with my serve, on grass, I would want it better,"" he said. ""During tournaments many times I was able to push it up. I hope to continue improving it during the tournament. I'm feeling good with my shoulder. That's the most important.""With 14 aces against Muller, winning 75 percent of points on his first serve, he may have turned that corner.In another second-round match, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz claimed his ninth straight win on Church Road when he recovered from a fumble in the opening set to score a 7-6 (5), 6-2, 6-2 win over Aleksandar Vukic.The third seed, who led 5-2 in the first set, appeared to have slackened and Vukic won the next four games.

Daniil Medvedev survives Alexandre Muller scare to reach Wimbledon third round,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/daniil-medvedev-survives-alexandre-muller-scare-to-reach-wimbledon-third-round/articleshow/111466615.cms,"NEW DELHI: Fifth seed Daniil Medvedev overcame 102-ranked Alexandre Muller on Wednesday to advance to the third round of Wimbledon .Medvedev secured a 6-7(3), 7-6(4), 6-4, 7-5 victory in a match lasting over three-and-a-half hours.Despite early setbacks, including losing the first set to the Frenchman and saving a set point to avoid a 2-0 deficit, Medvedev found his rhythm and ultimately prevailed.Medvedev, who was the runner-up at the Australian Open, initially struggled on Centre Court. In their first tour-level meeting, Muller, ranked 102nd, took the first set in a tiebreak. Medvedev had to work hard to stave off a set point in the second set before leveling the match in another tiebreak. From there, Medvedev outlasted Muller in a hard-fought third set and clinched the match in the fourth set.The 28-year-old Russian, who reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year, faced a determined Muller. Despite needing a medical timeout for a left thigh issue before the fourth set, Muller kept pace with Medvedev.The Frenchman impressed the crowd with unconventional shots like underarm serves and tweeners but struggled with the grass surface, having won only three matches on it in his career.Medvedev adjusted his strategy after losing the first set, increasing his net attacks. This approach paid off as both players exchanged breaks in the second and third sets. Watched by compatriot and 2004 Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova from the Royal Box, Medvedev was not at his clinical best but managed to force Muller into crucial errors.One pivotal moment was when Muller failed a drop shot, handing Medvedev the third set. The fourth set seemed destined for a tiebreak until Muller gave up two match points on his serve, culminating in a double fault that granted Medvedev the win.""When you win, there is the next round to try and do better,"" the former world number one said on court.""For some reason it (the grass) feels really slow, I need to get used to it but the more matches I play on it the more chances I have to play better... (I'm) happy to play on Centre Court at Wimbledon but even more happy to win.""","Daniil Medvedev beats 102-ranked Alexandre Muller 6-7(3), 7-6(4), 6-4, 7-5. The match lasted over three-and-a-half hours on Centre Court. The Russian reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111466684,imgsize-43954,width-400,resizemode-4/111466684.jpg"
