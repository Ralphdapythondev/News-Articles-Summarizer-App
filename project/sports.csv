Mayank Yadav: Remember Mayank Yadav? Former India bowling coach feels BCCI 'can't wrap the pacer up in cotton wool',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/remember-mayank-yadav-former-india-bowling-coach-feels-bcci-cant-wrap-the-pacer-up-in-cotton-wool/articleshow/112667918.cms,"Mayank Yadav (TOI Photo)

NEW DELHI: Mayank Yadav , the promising 22-year-old fast bowler for Lucknow Super Giants , emerged as one of the standout players in IPL 2024 , impressing with his sheer pace and taking seven wickets in just four games. However, his season was abruptly halted due to injury, leading to uncertainty about his return to competitive cricket.BCCI secretary Jay Shah expressed doubts about Yadav's availability for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Test series scheduled for December.While recovering at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey insists on easing Yadav back into action, particularly focusing on first-class cricket.Yadav's blistering speed captured attention early in the IPL 2024 season, consistently bowling at speeds exceeding 150 kmph, and delivering the fourth fastest ball in IPL history at 156.7 kmph. Unfortunately, an injury curtailed his participation after just four games where he secured seven wickets.""I cannot give you any answer on Mayank Yadav as there is no guarantee whether he will be in the team or not. But he is potentially a good fast bowler, and we are looking after him. He is currently at the NCA,"" Shah told The Times of India last week.The concerns around Yadav's injury have sparked discussions about his immediate future and the appropriate path for his recovery. Former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey advocates for a gradual reintroduction to competitive cricket, particularly in the longer format. Mhambrey argues that keeping Yadav sidelined out of caution may not be the best approach for the young pacer.""I don't agree that if he is not ready, just don't play him. This is the age where he has to bowl. A bowler should bowl. The more you bowl, the more you will have control, you will know your threshold as to how much your body can take. You can't wrap him up in cotton wool saying he will get injured,"" Mhambrey told The Indian Express in an interview.Mhambrey believes that Yadav's development and injury management would benefit from playing red-ball cricket. He emphasized that first-class cricket is crucial for gaining the necessary experience and for understanding individual physical limits.""We can't overbowl and burn him out, but we have to be smart about how much he should bowl. As a fast bowler, he needs to play first-class cricket,"" Mhambrey said.He stressed the importance of studying Yadav's background and training regimen to better manage his fitness and workload.""You have to check his background. How much cricket has he played? How much has he bowled? Everything adds up. We need to go in depth about him, what have been his training methods? How many overs he used to bowl, his history of injuries,"" Mhambrey noted.Mhambrey also highlighted the significance of understanding that Yadav is still in the developmental phase of his career, and proactive management of his workload and fitness is crucial.""He's only 22. His body is still developing. He is in that injury-prone age group. His body has not completely developed yet. His injuries can be controlled if we understand his background well.""As the BCCI deliberates on the best course of action for Yadav, the young pacer's return to full fitness remains eagerly anticipated by fans and selectors alike. His impressive performances in the IPL have shown glimpses of his potential, and managing his recovery effectively could be key to his future success in Indian cricket.","Mayank Yadav was one of the standout players in IPL 2024.

Competition Commission of India flags cricket rights concerns with Disney-Reliance $8.5 billion merger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/competition-commission-of-india-flags-cricket-rights-concerns-with-disney-reliance-8-5-billion-merger/articleshow/112666752.cms,"The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has made a preliminary determination that the proposed $8.5 billion merger between Reliance and Walt Disney 's media assets in India could adversely affect competition, according to four sources who spoke to Reuters. The main concern revolves around the combined entity's control over cricket broadcasting rights.This marks the most significant hurdle to date for the planned Disney-Reliance merger, which aims to create the largest entertainment company in India.The resulting entity would rival Sony, Zee Entertainment, Netflix, and Amazon, boasting a portfolio of 120 TV channels and two streaming platforms.Sources revealed that the CCI has privately issued a notice to Disney and Reliance, outlining its apprehensions about their potential dominance over the broadcasting rights for cricket, which is immensely popular in the world's most populous nation.The CCI has asked that the companies provide an explanation within 30 days as to why an investigation into the matter should not be initiated.""Cricket is the biggest pain point for the CCI,"" said another source.The combined entity, which would be primarily controlled by Mukesh Ambani's, Asia's wealthiest individual and Reliance boss, would possess valuable broadcasting rights for cricket matches on both television and streaming services. These rights are estimated to be worth billions of dollars, leading to apprehensions about the company's potential pricing power and influence over advertisers.When contacted for comments by Reuters, representatives from Reliance, Disney, and CCI did not respond. All individuals who provided information for this report requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the CCI's proceedings.Prior to the merger announcement in February, antitrust specialists had cautioned that the deal could face rigorous examination, particularly regarding the allocation of sporting rights.Reliance and Disney have responded to the CCI earlier inquiries regarding their merger, expressing their readiness to divest a small number of television channels to address market power concerns and expedite the approval process, according to sources who spoke to Reuters. The companies have reportedly offered to sell fewer than 10 channels in an effort to alleviate the watchdog's apprehensions.However, the companies have stood firm on their stance regarding cricket rights . They have informed the CCI that the broadcast and streaming rights for cricket are set to expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively, making it impossible to sell them at present. Furthermore, they have emphasized that any such sale would necessitate the approval of the cricket board, which could potentially delay the entire process.Reliance-Disney is set to acquire the digital and television broadcasting rights for prominent cricket leagues, most notably the world's richest cricket tournament, the Indian Premier League.The approval process for the acquisition might face delays due to the notice from the CCI. However, the involved companies have the option to mitigate the raised concerns by proposing additional concessions, according to one of the sources.""This is a precursor of things getting complicated ... The notice means that initially the CCI thinks the merger harms competition and whatever concessions offered are not enough,"" added the person.The CCI has asked the involved companies to address the concerns within a 30-day period, according to another source. The primary issue at hand relates to potential pricing difficulties that advertisers might encounter if the proposed merger proceeds.""The CCI is concerned the entity can increase rates for advertisers during live events,"" said the source.Jefferies, a financial services company, has predicted that the joint venture between Disney and Reliance will capture a significant 40% share of the advertising market across television and streaming platforms in India.In India, cricket enjoys an unparalleled and passionate following among its estimated 1.4 billion citizens. As a result, cricket matches are highly sought after by advertisers looking to reach a vast audience.According to estimates by media agency GroupM, the total spending on sponsorship, endorsement, and media related to the sports industry in India amounted to nearly $2 billion in 2023. Remarkably, cricket alone accounted for a staggering 87% of these expenditures.K.K. Sharma, the former head of mergers at the CCI, has expressed concerns that the merger could result in ""almost an absolute control over cricket.""In 2022, Zee and Sony had plans to create a massive $10 billion television empire in India. However, they received a similar warning notice from the CCI. To address the concerns, they offered concessions by divesting three TV channels, which ultimately helped them secure CCI approval. Despite this, the merger eventually fell through.",The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has made a preliminary determination that the proposed $8.5 billion merger could adversely affect competition.

India is now the state’s 7th largest tourism market, up from 11th in 2019.The growth has been attributed to a strong Indian community in the area, which includes around 61,000 residents and approximately 9,600 international students.“Whether you go north, south, head inland or up into the valley, the Swan Valley, there are some great experiences that visitors and tourists can have here within an hour or hour-and-a-half’s drive from Perth,” saidAdam Gilchrist , one of the best wicketkeeper-batsmen to have played the game.According to Anil Punjabi, Travel Agents Federation of India national committee member, representing east India, “On an average 50-70 people fly to Australia daily from Kolkata alone.”A lot of it is due to the movement of students. “Parents and family members travel to meet them and go for holidays,” he said.Besides, a simplified visa process, low cost carriers and Australia not being far from India unlike the US or Europe, also help. “It’s a big country. We have repeat passengers to Australia,” said Punjabi.And the number of visitors increases when there’s a sporting event around, involving India. “When there is something where India is involved, we see a rise in. People love sports in this part of the world,” said Punjabi, hoping India’s performance last time in Australia will enthuse many more to make the trip Down Under.Tourism Western Australia has partnered Gilchrist for the ‘Drive the Dream’ campaign, using his status as one of cricket’s best to attract Indian fans ahead of the upcoming five-match Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.“The campaign showcases what a beautiful state we have here in Western Australia. More so, how accessible some of the beautiful experiences are, just outside Perth,” said the 52-year-old, who and his son Harry took part in various adventures on the campaign trail.“Visitors can travel to the wine and food regions, a desert with pinnacles (limestone formations) where one can spend the evening stargazing or go on a boat trip and watch dolphins swim,” said Gilchrist.For him, one of the most memorable experiences was the Vertigo Walk on top of Optus Stadium, where the first Test will be played.“It was remarkable to take a tour on top of Perth stadium and have a beautiful view of the city’s skyline at sunset,” said Gilchrist, winner of three ODI World Cups.","India's first pitstop will be Perth ’s bouncy track.

It was almost perfect that night.Kolkata, 2001, when VVS (Laxman) and (Rahul) Dravid batted all day. They just shut us out of the game. When I reflect on it, you almost knew you were part of something special.Captaincy brings different pressures and expectations. Also, an element of excitement that you can have such an impact on the game. There are tough days, there are challenging days and then there are pleasing days.

TOI had reported on August 19 that with the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) having refused to host the 2024 Women's T20 World Cup, the UAE has emerged as the likely alternative to host the event, scheduled to take place from 3 to 20 October.The tournament will now be staged in Dubai and Sharjah.In a media release, ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice said: “It is a shame not to be hosting the Women’s T20 World Cup in Bangladesh as we know the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) would have staged a memorable event. I would like to thank the team at the BCB for exploring all avenues to try and enable the event to be hosted in Bangladesh, but travel advisories from the governments of a number of the participating teams meant that wasn’t feasible. However, they will retain hosting rights. We look forward to taking an ICC global event to Bangladesh in the near future.”Even the Bangladesh Cricket Board was insisting in hosting the tournament, the event's shift to another country became imminment after Australia women's team captain Alyssa Healy on Monday raised concerns that hosting the event in a country afflicted by disturbned by violence may not be appropriate at this point in time.“I’d also like to thank the Emirates Cricket Board for stepping in to host on behalf of the BCB and Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe for their generous offers of support, and we look forward to seeing ICC global events in both of those countries in 2026.”Even a player like Alyssa Healy said playing the World Cup in Bangladesh is not ideal at this stage. ""I'd find it hard to fathom playing there [in Bangladesh] at the moment, as a human being, I feel like it might be the wrong thing to do,"" Healy said. ""(That would be) taking resources away from a country that is really struggling. They are needing everyone they can possibly get in there helping people that are dying.

With the change, Pope becomes the 82nd captain for England in Test cricket.Reflecting on his rise under Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum, Pope stated his intention to follow the 'Bazball' approach. Despite stepping into the captaincy role, Pope mentions he can always seek guidance from Stokes, who will be with the team during the series against Sri Lanka.""It's a great opportunity for me, one of the greatest honours in English cricket,"" Pope told a pre-match press conference at Old Trafford on Tuesday. ""But I think it's still Stokesy's team.""That's probably the difference. I've had no message in my locker but I'm sat next to him in the changing room!""It's going to be great to have him around.

Right time for Manolo to take charge of national team: Brandon Fernandes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/right-time-for-manolo-to-take-charge-of-national-team-brandon-fernandes/articleshow/112661519.cms,"MUMBAI: The hiring of Manolo Marquez as India’s new head coach, or at least the way it took place, may not have gone down well with former captain Bhaichung Bhutia , but there’s no doubt the Spaniard’s appointment has proven to be immensely popular with the national team players.Just ask Brandon Fernandes , who thrived under Marquez at FC Goa last season, before opting to join Mumbai City on a free transfer.“It’s the right choice and the right time that he gets his opportunity to be the national team coach,” the 29-year-old midfield talent told TOI from Thailand where the Islanders are currently in pre-season training.Marquez’s appointment controversially compelled Bhutia to resign as a member of the All India Football Federation technical committee, as the former striker alleged the panel had been bypassed by the AIFF in the entire process of selecting the new coach.Clearly, though, the 55-year-old’s track record in the four years he’s been involved in Indian football went a long way in him landing the job. “Manolo is one of the best coaches in the ISL and he has been there for four years and he knows the Indian players well. I know for a fact that he will improve and be successful in the job,” Brandon added.Brandon’s own association with Marquez may well have continued at club level, seeing as the latter will also keep coaching Goa until his contract expires next season, but he was ready to leave his hometown club when Mumbai City came calling.“Mumbai City is one of the best clubs in India, and I got the opportunity to join them and I said ‘why not?’ So it’s a big challenge for me and I wanted a bigger challenge in my career so I decided to join Mumbai City,” the playmaker said when asked what prompted him to leave the Gaurs where he had spent the last seven years.This, however, is not the first time Brandon will be donning the sky blue colours of the two-time ISL Shield winners. He was picked up for Rs 12 lakhs by the Islanders in the season two draft back in 2015, though that turned out to be a forgettable campaign which saw injuries restrict Brandon to just two appearances.Even as he currently recovers from an ankle injury, Brandon is eager to make amends in his second stint with Mumbai. “It’s the past for me,” he said, “I had a very bad experience before but now I’m here with more experience, a better player I guess.“I will take this opportunity to give, in the coming years, what I couldn’t give that year. Mumbai City have obviously shown that trust in me and it’s time for me to repay it.”Mumbai City fans will also be drooling over the prospect of watching Brandon, provider of the most assists (25) by a domestic player in the ISL, team up with Lallianzuala Chhangte , the league’s all-time second highest Indian goalscorer (40 goals) after Sunil Chhetri.“Obviously Chhangte is one of the best players in India and it gives me an opportunity to play with him at club level. I play with him for the national team and now I would want to take this opportunity and back myself to help him and vice-versa,” Brandon said.",Manolo Marquez has been appointed as India's new head coach. Former captain Bhaichung Bhutia resigned as a member of the AIFF technical committee. Brandon Fernandes has joined Mumbai City on a free transfer.

After creating a bit of room for himself, he managed to drill a low shot that flew across the face of goal and nestled into the far corner of the net.Atletico Madrid responded swiftly, equalizing just over a minute later. Antoine Griezmann set up Marcos Llorente, who powerfully struck the ball into the top of the net.Despite Samuel Lino's effort hitting the post, Villarreal regained the lead when goalkeeper Jan Oblak was unable to secure a cross, resulting in an own goal off the unlucky Koke.Sorloth, who previously played for Sociedad, equalized for Atletico by heading the ball past goalkeeper Diego Conde just before halftime. Despite Conde's best efforts, the ball managed to slip underneath him and into the net.Atletico's new signing, Alvarez, formerly of Manchester City, made his debut for the club in the closing stages of the match. The striker, who cost the club around 85 million euros ($93 million), entered the fray with the second half evenly balanced between the two sides.Late in the game, Villarreal's recent acquisition, Nicolas Pepe, nearly scored from a free-kick, but his curling effort struck the crossbar. Despite chances for both teams, the match ended in a stalemate, with neither side able to find a winning goal.""We conceded very quickly, too easily, and that gives you an uphill struggle,"" Atletico midfielder Llorente told Movistar.""We got back level, which is the hard thing, and we went and let in another goal, and in the end when you let in two it's very hard to turn the game around and wedidn't do it today.""","Atletico Madrid drew 2-2 with Villarreal in their La Liga season opener. Robin Le Normand, Alexander Sorloth and Julian Alvarez all made their debuts for Atletico. The Rojiblancos had to come from behind twice to secure a point.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112642863,imgsize-41984,width-400,resizemode-4/112642863.jpg"

The Serbian forward was puzzled by the decision, but Cambiaso's offside position earlier in the play negated the goal.Under Motta's guidance, Juve's playing style has become more attractive compared to the previous manager, Massimiliano Allegri. This transformation is ongoing, with some of Allegri's preferred players, such as Federico Chiesa, being benched to accommodate those better suited to Motta's approach.Como will have a clearer understanding of their chances of remaining in the division after their upcoming matches against Cagliari and Udinese. The ambitious club, managed by Cesc Fabregas, was outmatched on the night.""Today was a reality check. We need to be better,"" said Fabregas to DAZN.""What I sure was a difference in quality... They were devastating when they took the ball off us and we gave away too many easy balls. That's not tactics, that's down to individual quality.""Marco Brescianini and Mateo Retegui, recent acquisitions for Atalanta, delivered a remarkable debut performance in their match against Lecce. The Europa League champions have faced a challenging summer, dealing with significant injuries and players pushing for transfers.Brescianini, who joined from Frosinone just days prior, scored the opening goal by capitalizing on a rebound in the 35th minute. He later sealed the victory with a composed finish in the 66th minute, making it 4-0.Between Brescianini's goals, Italian forward Retegui showcased his prowess by scoring a powerful header just before half-time. He then earned and successfully converted a penalty kick shortly before the hour mark, contributing to Atalanta's dominant away display.""It's better than even I could have imagined,"" said Brescianini, who is from just outside Bergamo, where Atalanta are based. ""I'm really happy to be wearing this jersey and I hope to repay the faith the club and fans have shown in me.""Atalanta's squad has been severely impacted by injuries, with key players Gianluca Scamacca and Giorgio Scalvini among those currently unavailable. The team is also dealing with the absence of several other players due to various fitness issues.In addition to the injury woes, head coach Gian Piero Gasperini had to make tough decisions regarding his lineup. Teun Koopmeiners and Ademola Lookman, the latter of whom scored a memorable hat-trick in the Europa League final, were both omitted from the squad as they seek transfers before the window closes.""No-one expected to be in this situation,"" Gasperini told Sky Sport. ""I have to play it by ear right now... I don't know what's going to happen in the coming 10 days but our job is to build as much as we can.""Atalanta CEO Luca Percassi has suggested that the club may still be able to resolve the situation with the two players who have expressed their desire to leave, despite the imminent start of the match.Reports indicate that Paris Saint-Germain is keen on acquiring the services of Nigerian attacker Lookman.""Our idea is that for the first time in our history to not let our big players go,"" Percassi told Sky Sport. ""We can't wait for this transfer window to close.""",Juventus defeated newly-promoted Como 3-0 in their Serie A clash. Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah scored in the first half.

"Jannik Sinner cleared of wrongdoing after failed drug tests, ITIA says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-cleared-of-wrongdoing-after-failed-drug-tests-itia-says/articleshow/112667044.cms,"Jannik Sinner , the world's top-ranked tennis player, tested positive for a banned substance in two separate drug tests conducted in March. However, an independent tribunal has exonerated him of any wrongdoing, the International Tennis Integrity Agency announced on Tuesday, just days before the Italian is scheduled to compete in the US Open .The tribunal, organized by Sport Resolutions, accepted Sinner's explanation that the anabolic agent clostebol entered his system through massages and sports therapy administered by a member of his support team.According to the ITIA, Sinner stated that his physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi , used an over-the-counter spray containing clostebol to treat a minor finger injury. Naldi then performed massages on Sinner between March 5-13 without wearing gloves, inadvertently transferring the substance to the tennis star's body.Naldi had no knowledge that the substance he applied to his wound had clostebol in it, according to Sinner. Clostebol, a steroid, can be utilized to increase muscle mass.The initial positive sample from Sinner was collected on March 10, followed by another one eight days later. Although provisional suspensions were imposed after each positive result, his team's prompt appeals allowed him to continue participating in competitions.""Sinner's results, prize money and ranking points from the ATP Masters 1000 event at Indian Wells, where the player tested positive in competition for clostebol, are disqualified, "" ITIA said in a statement, citing World Anti-Doping Code and Tennis Anti-Doping Programme regulations.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has announced its intention to examine the ruling and has retained the option to challenge it. Sinner has consistently asserted his innocence throughout the process.According to Sinner, the quantity of clostebol detected in his system was minuscule, amounting to less than one billionth of a gram.""I will now put this challenging and deeply unfortunate period behind me,"" the 23-year-old said in a statement posted to social media.The ATP Tour emphasized that the incident ""underscores the need for players and their entourages to take utmost care in the use of products or treatments.""This incident follows another high-profile case involving Simona Halep, a two-time major champion. Halep's initial four-year doping suspension was reduced to nine months earlier this year after she tested positive for a banned substance at the 2022 U.S. Open. She maintained that she had inadvertently consumed the blood-booster roxadustat through tainted nutritional supplements.As the world's top-ranked player, Sinner was already anticipating increased attention upon his arrival in New York for the year's final major, which begins on Monday. However, this situation has added an extra layer of scrutiny, coming just a day after his victory in a significant U.S. Open preparatory tournament in Cincinnati.""It's certainly surprising and shocking, at this moment, especially to me when it happened apparently in March,"" seven-times major winner and ESPN analyst John McEnroe said.""I don't know how they differentiate between one person, you know, sort of saying he was unaware of it and the reasons behind it and then someone else who says the same thing, you know, gets suspended.""Nick Kyrgios disagreed with the ruling.""Ridiculous - whether it was accidental or planned. You get tested twice with a banned substance ... you should be gone for 2 years. Your performance was enhanced,"" Kyrgios said on X.",World's top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner tested positive for a banned substance in two separate drug tests conducted in March.

If I had a ban, why was I asked (to play)?”That was Mukund Sasikumar venting his frustration on social media after a news report said that he had been suspended for two Davis Cup ties over his non-availability for the World Group playoff against Pakistan earlier this year.Mukund has also opted out of the upcoming World Group I tie against Sweden in Stockholm but for reasons different from the one he had for skipping the visit to Islamabad in February. The 27-year-old had cited ""personal reasons"" then while his refusal to go to Sweden was down to a combination of factors.""I was asked to play (against Sweden) by captain ( Rohit Rajpal ) and coach, and I chose not to play because one, I don't have a visa and two, I just didn’t want to be there due to bad management,"" Mukund posted on Instagram to rebut the report of his ban.AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar said ""the decision (to sanction Mukund) was taken during the executive committee meeting soon after the Pakistan tie,"" but was evasive when asked for more details.""You should ask him (Mukund) why is he not playing for the country. Even when there is a ban, my captain had called him (urging him to play),"" Dhupar said.And that was even more odd: Why would the captain reach out to a player suspended by the association -- unless, of course, there was no ban to begin with?It maybe noted that Rajpal is also the treasurer of AITA, and as such is a member of the executive committee, which according to Dhupar handed out the two-tie suspension.As it turns out, the only information on record is that the chairman of the selection committee, former Davis Cup player and coach Nandan Bal, had recommended that Mukund be not considered for selection since he had made himself unavailable for national duty for a third time.There is neither a reference to Mukund being show-caused nor a discussion of his case by the ethics committee before the executive committee made its decision.The Chennai lad, who had reached a career-high ranking of 229 in 2019 before the pandemic threw a spanner in his works, regretted his emotional outburst on Instagram but reiterated his frustrations.""The medium, what I wrote, the choice of words were not right. I do not want a younger player to express himself in the way I had done, I regret that,"" he told The Times of India.""But the emotions were bottling up. My name had been in the papers for the wrong reasons, it has been there for many months and it got to me.""Mukund was referring to the tie against Morocco in Lucknow last September where he conceded the opening singles rubber due to cramps and was also pulled up by the association for wearing a jersey which had India's name on his back wrongly spelt.""What happened was not fair. You cannot ban a player just like that without informing the player. I would have understood if there was a breach of code (of conduct) or my actions had been harmful to my team.""There cannot be a ban only because I was not available to play. I should not have worn (that shirt), but to be treated like a criminal when it was not intended, how could I have known what's written in the back?""It should have been sorted out in the locker room or through a personal call ... We players are a bit thick-skinned but it is not easy for parents and friends to read about this in the media.""Mukund is not the first player, nor will he be the last, to make himself unavailable for a Davis Cup tie. Sumit Nagal opted out of the Pakistan tie saying his game was not suited for grass while Yuki Bhambri has skipped the Sweden match for reasons unknown.So, why single out Mukund?And the right-hander, who has been going through a challenging phase over the past two years, both on the court since the pandemic as well as off the court, posed some important questions.""It is a misconception that you represent your country only when you play the Davis Cup. It is wrong,"" Mukund had told TOI earlier this year while discussing his decision to not go to Pakistan.""Even when you play a Grand Slam, an ATP or WTA event, or any event, you are representing your country. The top players don't play the Davis Cup, but nobody makes an issue out of it.""There are 100 ways to show your love for your country. Even a simple act of following rules and being a good citizen means a lot.""Or you can help groom the next generation, like Rohan (Bopanna) and Somdev (Devvarman) are doing.""Now, that is something alien to the higher echelons of AITA!","Mukund Sasikumar has been suspended for two Davis Cup ties by All India Tennis Association. The 27-year-old has also opted out of the upcoming World Group I tie against Sweden in Stockholm. AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar said ""the decision (to sanction Mukund) was taken during the executive committee meeting""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112661274,imgsize-32160,width-400,resizemode-4/112661274.jpg"
Why tennis star Jannik Sinner tested positive for steroids twice but faces no suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/why-tennis-star-jannik-sinner-tested-positive-for-steroids-twice-but-faces-no-suspension/articleshow/112659493.cms,"NEW DELHI: Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner, currently ranked among the world's top players, faced a doping investigation after testing positive for a banned anabolic steroid in March 2023.While the positive tests resulted in the forfeiture of prize money and ranking points earned at the Indian Wells tournament, Sinner will not face suspension from professional tennis.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced on August 22nd that an independent tribunal determined Sinner's violation was unintentional. This decision follows a hearing held on August 15th, where evidence and testimonies were presented.Sinner, who achieved a career-high ranking of world No. 1 in June 2023, provided an explanation for the positive tests.He claimed that a member of his support team unknowingly used an over-the-counter spray containing Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, to treat a minor wound on Sinner. The same team member subsequently administered massages to Sinner, inadvertently leading to the contamination.The ITIA, after reviewing the evidence and accepting Sinner's explanation, concluded that the violation lacked intent.This determination, supported by the independent tribunal's findings, resulted in a ""No Fault or Negligence"" ruling, effectively clearing Sinner of intentional doping charges.The incident occurred during the Indian Wells tournament, where Sinner initially tested positive for low levels of Clostebol metabolites.A second positive test from an out-of-competition sample collected eight days later led to a provisional suspension, which was later lifted following Sinner's successful appeal.Despite the investigation and its impact on his Indian Wells results, Sinner has continued to excel on the court.

Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka win Cincinnati Open titles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-and-aryna-sabalenka-win-cincinnati-open-titles/articleshow/112639015.cms,"Top-seeded Jannik Sinner and the second-ranked women's player Ayrna Sabalenka both secured respective victories in straight sets during the Cincinnati Open finals on Monday. This marks the first time either player has won the title at the prestigious tournament.In the women's final, Sabalenka triumphed over Jessica Pegula 6-3, 7-5, claiming her first title since her victory at the Australian Open earlier this year in January.Sinner, who celebrated his 23rd birthday on Friday, defeated American player Frances Tiafoe 7-6 (4), 6-2. With this win, Sinner becomes the youngest champion at the Cincinnati Open since Andy Murray's victory in 2008 at the age of 21.“I’m very happy to be in the position where I am,"" Sinner said, as quoted by AP. ""I'm just trying to keep going this way mentally. It's important to recover to be ready for New York. That's the most important thing.”The US Open is set to commence on August 26 in New York City.In Cincinnati, Sinner and Tiafoe both reached their maiden finals, surpassing their previous best performances of reaching the third round.Despite Tiafoe's efforts to force a tiebreak in the opening set, a series of three consecutive errors resulted in a 7-6 loss.Sinner established a commanding 5-1 lead in the second set, but Tiafoe managed to save three match points, narrowing the gap to 5-2. However, Sinner ultimately prevailed, successfully serving out the match to secure the victory.Tiafoe's journey to the final was marked by unusual circumstances. In the quarterfinals on Saturday, he claimed the first set before his opponent, Hubert Hurkacz, retired due to a calf injury. Subsequently, in the semifinals, Tiafoe showcased his resilience by saving two match points and defeating Holger Rune in a thrilling three-set encounter.An American male tennis player hasn't secured the championship in Cincinnati since 2006, when Andy Roddick achieved the feat.Sabalenka, who climbed to the No. 2 position in the rankings prior to the match, showcased her dominance by winning the tournament without dropping a single set. This victory marks her 15th WTA title.Despite her previous struggles in Cincinnati, where she had never advanced beyond the semifinals, losing three times at that stage, Sabalenka finally broke through to claim the trophy.At 26 years old, Sabalenka has established herself as a top contender for the upcoming U.S. Open. The Belarusian player was forced to miss Wimbledon due to a shoulder injury but made her return to the tour two weeks ago in Washington.“I would say that I'm really playing great tennis,” Sabalenka said. “Probably not the best tennis I can play but I'm definitely getting there. Hopefully at the US Open I can reach even higher levels.”Sabalenka quickly established a commanding 4-1 lead in the opening set against Pegula, taking just 17 minutes to assert her dominance. Despite Pegula's efforts to mount a comeback, including breaking Sabalenka's serve for the first time to level the second set at 5-5, her five double faults proved costly.Sabalenka, however, remained focused and determined, claiming the next two games to secure victory in a match that lasted 1 hour and 14 minutes.“She was playing at a high level and never really came down,” Pegula said. “When she’s serving really well, it’s tough, especially on these fast courts.”Pegula, the sixth-ranked player, faced a tough journey to reach the final. Following her successful title defense in Toronto, the American had to play two matches on Friday due to delays caused by weather conditions. Additionally, three of her matches extended to three sets.“I'm proving to myself that I can play a lot of matches and overcome a lot of challenges,” Pegula said. “I'm looking forward to not doing anything for a few days.""Sabalenka joined top-ranked Iga Swiatek as the only players with 10 or more WTA titles since 2020. She beat Swiatek in the Cincinnati semis.","Top-seeded Jannik Sinner defeated Frances Tiafoe 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the final of the Cincinnati Open.
