NEW DELHI: Authorities have ramped up security for the India-Pakistan T20 World Cup match scheduled for June 6 in New York after ISIS-K called for a ""Lone Wolf"" attack on the event. The terror group has released a video urging independent attackers to act, prompting an urgent response from local and state officials.Patrick Ryder, the Police Commissioner of Nassau County , where the match will take place, confirmed the threat and outlined the steps being taken to ensure safety.""In a video that has gone global, the terror group is calling for that 'Lone Wolf' to act out,"" said Ryder. ""When you have a game and a crowd as big as this, everything is credible.""Ryder explained the nature of the threat, which has evolved since April. Initially, it was a broad, international threat from ISIS-Khorasan, but it recently became more specific to the India-Pakistan match .""Then it got a little bit more specific towards the actual game of India versus Pakistan but did not name the place,"" he said. The latest development includes a video showing drones flying over the cricket stadiumwith the date ""9/6/2024"".In response, New York Governor Kathy Hochul has directed the New York State Police to implement heightened security measures.""There is no credible public safety threat at this time,"" Hochul said, but added, ""We continue to monitor the situation closely. My administration has been working for months with federal law enforcement and Nassau County to ensure New Yorkers and visitors are safe.""Bruce Blakeman, the head of Nassau County, assured that every precaution is being taken. ""We take every threat seriously. There are the same procedures for every threat. We don't minimize threats. We track down all of our leads,"" he said at a news conference.Security will be significantly increased at the cricket stadium in Eisenhower Park , where the match is scheduled. Additional police officers will be mobilized, and local hospitals are on alert. ""We will go to every fine detail when it comes to the security and safety of the residents here,"" said Ryder.The threat includes potential drone attacks, leading county officials to request the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to designate Eisenhower Park as a no-fly zone for drones.ISIS-K, an offshoot of the Islamic State operating in South and Central Asia, has a history of violent attacks, including a deadly assault on a Moscow concert hall in March. This context underscores the severity of the current threat.The India-Pakistan match is a key fixture in the T20 World Cup, which starts on June 1 with a warm-up match between India and Bangladesh.NBC New York TV reported that the security preparations for the World Cup event are the largest Nassau County has ever undertaken, comparable to those for presidential debates.The British newspaper Express first reported the threat, indicating it also extends to sporting venues across Europe, including Wembley Stadium. According to the Express, ISIS followers are being encouraged to target major events, including the Cricket World Cup, using tactics like drone attacks.""We make sure that we are on top of every situation that could potentially arise. Now to that end, we have taken many, many precautions,"" Blakeman assured the public.Authorities continue to treat every lead with utmost seriousness to ensure the safety of all attendees and participants in the T20 World Cup.","ISIS-K calls for a ""Lone Wolf"" attack on the event.

Virat Kohli's childhood coach suggests MS Dhoni for India's head coach role; Gautam Gambhir remains the front-runner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/virat-kohlis-childhood-coach-suggests-ms-dhoni-for-indias-head-coach-role-gautam-gambhir-remains-frontrunner/articleshow/110548847.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the deadline to apply for the Indian men's cricket team's head coach role ending on May 27, speculation is rife about who will replace Rahul Dravid . BCCI secretary Jay Shah hinted that the new head coach is likely to be an Indian, with reports suggesting Gautam Gambhir as the top contender. However, Virat Kohli 's childhood coach, Rajkumar Sharma , has floated the idea of MS Dhoni taking up the role.Speaking to India News, the Dronacharya awardee coach expressed his views on Dhoni being an ideal candidate.""First of all, it will be interesting to see which names apply for this post. I would like that whoever becomes the coach should be an Indian. If Mahendra Singh Dhoni announces retirement, he can prove to be a good option. He (Dhoni) has played a lot of cricket and has won big tournaments,"" Sharma said.While Dhoni has not officially announced his retirement from the IPL, his future remains uncertain. The IPL 2024 was speculated to be his final season, but the Chennai Super Kings legend has kept everyone guessing. CSK CEO Kasi Viswanath even stated that he expects Dhoni to return for another season.Sharma emphasized Dhoni's potential impact as a coach, citing his experience and respect within the team.""Dhoni will have more respect in the dressing room and he has played this format for a long time. Being able to plan for the team and manage it properly is most needed in the team because when Dhoni became the captain, there were big players in that team like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble, Gautam Gambhir, and Yuvraj Singh. Despite this, Dhoni handled the team brilliantly,"" Sharma added.Dhoni previously worked with the Indian team as a mentor during the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE, showcasing his potential as a guiding figure for the team. As Dravid's contract ends this year after the T20 World Cup, the appointment of his successor is highly anticipated.Gambhir, who recently mentored Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL title, is seen as a strong candidate for the head coach position. His success with KKR and experience as a former India player make him a compelling choice.","The deadline to apply for the Indian men's cricket team's head coach role ends on May 27.

NEW DELHI: An Argentine criminal court has deferred the commencement of a trial concerning the criminal negligence linked to the demise of football icon Diego Maradona to October 1, from its initial start date of June 4.This decision was made by the court located in San Isidro, near Buenos Aires, following the emergence of several unresolved issues highlighted by all parties involved in the case, as reported by local media. The specific details of these issues were not disclosed by the court.Diego Maradona, celebrated for leading Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup, passed away at the age of 60 on November 25, 2020, due to cardiorespiratory arrest. The initiation of the investigation into his death was prompted by requests from Maradona's family members shortly after his passing.The trial targets eight individuals, including medical professionals and nursing staff, who are accused of contributing to Maradona's death. Maradona was under their care at a rented property following a surgery intended to address potential brain bleeding. The accused have refuted claims of any misconduct or lapses in the medical treatment provided to Maradona.A pivotal aspect of the case yet to be determined is whether the trial will be conducted before the three magistrates of the court or a popular jury, as requested by one of the accused nurses. The trial is expected to feature testimonies from over 200 witnesses, encompassing Maradona's daughters and several of his former partners.A medical examination report revealed that Maradona suffered from cardiac insufficiency and experienced prolonged agony for up to 12 hours prior to his death.The report further indicated that Maradona did not receive the level of medical care appropriate for a patient in his condition, raising questions about the adequacy of the treatment he was provided. This trial aims to address these concerns and ascertain the accountability of the individuals involved in Maradona's care.","Argentine court postpones trial into death of football icon Diego Maradona to October 1.

He believes that an open dialogue fosters a positive environment, where players feel valued and motivated to perform at their best.Rohit feels the ultimate challenge for any captain is to make sure every player is on the same page.""The biggest challenge for any captain is to handle different kinds of players, since every individual has a separate thought process and varying demands. What a captain can do is absorb all things and respond accordingly.The biggest thing I have learned since becoming captain is that every player should be given equal importance so that everyone feels that they are part of this team and they are important,"" Rohit said on Star Sports .""Whenever someone comes up to you with a problem, you must listen carefully and give them the best solution. I believe that I have to prepare not only as a captain but also as a player,"" Rohit further said.Rohit clearly stated that his approach to leading the team is a little different.""My approach to captaincy is different, as I believe in more data-based analysis and understanding of the new trends. I spend a lot of time in meeting rooms to prepare myself for certain situations that might arise during the match. It's basically not for the player but for me because I need to know about these situations, and when they come on the field, I should be ready with answers.This is the way I prepare as I go through everything, and if I feel that some important things need to be shared with the players, then I do it with them; otherwise, if it's not important, then I won't. But for me, I go with my prep to get to know about the ground, the opposition, and how the team against me is playing of late.The T20 format is always changing, and each player is playing differently. You need to understand their style of play, and as per that, we tell our bowlers and batters to plan accordingly.

To meet the requirements of the International Cricket Council ( ICC ), the Uganda team faced a situation where they were forced to change the design of their T20 World Cup jersey, according to a report on cricket.com.au.The original design was chosen from the three that were shortlisted after a public competition by the country's cricket federation. The competition concluded in March this year with Elijah Mangeni's winning design inspired by country's national bird, the grey crowned crane.The ICC, however, asked the team to alter the design by removing the feathered pattern in order to better highlight the sponsor logos. In the changed design, the wings can only be faintly seen and an alteration on the similar lines was made on the trousers as well.The changed jersey was revealed at a ceremony before the team's departure to the West Indies, and the surprised fans asked questions on social media, which led to an explanation from Musali Denis, the Uganda Cricket Association's public relations officer.""The ICC asked for a change in the design but we didn’t have enough time to make the required changes and had to compromise on the winning design. We lost just about 20 per cent of the original design, but the rest of the design is the same,"" Musali was quoted as saying by the cricket.com.au report.Tournament debutants Uganda begin their T20 World Cup campaign on June 3 against Afghanistan in Guyana.","Uganda team forced to change the design of their T20 World Cup jersey.

They later taken on USA and Canada, before going into the Super 8s, which will be played in the West Indies.""India start as favourites to win the tournament. The current Indian team is amongst the best in the world, I would say. If they had to keep players like (Shubman) Gill (KL) Rahul and Rinku (Singh) out, I'm sure that this is a very strong side. It's a fantastic team. If they play as per their ability, I'm sure that they'll win the Cup, but they must believe that they are the best in the world. I'm sure that if they use their experience and tactics of the IPL, they'll have a very good chance,"" Vengsarkar said on Wednesday at a Sports Journalists' Association of Mumbai function to honour veteran sports journalists at the Wankhede Stadium, where he was the chief guest.Vengsarkar tipped India to beat Pakistan in the south Asian cricket giants encounter during the tournament. ""It's a big match for the players of both the teams, because you've to win the match as Pakistan are India's traditional rivals for many years. Pakistan have a good side. The India-Pakistan match is more of a mental game than a physical one. I think that the team which is mentally stronger will win, because of the pressure involved. India definitely start as the favourites in that match. As I said, they've a fantastic team,"" Vengsarkar said.Finding it slightly tough to pick his four potential semifinalists, Vengsarkar said, ""It's very difficult to say that, because the least fancied team can beat the best side in this kind of a tournament.

I can't say that 'X' 'Y' or 'Z' are the key players of the team. In this format, any body can win the match at any time in the game. Like in the IPL, the first six overs are very important.

Recalling that time, the veteran of 116 Tests said, ""When we started out in 2007, the BCCI was the last board to accept the T20 format. So, we didn't see anybody playing in this format. So, it was very difficult for us to pick the side. We made MS Dhoni captain of the team. We wanted players who 'll bring in energy (to the team), who are aggressive and are young. I remember that our first match was against Pakistan, and it went to the last ball. India won that match, and then Yuvraj Singh smashed those six sixes off England pacer Stuart Broad in one over, and then India won a thrilling final against Pakistan. Basically, everybody played well.""""Of course, over the years, the BCCI started the IPL, and the Indian players have played fantastic cricket in it.

NEW DELHI: To some, it might appear as extreme arrogance, but when Riyan Parag looks you in the eye and declares, ""I am going to play for India no matter what,"" it's a testament to his immense self-belief in his own skill set and abilities.""At some point, you'll have to take me, right? So that is my belief, I'm going to play for India. I don't really care when,"" Parag stated confidently during his exclusive interaction with PTI on Wednesday.No youngster has polarized opinions as quickly as the 22-year-old from Assam, who had a breakout IPL season, amassing 573 runs at a strike rate close to 150 while batting at No. 4 for the Rajasthan Royals In his previous five years in the IPL, Riyan, a 2018 U-19 World Cup winner, never even reached a 200-run season. He faced harsh criticism on social media as he transitioned from boyhood to manhood.""When I was not scoring runs - I said this in an earlier interview as well - that I am going to play for India,"" Parag reiterated on the sidelines of a Red Bull Campus Cricket tournament in Mumbai on Wednesday, a tournament he praised for giving exposure to talented youngsters.""That is me believing in myself. That is not me being arrogant. That was my plan with my dad (former Railways and Assam player Parag Das) when I started playing cricket at around 10 years old. We (a joint project) were going to play for India regardless of anything.""Riyan, Abhishek Sharma , and Harshit Rana have a high likelihood of being selected for the upcoming cricket tour in Zimbabwe.""Whether it's the next tour, whether it's a tour in six months, whether it's a tour in one year... I don't really put my thought behind when I should play. That is the selector's job, that is other people's job,"" Riyan said.Having learned the hard way about the downsides of social media, he has stopped taking things to heart.""You've got to be very quick and very sharp when reacting to things. Social media and all of that play a big part with mental pressure. Because once you start listening to those things... it always starts in a merry way, right?,"" he asked.""Once you start performing, people really hype you up. Once you start reading that, you get that satisfaction of listening to other people or watching other things.""This year's IPL served as a testament to his belonging at the elite level.""But what I've figured out in the last year or two is that I've got to have an undeniable stack of proof that I belong at this level. Which means (that) me practising a lot, me practising at that level, practicing those situations,” Parag said.What has been his biggest takeaway from the season.""The biggest thing that I've taken away from the last season is that believing in yourself actually works out, because a lot of people say a lot of different things, whether it's negative, whether it's positive. But at the end of the day, what matters is what you think about yourself and that is what I've been for,"" he said.Since his debut season with the Rajasthan Royals in 2018, Riyan's performance over the past five seasons has been disappointing, with his totals reading 160, 86, 93, 183, and 78.""I had a lot of rough seasons, more than (the) nice ones and I feel having that constant belief in yourself, that you actually belong in this level, that you can actually do things that you (had) dreamt of, has been a constant and that will stay throughout.""""What you saw this year in the IPL is how I play domestic cricket. I take the onus up to myself, I take the expectations, I take the burden upon myself to deliver and that is why I play the best,"" he said.So what changed from previous years?""I was not doing that in the IPL. I was taking way too much pressure, keeping my expectations way too high and not doing the basic things right.""Additionally, playing at a crucial No. 4 slot for RR also worked.""That is what I figured (that) I had to do this year; of playing at my favourite position as well, No 4 . I was like, okay, ""I do this at domestic cricket, this is the same thing I'm going to do in IPL and let's see how it goes"". It worked out perfectly,” he said.During a substantial period in this IPL season, RR enjoyed a commendable streak, only to see their momentum wane as they reached the playoffs, ultimately securing the third position. Parag conceded that there's still a tinge of disappointment hanging in the air.""""I'm still dealing with it. I got back home and I was super sad. The night after the game, it didn't really sink in. But then the day after the match, and before the final, it was tough,"" he said.""It's tough, but then that's how cricket goes.

That's what I talk about (when I mention) his strike rate. I felt that he was afraid to get out because he was worried about what is behind him rather than (saying), 'I'm so good'. It is the same thing I said about Babar and I had a chat with him after I talked about it in Pakistan and he said that his coaches told him the same thing. What I loved about (Kohli) this year was the intent to hit sixes,"" said Doull on Cricbuzz.He stated that his main point has always been that Kohli shouldn't have to worry about getting out, and that it was probably one of the few negative comments he has made about the former RCB captain.""He is too good to worry about getting out and that was always my point. I have said a thousand great things about Virat Kohli but I say one thing negative or construed to be negative, and I get death threats. That's the shame of it,"" he said.""There has never been an issue and I would never have a reason to have personal problems. When I look at the game and the way it has moved, particularly with the impact sub, a strike rate of 130-135 didn't cut it any more,"" he said.Kohli finished the IPL 2024 as the highest run-getter with 741 runs in 15 matches including a century and five fifties.

De Villiers, who retired in 2018, is relieved to be a mere spectator this time around.""It's a shame going into a tournament to have the focus on that.I mean it's nothing new, it's just a shame. Luckily this time around, I've had nothing to do with anything over there.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona have named Hansi Flick , the former coach of the German national team and Bayern Munich , as their new head coach on a two-year deal.Flick, who has been out of club management since his dismissal from the German team in September 2023, will be responsible for turning around Barcelona's fortunes following a disappointing season under Xavi Hernandez , who was fired on Friday.The club's statement emphasized Flick's reputation for ""high pressing, intense and daring style of play which has brought him great success at club level and international level, winning pretty much all there is to win in the world of football"".They specifically highlighted his achievements with Bayern during the 2019-20 season, when he led the team to six titles, including the Bundesliga , German Cup, Champions League, German Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and Club World Cup.Flick faces a significant challenge in addressing Barcelona's on-field issues while also navigating off-field turmoil, such as the club's financial difficulties and an ongoing refereeing scandal.He gained recognition as an assistant to Germany manager Joachim Low during their victorious 2014 World Cup campaign before joining Bayern as head coach in 2019, where he secured seven trophies in two seasons.Despite his success at Bayern, Flick's tenure with the German national team was marred by criticism following their early exit from the 2022 World Cup and a heavy home defeat to Japan in a friendly, which ultimately led to his dismissal in September 2023.

He added that ""The only thing that can save them is winning, whether they have been part of the club or not.""In addition to finishing second to Real Madrid in La Liga , Barcelona was eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Paris Saint-Germain.Reports suggest that Laporta was angered by Xavi's comments in May, which highlighted the economic challenges Barcelona faced when competing against Real Madrid and other top European clubs.",Barcelona appoint Hansi Flick as their new head coach on a two-year deal.

About a lot of things. We discuss our holidays and vacations. In the national camp too, after our meals in the dining room, we sit and chat for a while, sharing laughter. Sharing the dressing room with him has been great.""Adding a message for Chhetri, Thapa said, ""Although Sunil bhai knows everything about football and life and has been the one always guiding us, my message to him would be that now is the time you can eat what you want to, you can enjoy with your son in your free time. And our plan to go on a vacation together is still on.""With 57 caps, the midfielder has the third-highest appearances for India among the current players behind Chhetri and Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.Thapa's international career stretches back almost seven years now.""Seven years with the national team have been fantastic. I've played with some great players in the past and now also players keep coming. I'm still learning a lot from my teammates and playing international matches for my country.""I was fortunate enough to continue playing without missing any camps in those seven years,"" said Thapa.",Anirudh Thapa says India need to win their next two matches to qualify for the third round of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers. India face Kuwait at home on June 6 and Qatar away on June 11. The match against Kuwait will be the legendary Sunil Chhetri's farewell from international football.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110502324,imgsize-49332,width-400,resizemode-4/110502324.jpg"

Belgian David Goffin faced a hostile crowd during his grueling first-round match against French wild card Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at the French Open in Paris.The atmosphere on Court 14 was intense, with the usually tranquil Roland Garros courts transformed into a raucous arena as fans rallied behind the local favorite.Despite the challenging conditions, Goffin maintained his composure and emerged victorious with a hard-fought 4-6 6-4 6-3 6-7(4) 6-3 scoreline.However, the former world number seven was subjected to what he described as ""total disrespect"" from the partisan crowd , even alleging that a spectator spat at him during the match.As Goffin left the court following his triumph, he held his hand to his ears in response to the loud jeers from the crowd, highlighting the intense and sometimes hostile atmosphere that can arise when a French player competes on home soil.""When you are insulted for 3-1/2 hours, you have to tease the public a little,"" Goffin told Belgian media. ""Clearly, it goes too far, it's total disrespect.""It's really too much. It's becoming football, soon there will be smoke bombs, hooligans and fights in the stands. It's starting to become ridiculous. Some people are there more to cause trouble than to create an atmosphere.""Someone spat out their chewing gum at me. It (the match) was getting complicated. That's why I wanted to stay calm. If I started to get angry about it, it could have destabilised me.""Goffin called upon the organisers of the second Grand Slam tournament of the year to address the issue at hand and take necessary measures. He emphasised the need for the tournament officials to respond appropriately and ensure that the matter is dealt with effectively.""A lot of people are complaining, a lot of umpires feel that there is a lot of disrespect,"" Goffin added. ""This is repeated a lot in the locker room and among the ATP authorities. We're going to have to do something about that.""I think it only happens in France. At Wimbledon, obviously, there's not that. Or in Australia either. At the U.S. Open, it's still rather quiet. Here, it's a really unhealthy atmosphere.""Tournament organisers said officials would ensure that fans follow the rules and respect players.""The public are incredibly enthusiastic, particularly on the outside courts,"" they said in a statement.""However, they must of course show full respect to all players while doing so. Oversight bodies are in place to make sure rules are followed.""Although it's only natural that fans share their excitement and cheer on their favourites, this may not in any case go against the values of tennis or consideration for the players.""In the previous year's tournament, Taylor Fritz faced a hostile reception from the spectators at Philippe Chatrier. The American player was subjected to boos and whistles after defeating Arthur Rinderknech, leading him to repeatedly silence the crowd.Dealing with a disapproving audience can be a daunting experience for any player, as demonstrated by Martina Hingis' encounter during the 1999 final against Steffi Graf.Jeered by the fans after disputing a line call while 6-4, 2-0 up, the Swiss lost her composure and the match, only to be booed again after match-point.","Belgian David Goffin faced a hostile crowd during his first-round match at the French Open.
