By his own admission, 29-year-old Swapnil Kusale shoots more bullets than the words he speaks on a normal day. The shy Kolhapur rifle shooter doesn't plan to change this trait. He says it helps him focus more on his only priority - shooting.With a bronze in Paris Olympics, Swapnil became the first and only Indian to win a medal in the men's 50m rifle 3 positions event in Olympics history.Swapnil is only the second Olympic medallist from Maharashtra after Khashaba Jadhav's wrestling third-place finish in the 1952 Games. The soft-spoken, tall and 'fitness freak' shooter visited The Times of India's Pune office with his coach Deepali Deshpande , an Olympian herself (2004 Athens). They spoke about his journey to the Summer Games, his bronze-winning shot and how his dream of winning an Olympic gold is a work in progress.Swapnil said he was away from the social media for 6-7 months before leaving for Paris. ""I played some video games to de-stress and spend time with close friends,"" he said. The Kolhapur-born, Pune-based shooter is itching to get back to his routine and is ""avoiding overeating"" while his family and friends celebrate his success. He, however, doesn't mind a few extra servings of his favourite 'pooran poli', a Maharashtrian delicacy made of jaggery, chana dal and wheat.I am on a (forced) break for now. I am waiting for Deepali ma'am's call to resume practice. I am planning to slowly get back to my routine from September onwards and prepare for the World Cup Final.He feeds on shooting. Even after the Olympic trials, the team went to Munich; it was very hectic. I want him to take a break. But he cannot do without practice for more than four days.In his previous big finals, he had lost out on the medals because of the standing position. Prone and kneeling are his forte. He has been shooting in the prone since his junior days and defeated even Gagan Narang in prone final in the 2015 Nationals. But this time, prone was not bad, but somehow it was not on target. He made his weakness (standing) his strength and that made me quite happy.I was prepared to win (he missed the quota by a small margin) even for Tokyo. Our planning went for a toss due to the one-year delay due to the Covid pandemic.Because of the shorter Olympic cycle (three years), a few shooters, including Swapnil, were sitting on the fence. They were the easiest to train as they were already there (mentally and technically).I do not find thrill in 10m. I find 3P very challenging. My passion is 50 metres. It's thrilling, different, and an outdoor event. There are challenges of wind, light, managing three positions. The sound of the bullet excites me.I did not think much about the shots I missed. It was not worth thinking. What to think about the (preceding) bad shot in that fraction of a second (before the next shot) is also an art. My mentors taught me to just analyse why it happened and move on. I knew what went wrong at that point, so I corrected it and shot the next one.Though the noise is usually loud, this time I did not wear my earplugs. I tried this during the training too. Wearing earplugs made me conscious of my heartbeat and pulse. I was feeling those beats, which in a way put me under pressure. But when I removed the earplugs, the cheering from the Indian supporters motivated me and made me happy. I wanted to do even better in order to hear the cheer louder from the crowd.It is true. I like to listen more and talk less. It also helps a lot during shooting because we have to be at the lane all the time, so nobody talks to each other much. The self talk helps.I always tell them that once you talk to someone, you give them the right to talk to you. If you don't want anybody to talk to you, don't talk to them. His social circle is very small.When you see them grow, you get to know them in-and-out. Because of this long association, I got to know him so well that even while talking about his doubts from Paris on phone, I could sense the confidence from his voice. Such understanding happens only when you know somebody for a long time.(Vaibhav) Agashe sir has been helping me. He says talk to yourself as the anxiety lasts for a short time. It will go away only with self-talk. I go for a walk alone and speak to myself during such situations.My dream is to win an Olympic gold, which is still incomplete. I have been preparing for many years for this day. I applied these years of perseverance and made a promise to myself that come what may, I have to win. I enjoyed every bit of the journey from preparation for qualifications to the finals. I did not have any pressure as it may not help, so I chose to enjoy the road to the Olympics.Deepali ma'am is like my mother. She has seen my journey throughout my ups and downs, and my parents have always ensured I got everything I needed as I was building my career in shooting. Whether it was equipment or finances, they never let me know how they had arranged for the same for me. I had no idea how they arranged for all the money in the initial days, and I can never forget their sacrifices.(Laughs) Fortunately, I have been away from home since 2005 and led a hostel life from a very young age. I was in my village only till class IV.He is a very sincere boy. He has never misbehaved or been notorious. When I first went to the junior camp, I saw the boys, and I was thinking to myself how I would handle them. With Swapnil, however, there was never a problem. It never happened that he was called to a venue at a particular time, and he did not show up. He did not serve a single punishment in his three-year duration in the juniors category. Only once I remember in 2014, his match in the prone category was in the afternoon, and he and his teammates were shooting well. But they overslept and I saw swollen eyes. Shooters need alertness to apply the skills. If you don't sleep the entire night, you can still shoot well, but if you oversleep, then the coordination goes for a toss. That was the only time I was really angry with him. Otherwise, he is very disciplined, even with his eating habits. Once he decides some food item is not good for him, he will not touch it. Shooting is all about self-control.I miss everything about my home. In Maharashtra, we celebrate so many festivals, and I am not always there at home for the festivities, and I end up missing the family bonding during these occasions. Ultimately, these sacrifices are worth it when moments like these ( Olympic medal ) come your way. If you have a dream, you need to make these sacrifices and move on. I missed pooranpoli the most.","Swapnil Kusale won bronze in the men's 50m rifle 3 positions event at the Paris Olympics.

However, he has shown a unique skill that might give the impression of ambidexterity as he can bat left-handed for fun, although his primary batting style is right-handed.Additionally, Tendulkar used his left hand effectively when bowling spin, as he occasionally bowled left-arm orthodox spin in practice sessions.However, his professional bowling was right-handed, primarily as a medium-pacer or right-arm leg-spinner.This versatility adds to his legendary status, but in the strictest sense, he isn't considered ambidextrous.Tendulkar has frequently discussed his capacity to perform daily tasks with both hands. The legendary batsman eloquently explained his skill by stating that his right hand handles the wooden sticks while his left hand does all writing and eating.Every year, August 13 is observed as 'International Left-Handers Day ' to celebrate the uniqueness and differences of left-handed individuals.Tendulkar celebrated the 'International Left-Handers Day' in style, by playing some delightful, well-timed shots using his left hand in a video posted on social media.Sachin, who batted right-handed for most of his career, took to X and uploaded a video of himself using his left hand to play cricket and played some fun drives and slogs to perfection.With a bat in his hand, Sachin says in the video, ""Today is Left-Handers Day, so everything left can be right and right can be left. Let's try it out.""The video also has Sachin bowling left-handed and has been filmed in a way to show the legend bowling against himself.""This one is for my left-handed friends...

CAS defers verdict on Vinesh Phogat's appeal again; decision now on August 16,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/cas-defers-verdict-on-vinesh-phogats-appeal-again-decision-now-on-august-16/articleshow/112502834.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Court of Arbitration for Sport's ad-hoc division has once again postponed its ruling on Vinesh Phogat 's appeal against her disqualification from the Olympic finals. The new date for the decision is now set for August 16, which means the Indian wrestler will have to wait longer for a resolution to her case.Phogat, 29, was disqualified from competing in the women's 50kg freestyle final because she was found to be 100gm over the weight limit during the weigh-in process on Wednesday of the previous week.""The CAS ad hoc division president has allowed Hon.

Guzman Lopez had been defeated by Vinesh in the semifinal round but advanced to the final after the Indian wrestler was disqualified.Vinesh's legal representation consists of a team of French lawyers, including Joelle Monlouis, Estelle Ivanova, Habbine Estelle Kim, and Charles Amson. These attorneys have been assisting Vinesh and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) throughout the process of submitting the application. The Paris Bar has assigned these lawyers to Vinesh's case, and they are providing their services pro bono.Additionally, senior counsels Harish Salve and Vidushpat Singhania were brought in to assist her with the case.The IOA had initially scheduled a virtual press conference with its president, PT Usha, and Salve, coinciding with the anticipated timing of the verdict. However, the invitation was swiftly retracted mere minutes after the CAS released its statement.Vinesh, a three-time Olympian, made the decision to retire from the sport just a day following her disqualification. She stated, ""I don't have the strength to continue,"" expressing her inability to carry on in the wake of the recent events.The world championships bronze-medallist took desperate measures to avoid disqualification, including cutting her hair, going without food and water, and working out through the night. Ultimately, she required IV fluids due to extreme dehydration, and her situation drew widespread sympathy.Top athletes like javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, hockey star PR Sreejesh, and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar supported her and advocated for a silver medal.International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach later expressed understanding of her situation but questioned where the line should be drawn if small concessions were allowed in certain circumstances.""I must say, I have a certain understanding for the wrestler; it's clearly a human touch,"" Bach had said on Friday.""Now, it's (appeal) in CAS. We will, at the end, follow the CAS decision. But, again, the international (wrestling) federation, they have to apply their interpretation, their rules. This is their responsibility.""Nenad Lalovic, the United World Wresting (UWW) chief, however, remained doubtful that there would be any change in the results as they were only following the rules.""I am so sorry for what happened, but no matter the size of your country, athletes are athletes. This weigh-in was public, everyone saw what happened. How can we allow someone to compete when we all saw what happened.""We don't have any other choice but to follow our rules,"" Lalovic had said.The CAS ad-hoc division, set up especially for dispute resolution during the Games, had accepted Vinesh's appeal against her ouster on Friday last week.","The Court of Arbitration for Sport's ad-hoc division has once again postponed its ruling on Vinesh Phogat's appeal.

Memories of a lifetime for Manu Bhaker and Reetika Hooda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/memories-of-a-lifetime-for-manu-bhaker-and-reetika-hooda/articleshow/112481404.cms,"PARIS: Manu Bhaker fuelled India’s hopes at the Olympic Games by bagging two bronze medals, so it was only fitting that the youngster came back from Delhi to carry the flag along with bronze winner and retiring hockey goalkeeper PR Sreejesh as the curtains came at the stroke of midnight here at the Stade de France.Manu, who won third place in women’s 10m air pistol and team events and narrowly missed another third place in the women’s 25 pistol final, enjoyed every moment of the three-hour long spectacle in front of more than 71,500 spectators, who filled the stands hours in advance for the program, that started with a musical performance followed by the entry of flagbearers from 205 delegations.Sreejesh and Manu walked in dressed in the official team colours with ‘India’ glittering in golden bold letters on the back as loud applause rang from the hundreds of Indians who had taken their seat for the closing ceremony. “It was an unforgettable moment and I’ll always cherish this day,” Bhaker said. The 22-year-old added that it was “such a great honour to carry the national flag”.Manu’s only disappointment was that she couldn’t capture some of the treasured moments on her mobile phone. “Manu lost her phone when she returned to Delhi. She put it in airplane mode and left it on her seat and forgot to take it with her after landing in Delhi. It was a big loss as it was the same phone that was gifted to her by the official sponsor at the Tokyo Games,” sources told TOI. “A complaint was lodged with the carrier and we searched in the lost-andfound items. But Manu’s mobile was not there,” sources added.Sreejesh, meanwhile, had no such problems and he was seen clicking away after they took turns to wave the national flag.Wrestler Reetika Hooda was among the lucky few in the Indian contingent who got to stay back to be part of the closing ceremony. “I felt very good to represent my country in front of such a large audience. It was a bitter sad moment for me as I missed out on a medal,” said Reetika, the first Indian wrestler to qualify in the women’s heavyweight category.For Reetika, the big moment was not to watch Hollywood star Tom Cruise take the Games flag to Los Angeles but to meet and greet Cuban wrestling legend Mijain Lopez. Lopez won his first gold at Beijing in 2008 and he retired here after winning his fifth straight gold in the men’s Greco Roman 130-kg category. “I’m not even a big fan of Bollywood, so Hollywood is very far,” she said with a smile. “But to meet and pose for a picture with Lopez sir was a priceless moment,” she told TOI.",Manu Bhaker and PR Sreejesh carry the national flag at the closing ceremony.

Kieron Pollard of Southern Brave delivered a match-winning performance by hitting Rashid Khan of Trent Rockets for five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday. His explosive batting helped Southern Brave to chase down a target of 127, achieving victory with just one ball to spare at the Rose Bowl in Southampton.Pollard's game-changing performance began when Brave needed 49 runs off the last 20 balls.Rashid Khan had been economical with figures of 1/10 from his first 15 deliveries, but Pollard dismantled his bowling in a single over.Pollard smashed the first two balls over cow corner and the long-off region, followed by a straight hit back over Rashid's head with the third ball. A powerful shot over deep mid-wicket came next, and Pollard topped off the over with a final six over long-off. This assault reduced the runs required to 19 off 15 balls.Despite being dismissed shortly after his blitz, Pollard’s rapid 45 off 23 balls had already shifted the momentum in Southern Brave's favor. The team ultimately won the contest by two wickets with just one ball remaining.Earlier in the game, Tom Banton top-scored for Trent Rockets with 30 runs, helping his team to post a competitive total of 126/8.Reflecting on his performance against Rashid Khan, Pollard acknowledged their shared history and familiarity with each other's play.""I've played a lot against him, and he's gotten me out many times. But I knew the lines and lengths he was likely to bowl,"" Pollard said.""I just backed myself - if he bowled short, I was going across; if he went full, I was going to hit straight. He bowled three fuller balls, and they were right in my arc. At that point, I couldn't hold back, I had to go for maximums.

NEW DELHI: The sports community in India anxiously awaited the Court of Arbitration for Sport 's ( CAS ) decision on wrestler Vinesh Phogat 's appeal against her disqualification from the Paris Olympics gold medal match in the women's 50kg freestyle event.Vinesh had secured her place in the final with impressive victories, including a win over Japan's renowned wrestler Yui Susaki .However, during the mandatory morning weigh-in, she was found to be 100gm over the allowed limit, resulting in her disqualification.Devastated by the unexpected turn of events, Vinesh filed an appeal with the CAS last Wednesday, requesting a joint silver medal with Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez , who had been defeated by Vinesh but was subsequently elevated to the final due to the Indian's disqualification.The day following her heartbreaking disqualification, Vinesh announced her retirement from wrestling, stating that she lacked the strength to continue. This announcement came as sporting icons from around the world rallied behind the 29-year-old wrestler, who was competing in her third Olympic Games.Prior to her journey to Paris, Vinesh had been at the forefront of a protest alongside fellow wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik against the former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who faced allegations of sexual harassment and intimidation from the renowned trio and other wrestlers.Numerous sports personalities expressed their support for Vinesh, including renowned Japanese Olympic champion Rei Higuchi, who experienced a similar situation in the Tokyo Olympics before claiming gold in Paris, and legendary American freestyle wrestler Jordan Burroughs, who urged the IOC to award Vinesh a silver medal.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who also believed Vinesh deserved at least a silver, champion shooter Abhinav Bindra, two-time Olympic medallist and superstar javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, and celebrated hockey player PR Sreejesh all voiced their support for Vinesh, reminding the nation of her contributions to the sport.On the day before the verdict, Vijender Singh, a bronze medallist boxer from the 2008 Beijing Olympics, also expressed his support for Vinesh.""Bhan @Phogat_Vinesh aap ke sath pehle bhi the ab bhi hai or aage bhi rahenge (Sister, I was with you earlier, with you now, and will be with you in future too),"" Vijender tweeted.Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), expressed his understanding of Vinesh's predicament. However, he raised concerns about the potential consequences of granting minor exceptions in specific cases. Bach questioned, Where would one draw the line after allowing small concessions in certain situations?On the other hand, Nenad Lalovic, the chief of United World Wrestling (UWW), maintained a skeptical stance regarding any potential alterations to the outcomes. He emphasized that they were strictly adhering to the established regulations. Lalovic's stance suggested that a revision of the results was unlikely, as the organization was bound by the rules in place.""I must say, I have a certain understanding for the wrestler; it's clearly a human touch,"" Bach had said on Friday.""Now, it's (appeal) in CAS. We will, at the end, follow the CAS decision. But, again, the international (wrestling) federation, they have to apply their interpretation, their rules. This is their responsibility.""Lalovic added, ""I am so sorry for what happened, but no matter the size of your country, athletes are athletes. This weigh-in was public, everyone saw what happened. How can we allow someone to compete when we all saw what happened.""We don't have any other choice but to follow our rules,"" Lalovic had said.The Paris Olympics came to a close on Sunday with a grand ceremony held at the Stade de France, the primary stadium for track and field competitions throughout the event.In a separate development, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ad-hoc division, a special unit established to handle disputes arising during the Games, had granted Vinesh's appeal challenging her removal from the competition on Friday.Vinesh's legal team, consisting of French lawyers Joelle Monlouis, Estelle Ivanova, Habbine Estelle Kim, and Charles Amson, has been instrumental in assisting her and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) with the application process.The Paris Bar has provided these lawyers, who are handling the case on a pro bono basis.To further strengthen her case, Vinesh has also enlisted the help of senior counsels Harish Salve and Vidushpat Singhania. Salve, who served as the Solicitor General of India from 1999 to 2003, brings a wealth of experience to the table. He notably represented India before the International Court of Justice in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case.Should the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rule in Vinesh's favor, she will be awarded a joint-silver medal in the women's 50kg freestyle category, recognising her outstanding performance and the merits of her case.",Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the women's 50kg freestyle event.

India, who are the current holders of the trophy, have impressively won their last two Test series in Australia, both with a 2-1 margin.""It's going to be a competitive series. Australia has got a bit of a point to prove against India in Australia on the back of what happened in the last two series here,"" Ponting told 'The ICC Review', as quoted by PTI.""We are back to (having) five Tests as well, which is the other really important thing about this series.

He has just been over in Zimbabwe recently and played that (T20I) series over there, but a left-armer would be ideal for them to have in their touring squad,"" Ponting said.The former Australian captain expressed hope that both teams would field their strongest bowling attacks.""(Mohammed) Shami will be back fit by then, (Mohammed) Siraj we know will be there-abouts somewhere and obviously (Jasprit) Bumrah is going nowhere.

Probably, the only one question there might be with Australia again, is if (Steve) Smith's the right man to be opening the batting,"" he said.""That would be the only query that I can see there. But that was all about obviously bringing Cameron Green back into the side.""So I'll rephrase it, not whether Smith's the right man to open the batting but whether he thinks it's the right spot for him.

But I do not know how much people will want a 42-year-old bowler in their team so we will have to wait and see,"" Anderson remarked, acknowledging the potential hesitation teams may have in recruiting a veteran bowler.The retired seamer also shared insights into the discussions that took place with coach Brendon McCullum , team director Rob Key, and captain Ben Stokes prior to his decision to retire.Anderson revealed, ""I was told it was 'Lord's or never again' and I decided I wanted to have one more go in England; I wanted my family and friends to see me play one more time.""While England's management felt it was an opportune moment to explore other talent and pursue a fresh direction, Anderson maintained a composed demeanour.""England felt it was a good time to look at other players and wanted to go in a different direction. I would not say I was happy. But I did not kick off, I did not feel upset and having the opportunity to stay around the group in a different role interested me as well,"" he stated, expressing his openness to remaining involved with the team in an alternative capacity.",Former England pacer James Anderson has expressed his interest in exploring franchise cricket opportunities. The 41-year-old believes he can still utilize his swing bowling skills at the highest level. Anderson recently joined the England side as a bowling mentor for the remainder of the Test summer.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112490807,imgsize-29706,width-400,resizemode-4/112490807.jpg"

'Breaking away from my insecurity gave me..' says R Ashwin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/breaking-away-from-my-insecurity-gave-me-says-r-ashwin/articleshow/112489418.cms,"NEW DELHI: R Ashwin , the multi-talented 37-year-old off-spinner, has made a name for himself not only as a cricketer but also as an engineer, popular YouTuber, and now an author. With 516 Test wickets to his name, his opinions carry significant weight in the world of international cricket.Ashwin's recently published book, "" I Have The Streets: A Kutti Cricket Story ,"" co-authored by Sidharth Monga , has been well-received by critics.The book provides insights into his life until 2011 and offers a glimpse into his mind, which relishes probability analysis as much as decoding challenging batters.In an exclusive interview with PTI, Ashwin shared his philosophy on life, stating, ""I am living my life, that's it. I am not thinking about accomplishing 'A', 'B' or 'C' (targets). I am staying in the moment. I am a creative person in general, and if I feel I want to do something, I will go ahead and do it. (Whether it's) right or wrong, is something that I will assimilate later.""Ashwin admitted that he wasn't always this fearless, and as a child, he had an insecure side. However, as he grew older, he realized that his fears were holding him back, and once he confronted them, he became more resilient.This newfound fearlessness has been evident in his growth as a cricketer, from bowling carrom balls on the streets of Chennai to becoming India's premier spinner. Ashwin has faced criticism head-on and has responded with a plethora of wickets, refusing to let the ""outside noise"" disrupt his mental equilibrium.It is this system optimization, as the engineer in him would say, that allows him to take risks and not be afraid of failure.""I'm not insecure at all. I would rather fail in life than be absolutely safe. That's my character. I don't have the common insecurities that people have,"" he asserts with the same clarity with which he decodes complex cricket laws in his social media feeds, which don't take long to become viral trends.""Breaking away from my insecurity (as a child) gave me a great insight into how I can exploit somebody else's insecurity. And that's how I see cricket or life in general,"" he explained, letting out perhaps the secret of his understated aggression on the field.Ashwin, reflecting on the concept of parallel processing, which refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, shared that the COVID-19 pandemic was a turning point in his life. During this crisis, when everyone was grappling with the fear of loss, he reassessed his approach to life and realized that he had only one opportunity to pursue his passions.It was during the lockdown that Ashwin launched his YouTube channel, where he shares his well-articulated opinions on cricket, its laws, and players. His channel has now amassed over 1.5 million subscribers. It's important to note that Ashwin, like many others, also faced the emotional toll of seeing his loved ones hospitalized due to the virus during this challenging period.""The time that I have is pretty limited. I do plan but for me it's about living life. I felt cricket took away a lot of my time since 2010 (his India debut) but COVID gave me a chance to take a break, and you know, assess where I was,"" he recalls.""It (the COVID-forced break) has given me wings over the last four years to be able to express myself, expand my creativity zones and so on and so forth,"" he says, referring to his success as a rare outspoken voice in Indian cricket.He believes that the key to success lies in embracing fearlessness and possessing the capacity to perceive the exciting aspects of taking risks. This realization dawned on him during a trip to a casino in 2009, where he gained valuable insights into the nature of risk-taking.""If you go to the Casino, thinking of how much money you will make, you will pretty much end up without a rupee. But when you go with the intention of having fun and wanting to lose the money that you have, you always go back a much richer person. It was actually a big learning experience,"" he explains.Acquiring life lessons is not solely dependent on a single source; they can be gleaned from various mediums such as films, online series, or literature.Speaking of literature, he is well aware that sharing one's personal narrative with others comes with inherent risks.It is not limited to opening up a hitherto unseen side of yours to people who might judge without knowing. The potential for unintentionally causing harm to others is also present when private, distressing experiences are disclosed to the public.""I think hurting someone is an immensely painful journey. But if tomorrow I do write about hurtful instances of mine then it's because people who are on the other side, will have hurt me. They are obviously gonna feel bad about it, because nobody intentionally hurts you,"" he says, underscoring his belief in the inherent goodness of individuals.Ashwin considers painful experiences as essential life lessons that shape an individual's character. In his book, he recounts an incident during his time with Chennai Super Kings in 2010, where a team official denied his request for a good IPL ticket, despite his significant contributions to the team's success that season.""Look, people who give you an opportunity to learn harsh lessons in life are Gurus in my book. I didn't want to go and confront the guy. But for me it is an incident, it happened, and it fuelled the fire in me.""I wanted to become a better person. I wanted to become a better cricketer. I am thankful for the person who did that to me, because I think in some way or the other he fuelled my desire to do well,"" he says.This experience taught Ashwin that the world is not always fair.""It's not. See a lot of people come to me and say, what goes around comes around. The world is a very fair place, it's not. It can be very unfair on a lot of people. When you win, somebody else loses,"" he points out, the clarity of thought shining through once again much like his eyes, which light up at the first sight of a batter's vulnerability.","R Ashwin is an off-spinner for India and has 516 Test wickets to his name. The 37-year-old is also an engineer and a popular YouTuber.

The veteran player is set to join Bengal’s pre-season practice later this week after deciding to return ‘home’. Saha had represented Tripura for the past two seasons after a fall-out with a Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) official.A happy CAB president Snehasish Ganguly felt Saha’s return, along with Sudip Chatterjee ’s, will help Bengal fill up the void after former skipper Manoj Tiwary called it quits at the end of last season.“I am happy to be back and will contribute to the best of my abilities,” Saha said on Monday. The veteran wicketkeeper-batter, who has always put the team before self, is ready to play in any capacity. With youngster Abhishek Porel shining behind the stumps for Bengal and also in the IPL for the Delhi Daredevils, Saha is ready to give the youngster his space. “Abhishek joined us (senior Bengal) after being part of India U-19 World Cup squad and I had told the then Bengal coach Lalji (Arun Lal) to give him more opportunities. So if the team management feels right, I have no objection in him keeping wickets. I will play as a batter,” Saha stated.Approaching the twilight of his playing days, the 39-year-old Saha is not looking too far ahead. Although the IPL mega auction is scheduled later this year, Saha is not focussing on that . “I could have quit playing some formats to focus on IPL only. But that’s not my plan. All I can say is that when I retire I will do it from all formats of the game at the same time,” the Siliguri boy said.Saha, who has played 40 Test matches, which is just three less than Bengal legend Pankaj Roy, also sounded content with his India career. “I have never played the game thinking of achieving milestones. So numbers have never mattered to me,” he said.","Wicketkeeper-batter Wriddhiman Saha has made himself available for all the three formats of the game in the upcoming domestic season, on his return to Bengal.

""God forbid, the Champions Trophy won't be played here if there is any incident in these tours. Our soldiers are getting martyred in Balochistan and Peshawar. Only the government can answer why it has been happening, but it's wrong.""Concerns about security stem from past incidents where foreign teams have expressed fears while touring Pakistan. In 2021, New Zealand abruptly abandoned their tour just before the start of the ODI series due to security concerns, and England followed suit by pulling out of their scheduled tour later that year.Ali further added the importance of ensuring top-level security for visiting teams. ""We must ensure that there is not even a small security breach. The foreign teams should get the same security as our Prime Minister and President. I am sureMohsin Naqvi will be aware of these things.""The focus on security becomes even more crucial as Pakistan's home cricket season begins on August 21 with a two-match Test series against Bangladesh. The country aims to ensure that all visiting teams feel safe and secure, a prerequisite for successfully hosting the 2025 Champions Trophy.Any negative developments during these series could potentially derail Pakistan's ambitions of hosting the event.

"Indian players comfortable in ISL, must play abroad to grow: Manolo Marquez",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indian-players-comfortable-in-isl-must-play-abroad-to-grow-manolo-marquez/articleshow/112456005.cms,"In his more than two decade career, Manolo Marquez is coaching the national team for the first time

Panaji:

Manolo Marquez arrived in India as a replacement for Albert Roca at Hyderabad FC in 2020, replacing the Spanish coach who couldn’t resist the temptation of joining Barcelona as part of Ronald Koeman’s coaching staff.For two years during Covid-19, he was forced to live inside the bio-bubble. It was here that he got to know the Indian players , spending a lot of time with them, learning about their psyche, their families, cultures and traditions.Now, after four seasons in Indian football , the experienced Spaniard is the chief coach of the national team , and it is this thorough knowledge that is expected to give him a head start.“This is my fifth season in India and if you tell me five years ago that I will spend five years in India, maybe I would think that it was crazy,” Manolo said during his presentation in the Capital on Sunday. “After Spain (my home country), India is the country where I have spent the most years. From day one, I felt things are working in a good way for me (here).”It is India that has given him the job that he craved the most. After more than two decades of coaching where he trained almost every possible team – grassroots, youth, third division, second division, women and even LaLiga – Manolo finally takes charge of a national team. “I am very happy, it’s a dream for me to be the national team coach of India.”Manolo is doing the dual job of continuing to coach his club, FC Goa , and also national duties. “It’s about professionalism,” he told reporters when questions were asked, assuring everyone that “there won’t be any doubts.”His first assignment will be the tri-nation tournament in Hyderabad next month where he will field a team only after a couple of days’ training. The teams are still in pre-season. The bigger challenge, though, will be getting the best out of the Indian players, particularly with not making enough progress being made in the last five years.“In five years, the level of Indian players is better, but they could have improved faster. My feeling is that maybe some Indian players are very comfortable playing in ISL . I tell this to my players: you are very comfortable in India and will grow when you play abroad. I understand life is good for most of them here, and they are very comfortable. If Indian players play abroad, they will find strong opposition and their improvement will be faster,” said Manolo.The experienced coach who won the ISL trophy with Hyderabad in 2022 – after taking over a team at the bottom just two years ago – also felt domestic players should show more hunger to succeed with the national team, besides improving their mentality.“My feeling is that we are losing the spirit to play for the nation. You have to be angry, disappointed when you lose a game. We have to move in the same direction and play as a team. Sometimes a player thinks if he has a knock (injury), it’s better (not to join the national team camp).“We have to be stronger mentally. In football, technique is very important. Tactics are very important. Physical condition is very important, but if the head doesn't work, you can do nothing in life, not just football. If the mentality is correct, we will get good results,” said Manolo.","Manolo Marquez takes charge of India's national team for the first time. Spaniard has been coaching in India for four seasons.

The result leaves Mohun Bagan rooted in the mid-table with 12 points from 8 matches.East Bengal FC, Bhawanipore Club and Calcutta Customs are currently the top three teams with 19 points each and on track for advancing from Group B to the Super Six (championship round).Even if Deggie Cardozo's Mohun Bagan win their remaining four matches, their fate may not be in their hands.With their fifth win, George Telegraph under Gautam Ghosh kept their hopes alive with 15 points from 9 matches.Mohun Bagan came into the match looking for a hat-trick of wins following their demolition of Eastern Railway (5-0) and Tollygunge Agragami (5-1).Cardozo's boys went about achieving their target in earnest when referee Nripen Halder judged George defender Akash Mukherjee's attempted clearance to have touched his teammate Juwel Mazumder's hands, despite the latter's intense protest against the decision. From the resultant penalty, Serto Worneilen sent the goalkeeper the wrong way to give Bagan the lead in the 30th minute.However, Bagan were undone by their poor finishing as well as poor defending.On the first occasion, Bagan captain Sumit Rathi failed to check the run of Harsha Parui, whose cross saw Samaresh Das meet it with a powerful header at the other end. As the ball ricocheted off the first post, Ekka was nearby to drive it in.Three minutes later, it was Bagan goalkeeper Raja Barman who made a mess of a back-pass. Although he managed to block Abhishek Chakraborty's initial shot, Ekka's powerful left-footer off the return ball did the decisive damage. Bagan centre-back Raj Basfore claimed to have made a goalline save off Ekka's shot but the referee allowed the goal to stay, thus paving the way for George to complete a remarkable comeback.","George Telegraph rode a second-half brace from Amit Ekka to stun the green-and- maroon brigade 2-1.

Indian football team head coach should be an Indian in future: Manolo Marquez,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indian-football-team-head-coach-should-be-an-indian-in-future-manolo-marquez/articleshow/112444875.cms,"Target is 2027 Asian Cup

Indian players must play abroad, even if it's in lower division

NEW DELHI: Manolo Marquez , the newly appointed head coach of the Indian football team , described his new role as a 'dream come true' but emphasized that in the future, the national team should ideally be managed by an Indian.The 55-year-old Spaniard's tenure, effective from last month, will span three years, during which he will fulfill a dual role as both the head coach of FC Goa and the national team.Marquez, who will manage FC Goa during the 2024-25 season alongside his national team responsibilities, will transition to exclusively coaching the Indian team from 2025.""Apart from Spain, India is the country where I have spent the most number of years. Long time ago, I thought I would like to be a national team head coach and I am here. It is a dream come true,"" Marquez said while addressing his first press conference after his appointment as India head coach.""In the future, the national team coach has to be an Indian because he (Indian) will know better how the country works, knows the people of different parts of India. So, this has to be the target of Indian football in the coming years,"" he added.Marquez has been active in Indian football since 2020, having spent three successful seasons with Hyderabad FC. He also had a notable season with FC Goa, achieving a third-place finish in the Indian Super League (ISL ) this year. His upcoming international assignments include the three-team Intercontinental Cup, to be held in Hyderabad from September 3 to 9, featuring Syria and Mauritius alongside India.Following the Intercontinental Cup, Marquez will lead the team in the VFF Tri-Nation Series in Vietnam from October 9 to 15, competing against Lebanon and hosts Vietnam. Both tournaments will take place during the FIFA international match window, and the national camp for the Intercontinental Cup is scheduled to commence on August 30 or 31.Addressing concerns about potential conflicts of interest while serving as both India head coach and FC Goa manager, Marquez stated that this situation, although unusual, is not unprecedented.""It's not a normal situation, no doubt, but it's not the first time and won't be the last time regarding this situation.""I checked, in international level, there were big names earlier in same situation and in India, I am told there were many (such cases) earlier.""National team plays when there is no ISL. You won't have any doubt that we will work very hard for the national team.""Having failed to make it to the third round of the joint 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 Asian Cup qualifiers under Stimac, India are yet to qualify for the continental showpiece. The team will have to play in the qualifying round of the 2027 Asian cup from March next year onwards.""The target is to improve the level of Indian football -- individually as players as well as a team. No doubt, that will not be immediate but will take time,"" said the experienced coach who has managed several lower division sides in the Spanish league.""Our target is to win every match, but the long term one is to qualify for the Asian Cup in 2027. We will get 6-7 games before the Asian Cup qualifiers,"" Marquez said.""So, these two upcoming tournaments (Intercontinental Cup and VFF Tri-Nation Series) are important so that we can be in good seeding during the draw (for the Asian Cup qualifiers) in December this year.""""The best players will have to play at the best level, against stronger opponents. That is how you grow as a player. That is why more Indian players should play in the ISL. That is why my advice to Indian players is to play abroad even if it is lower division leagues.""They will learn more and improve more (by playing abroad). But the Indian players are comfortable playing in the ISL, in India but I want them to play abroad,"" Marquez said, adding that Indian football has improved in the last five years but can improve further.Marquez also said he will pick I-League players for the national team, if they have the requisite level.Asked what is lacking in an Indian player as seen in his five-year association with the country at club level, he said, ""It's the mentality of the players, we need to improve on this. We have to develop that we can do something, we have to be stronger in mentality.""If the mentality is right, we will get good results. I am optimistic that Indian football will improve step by step and reach the desired place.""",Manolo Marquez is the new head coach of the Indian football team.
