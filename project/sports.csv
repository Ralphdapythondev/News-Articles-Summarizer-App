While the former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Rashid Latif lately said there is ""fifty percent confirmation"" that India will come to Pakistan, the country's ex-spinner Danish Kaneria has flagged safety concerns for the Indian players.""Look at the situation in Pakistan.I have to say that the Indian team should not go to Pakistan,"" Kaneria told 'Sports Tak'. ""Pakistan should think about it, then the ICC will make its decision and most likely it will be a hybrid model; it will be played in Dubai.""India last visited Pakistan for the 2008 Asia Cup, while the last bilateral series between the two nations was when Pakistan visited India for five ODIs in 2012-13.Pakistan then returned to India for the 2023 ODI World Cup. However, the Indian government's stance on travelling to Pakistan hasn't changed because of the tense political relations between the two countries.""The safety of the players is the first priority. Respect is the second priority,"" said Kaneria. ""There are many things. I think the BCCI is doing a great job. I think all the countries will accept the final decision.""It has been reported that Pakistan is planning to host all of India's matches in Lahore, which is near Amritsar, to ease the travel of Indian team and fans through the Wagah-Attari border. However, reports have also suggested that a hybrid model of the tournament, like the Asia Cup last year, is what's BCCI is looking at.India played all their Asia Cup matches in Sri Lanka.","India last visited Pakistan for the 2008 Asia Cup.

First medal in track

Strong show in badminton, archery

NEW DELHI: Star para shooter Avani Lekhara won her second consecutive Paralympic gold in women's 10m air rifle (SH1) in Chateauroux on a history-making day for India which also saw Preethi Pal securing its first track medal on Friday.On the second day of competition, India further won a silver medal through Manish Narwal in the men's 10m air pistol (SH1) final and two bronze medals, one of which was claimed by Mona Agarwal in the same event as Avani, the other by Preethi in the women’s 100m (T35) event.Avani's journey to gold began with her participation in the women's 10m air rifle (SH1) category. She scored 249.7, breaking her own previous Paralympic record of 249.6, set during the 2021 Summer Paralympics in Japan.The competition was intense, with Avani narrowly surpassing Korea's Lee Yunri, who shot 246.8 for silver.Mona, also from India and competing in the SH1 category due to polio-related leg impairment, scored 228.7 to claim the bronze, marking the first double podium finish for India in the same event at the Games.Avani's win makes her the first Indian to win two consecutive Paralympic gold medals. The achievement comes after she faced several health challenges, including a gallbladder surgery in March, which forced a one-and-a-half-month break. Despite losing weight due to the surgery, she trained diligently at the Karni Singh shooting ranges to regain her strength and mental fortitude for the Paris Games.""It was a very close final. There was very less gap between 1, 2 and 3. I was focussing on my thought process and not the result,"" Avani said after her historic win.""I'm happy that the Indian national anthem was the first national anthem that got played in the arena this time too. I have two more matches to go so I'm focusing on winning more medals for the country,"" the ace shooter added.Avani's journey to becoming a top para-shooter began at the age of 11 when she was paralyzed waist-down due to a car accident. Competing in the SH1 category, which includes athletes with impairments in arms, lower trunk, or legs, as well as those with no limbs, Avani displayed remarkable composure in the final.She trailed behind Lee Yunri by mere decimal points, but Lee's poor last shot of 6.8 handed the victory to Avani, who shot a solid 10.5.Manish added to India's medal tally with a silver in the men's 10m air pistol (SH1) final.Preethi, competing in the women's 100m (T35) category, secured a bronze medal with a personal best performance.The achievements placed India in the 10th spot in the overall standings, ahead of Japan and Korea.Mona, who secured bronze in the same event as Avani, is a 37-year-old athlete from Sikar, Rajasthan. She has faced societal prejudice due to her lower leg impairment caused by polio during childhood.Before finding her niche in shooting, Mona dabbled in various sports including shot-put, powerlifting, and wheelchair volleyball. Her journey to the Paralympic podium is a testament to her resilience and determination.With the extraordinary performances of Avani, Mona, Manish, and Preethi, India achieved significant success in Paris. Avani's determination and training paid off despite the challenges she faced leading up to the Games.Manish, a Tokyo Games gold-medallist shooter, secured a silver medal after shooting 234.9 at the recent competition.The 22-year-old, who had won the 50m pistol gold in Tokyo three years ago, climbed from fifth place to the top in Paris, showing a determined effort to repeat his previous victory.However, a series of poor shots in the '9s' led to his drop to second place just when gold seemed within reach.Manish was born with a deformity in his right hand.Preethi won India's first athletics medal in a Paralympics track event, earning a bronze in the women's T35 100m competition with a personal best time of 14.21 seconds.The T35 classification is for athletes with coordination impairments such as hypertonia, ataxia, and athetosis.Preethi hails from a farmer's family in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh.She faced significant physical challenges from birth, with her lower body plastered for six days after she was born. Her weak legs and irregular leg posture made her susceptible to various diseases.To strengthen her legs, she underwent various traditional treatments. From the age of five, she wore calipers for eight years.Nitesh Kumar delivered an outstanding performance, defeating China's Yang Jianyuan in straight games -- 21-5, 21-11 -- in his second men's singles SL3 group A match to secure a spot in the semifinals of the para badminton competition.Meanwhile, seasoned archer Rakesh Kumar began his campaign with a 136-131 win over Senegal's Aliou Drame, moving into the pre-quarterfinals of the compound men's open category.Nitesh Kumar, a 29-year-old IIT Mandi graduate who suffered permanent leg damage due to a 2009 accident, showcased remarkable skill and dominance in his match against Yang.The SL3 class is designated for players with severe lower limb disabilities, requiring play on a half-width court.",Avani Lekhara becomes first Indian to win two consecutive Paralympic gold medals.

David Miller , known for his powerful hitting, launched a full-toss from Hardik Pandya down the ground, only for Surya to intercept it with a remarkable catch.In a stunning display of athleticism, Surya caught the ball near the boundary cushion, tossed it in the air as he crossed the rope, and quickly returned inside to complete the catch.The catch not only sealed India's victory but also sparked widespread debate and controversy.Social media was flooded with posts showing footage that appeared to suggest the boundary cushion had been intentionally moved further back, raising questions about the legitimacy of the catch.Despite the controversy, the catch remains a highlight of the tournament and is celebrated by Indian fans as a key moment in their team's triumphant campaign.",Tabraiz Shamsi takes to Twitter to reflect on the T20 World Cup final catch.

Former Vidarbha skipper Faiz Fazal to turn up for India Capitals in LLC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/former-vidarbha-skipper-faiz-fazal-to-turn-up-for-india-capitals-in-llc/articleshow/112934391.cms,"NAGPUR: Faiz Fazal is being finally rewarded for his consistent performances, a bit late though, post his retirement from domestic cricket. The prolific batter was picked by India Capitals for Rs 25 lakh in the Legends League Cricket ( LLC ) auction on Thursday.A few months after announcing retirement, Faiz would be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Shikhar Dhawan Chris Gayle , Dinesh Karthik, Liam Plunkett, Suresh Raina, Harbhajan Singh, and Irfan Pathan in the third edition of the LLC.""I'm looking forward to playing in the LLC. After retiring, I'm looking to explore all playing avenues across the globe,"" Faiz told TOI from Ireland. ""My management firm informed me about being picked up by India Capitals. I had a brief talk with Hemang Badani, coach of the Indian capitals. Once back in India, I will have a detailed discussion about my role in the franchisee setup,"" Faiz added.While many would think that the recognition may have come a bit late, Faiz, a week away from his 39th birthday, disagrees. Over the years, Faiz had piled up runs by tons in the domestic circuit. He was given a solitary chance to represent India, a One-day International against Zimbabwe. The southpaw batter scored a fifty in that match, still never got the India cap again.The former Vidarbha captain brushes off any talk of finally being at the right place at the right time. ""I have no regrets. Having regret just makes life difficult,"" Faiz says.Faiz's superlative performances in Ireland paved the way for his LLC stint. The opener guided his Lisburn to two maiden T20 titles - Northern Cricket Union T20 league and also the Ireland National T20 Cup.Faiz scored 88 in Lisburn's chase of 192-run target set by Leinster as the final match ended in a tie. In the ensuing Super Over, Faiz hit 22 runs in four balls, slamming a boundary and three consecutive sixes, as Lisburn scored 23 runs. Leinster managed just 9 for 2 in the Super Over paving the way for Lisburn's maiden title triumph in the All-Ireland T20.""I'm really happy with my performance so far this year. I'm indebted to the almighty that I was able to contribute to the success of my team. This was the first time that Lisburn emerged as the winner in the Northern Cricket Union T20 league and also the Ireland National T20 Cup,"" Faiz said.One of the sixes hit by Faiz in the Super Over was an uncharacteristic scoop shot behind the wicket. One can't remember Faiz ever playing such a shot for Vidarbha. ""Well, a few years before retiring I mostly used to play the longer format. Playing such a shot in a four-day game was never a prudent idea. But I have been playing unorthodox shots whenever I represented teams other than Vidarbha, where I didn't have to shoulder the responsibility of holding the innings together. In Ireland I have been able to play freely in T20s,"" said Faiz.Playing with Lisburn, a team that values him as a player, Faiz says that he is in a good frame of mind. Used to changing his game as per the team's needs, Faiz is doing just that in Ireland too.""After a tumultuous year or so I'm finally at peace. Conditions here in Ireland are a bit challenging for batting. The chilling temperatures and windy conditions make batting a tough job. But as a professional the team looks up to me to deliver and I have been able to stand up to their expectations,"" Faiz said.Apart from playing, Faiz has been donning the hat of batting consultant to Northern Knights, an Ireland based team. ""On the request of Cricket Ireland, I did a couple of sessions with the national team ahead of their maiden Test match against Zimbabwe,"" he said.",Faiz Fazal was picked by India Capitals for Rs 25 lakh in the Legends League Cricket ( LLC ) auction on Thursday.

"Durand Cup final: Mohun Bagan chase title No. 18, NEUFC history",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/durand-cup-final-mohun-bagan-chase-title-no-18-neufc-history/articleshow/112934014.cms,"KOLKATA: One can approach the Durand Cup final from different perspectives and with varied objectives - collectively and individually.Mohun Bagan SG - the defending champions and most successful team of Asia's oldest football club tournament - are back on the hunt, starting favourites for good reason as they host NorthEast United FC in Saturday's title-decider at the Salt Lake Stadium.The ISL may be coming in a fortnight but it's still early days of a new season and Jose Molina's side has already shown that they have that survival gene to stay in contention. If goalkeeper Vishal Kaith emerged the protagonist in helping the team win two back-to-back knockout matches in penalty shootout, against Punjab FC and Bengaluru FC, it may also generate a belief that a team in sync with such luck and pluck has the stage set for something special at the end of the tournament.This is also a wager Molina would like to win - not just to extend Bagan's record reign in Durand Cup to title No. 18, but to validate his own position affirming that he's the right man to take the team forward.""It's really good to play in front of your supporters but it's not an advantage and on the pitch, it will always be 11-vs-11. So, there will be pressure as the home side but the players are experienced enough to live up to the challenge,"" Molina remarked.NEUFC too have their own ambitions, standing on the cusp of history. This is not going to be a normal game for them as they eye their maiden trophy since having come into being in Indian football as one of the ISL franchises 10 years ago.A year ago at the same venue, they lost to East Bengal FC via a penalty shootout in the Durand Cup semifinal. They are ready to learn lessons from that defeat and make amends now.""They (Mohun Bagan) are favourites, but we have not come here for holidaying. What will we do tomorrow? It's easy on the board and it's what we'll do the pitch will determine the result. And what better way than facing Mohun Bagan to know where we stand now,"" NEUFC's present manager Juan Pedro Benali said during his pre-match press conference on Friday.In the likes of Dimitri Petratos, Jason Cummings and Greg Stewart, Bagan have the quality and firepower to singe any opponent. However, of the handful of truths that generally govern football as a sport, attack wins you a match but defence holds the key to winning a tournament.The way Bagan conceded 4 goals in the two knockout matches may not have escaped Benali's notebook. NEUFC are defensively strong, conceding just 1 goal in 5 matches so far. Their tactical shifts, ability to play in phases and holding the fort in numbers when needed may present a stern test to Bagan's ambitions.Aware of having to play a catch-up game in the knockouts, both Molina and Stewart want the final to be decided in regulation time. ‘It's a great opportunity to win our first trophy of the season. We're excited to get it done,"" Stewart said.In their maiden meeting outside ISL, Bagan will have the crowd to back them in this mission. NEUFC, on the other hand, are expected to have a special supporter in the stands - their co-owner and Bollywood actor John Abraham. ""We hope to give him a smile after the match,"" Benali said, grinning.",Mohun Bagan SG host NorthEast United FC in Saturday's Durand Cup final. Bagan are the defending champions and most successful team of Asia's oldest football club tournament. NEUFC are standing on the cusp of history as they eye their maiden trophy since coming into being in Indian football as one of the ISL franchises 10 years ago.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112934022,imgsize-158014,width-400,resizemode-4/112934022.jpg"

It's important for women's football in India,"" Crispin Chhetri said of Odisha FC Women 's AFC Women's Champions League preliminary stage match against Jordan's Etihad Club on Saturday.A win for Crispin's wards in the Jordanian city of Zarqa would ensure that they finish the stage as Group B leaders and earn a coveted berth in the group stage of the inaugural AFC women's competition.However, it will not be an easy game for the Indians against the home side who are currently leading Group B after thrashing Singapore's Lion City Sailors 5-0 in their first game of the preliminary stage. The scoreline made sure that they have a better goal difference than Odisha FC, who had routed the Singaporean club 4-1 in their opener.Apart from the fact that Etihad will enjoy home advantage in the crucial tie, they will also have the experience of playing on artificial turf, unlike their Indian counterparts.""The only advantage that they have is that they are used to playing on artificial turf. For us, it's a bit tricky and we will take time to adjust,"" head coach Crispin told TOI from Jordan on Friday.""Etihad (Club) are more experienced than the Sailors and they are in the middle of the Jordan's league so the understanding amongst themselves is better, and they are match fit,"" added the coach.The trickiness of an artificial pitch had already claimed its victim in the first game when Pyari Xaxa had to be substituted midway through the second half with a knee injury. While the coach said they will take a call on her participation on Saturday morning, he will also have to make adjustments in his starting lineup with Grace Dangmei and Neha, too, injured.The team will once again back on the scoring prowess of Lynda Kom Serto, who scored two of Odisha's four goals in the opener, and hope that the training sessions they have had between the games will bolster their game on the Jordanian pitch.As Crispin put it during the interaction, ""We have prepared well. Now it's time for execution.""",Odisha FC Women face Jordan's Etihad Club in AFC Women's Champions League preliminary stage match on Saturday.

We have started the Meghalaya Games a few years back and through this, our intention is to reach the top level. The creation of infrastructure keeps happening and we would like to see in the next few years proper infra not only at district level, but it should happen up to the block level. The government is certain that transformation of the youth mentally physically will happen in the state soon,” Meghalaya’s deputy chief minister Prestone Tynsong told TOI.“We are on a special mission mode for sporting activities in the state,” he added.This ‘special mission’ includes plans of hosting the National Games, nurturing athletes for representing India in the Olympic Games and exploring the idea of holding a national football tournament a la the Durand Cup or the Subroto Cup.“In New Shillong, there's a thought process to do something like a sports city with a football training academy, a bigger stadium and other things. When we look at the fact that we were not able to give tickets to so many people for the Durand Cup semifinal (which was held in Shillong’s Nehru Stadium having a capacity of about 17000 spectators), the only way is to have a bigger stadium. So we are working on those things,” Vijay Kumar D, commissioner and secretary to the government of Meghalaya, revealed.The Sangma government has embarked on a partnership with Indian Super League side NorthEast United FC in establishing a residential football academy in the vicinity of Shillong. The NEUFC co-owner John Abraham is also on board to strengthen the football ecosystem in the region.The Meghalaya government’s big push for promoting sports has also blossomed into an elite programme in which 11 athletes have been selected from a pool of 50000 young talents and have now been training under Australian Olympian and former triple jumper Ian Campell and others.“In New Shillong, along with tourism, IT and sports have been identified as the three big drivers. So, sports has definitely been part of that plan. Overall, infrastructure-wise we are already doing it. Now training and coaching is the second most important thing, that is where our investment is. For example, Lajong now have a new coach (in Jose Hevia from Spain).

exit in 3 years after shock defeat to unseeded Dutchman

Botic van de Zandschulp

Bopanna-Ebden advance

As Carlos Alcaraz exited the Arthur Ashe stadium at the end of the second set, balancing a gym bag and a whole load of emotions, he gestured aggressively at his box, where his longtime coach Juan Carlos Ferrero and agent Albert Molina sat stunned.The 21-year-old, champion at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, wagged his index finger, pointing at his head and mouthing his frustration. That scene summed up the US Open second round match in which Alcaraz made his earliest Grand Slam exit in three years.The world No. 3 went down 1-6, 5-7, 4-6 to Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp, ranked 74 in the world. The Spaniard made 27 unforced errors, 12 of which came on his forehand, the last of which punctuated his 15-match winning streak at Majors.""It was a fight against myself,"" Alcaraz said. ""In tennis you are playing against someone that wants the same as you, to win the match. You have to be as calm as you can just to think better in the match. Today I was playing against the opponent, and I was playing against myself. A lot of emotions that I couldn't control.""For the most part, Alcaraz appeared to be in a one-way conversation with his box. It was only when he broke back midway through the third set that Ferrero appeared to get into it.""I couldn't increase my level. My level stayed at the same point all the match, and it wasn't enough to win,"" the four-time major winner said. ""When I wanted to come back (to the match), it was too late.""Alcaraz came up short in his opening outing, his only tournament in the lead up to the US Open, going down to the maverick FrenchmanGael Monfils in three sets. It was his first match since his loss to Novak Djokovic in the final of the Olympic Games. Some 12 months ago, after Alcaraz fell to the Serb in the final in Cincinnati after holding a match point in the second set, the Spaniard didn't win a title again until Indian Wells in March this year. That's seven months and eight tournaments later.The third seed wasn't dotting the lines in New York late on Thursday. ""Being so close to the gold medal, it was difficult for me then,"" Alcaraz said of the Olympic final. ""But once I realized what I have achieved, it was the silver medal, it was a great achievement. I was really proud about it.""Alcaraz was weighed down by a heavy summer schedule - Roland Garros, Wimbledon, Olympics - going from clay to grass and back to clay.""The tennis schedule is so tight,"" he said. ""I've been playing a lot of matches lately, Roland Garros (title), Wimbledon (title), Olympic Games (final). I took a little break after the Olympic Games. I thought it was enough, probably it wasn't enough. I came here with not as much energy. I'm a player who needs (a bigger) break coming into important tournaments.""As much as Alcaraz's form contributed to his loss at Flushing Meadows, the 28-year-old van de Zandschulp's play proved to be sharper on the day. He struck the ball deep and close to the lines. He came in at every opportunity, disrupting the Spaniard's rhythm from the back of the court.""I think he's playing unbelievably aggressively. He's trying to come forward a lot. Today I tried to beat him to the punch a little bit. I tried to come in a lot to the net so he wasn't able to,"" van de Zandschulp said.""He's someone who can do everything. When he gets a shot on the forehand, he can drop shot, go for the winner, go inside out. He can do everything with the tennis ball. That's why facing him is unbelievably tough.""In the men's doubles, the second seeds Rohan Bopanna and Aussie Matthew Ebden put it across the Dutch pair of Robin Haase and Sander Arends 6-3, 7-5 in the first round.","World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz loses 1-6, 5-7, 4-6 to Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp.

He goes for all kinds of shots, he's got no care in the world, it's really annoying. He's got a great serve and he has great energy out here,"" Tiafoe said.""He can come up with great shots, so can I. We both move really well, so it's just highlight after highlight. I really hope you guys enjoyed the show, four hours of this battle.""The crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium was largely silent during the opening set as the two players went through the motions after Coco Gauff had fired it up with a gutsy comeback victory.However, they came to life right away during an exciting rally in which the net cord forced both players to race to the net, and Shelton ultimately won the point when play was stopped by the referee after Tiafoe touched the net to give up a 4-1 advantage.Shelton kept the crowd entertained with his skills; he once launched himself gracefully into the air at the net for a beautiful backhand smash and then followed up to blast a cross-court forehand winner that caused everyone to gasp in unison.But in the second set, Tiafoe managed to re-enter the contest. Shelton managed to hold serve in two consecutive service games despite being down 0-40, but Tiafoe eventually converted a break point at 5-5, winning the second set.When Tiafoe made mistakes and threw over a towel bin in annoyance during the third set tiebreak, Shelton swept ahead 6-0. There wasn't much separating the two players.Shelton was on the verge of collapse as Tiafoe battled back to 6-5, but the nonchalant American sealed a 2-1 lead with the quickest serve of the tournament on his seventh set point.Even though Tiafoe was leading 5-4, Shelton had to save set points before an unintentional mistake forced a deciding. They were tied in the fourth as well.In the fifth set, Shelton gave up first, trying too hard to hit huge strokes and making mistakes that allowed Tiafoe to break and take a 4-1 lead.Without turning around, Tiafoe scored his second match point by slyly approaching the net and executing a deft volley into the open court. He then celebrated his first victory against his countryman by giving him a quick hug at the net.Tiafoe is a member of an American group that is keen to end the 21-year men's major drought and Taylor Fritz gave home aspirations even more momentum when he easily defeated Argentine Francisco Comesana to set up a match with either Casper Ruud or Shang Juncheng in the following round.Being the first American man to advance to the fourth round of all Grand Slam tournaments in a single year since Andre Agassi in 2003, the 12th seed never gave up and sent over 33 winners.",Frances Tiafoe beats Ben Shelton in four sets to reach US Open quarterfinals. Both players had previously advanced to the semifinals at Flushing Meadows.

""It will be a war just like the last two times we've played. I know that the people love him here. Probably more than me.

Although the Serbian star holds a perfect 3-0 record against Popyrin, he remains cautious and respectful of his opponent's abilities.""He keeps on getting closer and closer, knocking on that door,"" Djokovic said.
