On his primary objectives as the bowling coach:

On helping the players deliver their best under pressure:

CHENNAI: Morne Morkel wreaked havoc with the steep bounce he generated as a bowler. A success in all forms of the game including the IPL , the 39-year-old former South African paceman is now India's bowling coach.There were quite a few prominent names in the fray including L Balaji for the job, but it was Morkel's experience of working with Gautam Gambhir at Lucknow Super Giants that clinched the deal for him.The series against Bangladesh, starting at the MA Chidambaram Stadium here, will be his first assignment but Morkel feels he doesn't have to tweak anything. It ""operates by itself"", the South African told bcci .tv on the sidelines of India's training camp at Chepauk on Saturday.When I ended the call, I sat for about five minutes in the room reflecting on it. I then phoned my dad and spoke about it. I did not go to my wife; normally they say that you go to your wife first. But I spoke to my dad. Knowing what is sort of going to come, it was quite a special moment. I enjoyed it for five to seven minutes myself. Then I shared it with my family, that there is an opportunity and that it might happen. I'm delighted to have eventually got things over the line. I'm here now in the set-up and I'm looking forward to a great journey.I just wanted to get an understanding about the guys, their strengths and weaknesses, and help them a little bit with the setting of goals for the upcoming series. Those are the sort of conversations we had. The guys did really well. I was blown away by how they went about things and how professional they were. It is a good sign and hopefully, we can build on that.I feel ready to take up this challenge. I understand and know that there is going to be the expectation of winning. Luckily, I have experienced it in my playing days. I can share that knowledge. When I was on the plane, I reflected. We are so lucky to have quality senior players. The senior players will lead the charge and it is our responsibility to support them and give them the best advice. This is a set-up that operates by itself. To protect that and make it better in some ways is going to be the goal.For me, it is important to connect well with the guys. I have played a lot against some of the players. I have seen and connected a little with some of the guys during the IPL. To be in the camp... to form friendships and relationships is very important for me.It is one thing to have the talent and skill - how can you make those guys feel welcome in an intimidating sort of environment. When India are playing, there is a lot of expectation. Having that experience and going through that, it is about passing on the knowledge to help them settle and feel at home. As soon as the players feel that they belong here and are comfortable within the space, the performances will come. It is about looking after that and from there, upskill them and get them up to the standard.","Former South African paceman Morne Morkel is now India's bowling coach.

In the world of sports, partnerships on the field often evolve into powerful unions off it. Among the many examples of athletic excellence and personal bonds, five iconic sports couples — Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf , Bastian Schweinsteiger and Ana Ivanovic , Bart Conner and Nadia Comaneci , David Lee and Caroline Wozniacki , Jozy Altidore and Sloane Stephens — showcase the perfect marriage of success in both love and their respective sporting careers.Their journeys, filled with triumphs and shared experiences, highlight how passion for sports can translate into strong, enduring relationships.Few couples in sports have achieved as much individual success as Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf.

This includes paying five million rupees monthly salaries to five mentors for teams in the Champions Cup in Faisalabad and spending around 12.8 billion rupees on renovating three Test venues ahead of the Champions Trophy next year.""What difference of a few lakh rupees will make to the board is anybody's guess, but it has potential to create discontent in women's cricket,"" a former Pakistan player said.The PCB official added that women players would receive daily allowances during the series itself.Currently, the players are also awaiting the announcement of their central contracts for the fiscal year, which has been delayed by over a month.Last year, the PCB awarded central contracts to 19 players.","Pakistan Cricket Board has decided to end the daily allowances for women players.

""Players should use social media wisely, but their real answers should come through their performances with the bat and ball. He (Babar) needs to focus on his fitness and work ethic because opportunities like these don't come around often.""""He has achieved a lot at such a young age, but what he needs to know what he wants to achieve in the future. Captaincy is a small thing, performance is what matters,"" the former batsman added.He continued, drawing a parallel with Kohli: ""Look at Virat Kohli. He chose to step down from captaincy on his own terms, and now he’s breaking records worldwide. This shows that playing for the country should be the priority. If there’s any energy left, then play for yourself.""On the field, Babar has been grappling with a noticeable dip in form.Pakistan's recent loss in a two-Test series against Bangladesh has compounded his struggles.His performances during the series -- scores of 0, 22, 11, and 31 -- have led to his drop from the ICC top 10 rankings for batters for the first time in years.This slump in performance has intensified scrutiny over his leadership in white-ball cricket , especially following Pakistan’s disappointing exit from the group stage of the T20 World Cup 2024 .","Former Pakistan skipper Younis Khan has weighed in on the pressure and expectations surrounding star Babar Azam.

Turning the game: What made Shane Warne the 'King of Spin',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/turning-the-game-what-made-shane-warne-the-king-of-spin/articleshow/113353037.cms,"Shane Warne Gatting Ball of the Century

NEW DELHI: Legendary Shane Warne , known fondly as the ' King of Spin ', wasn't just a cricketer; he was an artist who turned the cricket pitch into his canvas.His journey to becoming the most feared and respected spin bowler of all time began in a suburb of Melbourne, where a young Warne first picked up a cricket ball and discovered his unique talent for making it dance.In the early 1990s, the world of cricket was dominated by fast bowlers. Spin was seen as a dying art, something that could only flourish on slow, turning pitches in the subcontinent.But Warne was about to change all that. With his distinctive blond hair and a swagger that exuded confidence, he made his Test debut for Australia in 1992.His first few matches were unremarkable, but Warne was just getting started.The turning point came in the 1993 Ashes series against England. On a sunny day at Old Trafford, Warne bowled a delivery that would become known as the 'Ball of the Century'.It was Warne's first ball in an Ashes Test, and it pitched outside the leg stump. England's Mike Gatting watched it carefully, expecting it to turn slightly. But as the ball spun fiercely, it defied all expectations, whipping past Gatting's bat and clipping the top of the off stump.Gatting was left in disbelief, and so was the cricketing world. Warne had announced his arrival in spectacular fashion.From that moment, the legend of the 'King of Spin' began to grow.Warne possessed an uncanny ability to outthink batsmen. He could spin the ball prodigiously on any surface, making it drift, dip, and turn in ways that left even the best players baffled.His mastery of the leg break, the googly, and the flipper turned him into a weapon in the Australian arsenal.Warne didn't just rely on his skill; he played mind games with batsmen, setting them up over a series of deliveries before delivering the knockout punch. His showmanship added to his aura—he was a performer who thrived on the big stage, relishing the tension of the moment.By the end of his career, Warne had taken over 700 Test wickets, a record for a spin bowler. But it wasn't just the numbers that made him the King of Spin; it was the magic he brought to the game.Shane Warne redefined spin bowling, making it an art form that captivated millions and solidifying his place as cricket’s greatest spinner.","Shane Warne redefined spin bowling, making it an art form that captivated millions.

Southampton had started the match strongly, putting United under pressure.Just before the interval, De Ligt scored his first goal for United, followed by Rashford's first goal in six months, swiftly shifting the momentum in favor of the away team, AFP reported.Southampton's troubles worsened when their captain, Jack Stephens, received a red card in the 79th minute for a reckless tackle on Garnacho. The young forward then sealed the victory for United by scoring in added time.Southampton's Premier League struggles persist as they remain pointless after four matches, while Manchester United's victory propels them to the eighth position in the standings.The Dutch manager faced increased scrutiny following United's disappointing eighth-place finish last season, which led to an internal review of his position in May.United's fortunes took a further hit with consecutive losses against Brighton and Liverpool before the international break, intensifying the pressure on Ten Hag and his team. They had to navigate a challenging start at St. Mary's Stadium.In a tactical decision, Ten Hag opted to bench Casemiro following his subpar performance in the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool. Additionally, new acquisition Manuel Ugarte had to bide his time before making his debut as a second-half substitute.United continued to struggle with controlling the midfield in the opening stages but found a turning point when Onana saved a crucial penalty.Southampton's inability to capitalize on promising build-up play has been a recurring theme in their return to the top flight.Teenager Tyler Dibling impressed on his Premier League debut, using his trickery to draw Diogo Dalot into a reckless challenge inside the box.However, Archer's penalty lacked power, and Onana was able to parry the shot before comfortably catching the striker’s follow-up header.Just two minutes later, United took the lead as De Ligt put a tough week with the Dutch national team behind him by scoring his first goal for the club.Former Bayern Munich centre-back De Ligt was subbed off at halftime by Ronald Koeman after his mistakes led to two German goals in a 2-2 Nations League draw in Amsterdam.De Ligt, who first rose to prominence under Ten Hag at Ajax, was rewarded for his manager’s faith after being selected ahead of Harry Maguire. A short corner caught Southampton off guard, and Bruno Fernandes’ cross found De Ligt, who headed into the bottom corner.Southampton had brought in Aaron Ramsdale from Arsenal on the final day of the transfer window to bolster their survival hopes, and the England goalkeeper helped limit the damage. He made a fine save at his near post to momentarily deny Marcus Rashford’s much-needed goal.However, Rashford’s drought, which stretched back to March, ended in the 41st minute when his curling strike from outside the box found the far corner. Ramsdale also denied De Ligt a second before halftime as United looked poised to dominate.The second half, however, was much calmer, with United comfortably managing the game and keeping Southampton at bay. Frustrations boiled over for the home side when Stephens made an unnecessary lunge on Garnacho, catching him on the knee and earning a straight red card.In stoppage time, Garnacho added to Southampton’s misery with a powerful finish from Dalot's cross, sealing the victory in the 96th minute.","Matthijs de Ligt, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho scored to give Manchester United a 3-0 victory over Southampton.

Lobera-guided Odisha look for season encore but with a trophy; take on Chennaiyin in Kalinga opener,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/lobera-guided-odisha-look-for-season-encore-but-with-a-trophy-take-on-chennaiyin-in-kalinga-opener/articleshow/113341577.cms,"Kolkata: Having had probably the best season in the club’s history, Odisha FC did everything in their capacity to achieve great heights last season but for a trophy.Under a proven head coach on Indian shores in Sergio Lobera , the club had started off the 2023-24 season with runners-up finish in Super Cup at home, went to the semis of Indian Super League (ISL) for the first time and were beaten by Central Coast Mariners of Australia – the eventual winners – in the 2023-24 AFC Cup inter-zone semifinals playoff.To build on those remarkable achievements, the club has already done a good job by securing the services of the experienced Spanish gaffer apart from retaining their core squad. And now the Juggernauts are ready to roll under a coach who has an enviable record with his former clubs FC Goa and Mumbai City FC . Lobera won the 2019 Super Cup and ISL 2019-20 League Winners’ Shield with Goa before doing a double of winning the 2020-21 ISL trophy and League Winners’ Shield with the Islanders.Silverware with the Kalinga Warriors is surely due in order to match his unmatched feats as an ISL manager, but Lobera said he couldn’t ask more of his wards, who have had a ‘miraculous’ last season.“Last season was amazing, a miraculous season I must say, but that’s in the past, our focus is on the future now. Honestly, I can’t ask for more from my boys, they did remarkably well last season. We didn’t win any trophy but achieved great success for the club. We played in every tournament possible, unfortunately lost the Super Cup final, went to the semis of ISL and then AFC semifinal playoffs – that’s great, probably the best season for the club combining all the tournaments we played in,” Lobera told TOI from Bhubaneswar ahead of their ISL season opener against Chennaiyin FC at home on Saturday.Happy to be at the helm of Odisha FC for the second season running, Lobera was hopeful of adding to the club’s trophy cabinet, which only has the 2023 Super Cup to show now. “It’s first time in Odisha’s history that the same coach is starting the second season in a row. It’s good to continue with a club because when you start the first season you start with a zero. But now I have a group of players who understand my philosophy or what I want as a coach. We have a base from last season to work with and that certainly helps a coach in the second season. We are hopeful of building on that performance of last season,” said the former La Masia coach.Lobera also sounded confident with their pre-season where the reserve team, managed by assistant coaches, was out of the Durand Cup group stage and the first team under Lobera’s tutelage lost the final of Bhausaheb Bandodkar Memorial Trophy to FC Goa in penalty shoot-out.“I always believe that the best part of a season is the pre-season. The first team didn’t play the Durand Cup, so the young players got some valuable match-time there and we lost the final in Goa (Bandodkar Trophy) in penalties, but we scored some good goals, we beat good clubs from Australia (Brisbane Roar) and Argentina (CSD Defensa y Justicia). (Hugo) Boumos scored couple of goals against Brisbane Roar which will give us confidence going into the ISL now,” added Lobera, who assisted Tito Vilanova in 2012 during the latter’s stint as Barcelona manager.With the average age of the squad being 26.5 years, Odisha will see a mix of experienced foreigners alongside the youthful exuberance of the Indians, eight of them being under-22 and a host of 23, 24-year-olds. In the goalkeeping department, Odisha have just secured the services of their former custodian Kamaljit Singh, who will provide a solid backup to captain and first-choice ’keeper Amrinder Singh, along with Anuj Kumar and 21-year-old Niraj Kumar.“I always love to give young players chance to come into the first-team setup. We have eight U-22 players now and there’re many 24-25-26 year olds. I don’t think there’s many clubs in ISL who can say that. The right mix of youth and experience is always helpful to achieve success at any level, but I think that youngsters shouldn’t be put under pressure. They need to be well-prepared before coming into the first team, otherwise if someone is rushed then it can ruin his game. We need to take good care of young players and be patient with them,” explained Lobera.“Amey (Ranawade) was not getting matches before, he played so well for us and now he’s in the national team. Puitea (Lalthathanga Khawlhring) also had a very good last season and is in national reckoning now. Apart from preparing the young players for the club, we are also developing them for the Indian team, and it gives me immense pleasure to help in the growth of Indian football. You need good Indian players in your side to win trophies these days. Earlier when there were 6 foreigners in your team then it would have been possible but now with 4 foreigners (in playing XI) it’s not possible to win trophies with good foreigners alone,” the Spaniard added.However, asked about giving Indian players chance ahead of the big foreign names in key positions like centre-back, central midfield or centre forward, Lobera pointed towards his obligations as a club coach.“See, as the head coach of a club my priority is to win matches and trophies for the club. So, if I have a Roy Krishna or a Diego Mauricio and I feel that he can give me the best possible result then I will field him as the centre forward ahead of an Indian player. Rahim Ali and Isak (Vanlalruatfela) are very good players and both can play as winger or No. 9. We will see what situations demand and will field them accordingly.”Content with the squad at his disposal, still there’s one thing that Lobera will once again be missing this season. And that’s the local connection. Shubham Sarangi was the last and only Odia guy in the squad for four seasons until 2023, but now that he has joined Jamshedpur FC ahead of this season, defender Tankadhar Bag is the only native in the first-team squad, but he is yet to attain the level to get a match in the league.“Local players are very important for any club. I always feel that local boys are naturally much more attached to the club than players from outside, so it’s always good to have quality local players. When the supporters come to the stadium, they want to see some local guys playing, that gives them a natural connect. As the first team coach, I don’t know what’s the situation at the club’s academy or junior level about the local players, but it would be good to have some local guys in the side.

ISL season-11: Honours shared as Mohun Bagan & Mumbai City FC resume rivalry in style,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-season-11-honours-shared-as-mohun-bagan-mumbai-city-fc-resume-rivalry-in-style/articleshow/113340725.cms,"KOLKATA: Just like it was seen last season. Just like it can now be accepted as a benchmark. It may still feel too early but the rivalry between Mohun Bagan SG and Mumbai City is going to shape up the new season — again.If you need proof of that never-ending thirst for twists that defines a big game, if you are constantly reminded of the old adage that nothing is over until it’s over, it was much in evidence at the rain-bathed Salt Lake Stadium on Friday.Reigning ISL Shield winners Mohun Bagan SG and Cup holders Mumbai City FC seemed to have started from where they had left five months ago — no quarters were given and no mercy shown as they ended up sharing the spoils 2-2 in the tournament opener.Jose Molina’s hosts raced to a 2-0 lead inside the opening half an hour thanks to Tiri’s own goal and Alberto Rodriguez ’s strike in 29 minutes. Petr Kratky’s visitors dug in, believing in themselves and finding the target twice in the final 20 minutes. Tiri first reduced the margin in the 69th minute and second-half substitute Thaer Krouma snatched a point for Mumbai with their second goal in the 90th minute.It was a perfect start to a new season of the league. It was just the kind of a reminder that these two teams are about to lead the race for good reason. Creativity is the hallmark of these two teams but all the goals — including the opening one which was an own goal — came more from chaos than coherence.Mumbai went into an attacking mode right from the word go, enjoying possession and Bipin Singh bossing the left flank with his usual pace and potency and had even a goal disallowed for off-side. But having the ball isn’t enough and it’s what you do with it that counts.Such is the wealth of Mohun Bagan’s attacking prowess that if you doze off for a second, disaster will knock at your door rightaway. The opening goal of the new season sprang from an error in the heart of Mumbai rearguard and goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa certainly couldn’t absolve himself of his role in it.Liston Colaco, receiving the ball from Subhasish Bose, tried to square it across the face of the goal in the 9th minute. Lachenpa, standing at first post, should have stopped it, but ended up getting a faint touch to it and the ball took a deflection off his defender Tiri’s legs and went in.The build-up to Mohun Bagan’s second goal in the 29th minute was also chaotic. As the ball came to Asish Rai following a corner, he sent it deep towards the other end. Greg Stewart headed it back into the box and Alberto Rodriguez met it with a first-time volley which was spot on as Mumbai defenders again failed to react in time.Dimitri Petratos — who scuppered a gilt-edged chance to swell the lead when he found himself in a one-on-one position with the goalkeeper but failed to beat him soon after the restart — was uncharacteristically subdued. His Australian partner Jason Cummings was also largely ineffective. But just when Bagan thought they had done enough to get over the line, Mumbai struck back.Substitute Noufal PN who came in the 62nd minute, was at the heart of both goals. On the first occasion, his cross was met by Tiri, managing to find space and time to push it towards the goal, Rai’s desperate attempt to block it on the line failing to bear fruit. Then Krouma ruined Bagan’s hopes further, his placing on receiving the centre from Noufal perfect and precise to scythe through the heart of Bagan defence.",Reigning ISL Shield winners Mohun Bagan SG and Cup holders Mumbai City FC seemed to have started from where they had left five months ago. No quarters were given and no mercy shown as they ended up sharing the spoils 2-2 in the tournament opener.Jose Molina’s hosts raced to a 2-0 lead inside the opening half an hour thanks to Tiri’S own goal and Alberto Rodriguez ’s strike in 29 minutes.

The Mariners had taken a two-goal lead but failed to hold onto it.Tiri, one of the ISL 's most experienced foreign players, inadvertently put the ball into his own net in the ninth minute, giving his former team, Mohun Bagan, an early advantage.However, he later redeemed himself by scoring Mumbai City's first goal of the match in the 70th minute.Alberto Rodriguez , participating in his maiden ISL match for Mohun Bagan, propelled the Mariners to a commanding two-goal lead by finding the back of the net in the 28th minute of the game.Mohun Bagan, under the guidance of Jose Molina, found themselves in a familiar situation, unable to hold onto their lead, echoing their loss to NorthEast United FC in the Durand Cup final on August 31 at the same location.Despite the heavy rainfall, Mumbai City FC staged an impressive second-half comeback, with substitute Thaer Krouma finding the equalizer, securing a vital point on the road.The opportunity for Mohun Bagan's Liston Colaco to breach the Mumbai defense arose after the team failed to effectively clear a free kick. Colaco managed to overpower Valpuia and make his way into the penalty area.Subhasish Bose initiated an attack by passing the ball to Colaco on the left flank. Colaco then sent a low cross into the six-yard area, where Mumbai's goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa failed to intercept it. The ball ricocheted off Tiri and ended up in the back of the net, giving Mohun Bagan an early advantage.Mumbai had opportunities to equalize, particularly in the 13th minute when captain Lallianzuala Chhangte delivered an enticing cross from the right, finding Nikolaos Karelis at the far post. However, the striker's mistimed header resulted in a missed chance to level the score.Mohun Bagan extended their lead to 2-0 in the 28th minute, courtesy of a powerful strike from debutant Alberto Rodriguez.After another defensive lapse, Mumbai City once again struggled to clear the ball following a Mohun Bagan corner. Dimitri Petratos recovered the loose ball and passed it to Ashish Rai on the right, who then sent a precise cross into the box.Greg Stewart rose highest at the far post, nodding the ball down into the path of Rodriguez, who calmly slotted home with a side-footed strike to score his first ISL goal.The second half began with Mumbai City pressing for goals, but Manzoro’s wild effort in the 46th minute sailed over the bar.Rodriguez, instrumental in Mohun Bagan's strong first-half performance, went down with a cramp in the 79th minute and had to be substituted. This setback dulled their attacking edge, allowing Mumbai City to seize the momentum.In the 87th minute, Mumbai made key substitutions, bringing on Krouma and Brandon Fernandes.The equalizer came in stoppage time when Krouma finished off a slick move from Noufal in the 90th minute, leveling the score at 2-2.Despite Mohun Bagan's late penalty appeal for a handball and a yellow card for captain Subhasish Bose, Mumbai City's comeback was secured with a dramatic draw.Without regulars like Rahul Bheke, Alberto Noguera, and Jorge Pereyra Diaz, Petr Kratky's Mumbai City FC lined up in a 4-3-3 formation, featuring Chhangte, Bipin, and Nikolaos Karelis upfront.Molina, on the other hand, opted for more midfield strength in a 3-5-2 setup, with Dimitri Petratos and Greg Stewart leading Mohun Bagan's attack.","Mohun Bagan draw 2-2 with Mumbai City FC in the Indian Super League opener in Kolkata on Friday.

MATCH SCHEDULE

It has been an eventful year for Sriram Balaji and the amiable, battle-hardened pro will hold the key to India’s fortunes in the Davis Cup World Group I tie against Sweden in Stockholm on Saturday and Sunday.Balaji will open India’s campaign when he takes on Elias Ymer in the opening singles before Ramkumar Ramanathan tackles Leo Borg, the 21-year-old son of legendary Bjorn Borg, in the second match, as per the draw made on Friday.The Tamil Nadu combination will return to action on Sunday as they play the doubles rubber against hosts’ doubles specialists Andre Gorasnsson (aged 30 and ranked 66th in doubles) and Filip Bergevi (30, 125) at the Royal Tennis Hall.It is to Balaji’s credit that, despite him being a doubles specialist, captain Rohit Rajpal opted for his experience and reliability instead of saving him for the doubles and relying on the big serving Ramkumar to fetch him the two singles points.Balaji had a successful outing in singles in the previous tie, too, when he beat Pakistan’s ageing Akeel Khan in Islamabad earlier this year. But taking on Ymer, a 28-year-old who has been ranked 105 before and currently 238, will be an altogether different proposition. The Ethiopian-origin Swede has 11 titles, including six Challengers, the last of which came in Pune in 2018.Although he has run into a rough patch in recent times, he continues to play at the top level and is an excellent ball striker. If anything, turning out for his national team could be exactly the motivation Ymer needs to recover his form. Besides, he should have now been able to put behind him the emotional crisis arising out of his elder brother Mikael being handed a doping ban, which comes to an end later this year.But Balaji had been ranked in the top-300 and won 11 titles in the pro circuit in singles before focussing on doubles.What will be going for him, above all, is that he has been playing at the highest level with featuring in the Paris Olympics proving to be a cherished feather in the cap.“I played all the Grand Slams this year, I have been playing my best tennis. And playing for the country is always special. I keep practising singles and we played a lot of sets in practice after arriving here,” Balaji told TOIafter the draw.Asked how he intends to translate his doubles experience and skills to singles play, Balaji said: “I don’t want to give away too much of our strategy but I would be looking to keep the points short and put the pressure back on them.”By playing Balaji in combination with Ramkumar on Day 1, captain Rajpal has made clear his strategy.“What we don’t want is getting caught in long rallies,” Rajpal said.“They like to stay at the back (on the baseline) and both Ram and Balaji are good in serve and volley. They stand tall at the net, let them (opposition) try and pass them (Ram and Balaji).“They are playing at home. So, as Balaji said, we will try to put the pressure back on them.”For Ramkumar, the challenge will be to shrug off his poor form in singles — he has not won a match since May — and put his best foot forward, as he has often done when playing for India.“The surface is playing medium fast, and the ball is staying low. So it will be good for some slices. I will try to focus on my game,” Ram said.Saturday (from 5.30 pm IST):Sriram Balaji vs Elias Ymer; Ramkumar Ramanathan vs Leo Borg. Sunday (from 3.30 pm IST): Balaji/Ramkumar vs Andre Goransson/Filip Bergevi; Ramkumar vs Ymer; Balaji vs Borg.",Sriram Balaji will open India’s campaign when he takes on Elias Ymer in the opening singles before Ramkumar Ramanathan tackles Leo Borg.

If one has to characterise Leo Borg in one word, that would be it.It is one thing handling the pressure that comes with answering to a famous surname, quite another to embrace it and give your best day in and day out — to justify the adulation, to sort of earn the tag, maybe.“It’s a special thing to me to have a dad like him,” Borg said of his father, tennis legend Bjorn Borg , during a video call from his home town Stockholm on Thursday.Sweden host India in a World Group I tie on Saturday and Sunday.“He has done a lot of things in his time, and I feel really blessed because he has all the knowledge I need to get (from a father and a coach).“Of course, he’s been really supportive, and he has always been there for me on the tennis (court) and outside tennis. He’s been the best dad, actually. So I’m pretty, really proud of him, and he has a really special place in my heart.”On the tennis front, there’s no comparison between the father and the son.Borg senior, 68 now, lifted Sweden to its maiden Davis Cup win in 1975 when he was just 19. If his 33 singles win streak is a record in the tournament history, his six French Open trophies — four of them in a row — and five straight Wimbledon titles put him in a different plane altogether.Anyone else, in any walk of life, would have walked away from that borrowed stardom and harsh scrutiny that comes with it. Borg the junior has decided to not only play the sport, but also excel in it.Currently ranked 603, Leo had risen to 334 in the ATP charts last year before suffering a loss of form. He has recovered some of his level and motivation with a title and runner-up finish in the dreary ITF circuit in Thailand in recent weeks, jumping 169 places in the ranking ladder.Leo, 21, put it down to a “simple” advice he received from his father long ago.“Since I was really young, he said, ‘it’s really simple, never stop fighting until the last point’. And that’s been a very good advice, just to fight the whole match and the life outside tennis also. That’s a really simple thing, but it’s been really big.”The youngster’s humble journey on the tennis court may also explain the current woes of the sport in Sweden. For, Sweden is not just the land of Borg, it is also home to Zlatan Ibrahimovic.While Leo, who dabbled in football till the age of 12, had no doubts about his commitment to the racquet sport, his compatriots have quickly gravitated to soccer and other more rewarding sports. Not in them the mettle to fight back from losing the fourth set 16-18 in a tiebreaker after having five match points, and go on to win the fifth set in a Grand Slam final.“In my dad’s time, they had a really good amount of tennis players. I think they had some time like five top-10 players. Now, it’s completely different. We don’t have so many players in Sweden, it’s a little bit sad because we are a really good tennis country,” Leo said.“Many Swedish players quit tennis around the age of 18-19 because they think it’s too hard to get through to the pros. Of course, it’s hard, you really have to fight through to get to the top. I think our mentality has to be better.”","Leo Borg says it is a special thing to have a dad like Bjorn Borg.

And that's been a very good advice, just to fight the whole match and the life outside tennis also. That's a really simple thing, but it's been really big.""Amazingly, Leo has not watched videos of his father playing.""I have watched some things, of course, but it's true, I have never searched a video of him or anything like that. Yeah, (it) is funny, I know,"" he smiled.The youngster's humble journey on the tennis court may also explain the current woes of the sport in Sweden. For, Sweden is not just the land of Borg, it is also home to Zlatan.While Leo, who dabbled in football till the age of 12, had no doubts about his commitment to the racquet sport, his compatriots have quickly gravitated to soccer and other more rewarding sports. Not in them the mettle to fight back from losing the fourth set 16-18 in a tiebreaker after having five match points, and go on to win the fifth set in a grand slam final.""In my dad's time, they had a really good amount of tennis players. I think they had some time like five top-10 players. Now, it's completely different. We don't have so many players in Sweden, it's a little bit sad because we are a really good tennis country. I think your mentality is not that good anymore,"" Leo said.""Many Swedish players quit tennis around the age of 18-19 because they think it's too hard to get through pros. Of course, it's hard, you really have to fight through to get to the top. I think out mentality has to be better.""I think we have become too comfort (sic) in our country, to get to the top. So I think we have to focus on the mental side a little bit. Yeah, that's the most important thing, I think, or the difference, from his time.""Tennis is not that big anymore in Sweden, it's not a strange thing, actually, unfortunately.""",Leo Borg is the son of tennis legend Bjorn Borg.

Despite having never defeated Sweden in Davis Cup history, the Indian team is hopeful about securing their first victory in their sixth matchup.The contest will take place on a medium-speed indoor court at the Royal Tennis Hall in Sweden. India usually prefers faster surfaces, which would better suit their big servers.Indoor courts typically feature quick ball travel and are unaffected by external factors like wind.The team will play without top players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri .Former national champion Siddharth Vishwakarma is under consideration to join the team for an upcoming critical match. Despite his skills, his lack of experience at this level might prevent him from playing in a live rubber.The decision will likely consider his potential and the high-pressure nature of the match. His future participation seems contingent on further growth and experience.Captain Rohit Rajpal may opt for doubles specialist Balaji for the singles as he did against Pakistan on grass court earlier this year. In that match, Balaji performed well by defeating veteran Aqeel Khan in Islamabad and is currently in good form in Stockholm.Ramkumar Ramanathan is set to play a key role on the opening day of the upcoming match. The team's decision on the second singles match is still pending, with the choice between Niki Poonacha and N Sriram Balaji.Poonacha, despite his talent, has uncertain fitness due to a recent ankle sprain during practice. He is more focused on doubles and, although he beat Nagal earlier this year in Pune, has not played or won much in singles recently.Elias Ymer, Sweden's top singles player, is currently ranked 238. Indian player Ramkumar has faced Ymer twice on the ATP Tour, securing victories on both occasions.Ramkumar's performance has consistently shown strong talent and skill, yet the key for him is to stay composed under pressure and trust in his abilities.On Sunday, Balaji is set to play doubles. His partner will be either Ramkumar or Poonacha, which will be decided based on the scores after the first day.""We have better servers, and our players like to get in, play shorter points but these are medium-speed courts, so we are getting used to it by playing a lot of singles with each other,"" Rajpal told PTI.""If Yuki and Sumit were here, the tie would have tilted towards us, now it's 50-50.""""Leo Borg (second singles player) has improved a lot, we are watching him. They have a tough doubles team.""In preparation for the upcoming match, India's newly appointed Davis Cup coach, Ashutosh Singh, has conducted thorough research upon his arrival in Stockholm.In preparation for the upcoming competition, Ashutosh engaged with the coaches of the new team members, including Aryan Shah, to understand the young players' mindset and playing style.The Swedish team, led by Borg, holds the 603rd position in the rankings. Their doubles players, Andre Goransson and Filip Bergevi, are formidable competitors, ranked 66 and 125 respectively.Ashutosh engaged in discussions with players who have previously faced Borg to gather valuable insights. Additionally, Ashutosh dedicated a significant amount of time to analysing videos of the opposing players, which will aid in formulating effective strategies.The draw for the event is set to occur on Friday. The first day will feature singles matches, with doubles and reverse singles scheduled for Sunday.The winner of this tie will advance to the Qualifiers next year, while the losing team will move to the World Group I play-offs.","India will play Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group I contest starting on September 14.

PUNE: The Indian Davis Cup team, in Stockholm for the World Group I tie against Sweden on Sep 14-15, had a major fitness concern after Niki Kaliyanda Poonacha hurt his ankle during a practice session.""We had a bit of a scare. Niki Poonacha fell on the centre court, he sprained his ankle.The physios are working with him, he seems to be doing ok,"" captain Rohit Rajpal said from Stockholm on Wednesday. ""There was a spot on the centre court where his shoes got stuck and he fell. We taped it (the ankle), just to protect it.""It happened two days ago. He seems to be better (now), we are going to try him all out today,"" Rapal added, clarifying that the Bengaluru-based pro was put through light practice sessions over the past two days.""It is just a slight strain. He should be alright (in time for the tie)."" Poonacha's fitness is crucial to the Indian team's chances against Sweden in the absence of the country's No. 1 singles player Sumit Nagal as well as top doubles player Yuki Bhambri . Although he is a doubles player predominantly, with the surface playing ""medium"", Poonacha's explosive game with big serves could be an asset in singles.The tie will be played indoors on hard court at the Royal Tennis Hall, which hosts the long-standing Stockholm Open on the ATP Tour. The draw is set for Friday.""He (Poonacha) is one of the choices, certainly. In Poona (Pune Open ATP Challenger) this year, he beat Sumit (Nagal).

He is certainly in the fray,"" the captain said of the team's probable lineup for the opening singles.On the doubles pairing, Rajpal said: ""Our No. 1 combination would be our No. 1 doubles player (Sriram) Balaji and Ramkumar, but it all depends on how things shape up on the first day."" The travelling squad also comprises three new faces - former national champion Siddharth Vishwakarma (aged 29, WR 588), Aryan Shah (18, 637) and reserve player Manas Dhamne (16, 1080).

He believes that the move to PCI would be beneficial for the sport and its athletes.""We have won 21 medals at the Asian Para Games, around 14-15 medals at the World Championships, and 5 medals at the Paralympics , but we don't receive basic appreciation from BAI,"" Nitesh told PTI.""This isn't a new issue; it's a recurring problem. Their attention remains solely on able-bodied athletes, with minimal effort to promote para badminton.""Nitesh voiced his discontent through social media following BAI's tweet congratulating the para badminton players on their achievements in Paris.""Despite the occasional social media appreciation from @BAI_Media, we, the athletes, are highly dissatisfied with BAI's lack of interest in para badminton.""We sincerely request @Media_SAI and BAI to hand over para badminton to PCI, which has a better track record of supporting para sports,"" he wrote.Nitesh, a graduate of IIT Mandi, highlighted numerous administrative problems faced by para-badminton players.""There are significant administrative delays and inefficiencies.

Currently, all responsibilities often fall on one person, which at times gets overwhelming. With a dedicated team, tasks can be distributed effectively and managed more efficiently,"" Kumar continued.""Additionally, establishing a clear communication channel is crucial. We need to know exactly whom to approach with concerns.""Furthermore, the selection procedures are typically handled by a small group, without sufficient input from the players themselves.
