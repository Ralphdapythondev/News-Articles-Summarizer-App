Similarly, Kuldeep's stellar performance in the previous match propelled him to the fourth spot in the race for the IPL 2024 Purple Cap . Both Natarajan and Kuldeep have amassed an impressive tally of 12 wickets each in just six innings, with Kuldeep's spin and Natarajan's pace proving to be a formidable challenge for opposing batsmen. They trail closely behind current Purple Cap holder Jasprit Bumrah, who boasts 13 wickets in eight innings.In a historic moment, Yuzvendra Chahal etched his name in IPL annals by becoming the first bowler to reach the milestone of 200 wickets in the tournament during Rajasthan Royals' clash with Mumbai Indians.As the competition among bowlers intensifies, the IPL 2024 Purple Cap race remains tightly contested, with Bumrah leading the pack followed closely by Chahal and Harshal Patel, each boasting 13 wickets. Kuldeep Yadav follows closely in fourth place, while T Natarajan rounds off the top five with 12 wickets to his name.

NEW DELHI: In the 42nd match of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 season, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will face off against Punjab Kings (PBKS) at the Eden Gardens. KKR currently hold the second position in the points table, boasting five victories, while PBKS languish in the ninth spot with only two wins to their credit.With Mitchell Starc struggling to make a significant impact for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the IPL, the team has relied heavily on their batting, especially the top-order players like Sunil Narine , Phil Salt, Andre Russell, and captain Shreyas Iyer , who have all displayed remarkable strike rates.However, aside from Venkatesh Iyer, the specialist batters have all performed exceptionally well with strike rates above 150.KKR's bowling unit, on the other hand, has been inconsistent, with only Narine maintaining an impressive economy rate. Starc, in particular, has been disappointing, conceding runs at an alarming rate without being able to pick up wickets effectively. The uncapped Indian pacers Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora have shown more promise but still need improvement.In their upcoming match against Punjab Kings (PBKS), KKR will need Starc to rediscover his form and lead the bowling attack, especially against PBKS's power-hitters. Meanwhile, PBKS, struggling with inconsistent performances from key players like Prabhsimran Singh and Jonny Bairstow, will look to capitalize on KKR's bowling vulnerabilities.Both teams have relied on their uncapped players, particularly Ashutosh and Shashank for PBKS, to provide crucial contributions. PBKS will also hope for the return of their regular skipper,Shikhar Dhawan , to boost team morale after a string of losses.In the head-to-head clash between the Kolkata Knight Riders and Punjab Kings, the Knight Riders have demonstrated dominance, securing victory in 21 out of 32 matches played. Conversely, the Punjab Kings have managed 11 wins. Notably, there have been no instances of no result or matches abandoned.In the last 10 IPL matches hosted at Eden Gardens, there has been an equal distribution of success between teams batting first and second, with each side clinching victory in five encounters apiece.The statistical insights further reveal a high-scoring trend at Eden Gardens, with an average first innings score of 194.2 runs. Moreover, the benchmark for a winning first innings total stands notably higher at 210.2 runs, indicating the necessity for batting teams to aim for substantial totals to secure victory in matches played at this venue.Delving deeper into the nuances of batting performances, the data highlights the significance of strong starts and finishes in the context of T20 cricket. Teams have averaged 56.1 runs in the powerplay overs. Similarly, a commendable average of 61.1 runs in the death overs underscores the significance of finishing innings strongly, crucial for maximizing run-scoring opportunities and setting imposing targets for opponents to chase.In IPL 2024, Eden Gardens has emerged as a haven for batsmen, with teams consistently posting formidable totals of 200 runs or more when batting first.However, even such imposing scores haven't guaranteed safety, as multiple teams have come close to successfully chasing down these targets.The wicket in Kolkata has maintained its reputation for true bounce, favouring stroke play and providing an exciting platform for high-scoring encounters.1. Eden Gardens in IPL 2024 has favoured batsmen greatly. This indicates a high likelihood of batsmen accumulating significant fantasy points through big scores, boundaries, and possibly even centuries or half-centuries.2. Despite the high scores set by teams batting first, the pitch at Eden Gardens has seen multiple instances of successful chases, suggesting ample opportunities for fantasy players to benefit from batsmen chasing down imposing targets. This indicates the potential for fantasy points not only from batsmen but also from players involved in successful run chases.Shreyas Iyer (c), KS Bharat, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Rinku Singh , Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Sherfane Rutherford, Manish Pandey, Andre Russell, Nitish Rana, Venkatesh Iyer, Anukul Roy, Ramandeep Singh, Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine, Vaibhav Arora, Chetan Sakariya, Harshit Rana, Suyash Sharma, Mitchell Starc, Dushmantha Chameera, Sakib Hussain and Mujeeb Ur RahmanShikhar Dhawan (c), Matthew Short, Prabhsimran Singh, Jitesh Sharma, Sikandar Raza, Rishi Dhawan, Liam Livingstone, Atharva Taide, Arshdeep Singh, Nathan Ellis, Sam Curran, Kagiso Rabada, Harpreet Brar, Rahul Chahar, Harpreet Bhatia, Vidwath Kaverappa, Shivam Singh, Harshal Patel, Chris Woakes, Ashutosh Sharma, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Shashank Singh, Tanay Thyagarajan, Prince Choudhary, Rilee Rossouw.Phil Salt (wk), Sunil Narine, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Shreyas Iyer (c), Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Mitchell Starc/Dushmantha Chameera, Varun Chakravarthy, Harshit Rana, Suyash Sharma.Venkatesh IyerPrabhsimran Singh, Atharva Taide, Rilee Rossouw, Sam Curran (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Liam Livingstone, Shashank Singh, Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Kagiso Rabada, Harshal Patel.Arshdeep SinghIPL 2024 Stats: 286 Runs and 9 wickets in 7 MatchesSunil Narine has emerged as a key player for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2024, showcasing remarkable all-round performance.

KOLKATA: What is a safe total for Kolkata Knight Riders ? The team management must be asking themselves after they went down to Punjab Kings by eight wickets even after putting up 261 for six, their best at Eden Gardens and second highest IPL score, on being asked to bat first here on Friday.The match recorded the highest number of sixes (42) in any T20 game as after KKR hit 18 of those, PBKS bettered that by getting six more to record the highest run-chase in any T20 match scoring 262 for two in 18.4 overs.The hosts benched an injured and out-of-form Mitchell Starc, but his replacement Lankan pacer Dushmantha Chameera did not fare any better giving away 48 runs in three overs.In reply to KKR's 76 runs for no loss in the Powerplay, Punjab openers Jonny Bairstow and Prabhsimran Singh, coming in as an impact player for pacer Arshdeep Singh, set the platform with 93 for one.Bairstow, making a comeback after two matches in place of Liam Livingstone, led from the front taking the KKR attack head-on. The Englishman reached his 50 in 23 balls and 100 off 45 balls with eight fours and eight sixes.PBKS tilted the balance of the match in their favour by getting 132 runs for one, their highest IPL score at the 10-over mark.The Bairstow-Rilee Rossouw second wicket stand of 85 runs came in just 39 balls to keep PBKS on course.Shashank Singh kept his good form going to finish off things staying undefeated on 68 along with Bairstow, who got 108 off 48 balls with the help of eight fours and nine sixes. The two were involved in an unbroken third-wicket stand of 84 runs off 37 runs.Sunil Narine once again remained KKR's star performer ending with one wicket giving away 24 runs in his four overs after giving the side a solid start.Earlier, the Punjab bowlers were the receiving end of double-barrel firing as KKR openers Phil Salt and Narine gave the side another breezy start collecting 138 runs for the opening-wicket off 63 balls before Narine departed for 71 hitting nine fours and four sixes. PBKS' cause was hurt by some poor fielding too as they dropped Salt (twice) and Narine (once).Salt too missed the three-figure mark perishing an over later being bowled by Curran for 75 after hitting six fours and six sixes playing 37 balls.However, KKR lost steam after the quick departure of the openers. The way the two played, even Andre Russell, promoted up the order, looked slow in his 12-ball 24-run innings.KKR skipper Shreyas Iyer (28 off 10 balls) tried to up the tempo stitching together a 43-run fourth-wicket stand with Venkatesh Iyer off just 18 balls. But losing regular wickets saw them end up with some 15-20 runs short that did make a difference.","Punjab Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by eight wickets at Eden Gardens.

LUCKNOW: Lucknow Super Giants will host Rajasthan Royals on Saturday night in a game crucial for both teams. Having won seven of their eight matches, RR will be looking forward to sealing a playoff berth with another win here.Meanwhile, LSG will eye revenge after having lost their inaugural encounter against Royals in Jaipur by 20 runs.In the last few matches, LSG have had to face injuries in their fast-bowling unit, with young sensation Mayank Yadav and left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan going missing.Mayank's fate remains uncertain, though he practiced in the nets on Friday. Earlier, LSG bowling coach Morne Morkel had said that Mayank might make a comeback against RR.In the pre-match conference, LSG's assistant coach Sridharan Sriram said, ""Mayank bowled today in the nets but I am not sure if he will play.""LSG look in form as they have won back-to-back matches against CSK. Marcus Stoinis shattered multiple records as he remained unbeaten on 124 off 63 balls.Stoinis smoked six sixes and 13 fours in his match-winning knock.

NEW DELHI: Usually, halfway through an IPL season, the training sessions get shorter with several players opting to focus on recovery. With the summer sun getting stronger, one would have expected the same ahead of Saturday's match between Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians here at the Arun Jaitley stadium.Instead, the bulk of the MI team went through a gruelling session on Thursday afternoon while the Capitals camp also set up an intense session on Friday evening.This is a time when each IPL performance counts, with the selection for the upcoming T20 World Cup due soon. At a time when Indian cricket seems to be grappling with workload-management issues, one could see Hardik Pandya going full throttle with the ball in high heat and Axar Patel turning up for a lengthy nets session barely 40 hours after playing a tough match against Gujarat Titans.Capitals captain Rishabh Pant , too, was present overseeing his troops.Rohit Sharma , on Thursday, had a long and nuanced batting session. And Ishan Kishan, hoping to resurrect his international career after a fallout with BCCI, decided to push the limits by batting for nearly two hours at the practice area before moving on to the centre square to sharpen his range hitting skills.The two teams are delicately placed in the table. Capitals have a chance to push the top four and MI are clearly staring down a cliff. Stakes are always high for players in the IPL. But the pressure is more this time as the next few weeks may prove to be critical for many careers.One player who must be eager to seal his T20 World Cup spot at the earliest is Axar Patel. Forever in the shadow of Ravindra Jadeja , Axar has been selected and dropped from World Cup squads quite a few times.Capitals' director of cricket Sourav Ganguly asserted on Friday, ""Axar, Rishabh are certainties for me for the World Cup. I'm sure someone like Rohit, the way cricket is going these days, would want someone coming at No. 8 to bat and give him those 15-20 runs, which Axar can easily do. And if he needs someone to go in the middle and hit spinners, Axar can do that too. That's the advantage with Jadeja and Axar.""Axar's promotion in the batting order to No. 3 paid off immediately for Capitals in the last match as he scored a valuable 66 runs. And the economy rate with his brand of left-arm spin has been hovering around seven runs per over in a tournament which has seen 200 become the par score.There's another facet to Saturday's match that adds to the context, as MI's power-hitter Tim David pointed out. An afternoon match is closest to the conditions one may expect at the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean.""We've got a day game in Delhi and it's 38 degrees. It can be similar sort of conditions in the Caribbean and day matches there, it's pretty warm. It's hard to speculate on what the pitch will be like in a month's time. They could do a lot of work and make real flat pitches. It could rain the day of the game and would spin,"" David said.The IPL is tantalisingly poised. But the heat is on the players to make a case for World Cup selection.",Delhi Capitals face Mumbai Indians in the IPL on Saturday. Both teams have a chance to push the top four in the table.

Leicester City secure Premier League promotion; Leeds United's dreams dashed in 4-0 loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/leicester-city-secure-premier-league-promotion-leeds-uniteds-dreams-dashed-in-4-0-loss/articleshow/109638592.cms,"(Inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: Leicester City secured promotion to the Premier League on Friday following Leeds United 's unexpected 4-0 loss against Queens Park Rangers . The Foxes sit atop the Championship standings with 94 points and two games remaining, while Leeds remain second with 90 points and only one match left to play.Ipswich Town , currently in third place with 89 points and three games in hand, have the opportunity to overtake Leeds for the second automatic promotion spot.Leeds manager Daniel Farke acknowledged the situation, stating, ""It's not in our hands anymore (automatic promotion), we need to be honest."" However, he remained hopeful, adding, ""The race is not over, if Ipswich win the next two games then I will say congratulations but if they don't win them then we will have a lot to play for (against Southampton on the final day of the season).""Leicester achieved promotion in their first season following relegation from the Premier League last year. They face Preston on Monday before concluding their season at home against Blackburn on May 4. Leeds' fate depends on Ipswich's results against Hull on Saturday and Coventry in their game in hand on Tuesday. If Ipswich win both matches, they will secure promotion, relegating Leeds to the play-offs.Despite their impressive 5-0 victory over Southampton on Tuesday, Leicester's joy at promotion may be tempered by the Premier League's charges against them in March for alleged breaches of profit and sustainability rules during their last three years in the top flight. If found guilty, the Foxes could face a points deduction upon their return to the Premier League.QPR's well-deserved win over Leeds, with goals from Ilias Chair, Lucas Andersen, Lyndon Dykes, and Sam Field, ensured their survival in the Championship. Manager Marti Cifuentes, who took over from Gareth Ainsworth in October when the team was second from bottom, expressed his delight, saying, ""It was a fantastic evening. We worked really hard to get this type of performance."" He praised the club's resilience and unity in the face of adversity, calling their survival ""the great escape.""","Leicester City secured promotion to the Premier League on Friday following Leeds United's unexpected 4-0 loss against Queens Park Rangers.

The night belonged entirely to Bairstow and his partner Shashank, as they took control and led Punjab Kings to victory.Prabhsimran deserves special praise for his dynamic start, dismantling the KKR attack on a batting-friendly pitch, giving Bairstow the space to settle in.After Prabhsimran's dismissal, Rilee Rossouw added a quick 26 off 16 balls, while the in-form Shashank unleashed eight sixes, just one short of Bairstow's nine, making the chase seem effortless.The match saw a total of 523 runs scored and an IPL record of 42 sixes hit.Both the record chases now have come against KKR in space of 10 days and at the same venue of Eden Gardens.It was on April 16, KKR had failed to defend 223/6 with another Englishman -- Jos Buttler -- who smashed a 55-ball century to pull off the heist.It was IPL's joint record chase till then and both by with Rajasthan Royals -- first against Mumbai Indians in 2000 and then vs KKR in 2024.The two defeats also highlighted KKR's bowling plight this season as their 24.75 crore buy Mitchell Starc has failed to live up to his big prize purse, something that may be a big concern for the team poised to make the playoffs.This win may be a little too late for PBKS to make the playoffs. This was their third win from nine matches as they improved their position to eighth spot in the 10-team standings.For KKR, this was their third loss from eight matches as they have 10 points, occupying the second spot behind Rajasthan.Prabhsimran made the perfect impact at the top replacing pacer Arshdeep Singh when he creamed an 18-ball fifty with five sixes and four fours to give PBKS an ideal start to the massive chase.Prabhsimran teed off against Harshit Rana, smoking him for two sixes in three balls, before Dushmantha Chameera bore his burnt and conceded 23 runs in his over.On six off five balls, Bairstow was a mute spectator at his end with Prabhsimran blazing all guns.Down on one knee, Prabhsimran launched into Narine for a six over backward square leg that summed up the the effortlessness with which the batters had their way while wielding the willow.Bairstow came on his own in the next over when he went ballistic against KKR's 'Impact Player ', left-arm spinner Anukul Roy, who leaked three fours and two sixes in his first five balls.The only respite was Narine's direct hit from short fine-leg in the final delivery of that Roy over that brought an end to Prabhsimran's blazing knock.Before this match, Bairstow's highest this season was 42 as he got out for single digit scores twice and managed just 96 runs to be dropped in their last two matches.But nothing went wrong for the 34-year-old Englishman who single handedly steered the chase.after the thunderous start from Prabhsimran.Earlier KKR's posted their second ever 250-plus total, both coming during the current season.Narine blasted nine fours and four sixes -- his third fifty plus score of the season after 85 against Delhi Capitals and 109 versus Rajasthan Royals previously.Narine also jumped to second spot in the race for the 'Orange Cap' for leading run-getters with 357 runs from eight matches, 73 runs behind Virat Kohli (430 runs) who has played one match extra.Salt also was at his explosive best and blazed his way to his third fifty of the season in his 37-ball 75, studded with six fours and half a dozen sixes.Narine's fifty came off just 23 balls, while Salt took two more deliveries to complete the milestone as the KKR opening duo reeled off 100 runs in just eight overs.They also posted season's highest opening partnership of 138, eclipsing 134 by Lucknow Super Giant's KL Rahul and Quinton de Kock in their match against Chennai Super Kings on April 19.At 190/2 from 15 overs, KKR seemed well on course to improve upon their highest total of 272/7 that came against Delhi Capitals in Visakhapatnam on April 3.But their middle and lower order failed to capitalise and it was Shreyas Iyer's 10-ball 28 (1x4, 3x6) which went a long way in taking them past 260-run mark.",Jonny Bairstow hits unbeaten 108 as Punjab Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders.

Virat Kohli: 'Usually he isn't this slow': Former India cricketers express concerns about Virat Kohli's strike rate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/usually-he-isnt-this-slow-former-india-cricketers-express-concerns-about-virat-kohlis-strike-rate/articleshow/109615198.cms,"NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's calculated approach contrasted sharply with Rajat Patidar 's explosive innings for Royal Challengers Bengaluru against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL on Thursday.Patidar (50 off 20 balls) shouldered the majority of the run-scoring responsibility in his 65-run partnership with Kohli (51 off 43), who focused on rotating the strike to his partner, a strategy that drew criticism from Sunil Gavaskar during the commentary.The analysis of Virat Kohli's strike rate in IPL 2024 has ignited an engaging discussion on Jio Cinema, eliciting opinions from former cricketers Ajay Jadeja and RP Singh.IPL 2024: POINTS TABLE Ajay Jadeja provided an insightful analysis, dividing Kohli's innings into two distinct phases and highlighting their respective impacts. He noted Kohli's aggressive start but questioned RCB 's batting order, suggesting it might limit adaptability and experimentation during the game.""When Virat Kohli started, he looked to be in a different mood altogether. When he scored some 24 off the first 11-12 balls, we felt RCB did what SRH had been doing to other teams. But the main difference between SRH and RCB is that when RCB got ahead, they slowed down. Maybe they weren't aiming that high,"" Jadeja said.""Talking about Kohli's consistency is like explaining the existence of the sun. The moment the Powerplay ended, he slowed down. It could be because RCB lost two wickets, maybe. Sometimes, it looks as if RCB are very adamant about their roles. DK will always come out at the end. And in doing that, RCB pulled the hand-brake,"" Jadeja added.RP Singh shared similar views, commending Kohli's assertiveness in the Powerplay but expressing concern about his subsequent slowdown. He acknowledged Kohli's ability to disrupt bowlers' rhythm but pointed out a significant decrease in boundary scoring during the middle overs, a worry echoed by many.""He has transformed himself inside the Powerplay. We don't usually get to see such shots from him anymore. He takes his time, backs himself and plays as per the ball. He went to attack alright. He tried to disturb the line and length of the bowlers, but once the wicket fell, he got slow. Usually he isn't this slow; there were almost 24-25 balls when a single boundary wasn't scored, which could have had a strong impact but the good thing was he held one end, allowing Rajat Patidar to get the job done,"" RP Singh, former India quick, said.As the IPL season unfolds and the T20 World Cup approaches, Kohli's approach will remain under scrutiny.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL 2024. Rajat Patidar scored 50 off 20 balls, while Virat Kohli scored 51 off 43.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool 's Premier League title aspirations were dealt a severe blow as they suffered a 2-0 loss to their Merseyside rivals Everton , while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a hard-fought 4-2 victory over bottom-placed Sheffield United on Wednesday.Everton took the lead in the 27th minute through Jarrad Branthwaite, who prodded the ball past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker via the post following a poorly cleared free-kick.Despite Mohamed Salah 's efforts, Liverpool failed to equalize, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin sealed the win for Everton with a header in the 58th minute.""

NEW DELHI: Barcelona 's head coach Xavi has decided to remain in his position, despite previously announcing his intention to leave at the end of the season due to the challenging nature of the job.The Spanish club confirmed this news on Wednesday, following reports of meetings between Xavi, club president Joan Laporta, and sporting director Deco.The decision comes amidst a difficult period for Barcelona, who were recently eliminated from the Champions League by Paris Saint-Germain and fell 11 points behind Real Madrid in the La Liga title race after a 3-2 Clasico defeat.Xavi had expressed feeling ""liberated"" when he initially decided to step down, citing the immense pressure and lack of appreciation for his work. He had mentioned that other coaches, such as Pep Guardiola, Ernesto Valverde, and Luis Enrique , had also experienced similar struggles.Barcelona appointed Xavi as their manager in November 2021, and he helped the club win the league title last season. However, this season has been more challenging, with the team suffering a 4-1 defeat to Real in the Spanish Super Cup and being eliminated from the Copa del Rey by Athletic Bilbao. Financial issues have also plagued the club in recent years.Following Xavi's initial announcement to leave, there was a lack of experienced coaches linked to the job, with onlyRafael Marquez , the current Barcelona B team manager, being considered a serious contender.Despite the team's inconsistent performance this season, there are promising signs for the future, with the emergence of young talents such as Lamine Yamal , Pau Cubarsi, and Fermin Lopez.",Xavi had previously announced his intention to leave the club at the end of the season.

Juventus, who have won the competition a record 14 times, advanced despite a 2-1 loss to Lazio in their second leg, progressing with a 3-2 aggregate score.Atalanta, fresh off their Europa League quarter-final elimination of Liverpool , reached their sixth Italian Cup final, with their only previous trophy coming in the 1962-63 season. Fiorentina had taken a 1-0 lead in the first leg at home, thanks to a strike from Rolando Mandragora.However, Atalanta wasted no time in levelling the tie, with Teun Koopmeiners scoring in the eighth minute. Gianluca Scamacca thought he had doubled the lead shortly after, but his goal was disallowed for a foul in the buildup. Atalanta continued to threaten, with Koopmeiners and Charles De Ketelaere both coming close before the break.Fiorentina's task became even more challenging when Nikola Milenkovic was sent off early in the second half for fouling Scamacca just outside the box.

Liverpool, who have played one fewer match than Arsenal, face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.""We have made our people very proud, it is a big derby for us and I know what it means,"" said Arteta.The Arsenal manager acknowledged his team's strong start but noted their failure to convert all their chances and some sloppiness in certain areas. However, he praised their second-half performance, citing improved discipline and ruthless finishing.Chelsea suffered a significant setback before the match even began, as their key player Cole Palmer was ruled out due to illness. Palmer has been involved in nearly half of Chelsea's Premier League goals this season, and his absence was keenly felt by the visitors.Despite an unbeaten run of eight league games prior to their FA Cup semi-final loss to Manchester City, Chelsea were outclassed by an Arsenal side eager to reassert their title credentials following a home defeat to Aston Villa.Mauricio Pochettino expressed his disappointment with the result and his team's performance, stating, ""Today we didn't compete against a team fighting for the Premier League. We need to be aware we need to compete in a different way.""Arsenal started the match with incredible intensity, taking the lead within five minutes through Trossard, who has proven to be a more effective signing than Chelsea's January acquisition of Mykhailo Mudryk. Chelsea goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic made several impressive saves to keep his team in the game before halftime, but Arsenal's relentless pressure eventually paid off.White's curling effort from a corner doubled Arsenal's lead early in the second half, and Havertz, who has found consistent form under Arteta, scored twice to put the game out of reach. White's attempted cross, which flew into the top corner, capped off a night to forget for Chelsea, who remained in ninth place, three points behind the European qualification spots.Arsenal's next challenge is a daunting away fixture against Tottenham in the north London derby on Sunday.

It was Ahmed Jahouh, with his third assist of the season, who sent in a cross in front of goal from a corner and the dependable Carlos Delgado was there to meet it with his body and send the ball in.The equaliser got Sergio Lobera ’s team more pumped as Roy Krishna , Amey Ranawade and Isak Vanlalruatfela kept piling pressure on the Bagan defence with runs down the middle and the flanks. The Shield winners, too, kept pushing for another goal but the Delgado and Fall-led Odisha defence kept the dangers at bay.On the other hand, Odisha’s chief playmaker Jahouh fell to Habas’s plan of not being given the space for his long balls and his frustration led to a yellow card in the 23rd minute.But it was Juggernauts’ custodian Amrinder who became the provider in the 39th minute and sent a long ball ahead of the half line. Odisha’s top scorer, Krishna, received the ball with a header and on finding Subhasish Bose a bit out of position, beat Hector Yuste with his pace to send the ball in with a clinical finish between the legs of Vishal Kaith rushing from the goal and become the joint-top scorer in the league.Petratos and Manvir had chances to level the score soon after but the home side went into the break with a one-goal lead.Lobera’s men came back with new vigour after the change of ends but could only create half chances as Odisha held fort at the back.The second half, however, was put in the spotlight for the wrong reason as both teams saw themselves go down by a player to red cards.Armando Sadiku, who received a yellow for an outburst of frustration in the first half, got shown the red card for an aerial tackle on Jahouh in the 67th minute. Seven minutes later, it was Delgado who received the marching orders for a second yellow shown for what appeared to be a harsh penalty for an unintentional handball just outside the box.With both teams a man down, the coaches resorted to more cautious approach with a slew of substitutions and the best attacking chance after that went to Bagan who saw the ball hit the crossbar after a goalmouth melee.The scoreline, however, stayed 2-1 in Odisha’s favour ahead of Sunday’s second leg in Kolkata.",Odisha FC maintained their unbeaten streak at home as they got the better of Shield winners Mohun Bagan Super Giants 2-1 in the first leg of their ISL semifinal in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday.

I faced in Milan what Vinicius is facing in Madrid: Marcel Desailly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/i-faced-in-milan-what-vinicius-is-facing-in-madrid-marcel-desailly/articleshow/109517434.cms,"(The writer's in Madrid on the invitation of Laureus)

MADRID: The city is still reeling under the Clasico hangover and everyone is praising Jude Bellingham . Marcel Desailly , the former captain of France and a World Cup-winner, did not miss out on joining the chorus on England’s new-found ace who decided the Clasico at the Bernabeu on a raucous Sunday night.What makes Desailly stand out, apart from his outstanding physical appearance, is his composed articulation on matters others are apprehensive talking about.TOI asked about Vinicius ' offfield challenges with racism while playing for Real Madrid and Desailly spoke his mind.""He's ambitious and he's a bit too touchy. But he's right at the same time. I experienced this at the time when I was playing for Milan. He doesn't understand. I understand the situation because I'm originally from Africa. You see where he's coming from, Brazil, where it's completely different, the approach. So it's not surprising that he has made the noise. Because it's not about him, it's about the La Liga .""We have the power to change things, but we are not doing enough. Samuel Eto'o had the same issue at his time. So Vinicius is also part of these players who will suffer because the administrative people are not willing to hit harder. Otherwise, we are happy about his growth,"" he said.""Vinicius is 24. I think he has improved. Remember when he came? Four years ago. He didn't have the ability to finish. You see now his clinical assist and finishing."" Immediately his French soul took over and he referred to Dembele. ""The stats are very poor. Two goals or three goals, but he has great potential.""The one player who is living up to potential is Bellingham . With Euro 2024 round the corner, Desailly feels the Real Madrid star will influence Gareth Southgate's forever underachieving bunch rather positively.""I don't think that he was outstanding last night, but he's been key for his team. (Carlo) Ancelotti could have substituted him. But he took Vinicius out because he knew Bellingham had the legs to defend and to position himself and identify the correct moment to find the killer goal. He is just a good player for now. You try to compare him with Zidane. It's difficult for us to accept that. The use of the ball is different with Zidane and Bellingham. Jude is a bit more straightforward on acceleration. Zizou was more pattern-weaving, ballet-like. But the potential of the talent is quite similar.""With his experience of English football while playing for Chelsea, Desailly is cheekily penetrative in his assessment.""Quality kills the quality. That is England's problem. The Dutch were having this kind of problem too. They all have a high expertise, they all have their own belief every time. It was difficult for them to unite all together at the same moment to perform. So England might have to improve on this aspect because the talent is there. So let's see how the coach is going to be able to adjust and make the choice.""Desailly was born in Accra, Ghana but moved to France with his mother when he was just four.","Marcel Desailly believes Jude Bellingham is living up to his potential.

Odisha have never beaten MBSG in their past nine ISL encounters, having gone down on four occasions out of those.Sergio Lobera ’s boys will certainly leave no stone unturned to break that winless streak against their much-fancied, confident opponents at home before travelling to the Mariners’ Kolkata citadel for the second leg.

They secured their historic semis berth with a thrilling 2-1 comeback win against Kerala Blasters in the playoffs at home.Ahead of taking on the Shield Winners, Odisha FC head coach Sergio Lobera banked on their record at home this season. “Tomorrow’s game will be a difficult game. We are going to play against the current shield winners’ team. They have a very good team, but we also have a very good team and we are unbeaten in Kalinga. We want to keep the momentum in terms of our results at home. Our target is to finish the season unbeaten (at home),” Lobera said ahead of the game on Monday.Asked how special it will be to reach the ISL final, the Spanish coach said, “It will be very special for us to reach the semifinals. We are creating a lot of pages in terms of creating a story in the club. We want to do one step more. It will be amazing to reach the final.”Praising their opponents, Mohun Bagan coach Antonio Lopez Habas said ahead of the game, “For me, the past is not one to think about. I have to live in the present. Odisha are a very difficult opponent because they have a good coach, they have players with experience, and it will be a difficult match for us.”About their preparations for the semis clash, the Spanish gaffer said, “We need to prepare for this match as any league match, we need to win this match in the 90 minutes. We can’t think about the second leg, that is how we think about it. This semifinal is very difficult to win in the first leg, but we should not lose it in the first match.”With great tacticians at the helm of two talented bunch of players fighting for supremacy, Tuesday’s clash at Kalinga calls for an exciting first part of the two-legged battle for a berth in the final.","Odisha FC host Mohun Bagan Super Giant in the first leg of the high-octane last- four clash in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday.
