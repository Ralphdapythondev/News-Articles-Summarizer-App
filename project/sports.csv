A year ago, fast bowler Yash Dayal fell ill after receiving online abuse for being hit for five sixes in an over by Kolkata Knight Riders' (KKR) batsman Rinku Singh . A year on from that day, when Dayal used to play for the Gujarat Titans, the right-arm pace redeemed himself in the tournament, albeit in a different jersey.Bowling the last over in the crucial IPL 2024 match against the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) on Saturday, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) pacer Dayal (2/43) held his nerves to stop CSK from reaching the 201-run mark, which would have put RCB out of the tournament.After the match, Rinku came up with a warm Instagram story, which was almost a virtual hug from KKR batsman to Dayal.Tagging Dayal in the story, Rinku wrote: ""God's plan baby"".Chasing RCB's commendable 218 for 5, CSK could only muster 191 for 7 for a 27-run win.But that's not the entire story. CSK required to reach 201 and would have still made it to the playoffs. However, Dayal had other plans for the five-time champions.The win took RCB's points tally to 14, the same as CSK, but the Bengaluru outfit leapfrogged CSK in the net run-rate column to finish fourth.Hailing Dayal's effort, RCB skipper Faf du Plessis, who led Bengaluru's batting charts with his 39-ball 54, said: ""I want to dedicate my 'Player of the Match' award to Yash Dayal. He has a golden heart.""","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) pacer Dayal (2/43) held his nerves to stop CSK from reaching the 201-run mark, which would have put RCB out of the tournament.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru grab final IPL 2024 play-off berth; Chennai Super Kings knocked out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/royal-challengers-bengaluru-grab-final-ipl-2024-play-off-berth-chennai-super-kings-knocked-out/articleshow/110238295.cms,"(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru extended their fairytale run, securing the fourth and final playoff berth with a 27-run victory over defending champions Chennai Super Kings in their must-win last IPL league game on Saturday.This marked the sixth consecutive win for RCB, who initially posted a formidable total of 218 for five after being put in to bat.They then managed to restrict CSK to 191 for 7, securing their place in the playoffs for the ninth time in 15 seasons.Despite a late scare from Ravindra Jadeja (42 not out) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (25), who raised hopes of a CSK comeback after Rachin Ravindra's 61, RCB's Yash Dayal maintained his composure in the final over to guide the hosts to victory.With Kolkata Knight Riders, Rajasthan Royals, and Sunrisers Hyderabad already qualified for the playoffs, RCB's victory solidified their spot in the upcoming playoff stage.While it was ecstasy for RCB, the legion of fans of Dhoni sank into despair as it could potentially be the last time they witnessed their 'Thala' perform on a cricket field.Down and out after losing seven out of their first eight games, RCB had weaved five wins on the trot to script a remarkable turnaround and give themselves a chance to make it to the final four.On Saturday, the hosts needed to win by at least 18 runs to book the final play-off berth and they did that in style with yet another impressive show at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.The two teams finished at 14 points but RCB sneaked into the final four on the basis of a better net run-rate.The equation was in favour of CSK when they began their run-chase as a 200-plus score would have sealed their place in the final four at the expense of RCB even if they had lost the game.However, CSK lost skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad (0) and Daryl Mitchell (4) to be reduced to 19 for 2 in the third over.Ajinkya Rahane (33) and Ravindra (61) steadied the innings with a 64-run stand but Lockie Ferguson broke the partnership as the former was holed out by du Plessis and then the New Zealander was run out.Du Plessis then took a screamer to remove Mitchell Santner as CSK slipped to 129 for 6 in 15 overs.With their backs to the wall, Jadeja and Dhoni added a whirlwind 61 off 27 balls to bring the equation down to 11 off five balls to qualify for the play-offs.With CSK needing 17 runs off the last six balls to qualify, Yash Dayal bowled the final over and he was straight away smashed for a six by Dhoni but the pacer came back strongly to dismiss the former CSK skipper and then conceded just one run in next five balls to seal it for RCB.Earlier, sent in to bat, RCB's top-order, led by skipper du Plessis, fired in unison.Du Plessis hit three fours and three sixes on his way to a 39-ball 54, his fourth fifty of the season, while Virat Kohli (47 off 29 balls), Rajat Patidar (41 off 23 balls) and Cameron Green (38 not out off 17 balls) also went on a six-hitting spree to put RCB on solid ground.Openers Kohli and du Plessis began on a positive note and were 31 for no loss when there was a short rain interruption, causing a 40-minute delay.However, on resumption, CSK pressed spinners into the attack. With the ball gripping and turning, spin duo of Maheesh Theekshana (25/0) and Mitchell Santner (23/0) troubled the batters as RCB reached 42 for no loss at the end of the Powerplay.Kohli brought out his slog sweep to clobber two more sixes before holing out to Daryl Mitchell off Santner as RCB slipped to 78 for one in 10 overs.Ravindra Jadeja (40/0 in 3 overs) was however slaughtered by du Plessis, who blasted a four and two sixes to pile up 20 runs off his third over and then completed his 35-ball fifty.Rajat Patidar (41) then got into the act, depositing Theekshana for a maximum.In the 13th over, du Plessis was unfortunately run out at the bowler's end but Patidar continued his onslaught, smashing Simarjeet Singh for a four and a six, while Thakur conceded 17 with Green thumping one over long-on to bring up the 150.Green was, however, dropped by Gaikwad in the deep but Patidar continued to put the bowler under pressure as he smoked Deshpande for two sixes.Green then picked up successive sixes off Thakur, who had Patidar caught at the other end but it was too late as cameos from Dinesh Kartik (14) and Glenn Maxwell (16) swelled the total.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru secure fourth and final playoff berth with 27-run victory over defending champions Chennai Super Kings.

NEW DELHI: It turned out to be a dream night for Royal Challengers Bengaluru pacer Yash Dayal as he successfully defended 17 in the last over against the mighty duo of Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni to steer his side into Indian Premier League 2024 playoffs.Dayal, who was remembered for his maligned over that saw Rinku Singh hit him for five consecutive sixes to win an improbable game last season, before tonight, rose to the occasion, bowling a perfect final over against Chennai Super Kings , knocking the defending champions out of the knockouts race.The win for RCB was their sixth on the trot as they successfully defended 218 to secure a place in the playoffs, beating CSK by 27 runs.CSK, who needed to score 201 to qualify for the playoffs, ended up scoring 191 for 7 as Dayal gave away just 7 runs in the final over of the thriller.Here's how Yash Dayal's final over turned out as he took RCB into the playoffs.Yash Dayal to MS Dhoni - SIX! As Dayal bowled a low full-toss on leg-stump, Dhoni went for a full-fledged swing and middled it to perfection. It turned out to be a mighty strike as the ball went over the fine-leg roof.Yash Dayal to MS Dhoni - OUT! After getting hit for a maximum first ball by the legend, Dayal hit back in style, getting rid of Dhoni second ball of the over. As Dayal bowled a back of the hand slower ball on the stumps, Dhoni swiped it and unfortunately only managed a top-edge. Swapnil Singh, at deep backward square-leg, got under the ball and then grabbed the catch with ease.Yash Dayal to Shardul Thakur - Dot ball! It was another back of the hand slower from Dayal and he dug it in this time. Shardul went for the hoick across and missed the ball completely. Keeper Dinesh Karthik too was alert as he denied the CSK batters a bye.Yash Dayal to Shardul Thakur - 1 run! With 11 needed off the last 3 ball, Dayal fired in another back of the hand slower ball on the stumps. As Shardul went for a slog and only managed an outside edge to third-man, he and Ravindra Jadeja managed a single off the fourth ball of the over.Yash Dayal to Ravindra Jadeja - Dot ball! With 10 needed off 2 balls, Dayal, once again relied on his slower ball and again executed to perfection, this time beating Jadeja and producing a match-winning dot ball. As Dayal fired in a back of the hand slower ball outside off, Jadeja missed the swing and the ball was inside the tramline. The dot ball meant CSK needed an almost impossible 100 off the last ball to qualify for the playoffs.Yash Dayal to Ravindra Jadeja - Dot ball! On the last ball, Dayal was just needed to bowl a legal ball to take RCB to playoffs. But the left-arm pacer did one better, bowling another dot ball to wrap up the game in style. As Jadeja swung on the final ball, Dayal slower ball once again deceived him as CSK were given the knocked out blow.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Chennai Super Kings by 27 runs. Yash Dayal bowled perfect final over against MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja. RCB will now play in Indian Premier League 2024 playoffs.

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Virat Kohli recently shared insights into his early career, highlighting two key figures who significantly contributed to his rise in international cricket.In a conversation with former cricketer Suresh Raina on JioCinema, Kohli revealed that during the 2008 Emerging Players tournament in Australia, then-chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar and Raina advocated for his inclusion in the national team.Kohli emphasized the importance of the Emerging Players tournament, which ran from 2005 to 2011, as a crucial platform for aspiring cricketers to secure a spot in the national side. Reflecting on his career, he also recalled two major ""heartbreaks"" he faced during his peak batting form in 2016.During the tournament, Kohli initially struggled while batting in the middle order under the leadership of Subramaniam Badrinath and was eventually benched. When Raina joined the tournament mid-way as captain, he inquired with coach Pravin Amre about Kohli's absence from the lineup. On Raina's insistence, Kohli was promoted to the opening spot, replacing Ajinkya Rahane. This decision marked a turning point in Kohli's performance.""That match happened against New Zealand (when he played as an opener) Dilip was our selector. One thing is that you have heard about someone, the other is that you have seen someone. That makes an different impact. You see someone play, absorb pressure etc. He saw me opening, I made 120. That is when he (Dilip) decided that more chances have to be given to me. I am very thankful to him, I told him before as well that he (Raina) pushed my name,"" said Kohli.In that tournament, Virat played six games and scored 206 runs at an average of 41.20, with a century and a fifty. His best score was 120*.That match would go on to change Virat's fortunes and he would make his international debut in August 2008 against Sri Lanka. After being in and out of the team due to the presence of seniors, it was the Emerging Players 2009 tournament that helped him establish himself as a permanent player for India. India won that tournament and Virat emerged as a top-scorer with 405 runs in nine games at an average of 50.62, with two centuries and two fifties. His best score was 115*.Speaking on one of his career's biggest heartbreaks, he revealed that not being able to win the 2016 ICC T20 World Cup and the IPL for his side was ""heartbreaking"" and the loss in the T20 WC drained him so much that he could not get out of his room.""There have been just two heartbreaks in my career, and both were in 2016. One was the T20 World Cup. I was in a space where I thought that I could do anything. The no-balls and everything, that took me a lot of time to get over I was literally drained and didn't get out of my room the next day,"" said Virat.""Then, when we lost the IPL final here (M. Chinnaswamy Stadium). We felt like that was written in the stars, from how we made it to the final. Also, the final was at our home ground. We were chasing 200-odd runs and were over 100 runs in nine overs with no loss. When AB (de Villiers) got out, we needed 68 off 42 balls with eight wickets in hand. It's like how did we lose that game?,"" he concluded.2016 was Virat's peak at batting. In 37 international matches, Virat scored 2,595 runs at an average of 86.50, with seven centuries and 13 fifties. In 15 T20Is, Virat scored 641 runs at an average of 106.83 and a strike rate of over 140, with seven fifties. His best score was 90*.Virat was also the top-scorer in the ICC T20 World Cup and won the 'Player of the Tournament' title. In five matches, he has scored 273 runs at an average of 136.50 and a strike rate of over 146, with three half-centuries. But still he could not prevent India's loss to West Indies in the semifinal.In the IPL 2016 as well, Virat emerged as the highest run-scorer and set the record for most runs in a single edition. He scored 973 runs at an average of 81.08 in 16 games, with four centuries and seven fifties. But RCB lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final by eight runs.","Virat Kohli reveals how Suresh Raina and Dilip Vengsarkar pushed for his inclusion in the India team.

NEW DELHI: Following Chennai Super Kings' 27-run defeat against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL 2024 , skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad admitted they couldn't get over the line at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.Gaikwad himself had a disappointing performance, being dismissed for a golden duck on the first ball of the second innings by Glenn Maxwell.Speaking after the match, Gaikwad acknowledged that the wicket in Bengaluru was favorable, offering good turn and grip for the spinners.He noted that the team encountered numerous challenges in the game, including the absence of key players Matheesha Pathirana and Mustafizur Rahman.Gaikwad expressed his disappointment at failing to secure a place in the IPL 2024 play-offs.""It was a good wicket. For spinners, it was turning and gripping a little bit. I was pretty happy with what the target was. To sum up the season, I'm pretty happy with seven games out of 14. Injuries, not having Conway as well--made a lot of difference. Challenges right from the first game. Pathirana got injured, and we missed Fizz as well. When you have injuries, it is difficult to balance the squad. I couldn't get over the line, but these things can happen. For me, personal milestones don't matter a lot. After all, the ultimate prize is to win. We couldn't get it, so personally, I'm slightly disappointed as well,"" Gaikwad said.Coming to the match, CSK won the toss and opted to bat first. RCB put on a fine score of 218/5 on the board, with skipper Faf Du Plessis (54 in 39 balls, with three fours and three sixes), Virat Kohli (47 in 29 balls, with three fours and four sixes) putting on a 78-run partnership, setting a fine platform for Rajat Patidar (41 in 23 balls, with two fours and four sixes) and Cameron Green (38* in 17 balls, with three fours and three sixes) to put on a 71-run stand for the third wicket.Cameos from Dinesh Karthik (14 in six balls, with a four and six) and Glenn Maxwell (16 in five balls, with two fours and a six) took RCB to a 200-run plus total.RCB needed to restrict CSK below 201 runs to qualify for the playoffs and surpass their net-run-rate.In the run chase of 219 runs and the task of scoring 201 runs at least to book the top four spot, CSK lost two wickets early and were reduced to 19/2.

Alongside Virat Kohli's 47, their partnership laid a strong foundation, leading RCB to a formidable total of 218 for five on Saturday night.Chasing a daunting target, CSK needed over 200 runs to qualify and came remarkably close, with Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja launching a fierce counterattack towards the end.CSK required 17 runs off the final over, but despite Dhoni hitting a towering six off the first ball, Dayal kept his nerves and ensured RCB's victory.""I dedicate the Man of the Match (award) to Yash Dayal! I said to him pace off on this wicket is the best option,"" Du Plessis said during the post-match presentation ceremony.""What a night! Such a great atmosphere. Just a pleasure to finish the season in front of the home fans. There was a lot of rain falling on the pitch, and you don't want that moisture. It felt like a day-five Test match in Ranchi!""Rain threat was looming on the match and there was a 40-minute rain interruption too but it didn't matter in the end.""The contributions from many batters at good strikes, I'm really proud.

Incredible.""CSK skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad said missing out on key players made a huge difference as they finished fifth in the standing.""I think it was a good wicket to be honest, it was spinning and gripping a little bit, but I think 200 on this ground was gettable. We kept losing wickets at regular intervals, it was a matter of one or two hits, sometimes that can happen in a T20 game ,"" he said.""Pretty happy with what the target was, to sum up the season, I am pretty happy to have seven wins out of 14 games. Just couldn't get over the line in the last two balls.""With the kind of injuries we had, missing out on two frontline bowlers, not having (Devon) Conway at the top of the order as well, I think missing out on three key players made a huge difference.""Talking about the spate of injuries which affected the team, Gaikwad said: ""There were many challenges for us right throughout the first game. Injury to Fizz (Mustafiur Rahman), then injruy to (Matheesha) Pathirana as well, he came back and then again Pathirana missed out. When you have injuries around, you have to get that balance in the team and pick it (the team) for every game.""I think this season sums up well where we had to tinker around with our playing XI, considering the injuries and all the illness (of the players) as well.

You prefer to have some good match practice before you go into a final, but we can't control that. We have confidence and we have played some pretty good cricket over the home and away fixtures, so we'll go in with confidence that we've played enough good cricket to make the playoffs,” he said on Saturday.“We have had lots of time to reflect on the season and look at the areas that we felt we've done very well, and we've also reflected on areas we'd still like to improve. But most importantly, we've rested, rejuvenated. These things happen during tournaments, so we've just got to make sure that we're mentally ready to execute our plans in tomorrow's important match,” added the Australian.Meanwhile, Jitesh Sharma, who will lead Punjab Kings in the absence of their stand-in skipper Sam Curran, said his team will come out all guns blazing in the final game. “Punjab Kings are known for their fearless cricket. This being our last and we have nothing to lose, we will play more fearless cricket. Everyone will play with good intent and will play for victory,” he said.Jitesh also said they were unlucky to lose a few close games in the season despite playing good cricket. ""There were a few games which we lost in the last over. There are so many positives in this tournament for us. We got Shashank (Singh), Ashutosh (Sharma) who are very good. We have bowlers who are in good form. We will play with intent,” he assured.On being asked whether the departure of English players – Curran, Jonny Bairstow and Liam Livingstone – will put the team under pressure, he said, “I don’t think so. Whoever were selected into the team, have quality. English players’ absence will give opportunity to other players and it is a good chance to test their skills.”Jitesh has been in indifferent form this season scoring only 155 runs in 11 innings. He felt that this phase will help him do better in the future. “I think I had a very good learning this year because I have seen this phase. This will motivate me.

On the next Indian striker par excellence

On possibly missing the chance of reaching the 100-goal peak in international football

KOLKATA: Sunil Chhetri is at peace with himself now. A day after announcing his retirement from international football , he woke up on Friday with 688 missed calls on his cell phone.“It isn’t easy,” he said with a smile.It was a decision driven by instinct. It was a decision taken in consultation with Indian cricket star and his friend, Virat Kohli.“I discussed with him (Kohli) because we both understand the ups and downs of a career and take the step of calling time on it,” Chhetri said during a virtual interaction with media persons from Bhubaneswar, where Igor Stimac’s India are preparing for the upcoming FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifiers.As Chhetri gets ready for his swansong in the Blue Tigers’ jersey with the clash against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on June 6, the legendary Indian with 94 goals and 150 matches opened up on his 19-year journey and more.I don’t know the exact date, but probably 10 to 15 days after the Afghanistan game (which India lost 1-2 in Guwahati in the World Cup qualifiers on March 26) I started thinking about retirement. I was fighting with myself, trying to think holistically. Eventually it came with an instinct and when it came it was so individualistic, so narrow that I was taking time and it wasn’t easy. But now I am at peace with my decision.I’m very optimistic about the future of Indian football . There is a lot of fight for different positions. When you talk about the No. 9 one, there are a lot of candidates doing well. Unfortunately, they don’t play enough games in that position in the ISL. And in due time, I hope that changes. If you take this season’s two finalists (Mumbai City and Mohun Bagan SG), Liston Colaco and Manvir Singh or Bipin Singh, Vikram Pratap (Singh) and Chhangte or (Anirudh) Thapa playing as No. 10 or Sahal (Abdul Samad)...all these attacking players are really doing well. I do understand that No. 9 is a specific one, but I’m pretty sure that with the talent we have and the structure we have, we’ll get one.I don’t feel hollow, not reaching a hundred doesn’t bother me at all. 150 games — that’s the number that I really love. Playing 150 matches will be on top of everything if I have to tell my son what I had achieved as a footballer.I’ve never paid any heed to such things earlier. But now I may be thinking more about it. A very good-looking and hard-working player — this is how I would like to be remembered as.I’ll probably do coaching licenses just to be more knowledgeable (about the game). You see all these coaches who are handsome and in one year they lose hair and everything. I don’t want to lose my hair and grow older! I’ll think (about my future role) during my sabbatical but coaching is not very higher on my agenda right now.One or two years maximum. I am with Bengaluru FC for another year.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi is expected to rejoin Inter Miami 's starting lineup on Saturday night when the Herons face DC United at home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.The Argentine superstar sat out Wednesday night's goalless draw against Orlando City due to a knee problem, marking his fifth absence from league play for the Eastern Conference leaders (8-2-4, 28 points).In the five matches without Messi, the Herons have managed only one victory and two draws. However, they remain undefeated in the nine games he has featured in, securing seven wins in the process.Messi's absence on Wednesday seemed to be more of a precautionary measure for load management. Coach Tata Martino expressed optimism about the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner's return for Saturday's match, and Messi's name was not listed on the league's player availability report released on Friday night. ""We trained well yesterday, and we hope to train well today. We will define it after training, but we are optimistic about (Saturday's) match,"" Martino said Friday, via an interpretation from Spanish by USA Today.With 10 goals and a league-leading 12 assists, Messi has been in scintillating form this season. His former FC Barcelona teammate, Luis Suarez , is among three MLS players tied for the top spot in the goalscoring charts with 11 goals.DC United's Christian Benteke , who also has 11 goals to his name, failed to find the back of the net in his team's 4-1 home defeat to the New York Red Bulls on Wednesday night. Despite missing some excellent opportunities to claim the outright lead in the goalscoring race, Benteke's chances may not have altered the outcome against the Red Bulls, who posed a consistent threat on the counter-attack.The loss marked the third occasion this season where DC (4-4-5, 17 points) have conceded three or more goals at home. ""I mean listen, I think everyone was disappointed the other night, and the things that we didn't get right, we try to address in a really short time. And I think that's just trying to identify where some of the game got away from us. And I think a lot of those things are controllables,"" DC coach Troy Lesesne said.Away from home, DC have proven to be a tough side to beat, drawing four out of six matches and securing their first road victory last weekend with a 3-2 win over Atlanta United, courtesy of Benteke's second hat trick of the campaign. The Belgian international has found the net in three of his four away appearances this season.",Lionel Messi expected to start for Inter Miami against DC United on Saturday.

Despite many Spurs fans wanting their own side to lose to prevent their north London rivals Arsenal from claiming their first title in 20 years, City had to work hard to secure the victory.Guardiola's cautious approach underscores the competitive nature of the Premier League and the necessity for City to give their all in the decisive match against West Ham.""We would like to be 3-0 up after 10 minutes but that's not going to happen,"" Guardiola said at his pre-match press conference on Friday.""I'm ready for it to be a tough, tough game.

""In those days, it was common for Kolkata's big clubs to hold trials for aspiring footballers regularly in a move to catch them young. As the head coach of Mohun Bagan 's senior football team, I was privileged to oversee such trials and recommend who would be offered a contract.""There was a diminutive guy playing as a striker in one such trial match and he caught me by surprise when he scored from a bicycle kick. The goal was straight from the page of Shyam Thapa's skill-book. 'Sign him,' I told the club management after seeing that goal,"" the former Mohun Bagan defender and coach recalled.A week later, he was signed on a three-year contract with Mohun Bagan.And this was how Sunil Chhetri 's career as a professional footballer took wing in 2002 on the famed Maidan at the age of 17 years.""He was diminutive, but his spot-jump was excellent, allowing him to beat a defender in the air and score many goals during his time at Mohun Bagan under my coaching,"" Bhattacharya pointed out.After India's World Cup qualifier against Kuwait in Kolkata this June, Chhetri in the India jersey would also be the past.Little did Bhattacharya realize during that pre-season trial in 2002 how the diminutive dynamo would explode in theIndian football landscape in the next couple of decades.

NEW DELHI: Star Indian pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty on Saturday secured a spot in the Thailand Open badminton tournament final, defeating Lu Ming-Che and Tang Kai-Wei of Chinese Taipei in straight games.The game, held at Bangkok's Nimibutr Stadium, was a quick affair as the Indian duo blew away their opponents in only 35 minutes.Chirag and Satwik, who had previously won the Asian Games gold medal, showcased their superiority over their world No. 80 opponents, winning the semifinal 21-11, 21-12.The duo has a deep relation with Thailand as it was here five years back in 2019 that they had won their maiden super 500 crown. On Saturday, the Indian pair inched closer to regaining the title after reaching the summit clash again.The Indian pair thus continued to make waves in the BWF World Tour after progressing to their fourth final of the season. The duo had finished runner-up at Malaysia super 1000 and India super 750 before claiming the French super 750 in March.In the final on Sunday, the world number three Indian duo, the top seeds in this tournament, will be up against the Chinese pair of Chen Bo Yang and Liu Yi, who defeated Kim Gi Jung and Kim Sa Rang of South Korea 21-19 21-18 in the other semifinal on Saturday.Satwik and Chirag had some low returns in the last couple of tournaments. The Indian pair lost in the second round at All England Championships and then missed the Asia Championships due to an injury to Satwik. The Thomas Cup campaign was also not too fruitful as they lost a couple of narrow matches to top pairs. The final appearance will thus provide a major boost ahead of the Paris Olympics.On Saturday, Satwik and Chirag were not really tested by Lu and Tang, who played well only in patches but lacked the aggression and accuracy to trouble the Indians, who were a cut above their rivals.In the opening game, Satwik and Chirag were up 3-0 but the Taiwanese pair managed to make it 5-4 before they started leaking points. Errors crept into their game as they went long a number of times, allowing the Indians to enter the break with an 11-7 lead.Things didn't change after resumption as the Indians continued to gather point with their sharp placements. At 17-10, Chirag produced a powerpacked smash as they gained nine game points when the Chinese went out twice.The second game began on a close note as the two pairs moves 4-4 to 6-6. Satwik also produced an ambitious behind-the-back return only to spray it wide. Leading 9-7 for the first time in the match, Lu and Tang, however, couldn't sustain the pressure as a fast and long rally ended at the nets for the Chinese.With Lu and Tang continuing to find the going tough, it was 15-10 in favour of the Indians, who grabbed 8 match points when the Chinese made another soft error at the net.Chirag then stood at the front court and sealed it with a barrage of fast returns.In the women's doubles, the fourth-seeded Indian pair of Tanisha Carsto and Ashwini Ponnappa will face top seeds Jongkolphan Kititharakul and Rawinda Prajongjai of Thailand in the semifinals later on Saturday.","Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty beat Lu Ming-Che and Tang Kai-Wei of Chinese Taipei 21-11, 21-12.
