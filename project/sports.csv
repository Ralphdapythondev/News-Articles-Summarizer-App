MIAMI: When Imad Wasim lost his way to the press-conference room at Broward Park, it was, in a way, metaphorical. That's exactly how his team Pakistan went about in this World Cup - losing two matches against the United States and India, both from winning positions.A win against Canada was not enough and even before they play Ireland at Broward Park here, their fate had been sealed.""It's definitely the lowest point for Pakistan in my career,"" Imad, who has been playing for the country for quite a decade now, said.The allrounder, who has played under quite a few coaches and has experienced the fluctuating fortunes of the nation on the field, feels that in Pakistan, a change of personnel won't really make for a big change.""It has to be the mindset. We have to change the mindset. We are playing our cricket , we cannot be scared to lose all the time. The game is changing and we will have to deal with it. As far as I am concerned, playing fire with fire is the way to go,"" Imad said, looking extremely disappointed.Constant questions kept coming up about what exactly went wrong, but the player, who had come back from retirement to play this tournament, didn't want to single out anybody for the early exit.""When a team wins, it is a collective effort. When the team loses, it is also a collective effort. There is no point blaming one person for the debacle,"" Imad said.Pakistan have been on a downward curve for a while now. While they had crashed out of the ODI World Cup in India a few months ago after losing to Afghanistan, the defeat to USA here was definitely one bitter pill to swallow. ""Yes, you can say that the loss to the USA was unacceptable. We should not have lost,"" Imad, who missed that game due to an injury, said.But the discussions seemed to surround more on the defeat to India, a game which Pakistan controlled for most parts, only to lose in the last five overs. Imad, too, was held responsible for the defeat, because he could not translate his form in franchise cricket and failed to get big runs off Axar Patel in the 16th over.""Yes, I am sorry I couldn't do it. They bowled really well as well, but it's true that we should have won that game,"" the 35-year-old said.","Imad Wasim says Pakistan's World Cup exit is the lowest point in his career.

All-rounder Imad Wasim isn't shying away from admitting that the Pakistan team was at fault and committed mistakes that led to a sorry group-stage exit at the ongoing T20 World Cup , but he urged the fans and media to understand that the players too are humans.The washed-out Group A match between co-hosts USA and Ireland in Florida put Pakistan out of the race to 'Super 8s' and helped tournament debutants USA to make a historic entry into the next stage of the showpiece T20 event.In effect, however, it's the US team that knocked out Pakistan with their upset win over Babar Azam & Co in their campaign opener.It followed the match against archrivals India, where Pakistan let a win slip out of their hands and lost by six runs. Ever since that game, the team has been lambasted by Pakistan media, former players and on social media.""A bad thing has happened, but who knows it might be a blessing in disguise. It (the T20 World Cup flop) should be revisited...(we need to) play white-ball cricket the way it should be played,"" said Imad while addressing the media in the US.Talking in context of the heavyset wicketkeeper-batsman Azam Khan, the allrounder said that he has never body-shamed anyone and never talked about individuals.""As far as you said about me being an analyst as well, I have always talked only about cricket,"" said Imad. ""I haven't talked about individuals, neither have I body-shamed anyone nor talked personally about that person. A cricketer's job is to analyse cricket and to tell you whatever is going wrong and whatever is going right...""""It happens during group stages, there are other teams who have been eliminated...There is a lot of disappointment. We are disappointed more than you guys because this is our profession...It's all about how you get up and approach the world after falling, how do you react,"" he added.Concluding his reply to a journalist's question, Imad, who was alleged to be playing the tournament with an injury, requested everyone to not take out the human element while doing a post-mortem of the team's performance.""We want to tell the Pakistan public that we couldn't perform, and we are the ones to be blamed. Ek baat ye bhi kehna chahunga. Hum bhi insaan hain, humse bhi galti ho sakti hai aur dukh humein bhi hota hai iss cheez ka (want to say one thing; we too are humans and can commit mistakes, we are also hurt by this performance).",Imad Wasim says Pakistan team was at fault and committed mistakes that led to a sorry group-stage exit at the ongoing T20 World Cup.

INDIA-CANADA GAME CALLED OFF DUE TO WET OUTFIELD

MIAMI: Hardik Pandya has endured a lot in recent times. It all started with an injury in the ODI World Cup which cost him his T20 captaincy. That was followed by a disastrous million-dollar move to Mumbai Indians which led to internal rift in the team and reportedly, some not-too-happy vibes with Rohit Sharma .The horrible show in the IPL by the five-time champions didn't help. Hardik's own performances were poor as well. His personal life, too, allegedly went for a toss. Question marks were raised about his inclusion in the team for the T20 World Cup. The BCCI , however, kept the faith in the star allrounder and now, slowly, Hardik is finding his mojo just when it matters the most.In the three World Cup games so far, Pandya has registered figures of 2-24, 3-27 and 2-14, albeit all in extremely favourable conditions.However, he has shown the happy knack of bowling the difficult overs, the 17th against Pakistan being a case in point.Team India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey was particularly happy with the way Hardik kept trying even when the chips were down.""I'm definitely sure about one thing, he has confidence in his ability. Sometimes there's no rhythm in a tournament (IPL), sometimes, even if you try, the rhythm doesn't come, it takes time…that was a phase where the rhythm didn't come,"" Mhambrey said.While Hardik did his bit to get his rhythm back, there's somebody else who also deserves a bit of credit - his captain Rohit. His personal differences with Hardik following the batter's ouster as MI captain has been speculated on every platform, but when it came to choosing the Indian team, Rohit kept all that aside.He knew four allrounders would be his best bet in the World Cup, and for that he needed Hardik to deliver.""Four allrounders allow me the flexibility and in all probability, we are going to stick to that,"" Rohit had said before India's game against Pakistan.Hardik, too, knew this could be his last chance, and that pushed him to go 100 % in every training session, a fact lauded by Mhambrey. ""It would have been worrisome if he hadn't put in the hard work. But we noticed that despite the difficult times, his work ethic never took a beating. He kept bowling a lot and that meant the rhythm would return, especially when he understands his own bowling so well,"" Mhambrey said.Despite going for runs in IPL, Hardik tried bowling difficult overs, even after being taken apart quite brutally by MS Dhoni . But as Mhambrey pointed out, it was the confidence in his own ability that stood the allrounder in good stead. ""If you compare his rhythm in the IPL and the rhythm now, you can see he has got it back,"" Mhambrey added.Once the bowling bit is sorted, Hardik needs to score a few runs with the bat as well.India are now moving to the West Indies, where the conditions will be more favourable for the batters compared to the United States. All the team needs from him is a couple of cameos over the next five games and Hardik could well become one of the heroes of this World Cup.The crowds had come in, the enthusiasm was there, but the rains that south Florida had endured over the last few days was good enough for India's last group game against Canada to be called off at Broward Park.It didn't rain on Saturday, but the Friday afternoon downpour that had washed out USA's game against Ireland had damaged the outfield so much that India's game couldn't be started despite the best efforts of the groundsmen. India finished on top in Group A. They will now face Afghanistan in the Super-8 stage in Barbados on June 20.",Troubled seam-bowling allrounder seems to have laid all controversies to rest.

India's T20 World Cup match against Canada abandoned due to wet outfield,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/indias-t20-world-cup-match-against-canada-abandoned-due-to-wet-outfield/articleshow/111025366.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's plans to further fine-tune their Super Eight preparations were disrupted by the adverse weather, which washed out their match against Canada on Saturday. Despite this, they head to the Caribbean brimming with confidence after a strong performance in the T20 World Cup group stages.The final Group A game between India and Canada was called off without a single ball bowled due to wet conditions on the field. Both teams received one point each, with India topping Group A with seven points. The USA, with five points, also advanced, while Canada finished third with three points.A significant confidence boost for India comes from the impressive performance of their fast bowlers in the group matches. Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya, and Mohammed Siraj collectively took 20 wickets.They had the advantage of a challenging, double-paced drop-in pitch at the Nassau County stadium. However, they will have more traditional surfaces in the West Indies for the rest of the tournament.Nevertheless, if their performances in New York are any indication, their opponents have plenty to worry about. The Indian pacers displayed technical skill and a deep understanding of the conditions, effectively capitalizing on what was available.Arshdeep Singh particularly stood out. His delivery to trap USA’s Shayan Jahangir with a ball swinging in from over the wicket and a short-pitched ball that troubled Andries Gous showcased his adaptability and skill.These deliveries could potentially get wickets on any pitch, highlighting Arshdeep's prowess.Another positive sign for India is the form shown by their key batsmen, including skipper Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant, and Suryakumar Yadav. Both Rohit and Suryakumar had a subdued IPL 2024 campaign but showed glimpses of their potential here, which they hope to build on in the Super Eight.In contrast, Rishabh Pant had a good run in the IPL, and many were keen to see how he would perform in a high-stakes environment. Pant exceeded expectations, showcasing his trademark stand-and-deliver flicks, innovative scoops, and one-handed smashes.Behind the wickets, Pant was equally impressive, displaying acrobatics with his dives, runs, and leaps to make catches and stops.Hardik Pandya, who was portrayed as a ""silent villain"" on social media during a lackluster IPL while leading the Mumbai Indians, seemed to find his rhythm in the World Cup. Although his batting hasn't peaked yet, his bowling was impactful, troubling batters with his pace and variations.However, not all aspects of the team are in perfect shape. The spinners, except for Axar Patel, received limited game time during the group stages due to the nature of the pitch.Axar bowled six overs across three matches, taking three wickets. Ravindra Jadeja bowled only three overs against Ireland and Pakistan, and did not bowl against the USA.Other spinners in the squad, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal, will enter the Super Eight without having played in the group stages. They might have had some game time had the match against Canada taken place.This lack of game time for the spinners might pose a challenge as the pitches in the West Indies are expected to be more spinner-friendly progressively.However, this Indian squad has repeatedly shown their ability to handle pressure situations with ease. They will need to rely on this resilience as they compete in the Super Eight in the Caribbean.","The final Group A game between India and Canada was called off without a single ball bowled due to wet conditions on the field.

I see him as a Test and 50-over captain. In those two formats in which he excels as a player. In T20 cricket, his game is very good, a pure player, but he is not up there with the top 15 batters in the world in T20 cricket. I think there are better players than him up the order,"" Vaughan said on Cricbuzz""But I don't want them to change it (captain) again. You assume they got to have some consistency. There's no point changing once again. Even if he is not perfectly suited to captain in T20 cricket, I do think for this period, its worth him staying consistent because the last thing Pakistan need is a bit more kamikaze, swapping in and changing and overreacting. I think most Pakistan fans will be realistic with this team's performance. They have actually not got a great team, at the minute, on paper, its just not a very good team. Its down to the coaches, selectors and the system back in Pakistan to try and give those in power (captain and coaches) to choose a pool of players,"" he added.Pakistan are set to host Champions Trophy in 2025 and there are calls for a major shake-up in the team and the management.Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi -- who is also the country's interior minister -- recently said changes were imminent.""Pakistan team needs a major surgery,"" he told local media after the India defeat.""We must endeavour to make the Pakistani cricket team one of the best in the world.

His response was, 'If you play well, that's all the money and reward I need',"" Khan was quoted as saying by Ariana News.Jadeja was brought on board as a mentor just before the tournament started in India.Under his guidance, Afghanistan managed to secure remarkable victories against former world champions England and Pakistan as well as a strong Bangladesh team.Their run, however, ended after Glenn Maxwell's extraordinary double century.The 53-year-old Jadeja had an excellent cricketing career, playing 196 ODIs for India. He scored 5,359 runs at an average of 37.47, including six hundreds and 30 fifties.In addition to his ODI career, Jadeja represented India in 15 Test matches between 1992 and 2000, accumulating 576 runs at an average of 26.18, with his highest score being 96.Jonathan Trott, the head coach of Afghanistan during the World Cup, credited Jadeja for the team's outstanding performance, which helped them shed their 'minnows' tag.","Jadeja was brought on board as a mentor just before the tournament started in India.

There was no rain on the match day but the heavy showers the day before yesterday left the outfield in no condition for the USA vs Ireland match to take place.Seeing two back-to-back abandoned games, legendary Gavaskar and former England skipper Michael Vaughan criticised the ICC -- cricket's global governing body and tournament organisers -- for not having enough covers to cover the entire ground.""You just can't cover the pitch and let the other parts of the ground get wet,"" said Gavaskar on Star Sports after demanding ICC not to schedule matches at venues that do not have enough covers.The ongoing T20 World Cup in the Americas (hosted jointly by USA and the Caribbean) has had its fair share of rain interruptions and matches getting affected due to that.Three abandoned matches, a no result and a few truncated games due to rain and wet outfields have resulted in questions being raised over the arrangements.There have been multiple occasions, in America and the Caribbean, when amid rain only the centre square has been covered with the outfield left to soak in water.Already out of the T20 World Cup, Pakistan and Ireland are scheduled to play in Florida on Sunday and it will be interesting to see whether ICC gets into action regarding the covers situation.Also what ICC does for the remainder of the tournament in rain situations will also be closely monitored.","Team India's final Group A game against Canada was abandoned in Florida without even a toss taking place in the T20 World Cup on Saturday.

The tournament has seen some surprises, including the defeat of top seed Jessica Pegula, which has opened up the draw significantly.""For me today it was just about trying my best to stay in the present moment. She has a great serve, my focus was just to get the ball back into the court on return,"" Andreescu said after the match.""Staying mentally tough was key today.""The match was punctuated by two lengthy rain breaks, causing both players to struggle with consistency in the early stages.

She solidified her lead with a love service game, taking advantage of multiple mistakes from Osaka.Andreescu then clinched the first set 6-4 in 40 minutes, using heavily sliced drop shots to disrupt Osaka's rhythm.However, Osaka made a strong comeback in the second set. She broke Andreescu's first service game with a crosscourt forehand drive on break point and quickly moved to a 3-0 lead.A double fault from Andreescu handed Osaka a double break, allowing her to complete the second set 6-3 with a service winner.Their only previous encounter was also a three-set thriller in Beijing in 2019. The third set here at 's-Hertogenbosch was equally tense.Andreescu, energized and determined, broke Osaka's serve in the sixth game, impressing the crowd with her retrieval skills and inventive spins.As Andreescu served for the match, Osaka fought back with a break of her own, leading to a final set tie-break.In the tie-break, both players had opportunities, but Andreescu kept her composure. Osaka made several unforced errors, including a backhand into the net on match point.Osaka has historically not performed her best on grass, with her Grand Slam victories coming on hard courts at the US Open and Australian Open.However, she has shown potential to be a contender at Wimbledon this year as she makes her return after giving birth to her daughter.Osaka recently had a match point against eventual French Open winner Iga Swiatek in the second round, posing one of the toughest challenges for the world number one on the Paris clay.","Former world number one Naomi Osaka loses in three-set thriller to Canadian Bianca Andreescu.

From here on, though, the battle will get tougher as the co-hosts start their Super 8 campaign against South Africa in Antigua .The South Africans may be the stronger and more fancied team but USA vice-captain Aaron Jones promises that USA will not be the whipping boys of the competition.""We will not be easy to beat. Of course, the fight gets tough from here but we know we can beat the best,"" Jones told TOI.Not many gave USA a chance going into the World Cup but the team always had the belief they could do well. ""From the time we knew that the World Cup would be played at home, we believed we could go far. There was never any shortage of confidence in our camp,"" Jones said.It was primarily their win against Pakistan that was the stepping stone for their entry into the last-eight stage. It will create more buzz around the team, something that the team is desperately looking for as it tries to carve a place in the super-competitive sports market of the USA.""It's a big thing for us, and not just us, but the fans and the younger generation in America.

We would love to play more cricket against the full member nations, that's where we're going to test ourselves best against the best in the world,"" Jones said.Elaborating on the need for cricket being played in schools, Jones said that it's a must across ""all the states of the country"". American football, basketball, baseball and soccer are the most favoured options among the youth, but cricket needs to find its way to make it big.""This is very important because then the youth will understand what the sport is all about. And if they like cricket, they'll get their friends to come and play, their family to watch, and that will create interest in the game.""A credible show by USA in the Super 8s will only strengthen their case for that final push.",USA vice-captain Aaron Jones promises that USA will not be the whipping boys of the competition.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's recent run of single-digit scores in the ongoing T20 World Cup doesn't worry India's batting coach Vikram Rathour . The coach emphasized that Kohli has been performing exceptionally well in practice sessions and is more motivated than ever as the Super Eight approaches.Despite being the highest run-scorer in the IPL, Kohli has managed to score only 1, 4, and 0 in his recent matches against Ireland, Pakistan, and USA, respectively.When asked about Kohli's form in the post-match media conference after the game against Canada was washed out in Florida, Rathour had his response ready.""I love it when every time I come there is a question about Virat Kohli, whether he is doing well or not. No concern at all, no concern at all,"" Rathour said.""He (Kohli) has been batting superbly from the tournament that he came from (IPL). Couple of dismissals here, doesn't change anything, he is batting really well.""Rathour expressed confidence that India's top batter will deliver when it matters the most.""Actually, it's good that he is a little hungrier, he is really keen to do well and really switched on. It's a good space to be as a batsman, I think.""Looking forward to some good games and we've watched some good innings from him.""The batting coach sidestepped questions about the team's strategy of playing four all-rounders, including Shivam Dube and Axar Patel , suggesting flexibility based on conditions.""Again, we need to be a flexible team. We need to look at the conditions that are in front of us and be ready to deal with those. So as a team, we are going to be really flexible, I think.""We'll react to what (conditions) we get on the day. We have enough sources in our team to deal with any kind of conditions,"" Rathour explained.He acknowledged that some game time in Florida ahead of the Super Eights would have been beneficial.""But if the game had happened that would have really helped us. We were really looking forward to playing a game, to play a good game of cricket. There's always a concern when you play a game in conditions like this that some injury can happen.""You're already in Super 8 and that's the last thing (injury) you want to happen before you enter the serious part of the tournament.""Rathour noted that the tight schedule of the Super Eight, with little time between games, is not ideal but manageable.""Again, not ideal. It would have been great if we could have gotten a game today. But now this is what it is. So, we look forward to having a couple of good practice days in Barbados and getting into the game. So again, now the matches will happen simultaneously after one day.""So, as a team I think we are ready. We are used to this kind of schedule. We have done it in the past and I am sure we will do it really well this time as well.""He also commented on the issue of the ground in Florida not being fully covered, raising concerns to the ICC.""This question should be asked to the ICC people. I won't be able to answer that. I don't know the reason why it was not covered and why it didn't have enough covers to cover the whole ground.""If they would have covered it, definitely that would have helped. But now it's not there and this is what we've got.""Regarding the challenging New York drop-in strip, Rathour downplayed its impact on the team's performance.""It's good. You should be able to play on all types of wickets. We have the skills to play in all types of conditions and do well. So, we have got the difficult wickets.Hopefully, we will get good wickets in the tournament.""And if we get turning wickets, we have 4 spin options, we have enough fast bowlers as well. So, whichever conditions come, I think we are really equipped to deal with that,"" he added.","Vikram Rathour says Virat Kohli has been performing exceptionally well in practice sessions.

The latter then doubled the advantage just before halftime with a stunning curling effort from outside the box.Hungary managed to pull one back in the 66th minute when Barnabas Varga stooped low to head Dominik Szoboszlai's curling cross into the bottom corner.This sparked a desperate attempt to get back into the game, but the Swiss remained resolute and sealed the win when substitute Embolo took advantage of a mistake in stoppage time.Switzerland, aiming to reach the knockout stages in their sixth consecutive major tournament, displayed a polished performance. They were composed and well-organised in defence, and swift in attack, with Granit Xhaka orchestrating the play and Dan Ndoye causing constant problems for the Hungarian backline.Coach Murat Yakin's decision to recall Aebischer and Duah to the Switzerland side proved to be a masterstroke, as Aebischer played a pivotal role in several first-half attacks that exposed the weaknesses in the Hungarian defense.Hungary's start to their third consecutive Euros was underwhelming, especially considering their impressive run of 14 matches unbeaten that had only recently come to an end. They had the first opportunity of the game in the ninth minute when Attila Fiola squared the ball to Roland Sallai, who blasted his shot over the bar.The Hungarians, who reached the round of 16 in 2016 and were eliminated in the group stage of Euro 2020, improved in the second half and briefly rallied after scoring.However, the Swiss maintained their composure, with Xhaka and Ndoye creating good chances late on before Embolo calmly lifted the ball over the keeper to secure the third goal.",Switzerland beat Hungary 3-1 in their opening Euro 2024 qualifier in Cologne.

His impact was immediate, as he scored twice and provided an assist, highlighting his ability to influence the game's outcome.The first goal came as a result of a fortuitous mistake by the Guatemalan goalkeeper, who misplaced a pass directly to Messi, allowing the Argentine superstar to coolly slot the ball into an open net from 12 yards out.This early equalizer set the tone for Argentina's dominance.Messi's creative brilliance was on full display in the 38th minute when his incisive pass released Valentin Carboni into the penalty area, leading to a foul and a subsequent penalty kick, which Lautaro Martinez converted to give Argentina the lead.The second half witnessed Messi's continued influence as he orchestrated Argentina's third goal.

After a slick give-and-go with Angel di Maria, Messi deftly chipped the ball over the Guatemalan goalkeeper, showcasing his composure in front of goal.While Guatemala managed to take a surprise early lead through an own goal, their resistance was short-lived as Argentina's quality and Messi's individual brilliance proved too much to overcome.With Argentina preparing to face Canada in their group play opener next Thursday, Messi's display against Guatemala has undoubtedly instilled a sense of optimism and belief within the team and their supporters.

Their clinical finishing and relentless attacking play left Scotland with no respite, as the visitors failed to register a single shot on or off target throughout the match.For Scotland, who were making their second consecutive appearance at the European Championship under coach Steve Clarke, the defeat was a harsh reality check. They now face an uphill battle to progress from the group stage for the first time in a major tournament, with their next match against Switzerland on Wednesday taking on added significance.Germany, on the other hand, will look to build on this impressive start when they face Hungary in their second Group A encounter on Wednesday.

I feel more calm with the plan I have and just really grateful to be back,"" said Osaka, attributing her good form to being ""more comfortable returning and accepting mistakes as they come.""The first set remained on serve until the sixth game, with both players struggling to adapt to the windy conditions.Osaka then seized control, breaking Lamens' serve with a series of powerful shots from both wings, aided by unforced errors from the Dutchwoman. More mistakes from Lamens in her next service game handed Osaka the first set 6-2 in just 26 minutes.Osaka continued her dominance at the start of the second set, breaking Lamens' first service game with a string of winners to take a 3-0 lead. The match concluded as Lamens hit another groundstroke into the net.Despite admitting that grass is not her preferred surface, with her four Grand Slam titles coming on the hard courts of the US and Australian Opens, Osaka appears to be gradually regaining the form that once took her to the top of the world rankings.She has never advanced beyond the third round at Wimbledon but recently pushed eventual French Open champion Iga Swiatek to match point in the second round, the toughest challenge the world number one faced on the Parisian clay.","Former world number one Naomi Osaka beats Suzan Lamens in straight sets.
