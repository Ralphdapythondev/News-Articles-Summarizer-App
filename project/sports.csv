EXPLAINED: Why Bangladesh batsman Shakib Al Hasan is holding a band between his teeth while batting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/explained-why-bangladesh-batsman-shakib-al-hasan-is-holding-a-band-between-his-teeth-while-batting/articleshow/113540127.cms,"Former Bangladesh captain and veteran allrounder is using an interesting technique to get his stance and head position right while batting in the first Test against India at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.Images of a thin black band clenched between his teeth while facing up to a bowler have been doing the rounds on social media, leading to the question what makes Shakib do that.Former India opener Aakash Chopra , who is also doing commentary in the two-match Test series, explained the reason when a batsman can attempt such unique corrective measures.""While (the left-handed Shakib) is in his stance, he keeps pushing his head inwards, almost towards mid-on. Why he's doing this is because somebody must have told him that he can do this to address the problem of his head falling over, which leads to the front foot going in the same direction (towards mid-off). If that happens, then your batting gets disturbed,"" explained the 47-year-old Chopra, who played 10 Tests.""So that thread or band he is holding in his teeth is at its peak tension when his head is inwards. He is trying to keep his head as close as possible to his right shoulder so that it doesn't go to the other side, and it helps in keeping the front foot straighter,"" said Chopra.""One other thing he has added with this is changing his trigger movement, which normally happens with the feet (while playing a delivery).""Chopra reckons Shakib has taken a leaf out of former India captain and coach Rahul Dravid's book.""Dravid (right-handed batsman) tried something similar (but not with any band), as he always tried to keep his head closer to his left shoulder. If your head is on your leading shoulder as a batsman, then your front foot movement is straighter. That's what Shakib is doing.""",Bangladesh batsman Shakib Al Hasan is using an unusual technique to get his stance and head position right while batting in the first Test against India.

Wish I could be him: Spin partner Ashwin

Ashwin and Jadeja

CHENNAI: Amid the euphoria of Ravichandran Ashwin 's century, a performance that went slightly under the radar was that of Ravindra Jadeja 's. Had the 35-year-old completed his fifth Test century on Friday morning, the spotlight would have been on him, but the new ball and morning dampness got the better of his defence as he fell 14 short of the milestone.But Jadeja has an ability to take small disappointments in his stride.""Yes, I got out today, but that's part and parcel of the game,"" Jadeja said with a smile after dismissing the two Bangladesh batters Litton Das and Shakib Al Hassan who looked set in the middle.The Chennai Super Kings player, who calls the MA Chidambaram Stadium his home, is four short of the 300-wicket mark, a significant milestone for any bowler. ""Yes, it's a good opportunity for me to get there tomorrow,"" Jadeja said.India have won the last 17 Test series at home and it's the Ashwin-Jadeja combo that has played a massive role in the success. While they have won numerous Test matches with the ball, this Chennai Test will probably be remembered for their 199-run batting partnership that destroyed Bangladesh in one-and-a-half sessions.""Jaddu is one cricketer who has evolved so nicely. I always envy him, I have made that amply clear. He is so gifted and talented and has found ways to maximize his potential. I wish I could be him but I am glad I am myself,"" Ashwin said after the day's play.When they bowl together, Ashwin is the one who experiments while Jadeja's strength is to keep repeating the same thing for hours. ""He keeps it really simple and can repeat it day in, day out. He is just an exceptional cricketer,"" the 516-wicket man said.The secret of the Ashwin-Jadeja combo is the fact that they both enjoy each other's success, with the bat and with the ball. Ashwin had said on Thursday how Jadeja helped him as he moved towards his century, but Jadeja feels ""Ashwin doesn't need any advice"".""I was just talking to him that we are not going to make errors because the wicket was good and we were batting well. Well played to him, a brilliant knock at his home ground,"" Jadeja said.Both are towards the back-end of their careers and have gone through different phases. As Jadeja became India's No. 1 spinner abroad, Ashwin had to come to terms with the fact that it's the left-hander's batting that gave him the advantage.Ashwin, though, has more Test centuries than Jadeja, but a muchevolved Chennai man acknowledged that he has learnt a lot from his colleague's batting.""Watching him bat over the last couple of years has given me insight on how I can be better. Both of us have grown together, and have done some special things. We really value one another at this stage and both of us are enjoying each other's success more than ever before,"" Ashwin said.For the duo, the MA Chidambaram Stadium pitch over the weekend will be a perfect stage to make their Chennai fans happy, probably for one last time in Test cricket .",India have won the last 17 Test series at home.

His fighting yet aggressive ton in the first innings of the opening Test against Bangladesh was further proof that Ashwin is among the top echelon of players in the longest format.So how does he continue to remain at the elite level and excel on the international stage? Ashwin, speaking after the conclusion of the second day's play at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday, came up with a crisp but powerful response.""I used to be critical (about myself). I had put a lot of pressure on myself and people had put pressure on me. I used to be happy about it. But it is not like that anymore,"" said Ashwin, whose 113 placed India on top and delighted the home crowd.""The most important thing for me is to enjoy my cricket. I want to play cricket with a smile on my face. Four or five years ago, I had promised myself that I will not respond to anyone. I had promised myself that I will play for my happiness. I have been maintaining that promise till now,"" added Ashwin, one of the driving forces behind India's near-invincible home record in Tests over the last 10 years or so.Ashwin has ""embraced"" the tough challenges that have come his way.

He took the task head-on and ensured the visitors had no avenue to mount more pressure.""As a cricketer, the pride is in the performance. You want to win and you play the game for that. I do enjoy pressure, there is no doubt about it,"" said Ashwin. ""That is one of the reasons I love playing this sport. It gives you opportunities to respond when you are pushed to a corner.

NEW DELHI: Batting maestro Virat Kohli couldn't help but lighten the mood with a hilarious remark aimed at Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan during the second day of the first Test in Chennai.Kohli found himself at the crease early in the second innings, just like the first, as India lost two quick wickets in the form of skipper Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal within the first seven overs.Following the departure of the openers, Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill steadied the innings, helping India surpass the 50-run mark. However, Kohli’s stay at the crease was brief; he scored just 17 runs before being adjudged LBW to Mehidy Hasan Miraz in the 20th over. Kohli’s innings consisted of 37 balls, marking another early exit for the experienced batsman.The incident occurred during India's second innings when Kohli was at the non-striker's end. The stump mic captured Kohli humorously referring to Shakib Al Hasan as 'Malinga,' a nod to the former Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga , who was famous for his exceptional yorkers .Kohli's remark came as Shakib consistently delivered a series of effective yorkers, showcasing his bowling prowess and adding a light-hearted moment to the match.Kohli joked, “Tu Malinga bana hua hai, Yorker pe Yorker de raha hai!” This playful comment not only showcased Kohli's wit but also highlighted Shakib's impressive bowling performance, reminiscent of the legendary Malinga known for his deadly yorkers.Shakib, who has been a standout player for Bangladesh, took the comment in good humour, reflecting the sportsmanship that characterises cricket.","Virat Kohli made a hilarious remark aimed at Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan during the second day of the first Test in Chennai.

(The writer is a Mumbai based tech entrepreneur and a chess enthusiast)

The 45th FIDE Chess Olympiad in Budapest has been a showcase of India's rising dominance in the chess world, with both their men's and women's teams displaying exceptional performance. However, China's decision-making regarding their lineup has raised eyebrows among chess enthusiasts and analysts.India's open team has been the story of the tournament, maintaining a perfect 16/16 score after eight rounds.The team, led by young prodigies like Gukesh Dommaraju and Arjun Erigaisi , has not lost a single game out of 32 played. Their latest victory, a 3.5-0.5 win against Iran, further solidified their position at the top of the leaderboard.Gukesh's performance on board one has been particularly noteworthy. He leads the race for individual gold on the top board, ahead of even Magnus Carlsen. Arjun Erigaisi, playing on board three, has been equally impressive, winning seven out of eight games and reaching a live rating of 2792.While India soars, China's strategy has come under scrutiny. The defending world champion, Ding Liren , has been conspicuously absent from the Chinese lineup in recent rounds. This decision has perplexed many, especially considering the upcoming World Championship match between Ding and Gukesh.Speculation suggests that China is holding back Ding to prevent him from revealing his preparation for the World Championship. However, this strategy may be costing China valuable points in the Olympiad.In a crucial match against India, where China needed a win, they opted to field Wei Yi against Gukesh on the top board instead of Ding. This decision backfired as Gukesh managed to grind out a win in the endgame against Wei Yi. The absence of Ding, the incumbent World Champion, from board one in such a critical match goes against the usual norm and has been a topic of much debate.In the women's section, Poland has once again proven to be India's nemesis. Just as in the 2022 Olympiad, Poland handed India their first defeat, winning the match 2.5-1.5. This result has created a three-way tie for first place between India, Poland, and Kazakhstan, all with 14 match points.The match was a nail-biter, with Poland's victory secured by IM Alina Kashlinskaya's win over GM Harika Dronavalli on the top board. Despite IM Divya Deshmukh's win for India, a last-minute mistake by IM Vantika Agrawal allowed Poland to clinch the match.With three rounds to go, the tournament is wide open in both sections. In the open category, India will face a stern test against Uzbekistan in the next round, a rematch of their crucial encounter from the 2022 Olympiad. Uzbekistan, along with Hungary, is breathing down India's neck, just two points behind.In the women's section, the upcoming round will see Poland take on Kazakhstan, while India faces the United States - another team that defeated them in 2022.Several players have stood out with exceptional individual performances. In the open section, Arjun Erigaisi's dominant run has caught everyone's attention. In the women's section, 17-year-old Eman Sawan from Palestine has won all seven of her games, with her performance rating calculated at an impressive 2631.As the 45th FIDE Chess Olympiad enters its final stages, all eyes will be on India to see if they can maintain their perfect run in the open section and bounce back in the women's. Meanwhile, China's strategy with Ding Liren will continue to be a point of interest, especially as it may impact their final standing in the tournament.The Olympiad has once again proven to be a thrilling showcase of chess talent from around the world, with emerging stars and established champions alike contributing to a memorable event. As we head into the final rounds, the chess world eagerly anticipates the crowning of the new Olympiad champions.","India's open team has been the story of the tournament, maintaining a perfect 16/16 score after eight rounds.

leaves an impression

CHENNAI: Midway through the second session at the MA Chidambaram Stadium , a young crop of Bangladeshi journalists got busy in a discussion about the nearest tourist spots around Chennai. Much like the captain of the Bangladesh team, Najmul Hossain Shanto, this group of scribes had thought, leading into the Test, that Bangladesh could stretch India to five days.By the end of Friday’s action in Chennai, it was crystal clear that post lunch on Sunday, they are in for a mini-vacation before the Kanpur Test.The hint of fight that the Bangladeshi pacers showed on Thursday slowly dissipated into an abject capitulation of the batting unit against an Indian attack which didn't give an inch.The class of Jasprit Bumrah (4/50) has been way too much to handle for even the best batters in world cricket in recent times, and the brittle Bangladeshi batting lineup merely added a footnote to the long list.After being bowled out for 149 in their first innings, Bangladesh conceded a lead of 227, which left fans in Chennai with tickets for Saturday's play ecstatic. The party mood was sullied just a bit late in the day by the back-to-back failures of Rohit Sharma (5) and Virat Kohli (17).Kohli, though, had got an inside edge as he missed a flick off off-spinnner Mehidy Hasan Miraz to be adjudged leg-before, but strangely he didn't ask for a referral.At stumps, entertainers Rishabh Pant (batting 12) and Shubman Gill (batting 33) were at the crease, the lead already going to 308 with seven wickets still in play. While the first half of the morning session didn't go as planned for India, with Ravindra Jadeja (86) missing out on a deserved century, the rest of the day was a master-versus-novice mismatch.That Bumrah (4/50) would be dangerous was a foregone conclusion. What made it a difficult watch for those who were looking forward to some competition was the lack of application of the Bangladeshi batters.The procession started in the first session itself when left-hander Shadman Islam shouldered arms to Bumrah bowling around the wicket and was bowled. The bounce and the movement that Bumrah generated from good length accounted for Mushfiqur Rahim, who edged one to slip, while the tail was merely cannon fodder.While Bumrah was doing what he usually does, it was Bengal pacer Akash Deep's spell that left a mark. It's true that left-handers Zakir Hasan and Mominul Haque aren't exactly big-league material, but Akash Deep hit the right length from the word go. The 27-year-old — who is very much in the reckoning for a berth in the Test squad for the Australia series — got the ball to cut back enough and to dismiss Mominul and Zakir as Bangladesh were reduced to 22-3 before lunch.Bangladesh paceman Taskin Ahmed acknowledged that the batting left a lot to be desired. But he felt that the SG ball, too, played its part in the Bangladesh capitulation. “The Indian players are used to playing with the SG ball. It does quite a bit in the first 10 overs and we probably were unable to adapt. A better performance was expected from our batters,” he said.With the back of the Bangladesh batting well and truly broken in the first session itself, it was on Litton Das and Shakib Al Hasan to stage a comeback. Both have the experience of playing in India and for a while, the duo seemed to give them a bit of hope. But it's their tendency to sweep a little too much against spinners which brought about their downfall.","After being bowled out for 149 in their first innings, Bangladesh conceded a lead of 227.

Chepauk's pitch revolution: Pacers dominate in a spinners' paradise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/chepauks-pitch-revolution-pacers-dominate-in-a-spinners-paradise/articleshow/113532955.cms,"NEW DELHI: Close your eyes for a moment and think back to some of the great spells at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The first two images that might come to mind could be young spinners – one bespectacled and another with a turban - mesmerizing batters like magicians. Narendra Hirwani bagged a 16-wicket haul against West Indies in 1986. In 2001, Harbhajan Singh took 15 wickets against Australia.Naturally, expectations were high for modern-day greats Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja to dismantle the Bangladesh batting line-up at Chepauk, in keeping with tradition.However, Jasprit Bumrah , Mohammed Siraj, and Akash Deep, the pacers, seized the spotlight, sharing eight wickets among them and defying historical expectations.Such dominance by pacers at this venue has been rare since the late 70s. In 1979, a trio of Kapil Dev, Karsan Ghavri, and Dhiraj Parsana took 11 wickets in India's three-wicket win over the formidable West Indians.Since then, Chepauk has typically been known as a spinner's paradise. Yet, a shift began earlier this year during the IPL when Chennai Super Kings played on a pitch with a touch of grass against Gujarat Titans.CSK defeated GT by 63 runs, with Matheesha Pathirana, Tushar Deshpande, and Mustafizur Rahman delivering noteworthy spells, while spinners like Jadeja and Rashid Khan had ordinary figures.""It was a call made by skipper Ruturaj (Gaikwad) in his effort to maximize the resources within the CSK setup. Anyways, it was a change from the long-standing, set strategy of preparing slow tracks and using spinners to win (under MS Dhoni),"" a source familiar with the move told PTI.The new red-soil pitch at Chepauk aligns with the Indian team's vision to give more practice to their pacers ahead of the crucial tour to Australia.Having a suitable pitch is one thing, but the ability to exploit it is another. Unsurprisingly, Bumrah led the way.Watching Bumrah set up Bangladesh's lower-order batter Taskin Ahmed was exceptional.After a series of short-length bumpers keeping Taskin on edge, Bumrah rattled his stumps with a fuller delivery.It was a brilliant mix of skill – delivering a toe-crusher after using the track to bowl unsettling short balls.Seasoned off-spinner Ashwin, who went wicketless, acknowledged the pitch's transformation, which Bangladesh pacers Hasan Mahmud and Taskin also utilized well.""Chepauk is a place that we know. So, it's always special for me to play here. But in the past, when I played in the U-19 matches here, the wickets were always like this,"" Ashwin said.""It used to be hard red clay, good bounce. I never saw that surface again. So, I'm really glad to see it back,"" he added.Bangladesh will now face a two-way challenge when they bat in their second innings.","Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and Akash Deep, the pacers, seized the spotlight, sharing eight wickets among them and defying historical expectations.

They lost three wickets within the first 10 overs, only managing to score 27 runs.""Overall, our batting was a little bit disappointing. Yeah, there is some help for the fast bowlers, but still, we could have done much better than that. So yeah, we are disappointed,"" PTI quoted Ahmed as saying at the press conference after the day's play.""We also lost too many wickets in the first 10 (overs), which cost us our game.""At stumps on the second day, India was at 81 for 3 in their second innings, amassing an overall lead of 308 runs.Ahmed, who secured three wickets in India's first innings and one in the second, mentioned that their limited experience playing with the SG balls did not help.Bangladesh players are accustomed to playing with Kookaburra balls, which have a flatter seam compared to SG balls.""Also, playing with the SG ball is a challenge. The Indians play with SG ball since childhood, so they know how to use it properly, giving them a huge advantage,"" said the 29-year-old right-arm pacer.""We also made some mistakes with the new ball. What I felt about the SG ball and this condition is that there were some challenges, especially for the first 10-12 overs.”""India is a formidable side against any opponent at home. And everyone tries to make the most out of the home advantage, the same as we will do when we play at home soon.""When it came to bowling, Ahmed believed his side performed well overall.""Yes, yesterday we started well, and at the end of the day, (Ravichandran) Ashwin and (Ravindra) Jadeja batted well. Also, this morning, we had a good session, and then we finished them all in 37 runs by taking four more wickets.”""So overall, we bowled well. Yesterday, there was more help than today.""Ahmed commended the Indian bowlers for maintaining consistent line and length.""No doubt they all are world-class. They were more consistent with their line and lengths, and there were plenty of variations in the Indian bowling attack,"" he said.Reflecting on their historic Test win in Pakistan, Ahmed stated, ""We played overall good cricket in Pakistan, and Test cricket is something you need to be good in your department in every session.”""But, conditions are different here.""Ahmed highlighted that his team is still a work in progress.""Everyone (in the team) is concerned about it and is working on it. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, but there is no limit to getting better.""""While we are trying to improve on it by giving our utmost, at the end of the day, it all boils down to how we execute our plans,"" he concluded.","Bangladesh dismissed for 149 in 47.1 overs on the second day's play.

So gifted, so talented. He's found ways to maximise his potential. I wish I could be him, but I'm glad I am myself,"" PTI quoted Ashwin as saying to reporters during the post-day press meet in Chennai on Friday.Ashwin acknowledged that having Jadeja at the crease helped him build his sixth Test century.""He is an exceptionally good cricketer. I'm happy for him. Likewise, in so many ways, I think watching him bat over the last couple of years has also given me insight on how better I can be,"" he added.However, their approaches to bowling are distinct. Ashwin relies on a variety of tricks to deceive batters, whereas Jadeja focuses on maintaining tight and consistent lines to yield results. Despite their different styles, they've managed to complement each other to great effect.Together, they've become India's most successful bowling duo, surpassing the previous record held by Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh , who took 501 wickets together. Ashwin emphasized their mutual respect and the joy they share in each other's success.""He keeps it really simple. He can repeat it (bowling) day in and day out. So, both of us have grown together. Both of us have done some special things. We really value one another at this stage and both of us are enjoying each other's success more than ever before,"" Ashwin explained.The duo's job isn't finished yet, as they will need to bowl in tandem again in Bangladesh's second innings to secure a win for India. Ashwin has already strategized how to tackle the Bangladeshi batsmen, even though he went wicketless in their first innings, which ended at 149.""I think there's a bit more up-and-down bounce. I would say the carry is there still. It's probably quickened up a touch (today) and then it's again gone on the slower side. I really do think as this game pans out, if at all it gets to the fourth-fifth day, it will turn for certain.""Ashwin elaborated that the key challenge moving forward will be to handle spin effectively, as the pitch is expected to assist spinners in the later stages of the match.""But the challenge going ahead in this pitch would be to negotiate spin, as the surface in due course will be able to do its tricks on the batters,"" he said.Ashwin's insights reflect the duo's understanding of the game and their ability to adapt to different conditions, aiming to steer India to victory once again with their effective partnership.",Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have redefined teamwork in Indian cricket.

His efforts helped dismiss Bangladesh for a modest total of 149 in the first Test being played at MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Friday.Given the lack of assistance from the pitch on day two, Bumrah disclosed that he tried out different variations of his deliveries, as his usual ones were not producing the desired results.He elaborated on the strategy he employed to dismiss Mushfiqur Rahim when the surface offered no help to the bowlers.""The ball had become a little old, there wasn't a lot of movement, but there was some spongy bounce on the wicket. So, I was trying to assess my options because when I tried to bowl a little fuller, there wasn't much deviation. I was just trying to think about how I could make run-scoring difficult. That's what I focused on, and luckily, I got the outside edge,"" Bumrah told JioCinema after stumps on Day 2.Bumrah also talked about the adjustments he needed to make in his variations because of the prevailing conditions.""I had no other option because when I tried to bowl a length ball, the ball wasn't doing anything, and the ball wasn't reversing either. So, I had to try something because, as a bowler, you have to experiment when there's not much happening. There was no grip on the wicket, so I used one of those tactics that I've used in domestic cricket as well. It worked today, and that experience helped me out.""He went on to share insights into his use of bouncers in the match, saying, ""In Test cricket, I don't usually bowl as many bouncers. Given the weather was harsh and I'm just getting back into Test cricket, I had to make adjustments. The ball had become wet because of sweat, and the seam was also wet. So, I had to use different options to get a wicket and make run-scoring difficult. These are things you learn as a lower-order batter too.""Bumrah then shared the discussions he had with captain Rohit Sharma about their tactical approach to the bowling attack for the day.""He understands the bowlers very well. The weather was harsh, and everyone is coming back after a while - we're playing a Test match after some time, so everyone needs to get into the groove. The chat was about short spells to make them effective. We have fast bowlers who want to bowl fast and spinners who can create an impact. When the ball is new, the seam is hard, and there is some lateral movement, so we wanted to capitalize on that,"" he said.""The plan wasn't necessarily to bowl fuller because there was no consistent swing. Some balls swung, and some didn't. So, we quickly adjusted angles, and I came around the wicket. But yes, with the new ball, there was some assistance, and we focused on that,"" the pacer said.At stumps on the second day, India stood at 81/3, boasting a substantial lead of 308 runs.

NEW DELHI: Amit Mishra , renowned for his spin bowling, surprised everyone with his exceptional batting performance, outclassing both Indian batters and England bowlers. In an innings where prominent players such as MS Dhoni and Gautam Gambhir got out for 3 runs each, Mishra partnered with Sachin Tendulkar to score 84 runs.The English team grew increasingly frustrated due to Mishra's steadfast batting and their missed opportunities to dismiss Tendulkar.The tension on the field was noticeable as English players struggled to capitalize on their chances.The frustration led to a breach of cricket etiquette, with England players walking across the pitch. This behavior prompted the umpires to issue an official warning to England captain Andrew Strauss for his team's repeated violations. Despite the warning, the damage was done.The footmarks on the pitch eventually favoured spinner Graeme Swann, who dismissed Mishra. Swann proceeded to take six wickets, contributing to India's batting collapse, with players like MS Dhoni, Suresh Raina , and Gautam Gambhir scoring in single digits.Mishra's batting performance overshadowed his struggles with the ball. He confidently handled the English attack, achieving his second Test half-century. His 50 off 103 balls displayed his skill against Swann and fast bowlers. In both the innings, Suresh Raina failed to open his account.In the first innings, Mishra, primarily in the team as a spinner, bowled 38 overs without taking a wicket. England declared at 591 for 6, with Mishra conceding 170 runs, making him the most expensive Indian bowler in that innings.However, he compensated with the bat, scoring 44 runs in the first innings and a half-century in the second. Rahul Dravid 's 144 not out in the first innings and Sachin Tendulkar's 94 in second innings was the major highlight of Indian batting.England secured a win against India by an innings and 8 runs. India failed to avoid a follow-on in the match. Ian Bell achieved a double century for England, while Kevin Pietersen scored 175 runs.

When I play as a No. 10, I need to stay close to the striker. But against Punjab, I frequently dropped back to collect the ball, leaving the striker alone, making it easier for the opposing team to defend.

Tell us about the turnaround.

How was the atmosphere in the blue side of Manchester when you were playing, and the club wasn't winning enough?

And now?

Can

Pep Guardiola

be the new Ferguson?

Currently, the fight for the European supremacy is between Man City and

Real Madrid

. Why do Real win more trophies?

Man City captain Rodri has spoken strongly about the congested schedule. Do you share his concerns?

How has Ian Wright shaped you as a person and a player?

Shaun Wright-Phillips has a favourite adage for life: If you fall from the bike, you get up and ride again. Honest in observations, chipping in with wisecracks, the former winger took time out from his Manchester City Trophy tour to talk to TOI. Excerpts...It happened gradually.Man City, in my first spell was a sleeping giant. It just didn't have the same backing as the other top clubs. When I rejoined in 2008, the take-over had happened. The new owner and his team have done a magnificent job. I think the biggest point is they didn't just win that first trophy and kind of sit back. It became an addiction.Quite like a roller-coaster ride. Sometimes we'd blow teams out and other times we'd play well and lose. But to beat Alex Ferguson's Man United was difficult. United had that power. When you have the likes of Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Andy Cole, Roy Keane, Wayne Rooney, Michael Owen, you generate formidable power. We couldn't financially get there.Now we're at par. But now United spend more money than us and it's just not working. We're here to stay. To win four Premier Leagues in a row, it is a summit that no one has ever scaled. In so many ways, United have kind of lost their way. I think if you look at Old Trafford, that was a place everybody was scared to go to. Now, not so much. And then things like the leaky roof, that's not Old Trafford. It was called a theatre of dreams for a reason. They need to get back there, but it isn't a quick fix.No, I don't think he can. I think Alex Ferguson was a phenomenal manager and a lovely human being, and made football seem completely different during his time. He made that team. He didn't start well but look where he ended up. Then Arsene Wenger comes and changes football completely again, with counter-attacking fast breaks. I remember playing at Highbury and it would take Arsenal three passes to put the ball in the back of the net. And now you've got Pep, who is completely different in his own right. He has influenced football, not just the Premier League , down to the grassroots. Now everybody wants to play out from the back. You go and watch Sunday league football. Goalkeepers are engaging in passes that didn't exist before. They've all changed and brought something unbelievable to the world of football.Real Madrid, for me, isn't the Real that I've seen, say, last seven or eight years ago. (Now) It's a completely different way of playing. Carlo Ancelotti knows how to win football matches. And if you watch them against us in the Champions League last year, Real had individual moments of brilliance. They just keep the ball away from their goal and score when they have a chance. That's how they play – they can be free in the blink of an eye. That is Real Madrid for you. And that's why they win trophies. They don't need to play well to win. They just need a split second of magic, and they have magic all over the pitch.It's hard on them. Not just physically, mentally as well. I think people forget that. There is no respite. And you want top players like Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne to play as long as possible. You don't want to lose players. I think this punishing schedule can shorten that. It will take its toll. In football you get wear and tear. So, when people like Kevin and Rodri talk about it, they're not saying it for no reason. They're saying it because they're feeling it. I can agree with a lot of what the players are saying.The special thing about our relationship is that Ian, my father, didn't try to shape me. He let me create my own path and play the way I wanted to play. He was a completely different player. He was a natural out and out goal scorer. There weren't many players like him. His tenacity, his edge, his sharpness, his pace, we don't have those anymore. I could never match that. I was more of a creator and an entertainer. Yes, I scored, and yes, I wish I scored more, and I wish I played in one of Pep's teams. But he didn't play football with me, just as I've never played football with my kids. He let me fall in love with the game myself, and that's when the passion grew for me. He allowed me to be me. And that is what I'm most thankful of. I couldn't be more proud of him for trusting me to take the right path.",Shaun Wright-Phillips has spoken to TOI about his time at Manchester City. The former winger believes the fight for European supremacy is between Man City and Real Madrid. He also reveals how Ian Wright shaped him as a person and a player.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113531628,imgsize-23470,width-400,resizemode-4/113531628.jpg"

Facing criticism for Australia's recent performances, he described his resignation as ""best for the nation.""Football Australia chief executive James Johnson, who had supported Arnold a week earlier, confirmed that the board accepted his resignation.Johnson emphasized the need to appoint a permanent successor before Australia faces China in October.

Leverkusen's impressive performance came just months after their sole defeat in an otherwise remarkable season, which saw them clinch the Bundesliga title and the German Cup.Atalanta, the team responsible for Leverkusen's Europa League final defeat in May, was held to a goalless draw by Arsenal at home, with a penalty being saved during the match.In other fixtures, Atletico Madrid secured a 2-1 win against Leipzig, while Benfica emerged victorious over Red Star Belgrade with the same scoreline. Brest, making their European competition debut, celebrated a 2-1 triumph over Sturm Graz.These matches were part of the third evening of the revamped Champions League format, which has replaced the traditional group stage.The Champions League has undergone a change in format, with 36 teams now competing against eight different opponents until January. The teams are ranked in a single league table, which determines their progression to the knockout stage.Despite his young age, Lamal has already achieved numerous scoring records for both Barcelona and Spain. He played a crucial role in Spain's victory at the European Championship this summer, becoming the youngest goalscorer in the tournament's history.However, Lamal's goal in the Champions League was not a record-breaking achievement for him. At 17 years old, he became the second-youngest scorer in the competition, narrowly missing out on the record held by his teammate Ansu Fati, who was 28 days younger when he scored his first Champions League goal in December 2019.Lamal's impressive 28th-minute equalizer showcased his skill and precision. After cutting inside from the left, he expertly placed the ball between two defenders, finding the bottom right corner of the net. His goal canceled out Maghnes Akliouche's earlier opener for the opposing team.Barcelona faced a challenging match after Eric Garcia, their defender, was sent off within the first 11 minutes of the game. Monaco capitalized on this advantage when George Ilenikhena, an 18-year-old forward, scored an impressive goal in the 71st minute.The 21-year-old Writz maintained his goal-scoring streak on Thursday in Rotterdam. After Robert Andrich intercepted a misplaced Feyenoord pass, he played the ball through to Wirtz, who charged forward and struck the ball into the bottom right corner of the net.Leverkusen increased their lead to two goals at the half-hour mark. Victor Boniface made an intelligent pass from the edge of the penalty area to Jeremie Frimpong on the right wing. Frimpong then delivered a cross that Alejandro Grimaldo slotted in at the far post.Six minutes later, Wirtz volleyed in another cross from Frimpong to further extend Leverkusen's lead.Leverkusen hardly needed any help but it was given it on the stroke of halftime when a howler by Feyenoord’s German goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther saw him turn the ball over the line following Edmond Tapsoba’s header.Antoine Griezmann, a seasoned player at 33 years old, stood out for Atletico despite the emphasis on youth. He scored in the Champions League for the 11th consecutive season and provided the assist for Jose Maria Gimenez's dramatic headed winner. Leipzig had initially taken the lead through Benjamin Šeško in the fourth minute.Arsenal's goalkeeper, David Raya, proved to be their savior by making a double save from a penalty in the 51st minute, which was awarded after Thomas Partey fouled Ederson. Raya first denied Mateo Retegui's spot kick, but the rebound fell back to the striker. However, Raya managed to claw Retegui's header off the line in a scrambling effort.Without the injured Martin Odegaard, their primary creative player, Arsenal found it challenging to create chances in attack. They relied on their characteristically resolute defense and Raya's heroics to secure a point in Bergamo. In the upcoming round, Arsenal will face Paris Saint-Germain at home.Brest's inaugural goal in European competition was netted by midfielder Hugo Magnetti at home, but not at their usual stadium.Due to Brest's stadium failing to meet UEFA's standards, the club's European home matches were played at Guingamp's Stade de Roudourou, situated approximately 114 kilometers (71 miles) away.Brest achieved an impressive third-place finish in the French league last season. Sturm is making its first appearance in the Champions League proper in 24 years, following their successful campaign to end Salzburg's decade-long dominance of the Austrian league.Under the guidance of new coach Bruno Lage, Benfica secured their second consecutive victory, courtesy of goals from Turkish internationals Kerem Aktürkoğlu and Orkun Kokcu.Kokcu's goal was particularly impressive, as he skillfully curled a free kick into the top right corner from a distance of 25 yards. Felicio Milson managed to score a late goal for the home side.","Bayer Leverkusen defeated Feyenoord 4-0 in their Champions League match. Atalanta were held to a goalless draw by Arsenal.

NEW DELHI: Football is a game of glory, wealth, and fame, but even the biggest stars in the sport aren’t immune to legal troubles. In recent years, several world-class footballers have found themselves on the wrong side of the law, particularly when it comes to tax evasion .From Cristiano Ronaldo to Lionel Messi , these players have faced hefty fines and legal battles over unpaid taxes.Without any further ado, here are the top 5 footballers who were fined for tax evasion.Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the most famous footballers in the world, faced tax evasion charges during his time at Real Madrid . In 2019, the Portuguese star was ordered to pay €18.8 million in fines and was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence.The Spanish authorities accused Ronaldo of hiding income from image rights between 2010 and 2014.To avoid prison time, Ronaldo agreed to settle the case, paying the fine and resolving his legal woes, but the incident remains a blot on his otherwise glittering career.Arguably one of the greatest footballers of all time, Lionel Messi also found himself embroiled in a tax evasion scandal.In 2017, Messi and his father, Jorge, were found guilty of defrauding the Spanish government of €4.1 million by hiding earnings from image rights between 2007 and 2009.Messi received a 21-month prison sentence, which was later converted into a €252,000 fine. Like Ronaldo, Messi’s reputation was briefly tarnished by the scandal, though it didn’t affect his career trajectory.Brazilian star Neymar has also faced tax evasion allegations, both in his homeland and in Spain.In 2016, Brazilian authorities froze Neymar’s assets, including a yacht and a private jet, after accusing him of evading taxes between 2011 and 2013.He was fined approximately €45 million. Neymar also dealt with legal troubles following his high-profile transfer to Barcelona , where there were allegations of irregularities in his transfer fees, although those cases were settled.Former Real Madrid and Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso was another footballer caught up in tax evasion controversies. Alonso was accused of failing to pay nearly €2 million in taxes related to image rights earnings during his time in Spain between 2010 and 2012.Unlike Ronaldo and Messi, Alonso did not settle his case immediately, instead choosing to fight the charges in court.Later, Alonso was acquitted, but the legal battle dragged on for several years, keeping him in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.Colombian striker Radamel Falcao, known for his goal-scoring prowess, was accused of defrauding the Spanish tax authorities of nearly €5.66 million during his time at Atlético Madrid .Falcao was found guilty of concealing income from image rights between 2012 and 2013.Later, he agreed to pay a fine of €9 million to settle the charges. Like many of his peers, Falcao's legal troubles stemmed from the complex financial structures used to manage image rights, a recurring issue in football.The world of football brings fame, fortune, and sponsorship deals, but as these cases show, it also brings financial scrutiny.While the players listed above have all faced significant fines and legal issues, they’ve managed to continue their successful careers. However, these tax evasion cases serve as a reminder that even the wealthiest athletes are accountable to the law.","Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Radamel Falcao are among the footballers who have been fined for tax evasion. Ronaldo was ordered to pay €18.8 million in fines and was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence. Messi and his father, Jorge, were found guilty of defrauding the Spanish government of €4.1 million.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113499693,imgsize-47292,width-400,resizemode-4/113499693.jpg"

Wing-back Saviour Gama, who made his ISL debut in the last game, is also doubtful with the knock which made him go out in the 16th minute of the first match.Odisha, meanwhile, are winless in their last five ISL away games, and have lost their last three matches. They would surely aim to break that winless run on Friday evening by improving their performance on field.""We need to learn and improve, starting with myself as the coach. We need to analyse many things, but the players need to put their focus on the next game. We need to improve a lot of things if we want to be competitive and secure top positions in the ISL,"" Lobera said ahead of the encounter.Punjab, meanwhile, will find it difficult to quickly come to terms with the absence of their inspirational captain-forward Luka Majcen, who is set to miss the action for at least 6-8 weeks with fractured jaw.Admitting that their gameplan without Majcen in the setup will be crucial in shaping up their season, PFC head coach Panagiotis Dilmperis said on the eve of the match, ""We hope that Luka recovers quickly and joins the team. He is a fighter and would have been with the team even in this situation if it was possible.""However, the Dilmperis-coached side will hope to register their second win on the trot after beating Kerala Blasters in their away opener. And if Punjab managed to do so it would be their first against Odisha. Punjab lost both the league matches to the Juggernauts last season.Hugo Boumous showed his brilliance as the creative midfielder in his debut for Odisha in the last game and Lobera will need him to live up to the billing alongside experienced senior-pros like Roy Krishna, Diego Mauricio, Mourtada Fall and Ahmed Jahouh to deliver the goods in combination with the Indian youngsters in the Juggernauts' setup.",Odisha FC take on Punjab FC at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi.

He discussed this issue during the 'Stay Your Age' U-15 football tournament held from September 12 to 18 in Navi Mumbai.""This needs to stop. The age-fraud thing has been an elephant in the room for so many years,"" said Jhingan.He highlighted that age-fraud can harm players' confidence and cause self-doubt at a crucial development stage.He said playing against older players negatively impacts youth players' growth.""During my younger days, in the U-15 and the U-17 times, we always knew there was someone who was older but playing in our age group. I have many times felt that I was not good enough, because that boy was stronger, faster, and more mature than me, but all of that was only because he was older than me,"" he said.""At that age, when you are that young, even a difference of two years makes a massive difference in terms of the quality that you produce on the pitch. Luckily, I kept going and believing in myself,""Jhingan added.The Stay Your Age Cup implemented a strict document verification process to ensure fair play. Teams accessed player documents to maintain transparency. The teams competed in five matches each using a league system format.The tournament featured six teams: RFYC, FC Goa, Bengaluru FC, Dempo SC, FC Madras and Mizoram Football Association (MFA).Jhingan emphasized the importance of fair tournaments for the accurate development of young players.""It (age-fraud) needs to be stopped. It’s so sad that it still happens. It’s not just in football, but in all sports, all across the world. I think this needs to stop big time. I am really happy that all the clubs and the Reliance Foundation are coming together to solve this problem,"" he added.",FC Goa defender Sandesh Jhingan spoke about age-fraud in football.

If you win, you will get this much as a bonus, and if the team wins this much extra.""The committee then decided to authorize the captain to discuss it with the player.""Rajpal refused to comment on the matter but another member of the executive committee who attended the meeting confirmed, without revealing details, that Nagal's request was agreed to.An AITA source familiar with the subject said, ""It ($50,000) is roughly Rs. 40-45 lakh for two ties in a year. So essentially, he has asked for Rs. 20 lakh per tie, which I think is fine. A (No. 1) player gets anywhere around Rs. 7 to 12 lakhs at the moment.""As a standalone figure it might seem exorbitant, but to put it in perspective, a player earned $100,000 simply for turning up in the singles first round at the US Open this year. At the French Open, a first-round appearance made a player richer by 73,000-euros.It is also understood that Nagal had requested for a change in support staff attached to the Indian Davis Cup team. It is not clear whether he wanted both Rajpal (as captain by Mahesh Bhupathi) and Zeeshan Ali (as coach by Somdev Devvarman ) to be replaced, or only the latter. Devvarman is Nagal's mentor.The AITA subsequently appointed Ashutosh Singh as coach after Ali resigned.Nagal issued a detailed statement on the subject while also responding to the attack from the AITA that he skipped the Stockholm sojourn despite being fit.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup, as playing for the national team is a moment I cherish deeply. However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team’s chances,"" said Nagal, who on Thursday pulled out of the ATP 250 event in Hangzhou.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""","Sumit Nagal had asked to be paid $50,000 a year for playing Davis Cup.

However, Nagal defended this by stating that it is common practice for athletes to be compensated for their participation.Nagal had opted out of the recent Davis Cup tie against Sweden, citing a back strain. This injury had also forced him to withdraw from the US Open men's doubles competition last month.Without a singles specialist, India lost 0-4 to Sweden on their home turf.The team, primarily composed of doubles players and debutants, failed to win a set in the World Group I tie.On Thursday, AITA expressed its displeasure, claiming top players like Nagal, Yuki Bhambri , and Sasikumar Mukund had refused national duty.Nagal was scheduled to play in the ATP 250 Hangzhou Open but withdrew, again citing his back issue.""You tell me why should a player be asking for money to play for the country. This is a big question. He had demanded an annual fee of $50,000 (approx 45 lakh) and said if he is not paid, he will not play,"" Dhupar told PTI.India plays only two ties per season in the World Group I, typically in February and September.""Let the country decide if it is right or not. Then, it is the decision of the government and everybody. The players are also paid by TOPS. And it's not that they don't get paid for playing the Davis Cup. They do get paid,"" Dhupar insisted.Dhupar was referring to the prize money that AITA receives from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) for Davis Cup participation, which is distributed among team members.For a World Group I tie, AITA receives around Rs 30 lakh, of which 70 per cent is distributed among participating players. The remaining 30 per cent is kept for administrative expenses by the national federation.The prize money decreases for lower group ties.""No other player asked for additional money over and above their share of the ITF prize money.""A former Indian Davis Cupper confirmed that there have been past instances where leading players asked for money to play Davis Cup and those demands were accepted.Nagal did not deny AITA's claim. He defended his stance through a statement on social media.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""AITA was displeased that Nagal skipped Davis Cup by citing injury but seemed to recover in time for the Hangzhou Open. Nagal withdrew from the ATP 250 tournament two days after AITA's statement.Nagal emphasized the honor of representing his country.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup...However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team's chances.""""I believe it is better for the team and for the country to have someone at 100 per cent rather than risking further injury and potentially disrupting the match. I had informed AITA well in advance about my inability to participate.""It was learned that Captain Rohit Rajpal took Nagal's proposal to the AITA Executive Committee. After initial reluctance, the committee agreed to pay him, but requested the captain to renegotiate the figure.However, before an agreement could be reached, Nagal withdrew from the tie and the discussion ended without progress.During the tie, Nagal criticized AITA on social media, stating that many team members were there only to enjoy junkets.He justified his break further.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Nagal reaffirmed his commitment to representing the country.""I look forward to future opportunities to wear the national colours and make my country proud, both on and off the court.""Nagal had also skipped the tie against Pakistan earlier this year, stating that the grass court surface did not suit his style of play as well as hard courts do.Skipper Rajpal faces criticism on social media, with many questioning his suitability as Davis Cup captain.Rajpal was appointed captain in 2019, replacing Mahesh Bhupathi , who hesitated to travel to Pakistan due to security concerns.A team official noted that receiving payment like cricketers is acceptable, but tennis players should also be willing to go through a selection process.""They want contracts, but do they play Nationals? Do they come to the national side through selection trials like shooters and badminton players?

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the Italian tennis sensation, has achieved a remarkable feat by winning his second Grand Slam title of the year at the US Open. The 23-year-old world number one defeated American Taylor Fritz in straight sets, with a score line of 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, to secure his maiden US Open crown.This victory comes on the heels of his triumph at the Australian Open earlier this year, making him the first Italian man to win the prestigious US Open title.Jannik Sinner has secured his sixth title of the 2024 season, reaffirming his status as the world number one. Sinner's stellar record this year includes 55 wins and just 5 losses.However, his journey to winning the US Open was not without issues. Before the tournament, an independent tribunal cleared him of any wrongdoing related to a case that had drawn significant public and player attention.Allegations suggested that tennis' anti-doping authorities treated Sinner differently from other players, leading to a divided locker room atmosphere.In March, Jannik Sinner tested positive for Clostebol, a banned substance, twice. However, it was determined that the presence of the steroid was accidental, caused by a massage from his former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi.Naldi had unknowingly transferred Clostebol to Sinner while treating his own finger with a spray containing the substance, provided by Sinner’s ex-fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara. The investigation cleared Sinner of intentional doping, and he faced no suspension.Despite these distractions, Sinner stayed focused and demonstrated his skill on the court. His victory in New York extended his winning streak to 11 matches.Top players such as Novak Djokovic , Carlos Alcaraz , Alexander Zverev , and Daniil Medvedev have faced Sinner's strong performance first hand.These victories underscore Sinner's prominent role in tennis, continuing to impress both fans and competitors.In the video, Jannik Sinner faced off against 21-year-old Carlos Alcaraz. Both players demonstrated strategic gameplay, focusing on precise ball placement. During a crucial moment, Sinner executed a wide shot across the court. Alcaraz managed to reach the ball but couldn't keep it within Sinner's side of the court.In another segment of the video, Sinner played against Novak Djokovic. When Djokovic aimed a shot towards the sideline, Sinner responded with a delicate shot near the net. As Djokovic rushed to intercept, Sinner positioned himself well and directed the ball to the back corner of the court, securing a point against his formidable opponent. Even Djokovic was impressed by Sinner's shot.Jannik Sinner's recent victories have solidified his position as a leading figure in tennis. At a young age, his achievements reflect his talent and commitment. Continuing to secure titles and maintain high rankings, Sinner is a standout player to observe in the future.Sinner's notable performances have displayed his strong serves, precise groundstrokes, and excellent court coverage. His composure and execution indicate he is well-prepared for future competitions.The tennis community is keenly watching Sinner's upcoming matches as he seeks to expand on his successes.

Number two, Davis Cup is definitely a very important. It's more than a tournament, every player who is an Indian should participate if selected. So why not?"" Dhupar remarked.

That's the good news. That the game in the country could be rapidly barrelling down a bottomless pit is the disturbing part. Until last week Sumit Nagal was the only Indian ranked in the top-300 of the singles ranking on the men's and women's Tours.That piece of statistic is abysmal by itself but hold it up against India being the only Asian nation to have made a Davis Cup final, not once, but thrice (1966, 74 and 87) and it's discomfiting.This week, Sahaja Yamalapalli cracked the top-300 at No. 298 on the WTA list. She's the India No.1.Outside of Nagal, there's little to inspire hope in singles on the ATP Tour. India has enjoyed success in doubles this year with Rohan Bopanna rising to No.1 in the individual doubles ranking, and with ten Indians logged in the top-150 things are looking good in the two-man act. But doubles is not the power index of the sport. That's precisely why an Indian side, sans the 27-year-old Nagal, failed to win so much as a set against Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group 1 tie over the weekend in Stockholm.Playing the singles for the hosts was Elias Ymer ranked 238 and Leo Borg 603. For the visitors it was Ramkumar Ramanathan, ranked 334 in singles and 144 in doubles, and Sriram Balaji, unranked in singles, and No 65 in doubles, playing singles and doubles.It was not the result so much but some of the choices made by non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal that sent shock waves through the fraternity. Playing 34-year-old Balaji, a doubles specialist, in a live singles rubber when 18-year-old Aryan Shah, the most improved of the Indian players in that bracket, was on the bench. Shah may not even have got the purchase Balaji managed in the match, but it would've counted as investment. Experience is real.Siddharth Vishwakarma, who replaced Balaji for the reverse rubber, turns 30 in a couple of weeks and is ranked just 46 slots higher than the teenager.The player community is not amused. They are all over social media and podcasts, exercising their vocal chords, taking on the All India Tennis Association .The timing is particularly sweet given that one of the most poorly performing associations in Indian sport has elections and the AGM scheduled for Sept 28. A 56-member Electoral College will decide on the posts of president, secretary and treasurer while also filling in the Executive Committee for a four-year term.Nagal, recovering from a back injury, joined Somdev Devvarman and Purav Raja on their podcast. The trio spoke on a range of issues from the anaemic levels of trust between players and officials to coaches dozing off during Davis Cup ties when players are on court and the dismal state of the National Tennis Centre in New Delhi. If it weren't real, it would make for good comedy.Over the weekend Bopanna called for a 'cultural shift in the sport', former pro Vishnu Vardhan followed up with a 'comprehensive plan' on X (formerly Twitter).Is AITA listening?When asked to comment on AITA's dismal track record the IOA and the sports ministry preferred silence.Does anyone care?Still should the rumbles from the player community come together in a united voice, it will be hard to muzzle.AITA will look to divide and rule as it has always done, offer a section of the players sops. It's up to the players to stand up not just for themselves, but for the generations to come.Using words is a good beginning, but they will need to do more. Be the change they wish to see.

AITA secretary Anil Dhupar accompanied the team to Sweden, in the latest instance.Bal admitted the players' grievances were genuine but still believed that those factors should not come in the way of representing the country.""I don't agree when a player says that, because the team atmosphere is not good or they are not happy with the association, that he will not play,"" Bal said.""When I play, I play for my country, I am not playing for AITA. Maybe I am from a different generation or think differently, but even after all those arguments, I will still play for my country.""Bal also did not agree that the players didn't find it worth taking a break from their professional careers, only to find that professionalism of the personnel attached to the team were not upto the standard expected at the top level.""I was part of the squad picked for the 1982 Asian Games (in Delhi). We were called for six two-week camps that year. That's 12 weeks, and here we are talking about 12 days a year,"" he said.""We were also making a living out of playing tennis. As a result, one can check the records, my ranking was somewhere around (a career-high 309) at the start of the year (1981), and then it dropped (to 503 at the end of 1983).""And the next year, I still played for my country.""Against Sweden, both the team selection and match tactics have come under scrutiny.After Nagal withdrew, the selection committee opted to bring in 16-year-old Manas Dhamne - ahead of 21-year-old Karan Singh, who was also ranked higher - as reserve while 18-year-old Aryan Shah, previously the reserve, became part of the nominations.Eventually, Rajpal played doubles specialists Ramkumar Ramanathan (who has not won a singles match on the ATP circuit since May), Sriram Balaji in both singles and doubles.Bal said the committee chose to give Dhamne the exposure once it became clear that the captain was ""reasonably certain"" to play Ramkumar and Balaji, and to some extent Niki Poonacha.""As much as I agree (with fielding Aryan in singles with an eye on future), he is also ranked higher, as a captain you would go with a player who has the experience of 30-40 ties, how the surface is playing, all that would have made an impact (on Rajpal's decision),"" he said.""He has played a lot of tennis. He has travelled a lot, he knows his tennis.""Ram and Balaji knew what the battle was, what they were getting into. They were dignified and fought it out.""Asked to sum up his thoughts on India's performance in Stockholm, Bal said, ""Disappointing.""""When you are playing with a half deck, the way we crumbled, says it all. Even with Sumit, Sasi and Yuki in the mix, Sweden would have been tough to beat at home anyway,"" he added.""Don't know if we can blame the players, or the captain or the coach, when we have two doubles players playing singles, it had to happen.""Doubles could have been closer, but when you are 0-2 down it is not easy to fight back. You need extra-ordinary players who can say, 'let's take it one match at a time'.""We did it against Brazil (in Chennai in 2010) when we had the class of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi .""",Top singles players Sumit Nagal and Mukund Sasikumar as well as leading doubles player Yuki Bhambri were not available for selection for different reasons.
