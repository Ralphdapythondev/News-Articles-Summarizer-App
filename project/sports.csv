Thorkildsen was present in the stands, along with three-time Olympic champion and world record holder Jan Zelezny of the Czech Republic.Neeraj became only the third Indian athlete, and the first in track and field, to win back-to-back individual Olympic medals.

Nonetheless, Neeraj's accomplishment makes him the second male athlete from post-independence India to secure two Olympic medals in an individual event.Sumariwalla expressed his belief that people often place excessive emphasis on medals, a perspective he personally disagrees with. He highlighted that Neeraj had overcome an injury to claim the silver medal, demonstrating an ""unbelievably good"" performance in the final event.""I think people give too much stress on medals. I am one of those who doesn't talk about medals. I think if the process is right, medals will come. Look at what happened. He came back from an injury. In Tokyo, he got a golden. Today he threw 2 meters more than he threw in Tokyo but had to settle for a silver...He got a season's best. I think he's a tiger. He fought like a tiger. He recovered from an injury and he was just unbelievably good...He's a champion. That's what champions are made of....,"" Sumariwalla told ANI.Neeraj faced challenges during the competition. His first and third attempts were ruled invalid due to red flags, and his final three attempts were also deemed fouls.This came as a surprise considering his impressive performance in the qualification round, where he threw an impressive 89.34 meters.Despite his best efforts, Neeraj's second-best throw of 89.45 meters was not sufficient to secure the gold medal.The pressure seemed to be mounting on him before his fifth attempt, and he unfortunately crossed the line once more, resulting in another red flag.

settles issue with monstrous second throw in final

PARIS: It was hot and humid at the Stade de France on Thursday night. The air was still, and heavy with anticipation. Not the best of conditions for an athlete to give his best. But that would have been the last thing on Neeraj Chopra 's mind.He came here with the tag of the defending javelin throw champion. ""It gives you motivation. Helps you focus better on your performance."" Just two days ago, Chopra got his second-best throw ever at this arena, 89.94m, during the qualification. ""Don't go by this throw. Final alag cheez hai (final is a different thing),"" he had said.It was different. Very different. The Indian, who had topped the qualifications, started with a foul. So did Pakistan 's Arshad Nadeem, Neeraj's challenger and a friend on the circuit. But that was not a worry for these two sub-continental heroes.They went top of the chart on their second try. Nadeem set an Olympic record with a huge throw of 92.97m. It was a sensational throw, almost unbelievable. The javelin kept soaring and soaring before it fell to a huge roar in the stadium. The earlier record stood at 90.57m. He had just gone way, way ahead of the others.Neeraj managed 89.45m on his second try to be second on the list, 3.52m behind the Pakistani. He indicated with his right hand that it was not where he wanted to be at. There was a lot of catching up to do, for him and the others.Nadeem's third throw was around 88m. He looked satisfied as he pumped his fist. He knew he had done his best. Neeraj fouled his third throw. It was a weak one anyway. The Indian usually gets his best throws on his initial tries. Three gone. So, could he improve now? Had Nadeem's throw put extra pressure on him?The other challengers - Anderson Peters of Grenada, Jakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic, Keshorn Walcott of Trinidad and Tobago and Germany's Julien Weber - were just behind Neeraj after four attempts. In the third spot was Vadlejch with 88.5m.The script could still change. The gold looked to have been secured by the Pakistani in his safe vault. The competition was in his pocket. It was about the other two medals.Neeraj fouled his fourth and fifth throws too. Out of five attempts, he had managed just one valid throw. It was very uncharacteristic. He was still second on the list, but there was a throw left and he could be upstaged.At this stage, it was Pakistan gold, India silver. Not many would have predicted this before the event. Nadeem is a World Championship silver medallist and has crossed the 90m-mark often in his career. He had chosen this venue, this stage to get a throw he would have often dreamed about.Neeraj fouled his sixth and final throw too. He raised his hands to thank the crowd. Nadeem then went for his final throw. It again went like the first one, just short at 91.79m. He then went down on his knees to thank God.Chopra was looking to become the fifth athlete in the history of the Games to defend the men's javelin throw Olympic title. He failed to do that but with the silver here, he has gone a step ahead of other Indian Olympians.","Neeraj Chopra fails to defend men's javelin throw Olympic title.

NEW DELHI: Harmanpreet Singh , the skipper, stepped up to the challenge yet again, scoring two goals as India's hockey team secured a 2-1 victory over Spain. This triumph earned them a second straight Olympic bronze medal and provided a fitting farewell to veteran goalkeeper P R Sreejesh on Thursday.Despite the heartbreaking 2-3 loss to Germany in the semifinal, the Indian team bounced back and displayed positive hockey throughout most of the match, ultimately emerging victorious.Spain's captain Marc Miralles had given his team an unexpected lead in the 18th minute from a penalty stroke. However, Harmanpreet (30th, 33rd minutes) responded by converting two penalty corners, securing the win for India.The Indian team demonstrated their resilience and fortitude, securing yet another podium position at the pinnacle of global sports competitions. Their achievement in Tokyo three years prior, which ended a 41-year drought, set the stage for this remarkable feat.Sreejesh, at 36 years of age, delivered an outstanding performance in the final match of his distinguished 18-year career, making crucial saves that left an indelible mark on the game.In the opening quarter, India took the initiative, controlling the play with meticulous execution. However, Spain mounted a strong comeback following the initial 15 minutes, challenging the Indian side's dominance.Spain earned nine penalty corners compared to India's six, with India converting two of theirs.Despite Spain having more possession, India was the more aggressive team, frequently breaking through the Spanish defense in the first 15 minutes.Spain entered the second quarter with greater intensity and purpose, applying heavy pressure on the Indian goal.Spain took the lead in the 18th minute, but Harmanpreet once again showcased his top form to guide India through the challenge.The last time India secured back-to-back Olympic medals was in the 1968 and 1972 editions, both resulting in bronze.The bronze medal in Paris was a much-needed triumph for the Indian contingent, which had faced six agonizing fourth-place finishes, alongside the heartbreaking disqualification of wrestler Vinesh Phogat.Still trailing, India intensified their efforts against the Spanish defense, earning their first penalty corner in the 29th minute, but failed to convert.Just 21 seconds before half-time, Manpreet made up for his earlier mistake by securing another penalty corner for India, and this time, Harmanpreet struck with precision.India earned another penalty corner in the 35th minute, but Harmanpreet's powerful shot was blocked by Spain's goalkeeper Luis Calzado.Mandeep Singh's impressive run down the left flank led to another short corner, but Spanish defender Jordi Bonastre took a blow to his left knee to prevent India's attempt.Sreejesh then thwarted a Spanish attack, allowing India to maintain their 2-1 lead until the end of the third quarter.Hardik had to be taken off the field five minutes into the fourth quarter after colliding with an opposing player and suffering a hand injury.This occurred just after India successfully defended another short corner, which was initially caused by Manpreet accidentally hitting the ball onto Hardik's foot.Fortunately for India, Marc Recasens missed the target, easing the tension in the Indian camp.With three minutes remaining, Spain removed goalkeeper Calzado in a desperate bid to find an equalizer, but India held firm and made no mistake in the dying moments.",India's hockey team secured a 2-1 victory over Spain.

SARAH'S WRESTLING RITUALS AND THE FLASH CARDS

UPDATE:

Vinesh was disquailfied after being found 100gm overweight ahead of her 50kg freestyle final against Sarah on August 7. As a result, Vinesh finished last in the final standings. Cuba's Lopez, who Vinesh had defeated in the semis, went on to face Sarah in the gold-medal match. Sarah ended up winning the final.

NEW DELHI: It won't be wrong to analyse that Vinesh Phogat wrestled the final first before reaching the gold-medal match in the women's 50kg division at the Paris Olympics . Beating Yui Susaki, who had won nothing but gold in her 82-0 unbeaten international career until Tuesday, including the Tokyo Olympics gold, in the pre-quarterfinals was like a reverse draw for Vinesh.Both Vinesh and Susaki were in disbelief after the final whistle. Vinesh, thumping the mat and then laying flat with tears in her eyes, was perhaps amazed how the almighty scripted her story -- from the career-threatening injury at Rio 2016, from the protest on the streets to a clear path to the podium, from getting dragged on the road to taking down the unbeaten, from rehab room post surgery just a year ago to sparring sessions, from one weight category to another.Tough life, but she wrestled on.The first reaction on Susaki's face after the defeat was like she didn't know what it means when the referee raises the opponent's hand. She had never experienced that at the end of an international match she fought in her career before facing Vinesh in Paris.But that was that. A 3-2 win. Vinesh Phogat progressed, then beat Ukraine's former European champion Oksana Livach in the quarters and Pan American Games champion Yusneylis Lopez Guzman of Cuba in the semis to become the first Indian female wrestler to reach an Olympic final.Medal confirmed, but more than that, a chance to become the first Indian woman to win an individual Olympic gold medal now just six minutes away.A consolation for Susaki as well. Vinesh reaching the final made the Japanese alive for repechage and bronze.The only person in the world who can now stop Vinesh from becoming an Olympic gold medallist is Sarah Hildebrandt -- her American opponent in the final, with an impressive record.The 30-year-old Sarah, a bronze medallist from Tokyo Games and four-times World Champoinships medallist, made her international debut in 2013 in the 55kg weight category and went on to win the first of her seven Pan American Championships gold as a 19-year-old -- after taking up the sport inspired by her two brothers who were also wrestlers.Sarah choosing to wrestle was against the wish of her parents, who eventully came to terms with her decision after insistence by her middle school that wrote to them about their daughter's skills in wrestling , according to information available on the Paris Olympics website.Such was her build-up that her mother would end up being her sparring partner during practice sessions.""When I started wrestling, my mum would come over to watch practices with just me and my coach and I would end up wrestling her. This sweet woman let me beat her up at 5:30 in the morning, for the sake of my improvement,"" Sarah, who is the reigning Pan American champion besides being the bronze medallist from the 2023 Budapest World Championships, is mentioned as saying on the Paris 2024 website.Over the years since arriving on the international mat 11 years ago, Sarah has switched from 55kg to 53kg, and then to her current weight division, 50kg.She began her Paris journey with an impressive 10-0 victory by technical superiority against Ibtissem Doudou of Algeria.Sarah followed that up with a 7-4 triumph over China's 2023 World Championships bronze medallist Feng Ziqi in the quarters.In the semis, she defeated the 2023 World Championships silver medallist Otgonjargal Dolgorjav of Mongolia with a comfortable 5-0 win.Before taking the mat in a match, Sarah's favourite music is the AC/DC band, with her walkout number being the super hit song 'Thunderstruck'.Sarah, who trains at the US Olympic and Paralympic Training Center in Colorado, has an interesting ritual when it comes to studying her opponents -- she makes flash cards.""I literally make flash cards on opponents like I'm in school, just kind of study them when I am in the sauna, and stuff like that,"" she told FloWrestling before arriving to Paris.""Just going over things like what their first tie is, which way do I want to circle, their moves that may be frequent, some no-no's at my end, like 'let's not even do that'...It just kind of keeps you fresh because I want my wrestling to be the main star when I step on the mat, the main thing I am focused on.""Obviously I am going to come prepared. There are things specifically that I am going to do and not going to do against people. So just have an idea like let's circle right after the whistle, or they are gonna do this after the whistle...just having those ideas in the back of your mind,"" she added.""When stuff starts rolling, it just comes naturally.""On Wednesday, it won't be the biggest match of the career for only Vinesh. Sarah, too, will be competing to win her first ever Olympic gold.It's going to be a contest.","Vinesh Phogat was disquailfied after being found 100gm overweight ahead of her 50kg freestyle final against Sarah Hildebrandt.

Hildebrandt, 30, who had previously won a bronze at the Tokyo Games , described the confusion she experienced during the weigh-in, initially mistaking Phogat's absence for a forfeit.""I prepared for chaos, but that was not on my bingo card of chaos,"" Hildebrandt was quoted as saying by PTI, explaining the unexpected turn of events.Hildebrandt thought Phogat had forfeited when she did not see her at the weigh-in.""(Vinesh) wasn't at weigh-ins, so I was in my head like, 'Oh my gosh, this might be a possibility.'

We've asked the board to try and ask for some security for us until the main team arrives, but we haven't heard anything back yet,"" a Sri Lankan player in England told ESPNcricinfo.Sri Lankan team manager, Mahinda Halangoda, confirmed that he formally addressed these security concerns with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), particularly after reports of unrest in Manchester, the venue for the first test match.""I raised the issue with them, and the ECB responded very quickly and sent us their comprehensive security arrangements. We'll be having a security liaison on the tour from them as well,"" Halangoda stated.This situation presents a parallel to Sri Lanka's own experience in 2022. The island nation faced significant political and economic turmoil, leading to ethical concerns raised by Australia and Pakistan regarding touring for a bilateral series. Ultimately, the Asia Cup, initially planned to be held in Sri Lanka, was relocated to the United Arab Emirates due to the unrest.While the ECB has assured the Sri Lankan team of comprehensive security arrangements, the players' apprehension underscores the potential impact of broader societal issues on international sporting events. The situation highlights the importance of proactive communication and robust security planning to ensure the safety and well-being of athletes, particularly when events coincide with periods of social unrest.The SLC will be keen to ensure their players can focus on the upcoming series without undue anxiety. The effectiveness of the ECB's security measures and the overall management of the situation will be closely observed, setting a precedent for future touring teams navigating similar circumstances.",The Sri Lankan cricket team has expressed concerns regarding player safety ahead of their upcoming test series against England.

There were not a lot of runs scored down the ground. They did not use the feet as much as we expected. It was about using sweeps and piercing that deep square leg and midwicket field. That is something we failed to do as a batting unit. We did not play enough sweeps, reverse sweeps, or paddle sweeps, and used our feet too much. That was the difference,"" said Rohit.""If you look at Kusal Mendis and Avishka Fernando today [who put on an 82-run stand], they got a lot of runs square of the wicket. They were using the turn, and sweeping, making the fielder move left and right. They were smart with how they batted and we were not,"" he added.The Indian captain acknowledged that the Men in Blue were under siege from Lankan spinners rather than dominating against them. Additionally, he stated that players are allowed to devise their own strategies for overcoming spin and playing on turning tracks.""It starts with your training, When you get to your sessions, I can see the guys are working hard in the nets whenever we get the opportunity to train as well. I do not see there being a lack of effort when we want to try and play different shots,"" he added.According to Rohit, it's crucial to score as many runs as you can during the first ten overs of the powerplay because these pitches slow down later on.""My personal effort was to ensure that I score as many runs as I could. It was not as if I wanted to throw my wicket away after the powerplay. I wanted to continue the momentum and intent, but I unfortunately got dismissed while trying to play a few shots.

Virat Kohli , Shreyas Iyer , Shubman Gill and KL Rahul had fairly long batting sessions. Neither Mohammed Siraj nor Arshdeep Singh bowled.Ryan ten Doeschate adds, ""We're trying to be very specific and learn from the mistakes in the first couple of games since the conditions have been very tough, guys have come up with their own plans and how they want to go about it. It's more of a mental point of view, they're all fantastic players of spin, that's not likely to be an issue. We're trying to just form an environment where the guys feel positive where they can really express themselves and go out to show how good they are. I think it's admirable how the guys one-up with themselves under pressure. They feel that we'll at least share the series with Sri Lanka. And the preparation has been made around that we can be our best.""With the second match ending in a loss, India now has the choice of fielding their strongest XI or experimenting ahead of the next major ICC tournament, which takes place in just six months.Abhishek Nayar concludes, ""I think as Indians we are emotional people and normally when sometimes you don't get results our way, there is a lot of passion and integrity at stake for every individual so every cricketer in that dressing room knows what's at stake and a lot of time that sort of brings the best out of the team and it bring out that fighting spirit that you want to often see in our team, then you obviously try to implement that in the centre with all the strategies that you come with, all the discussions that we have in the dressing room, sometimes, being pushed against the wall brings the best out of us.""A loss would come as a shock to the recently recruited Gautam Gambhir-led coaching staff, who took over a team that had played some of the best ODI cricket in India less than a year ago.

Rohit Sharma, the Indian skipper, has been in excellent form throughout the series, looking comfortable at the crease while other Indian batters have struggled. His current form and momentum make him one of the safest picks for fantasy contests.

On the other hand, Kuldeep Yadav, the Indian left-arm wrist-spinner, has not been at his best in the series. However, given the nature of the wicket, he has the potential to emerge as one of the highest point earners in this game.

For Sri Lanka, young all-rounder Dunith Wellalage has been impressive with both bat and ball in the series. His current rhythm in both departments makes him one of the top picks for the game.

Additionally, Jeffrey Vandersay, the Sri Lankan skipper, had a remarkable performance in the last ODI, dismissing six Indian batters. With his current form, he can be a valuable asset in fantasy contests.

NEW DELHI: The Indian batsmen, especially Virat Kohli , will need to strategically handle the spin challenge in the third and final ODI on Wednesday to prevent their first series loss to Sri Lanka in 27 years.This is not the ideal start for Gautam Gambhir in his debut ODI assignment as the team's head coach.India's last bilateral ODI series defeat against Sri Lanka was in 1997 when Arjuna Ranatunga's team inflicted a 0-3 defeat on Sachin Tendulkar's side.Since then, India has won all 11 bilateral ODI series against Sri Lanka, both at home and away.India cannot win the current series after losing the second ODI by 32 runs and tying the first match. The batsmen's indecisiveness on the spin-friendly RPSC pitch has put the team in this uncomfortable position.Kohli's struggles have been the most evident, scoring only 38 runs in two matches. More concerning than the number of runs is the manner of his dismissals, falling to the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga and Jeffrey Vandersay. Kohli appeared subdued and failed to capitalise on the strong starts provided by Rohit Sharma .A confident and in-form Kohli is crucial for India's success in the middle overs, whether chasing or setting a target. However, his struggles reflect the overall difficulties faced by the Indian batting unit.Shivam Dube, the designated spin-hitter, failed to read a straightforward leg-break from Vandersay in the second ODI. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, known for their prowess against spinners, have struggled with their footwork and wrist play against the Lankan slow bowlers.The Indian batsmen need to learn from Rohit's approach, particularly his confidence and planning, to effectively rotate the strike and keep the spinners at bay on the Premadasa pitches. Rohit's exceptional batting against both pace and spin has been a standout performance in the series.India (IND) and Sri Lanka (SL) are set to face off in the third and final ODI of their three-match series at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on August 7 at 2:30 PM IST.The two teams have a long history of playing against each other, with India holding the upper hand in their head-to-head record. Out of the 170 ODI matches played between the two sides, India has emerged victorious in 99 games, while Sri Lanka has managed to win 58 times.The pitch at the R. Premadasa Stadium has been a typical Sri Lankan wicket, offering slow and challenging conditions for the batters. The best time to score runs on this surface is when the ball is new and hard, as it comes onto the bat nicely. However, as the match progresses, the ball tends to slow down and starts to turn, making it difficult for the batters to score freely.Considering the pitch conditions, top-order batters from both teams have the best chance of scoring well and earning fantasy points. While the new ball bowlers might not get much assistance from the wicket, spinners from both sides could prove to be valuable assets in fantasy XIs.Rohit Sharma (C), Ꮪhubman Gill (VC), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd.

Sahal Abdul Samad put Cummings through inside the box and the Aussie striker put it past the rival goalkeeper easily. Aldred doubled the lead within six minutes. Suhail Bhatt's header from a Liston Colaco free-kick was saved by goalkeeper Subhajit Basu, but the rebound fell in the path of Aldred who smashed the ball in. Liston, who created pressure on Air Force defence, finally found the net in the 38th minute from a Sahal pass as Bagan went into the half-time with a comfortable 3-0 lead.The green-and-maroon boys kept up the pressure in the second half and soon increased the lead through Anirudh Thapa in the 65th minute.

Cummings completed his brace with a lovely left-footed finish to score the fifth goal for his side.New-signing Greg Stewart got on the scoresheet when he found the net with a clever finish after being set up by Cummings in the added-on time.In another match of the day, 10-man FC Goa went on top of group 'F' with a 2-1 win against Tribhuvan Army FC in Shillong.","Mohun Bagan Super Giant thrashed Indian Air Force FT 6-0 to go on top of Group 'A' in Durand Cup.

Will 'Skeleton bone test' be able to end the age fraud menace in Indian grassroots football?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-skeleton-bone-test-be-able-to-end-the-age-fraud-menace-in-indian-grassroots-football/articleshow/112229085.cms,"What is a skeleton bone test?

NEW DELHI: If you google "" age fraud in Indian football "", you'll find countless entries, articles, short-form, long-form, evidence-driven ones, written by countless writers, journalists, and observers of the beautiful game of football.One can find the news of the Indian under-15 football team's captain turning out to be almost eighteen months over the age limit for the Asian under-16 championship in April 2019 or an under-17 player initially rejected by coach Nicolai Adam for his ""unnatural height"" at age 14 was later accepted into the team under Luis Norton de Matos, everything is already so well-documented.While age fraud remains a persistent issue in Indian football, we should now be looking for a more permanent and accurate solution to fight it.And it should begin early, from the grassroots level of Indian football, like the Subroto Cup , an annual school football tournament held in India, named after Subroto Mukerjee, the founder of the Air India Football Club. The prestigious tournament, established in 1960, was once graced by players like Baichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri and will enter its 63rd edition on August 5.Aimed at promoting the sport at the grassroots level, it will host a jaw-dropping 111 teams across three categories, with the sub-junior (under-15) category introduced for the first time this year. It will also have some teams from foreign countries too.To fight the demon of age fraud, the organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament, offering a promising solution to address this issue effectively.During the opening press conference of the Subroto Cup, TimesofIndia.com raised concerns about age fraud. Answering, an Air Force Sports Control Board (AFSCB) spokesperson stated, ""All and every footballer (who will be participating in the Subroto Cup) is registered on the AIFF website. And each of them gets a unique code. We also want to avoid age fraud. As per the AIFF guidelines, a skeleton bone test will be done for the under-15 boys category. For the under-17 category, it will be normal medical. The skeleton bone test or the age-detection test will all be done under the guidelines of AIFF.""The skeleton bone test, commonly known as a bone age assessment, estimates a person's age, especially in children and adolescents, by analyzing their bones.This process typically involves taking an X-ray of the left hand and wrist, as this area contains bones that undergo predictable developmental changes with age. The X-ray is then compared to standard reference images, such as those in the Greulich-Pyle Atlas, to determine the bone's developmental stage, including the appearance of growth plates and the fusion of epiphyses.It is understood that 22 teams in the under-14 category were disqualified and did not participate in the Subroto Cup after failing the age-determination test last time. According to AIFF guidelines, if four or more players from a team are found to be over-aged, that team will be immediately disqualified and barred from the tournament.""Apart from that, all the players who have already registered through AIFF and CRS (central registration system), have their age verified. The people who are coming are less in numbers. So, in times to come, age fraud, which is prevalent in football, is likely to reduce,"" he ended on a positive note, sounding hopeful, as we all are, of a better future.","The Subroto Cup is an annual school football tournament held in India.
