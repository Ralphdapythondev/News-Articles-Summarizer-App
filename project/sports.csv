There was hope in the heart, the coffee smelt good. The daily fight to get ready, catch the metro and reach the competition venue didn’t seem that daunting. Something had happened last night that had lifted the spirits.But it all changed with a simple, yet chilling message: “Vinesh Phogat has been disqualified.” It was a bolt from the blue.A sense of disbelief took over. What happened?She had failed to maintain her weight and was found to be nearly 100 grams overweight.It was cruel. To put 100g in perspective, that’s how much a bar of soap or two eggs weigh. Vinesh had waged epic battles. She led the protest against the federation chief, took him to court for alleged sexual harassment. She slept on the street at Jantar Mantar and faced police’s hostility.She could not train for almost a year, but there was this unfinished business. She returned to the mat. She failed to qualify in the 53kg category, her category, and settled for 50kg. She had to be in Paris.How did this mishap happen? Vinesh had no trouble at Tuesday morning’s weigh-in. Amidst three back-to-back bouts, she kept replenishing with fluids and some food. That’s a normal routine amid multiple exhausting contests But it adds to body weight. Wrestlers and their support staff know that. It is always a challenge .Vinesh did not speak to media after winning her semifinal against her Cuban rival Tuesday evening. Her eyes signalled she had much to say. “Kal baat karoongi (Will talk tomorrow),” she said, secure in the fact that she was the first Indian woman wrestler in an Olympics gold medal fight.But she added, “Weight manage karna hai abhi.” She knew she had crossed the limit.

Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from Paris Olympics: An athlete's challenges in managing the self,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/vinesh-phogats-disqualification-from-paris-olympics-an-athletes-challenges-in-managing-the-self/articleshow/112361702.cms,"Abhi nahin, sir, please jaane do. Abhi mujhe weight manage karna hain.

PARIS: ""I will speak tomorrow."" A hope filled, happy-sounding Vinesh Phogat was bounding off after reaching the final of the women's 50kg freestyle on Tuesday here in Paris, before she was found just about 100g over in the morning weigh-in for the final.Even in the euphoria of victory, the 29-year-old wrestler was clearly more concerned about maintaining her weight ahead of the morning's final weigh-in.Later, as dusk was gathering over the Champs de Mars arena, Vinesh was seen skipping near the athletes' area. In a full 45-minute session, she did some running and stretching, all wearing layers of clothing to help the excessive sweating continue. Then, as she cooled down, she spent nearly quarter of an hour with herself, sometimes looking ahead - the Eiffel in the distance - or with her head buried in her hands. It was a reflective period for the wrestler, but it was clear more pressing things were on her mind.Despite all the conspiracy theories swirling over Vinesh's unfortunate exit hours before what was a historic final, the struggle to manage weight in competition is a real challenge for wrestlers , boxers and weightlifters, sometimes more than the draw itself.At the 1984 LA Olympics, India's lifter Kamalakanta Santra was found to be two kg over at the 60kg weigh-in. If memory serves one right, Santra essentially sought to beef himself up by eating. His coach later said that in his zeal, Santra had overeaten.Cutting weight is a standard practice that all wrestlers carry out, since they usually go into the tournament at least three kg above if not more, but there also comes a time when the body simply refuses to give in. That is what perhaps also may have happened with Vinesh on the final morning. On whether Vinesh needed to eat to replenish her depleted resources can be gauged by her empty reserves in the second period of her quarterfinal bout when Ukriane'sOksana Livach came strongly at her and the Indian had nothing physical to hold her off with. She resorted instead on experience and guile - and a breather via a challenge - to win.Often, it is those in the lower weight categories who face the bigger problems, further complicated in case of women for whom shedding weight is physiologically not as easy as in men. There is a natural tendency to gain weight and it is higher in the lower categories than in the higher ones.""In weight categories that are crucial, we monitor the weight loss at sleep time and in the morning, and discover that in the lower weights, there is often a weight loss of 300 to 500g compared to nearly 800g in the higher categories,"" explained Mohit Dhariwal, SAI-appointed boxing team nutritionist during the pre-Games training at Saarbrucken, Germany. ""Weights in the lower categories are the toughest to shed.""He pointed to the case of boxer Nikhat Zareen, who despite being disciplined with dietary requirements, faces great difficulties in managing weight. Indeed, there were whispers of Nikhat's struggles in Saarbrucken against weight. When asked how much she was over, the boxer often missing from the campus cafeteria since she was placed on a leaner diet, replied, ""Three kgs.""In Paris too, Nikhat faced a similar weight management situation in leading up to both her bouts - against German Maxi Kloetzer and later, China's Wu Yu . The 50kg boxer told TOI how she had been subsisting solely on water for the past two days. Her throat parched, Nikhat said that the water-only diet had led to sleepless nights before the bouts.Asked what she would eat after her win over Kloetzer, Nikhat said: ""Maybe some little protein, but not much, I have to manage weight.""Both Vinesh and Nikhat have had to relinquish their favoured weight classes to adjust to lower ones due to either the entry of a superior rival (Antim Panghal, 53 kg) or the official re-jigging of the weight categories. Nikhat had to leave her 54 kg and go down to 50. These adjustments come with a host of problems.Any boxer or wrestler often weighs at least a couple of kgs if not more than their weight category, making it tortuous to shed weight at such alarming rates and in such short span of time. Vinesh, at 29, has a natural weight easily above 55 kg, plus a possibility of hormonal and retention issues coming into play.Particular care is taken in the replenishment and recovery.A visit to the National Institute of Sports, Patiala ahead of the Olympics revealed carefully drawn up charts for nutrition plastered on the boxing hall walls, giving us an idea of how much rigour goes into an athlete's weight management.","Vinesh Phogat was found to be just about 100g over in the morning weigh-in for the final. The 29-year-old wrestler was clearly more concerned about maintaining her weight. The struggle to manage weight in competition is a real challenge for wrestlers, boxers and weightlifters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112361662,imgsize-24154,width-400,resizemode-4/112361662.jpg"

Virat Kohli , Rishabh Pant , and debutant Riyan Parag all fell victim to the spin trap, as India's batting lineup crumbled under pressure.Earlier, Sri Lanka posted a competitive total of 248/7, thanks to a well-paced 96 from opener Avishka Fernando and a solid contribution from Kusal Mendis (59). Fernando's innings laid the foundation for Sri Lanka, as he shared crucial partnerships with Pathum Nissanka (45) and Mendis.India's bowling effort was led by debutant Riyan Parag, who picked up three wickets, while Kuldeep Yadav provided valuable support. However, the Sri Lankan batters managed to capitalize on the Indian bowlers' inconsistencies, with Mohammed Siraj proving expensive.The series victory marked a significant achievement for Sri Lanka, as they had not won a bilateral ODI series against India since 1997. The result also highlighted the challenges faced by the Indian team on turning tracks, as acknowledged by Maheesh Theekshana in his post-match comments.""We knew they are used to small grounds and good wickets in India.

NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka 's resounding 32-run victory in the second ODI brought an end to India's impressive streak of 11 consecutive bilateral series triumphs against them in the 50-over format.The last time India was unable to secure a series win against Sri Lanka was back in December 1997, when a three-match home series concluded in a 1-1 tie.Despite the intense rivalry between the two Asian nations, which reached its peak during the 2000s, India embarked on a remarkable run of 11 straight bilateral series victories against the Lankan Lions, commencing with a 6-1 win in a seven-match series in late 2005 and culminating in a 3-0 series win in India last year.During this period, India emerged victorious in five away series against Sri Lanka. This is a remarkable achievement for the Indian team, considering the tough conditions and the strong opposition they faced in Sri Lanka.India's consistent performance in the ODI format can be attributed to their formidable batting lineup and a bowling attack capable of taking crucial wickets at key moments.The defeat in the second ODI serves as a wake-up call for the Indian team, who will be determined to bounce back in the remaining matches of the series. The team management will need to carefully assess the areas that require improvement, particularly the batting department, which struggled in the second ODI.Conversely, Sri Lanka will be energized by this victory and will aim to sustain the momentum throughout the remaining matches. The team has demonstrated their ability to compete with the world's best and will strive to build upon this success in the future.This series is shaping up to be a thrilling contest, with both teams giving their all on the field.

Virat Kohli , Shreyas Iyer , Shubman Gill and KL Rahul had fairly long batting sessions. Neither Mohammed Siraj nor Arshdeep Singh bowled.Ryan ten Doeschate adds, ""We're trying to be very specific and learn from the mistakes in the first couple of games since the conditions have been very tough, guys have come up with their own plans and how they want to go about it. It's more of a mental point of view, they're all fantastic players of spin, that's not likely to be an issue. We're trying to just form an environment where the guys feel positive where they can really express themselves and go out to show how good they are. I think it's admirable how the guys one-up with themselves under pressure. They feel that we'll at least share the series with Sri Lanka. And the preparation has been made around that we can be our best.""With the second match ending in a loss, India now has the choice of fielding their strongest XI or experimenting ahead of the next major ICC tournament, which takes place in just six months.Abhishek Nayar concludes, ""I think as Indians we are emotional people and normally when sometimes you don't get results our way, there is a lot of passion and integrity at stake for every individual so every cricketer in that dressing room knows what's at stake and a lot of time that sort of brings the best out of the team and it bring out that fighting spirit that you want to often see in our team, then you obviously try to implement that in the centre with all the strategies that you come with, all the discussions that we have in the dressing room, sometimes, being pushed against the wall brings the best out of us.""A loss would come as a shock to the recently recruited Gautam Gambhir-led coaching staff, who took over a team that had played some of the best ODI cricket in India less than a year ago. Despite their early success, they wouldn't want to come to a conclusion on a note where they had more questions than answers at the end of their two-week tour to Sri Lanka.",The Indian cricket board shared a video on their official X handle that showed the Rohit Sharma-led team hitting the nets on Tuesday.

3rd ODI: Will India stave off Sri Lanka to keep a nearly three-decade long record intact?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/3rd-odi-will-india-stave-off-sri-lanka-to-keep-a-nearly-three-decade-long-record-intact/articleshow/112308862.cms,"The Indian batsmen will need to tactically navigate the spin challenge in the third and decisive ODI on Wednesday to prevent their first series loss to Sri Lanka in nearly three decades, 27 years to be precise. The path has been set by captain Rohit Sharma , and it is up to the rest of the batting lineup to follow the skipper.In his maiden ODI series as head coach, this is definitely not the start Gautam Gambhir would have envisioned, given his emphasis on winning.India were last defeated in a bilateral ODI series against the Lankans in 1997. India haven't lost for 11 series of 50-over internationals between the two teams since then.However, the visitors find themselves in an unfamiliar position, after a tie in the opening match and a 32-run defeat in the second. Winning the three-match series is now beyond India's grasp, and the team will be determined to avoid a defeat in the final match of the series at Colombo 's R Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday.This position of discomfort is brought upon the team largely by their batsmen, who seemed to have been plagued by indecisiveness on a pitch that offered plenty of turn to the spinners.Star batter Virat Kohli epitomized the team's fragility more than anyone else. Besides scoring only 38 runs in two matches, it's the nature of Kohli's dismissals that has raised concerns.Kohli has appeared subdued in the middle, after the explosive starts provided by Rohit in the two games. The master batter within Kohli remained dormant as he struggled against the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and Jeffrey Vandersay, who claimed six wickets, in the second, before eventually succumbing to them.Perhaps, Kohli should focus on the happier memories rather than allowing his mind to be shackled by the current challenges. India's success in the middle overs, whether chasing or setting a target, heavily relies on a free-flowing Kohli.Shivam Dube, India's designated spin-basher, failed to read a simple leg-break from Vandersay in the second one-dayer, resulting in an lbw dismissal. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, known for their prowess against spinners, have struggled to use their feet and wrists effectively against the Lankan slow bowlers.The solution possibly lies in observing Rohit's batting, not necessarily his approach, but the confidence and strategy behind his innings.Rohit's mastery over the Lankan bowlers, both pace and spin, has been remarkable. His 44-ball 64 was a display of well-calculated strokes that never seemed risky.The team management may reconsider Dube's position in the lineup when deciding the eleven for the match on Wednesday.Given the conditions in Colombo and the nature of the pitch, batting allrounder Riyan Parag's spin bowling can prove more useful than Dube's straightforward medium pace.On their end, the Indian bowlers need to step up their performance in the crucial stages of the game as the previous matches highlight their failure to bowl the hosts out for a low score despite reducing them to 142 for 6 and 136 for 6.","India were last defeated in a bilateral ODI series against the Lankans in 1997.

Will 'Skeleton bone test' be able to end the age fraud menace in Indian grassroots football?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-skeleton-bone-test-be-able-to-end-the-age-fraud-menace-in-indian-grassroots-football/articleshow/112229085.cms,"What is a skeleton bone test?

NEW DELHI: If you google "" age fraud in Indian football "", you'll find countless entries, articles, short-form, long-form, evidence-driven ones, written by countless writers, journalists, and observers of the beautiful game of football.One can find the news of the Indian under-15 football team's captain turning out to be almost eighteen months over the age limit for the Asian under-16 championship in April 2019 or an under-17 player initially rejected by coach Nicolai Adam for his ""unnatural height"" at age 14 was later accepted into the team under Luis Norton de Matos, everything is already so well-documented.While age fraud remains a persistent issue in Indian football, we should now be looking for a more permanent and accurate solution to fight it.And it should begin early, from the grassroots level of Indian football, like the Subroto Cup , an annual school football tournament held in India, named after Subroto Mukerjee, the founder of the Air India Football Club. The prestigious tournament, established in 1960, was once graced by players like Baichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri and will enter its 63rd edition on August 5.Aimed at promoting the sport at the grassroots level, it will host a jaw-dropping 111 teams across three categories, with the sub-junior (under-15) category introduced for the first time this year. It will also have some teams from foreign countries too.To fight the demon of age fraud, the organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament, offering a promising solution to address this issue effectively.During the opening press conference of the Subroto Cup, TimesofIndia.com raised concerns about age fraud. Answering, an Air Force Sports Control Board (AFSCB) spokesperson stated, ""All and every footballer (who will be participating in the Subroto Cup) is registered on the AIFF website. And each of them gets a unique code. We also want to avoid age fraud. As per the AIFF guidelines, a skeleton bone test will be done for the under-15 boys category. For the under-17 category, it will be normal medical. The skeleton bone test or the age-detection test will all be done under the guidelines of AIFF.""The skeleton bone test, commonly known as a bone age assessment, estimates a person's age, especially in children and adolescents, by analyzing their bones.This process typically involves taking an X-ray of the left hand and wrist, as this area contains bones that undergo predictable developmental changes with age. The X-ray is then compared to standard reference images, such as those in the Greulich-Pyle Atlas, to determine the bone's developmental stage, including the appearance of growth plates and the fusion of epiphyses.It is understood that 22 teams in the under-14 category were disqualified and did not participate in the Subroto Cup after failing the age-determination test last time. According to AIFF guidelines, if four or more players from a team are found to be over-aged, that team will be immediately disqualified and barred from the tournament.""Apart from that, all the players who have already registered through AIFF and CRS (central registration system), have their age verified. The people who are coming are less in numbers. So, in times to come, age fraud, which is prevalent in football, is likely to reduce,"" he ended on a positive note, sounding hopeful, as we all are, of a better future.","The Subroto Cup is an annual school football tournament held in India.
