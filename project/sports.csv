After Delhi Capitals defeated Lucknow Super Giants on Tuesday to keep their slender playoffs qualification hopes alive, Rajasthan Royals became the second team to book a spot in the top four of the ongoing Indian Premier League Only six league matches left in the tournament, and five teams are still in the fray for the two remaining playoff spots.Here's the chances of the teams in contention of the final two spots in the IPL playoffs: KKR now have a 75% chance of finishing sole toppers and a 25% chance of ending up in sole second spot, assuming no more matches get rained off.If they win their last game, they will top. They could top even if they lose their last game, provided RR don’t win both their remaining games* RR will top the table if they win their remaining games. Their chances of being sole toppers are a respectable 25%. They also have about 40% chance of finishing sole second. They are now guaranteed qualification because even if they lose both their remaining games, they will either finish sole third or tied for third with* Third placed CSK are sure to finish among the top four teams on points, but are not assured of qualification. They could end up tied third with up to four other teams (DC, RCB, SRH and LSG) or tied fourth with up to three other teams (DC, RCB and LSG) depending on results in other games. What helps is their better net run rate at this stage* Fourth placed SRH too are sure to finish among the top four on points, but they too are not sure of qualification. They could find themselves in a tie with four other teams (DC, RCB, CSK and LSG) for third place if they lose both their remaining games. They could also end up in a three-way tie for fourth spot with DC and LSG. But even just one win from their two remaining games would guarantee qualification* Fifth placed DC’s chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, have doubled to 62.5% thanks to Tuesday’s win. But they are far from sure of qualifying. A third place finish on points would involve a four-way or five-way tie, while finishing fourth would mean a two-way to four-way tie depending on results in other games* Sixth placed RCB have a 50% chance of making it to the top four spots on points, singly or jointly. Their last game against CSK is a must-win, but even winning it is not enough. Other results will need to go their way* Seventh placed LSG, despite Tuesday’s loss, are not out of it yet. They still have a 31% chance of finishing among the top four spots on points, singly or jointly. The bad news, however, is that finishing third would involve a five-way tie while ending up joint fourth would mean a three-way or four-way tie and their NRR is the worst among all the teams they could tie with* MI, PBKS and GT have already been knocked out.",Five teams are still in the fray for the two remaining playoff spots. Delhi Capitals defeated Lucknow Super Giants on Tuesday to keep their slender playoffs qualification hopes alive. Rajasthan Royals became the second team to book a spot in the top four of the ongoing Indian Premier League.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110131603,imgsize-112042,width-400,resizemode-4/110131603.jpg"

With Jake Fraser-McGurk and Tristan Stubbs bringing intimidating hitting through the second half of the IPL , Abhishek Porel on Tuesday showed he has brought in consistency to his elegant strokeplay.Against a rather thoughtful Lucknow Super Giants bowling attack on a tiring Kotla track, Porel made up for McGurk’s rare failure with a sublime 33-ball 58 to lay the foundation for the hulk-like Stubbs to close the innings with an unbeaten 25-ball 57 as Capitals posted 208/4.The maturity of the two batters in their early 20s trumped the experienced LSG top order as Capitals finished the league stage with a 19-run win and 14 points.While defending the total, the experience of Ishant Sharma (3/34) and Kuldeep Yadav (1/33) knocked the wind out of the LSG batting despite Nicholas Pooran’s ominous knock of 27-ball 61, Arshad Khan’s late charge of unbeaten 58 off 33 to take LSG to 189/9 and Capitals’ customary ordinary catching abilities.Tuesday’s result, however, has placed both teams on the verge of falling short of making it to the playoffs.Capitals’ have been spoilt by McGurk’s onslaught up front in an innings. When the maverick opener was thoughtfully dismissed for a duck at long on off the second ball of the innings bowled by left-arm seamer Arshad Khan, it seemed Capitals could fall behind on a surface that has regularly produced scores of well above 200 this year.But Porel raised his hand this time to calm the Capitals dugout before Stubbs allayed all fears of a possible collapse and powerfully finish the innings on a high.Porel isn’t anything like McGurk’s muscle game. It was all timing and match awareness that saw Porel take Capitals 73/1 at the end of the powerplay. By the time he reached his 50 off just 21 balls, he had already hit four sixes and five boundaries. The pitch wasn’t as flat as it has been here this IPL. The cutters into pitch stopped on the batters as Shai Hope had to really wait to pick his deliveries to go big.Perhaps, it was the heat coupled with some shrewd bowling into pitch by Ravi Bishnoi that put the brakes on the Capitals charge. Porel seemed to be running out of gas even as his skipper Rishabh Pant was taking his time to score 33 off 23.Once Porel was dismissed caught at deep mid-wicket, it looked like Bishnoi and left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan had worked out a way to apply the choke with spells of 1/26 and 0/29 respectively.This is where Stubbs displayed his rapid evolution as a batter. He batted just 25 balls and hit four sixes and three boundaries. But the innings was well thought out.Understanding that going after spin straightaway isn’t his strongest game, he bided his time against the Bishnoi by knocking him into the gaps for singles. But he unleashed his fury at the back end of the innings.",Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants by 19 runs in IPL. Abhishek Porel and Tristan Stubbs top scored with 58 and 57 respectively. Capitals finished the league stage with a 19-run win and 14 points.

With three teams eliminated and one assured of a top-two finish, there are six teams still in the race to IPL 2024 playoffs with only seven league-stage matches left to play.The rain-abandoned match between Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Monday meant that the two-time champions KKR (19 points, 1 match left) assured themselves of a top-two finish, while Gujarat joined Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians as the teams eliminated from the race to playoffs.On Tuesday, Delhi Capitals (DC) host the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), and with every match now, the playoff scenarios change.With the sun turning Delhi into a hot furnace, there is no threat of a Ahmedabad-like weather affecting the DC vs LSG match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in the national capital. So based on the two possible results, here's how the fortunes of the two teams will get affected.Occupuing the sixth spot on the table currently with 12 points from 13 matches, this is Delhi's last league match, which means losing is not an option at all because if LSG win, Rishabh Pant & Co will become the fourth team to bow out.Lucknow also have 12 points but have played a match less than Delhi. But a win over DC won't assure Lucknow of a place in the playoffs. Their chances will improve but to qualify, they will have to beat Mumbai Indians in their last match and hope that the Sunrisers Hyderabad (14 points, 2 matches left) lose both their remaining matches.A win for DC will mean that they stay in the race to playoffs but their faint hopes will heavily depends on results in other league matches.If Delhi beat Lucknow, they will then want Royal Challengers Bengaluru (12 points, 1 match left) and LSG to lose their remaining matches. Besides that, Sunrisers will need to lose their last two games with big margins for DC to enter the playoffs.","Rain-abandoned match between Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Monday meant that the two-time champions KKR (19 points, 1 match left) assured themselves of a top-two finish.

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Ravi Shastri took a swipe at the concept of the Spirit of Cricket while discussing on veteran Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin 's YouTube channel, suggesting that he prioritises adherence to rules over the ""spirit of cricket.""Shastri's remarks come in the context of incidents during India's Test series in England in 2021, during which India secured a historic victory at Lord's in the second Test.One notable incident involved England's James Anderson engaging in a heated argument with Indian players, particularly Jasprit Bumrah .During the match, Bumrah delivered a series of bouncers to Anderson, resulting in him being struck on the helmet, ribs, and left hand. This led to a tense exchange of words between the players involved.Reminiscing on the argument, Shastri said on Ashwin's channel, ""What is wrong with that? You got a bat in your hand. There is no rule that tail-enders you should not(bounce). Then declare the innings, no? If it gets too hot in the kitchen and you do not want to be there, then stay inside, be clear, your fingers are fine, everything is fine, and you can bowl as much as you want so that you are not injured.""Shastri continued to discuss the concept of the 'Spirit of Cricket,' which has garnered significant attention recently, particularly concerning incidents of batters being run out at the non-striker's end. Although this mode of dismissal is entirely legal within the rules of the game, it has been viewed by many experts and fans as going against the spirit of cricket.One notable incident involved Ashwin, who famously dismissed England batterJos Buttler in a similar manner during an IPL game. Ashwin's action attracted criticism, with many fans and experts calling for bowlers to warn the non-striker before executing such a dismissal.Several other players, including Indian women's cricketer Deepti Sharma , have also employed this mode of dismissal, resulting in criticism from ex-cricketers and fans alike. Critics argue that the 'spirit of cricket' should take precedence over strict adherence to the rules in such cases.Shastri said that he is a believer in rules, rather than the spirit.""Forget spirit. I believe in rules. You (Ashwin) mankaded a guy, it rules, there's a rule book, observe the damn rules. A guy running two steps ahead, 'It's not fair, you should warn me.' For what warn? The rule says you're cheating. I hate warnings. I'll take the bails off straightaway. On your bike now! Rule book page 33. Don't whinge and moan after the event. It's there.

NEW DELHI: The Punjab Kings are set to resume action against the Rajasthan Royals at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati on Wednesday, aiming to conclude the season positively.Although they haven't advanced further in the competition, the Kings' squad sees the remaining two games as an opportunity for the young players to showcase their skills freely and leave a lasting impression in the tournament.During the pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Punjab Kings assistant coach Brad Haddin emphasized that the team management's priority is to provide maximum exposure to inexperienced players in the upcoming matches.""We want the guys to play with freedom. Tomorrow's game is for them to go out there and express themselves. It is another opportunity for younger guys in the team to develop. We are confident that they will take this opportunity and put on a show with the skills we know they have. The players must see these games as opportunities to get that big score and to have that breakout performance in the IPL with which they can kick on for years to come,"" Haddin said.""It's tough being eliminated. But in this tournament, there are always good opportunities to play against quality opposition. From our point of view, we want to make sure that the players forget what has happened before and focus on where they can improve,"" the former Australia international was quoted as saying in a release.Rajasthan Royals have been one of the top teams in the ongoing IPL season, maintaining a consistent winning run. With youngsters like Riyan Parag being spectacular with the bat, veterans such as Sanju Samson chipping in at the top order, and a bowling unit led by speedster Trent Boult, the Royals have posed a hard challenge for all opposition.""We know the quality that Rajasthan Royals have. They have got some really good bowlers up front with Boult, and they got two quality spinners in the middle, and they got a lot of power at the back. But it's important that we get our process right. We focus on continuing to develop our players,"" Haddin said.The 22-year-old Parag may further have an advantage in Guwahati on Wednesday, as he will be playing the match in his home state and will be familiar with the conditions. On being asked about their strategies to tackle the explosive batter, Haddin revealed a secret weapon.""If you look at Riyan's development over the last couple of years, he's gradually got better and better. This year, he has been starting to win games. But we're lucky we have a secret weapon to tackle him in Trevor Gonsalves, who has coached him all the way through. He gave some really good insights into him during the team meeting. So, we have a couple of plans,"" he said.Further speaking on the threat posed by Samson, Haddin added: ""Samson has also played some really good cricket for a long, long time. Now he's one of the important wickets for the opposition. But that is an opportunity for our bowling group who have been good throughout the tournament. Samson is among the players our bowlers would want to make uncomfortable and get the wicket of and put the odds back in our favour.""Haddin further praised the pitch in Guwahati and said that his side have a good experience of playing on the surface. ""The pitch is very impressive. We had a good run last night and the surface looks great. We were lucky enough to have a bit of practice on one of the centre wickets as well and it was really consistent. The wickets outside are also of good quality. We have good memories here as well; I think we won last year as well. So, we can take a bit of confidence that we understand the surface,"" he said.With Liam Livingstone and Kagiso Rabada returning home due to injuries, Punjab Kings are expected to make a few changes against Rajasthan. On being asked about the possible playing team, Haddin kept the cards close to his chest.""There will be a few changes with Livingstone and Rabada returning home.

Suman Sharma steps down as Kerala women’s cricket team coach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/suman-sharma-steps-down-as-kerala-womens-cricket-team-coach/articleshow/110125346.cms,"KOCHI: A key figure in making the Kerala women’s team a force to reckon with in domestic cricket circuit and the one who facilitated the entry of Wayanad girls, Minnu Mani and Sajana Sajeevan , into the Indian team, Suman Sharma , is bidding goodbye to state cricket. The former Delhi cricketer has stepped down as the head coach of the Kerala women’s team.Suman first assumed charge of the state women’s team before the 2013-14 season.Barring a two-year break, she has been the guiding force for Kerala’s women cricketers for more than a decade.“In the previous years, I had rejected offers that came my way and focused on the betterment of Kerala cricket. But I feel now the time is right to move on. It’s been a great journey for me with Kerala cricket , and I will be forever grateful for the support extended by the players, the support staff, and office-bearers of KCA,” Suman told TOI.Low on confidence, the Kerala women’s team were a bunch of pushovers when Suman arrived on the scene. Slowly but steadily, she instilled in them a more professional approach. During the 2022-23 season, the Kerala women’s team went on to beat the mighty Railways. Though silverware eluded them, Kerala team has been performing on a consistent basis in the last five years.“Kerala players have become more confident. There is a sea change in the fitness level of the players. The team now has a foundation, and all it needs to do is to build from it,” added Suman.But the biggest gain for Kerala cricket from Suman’s tenure has been that she has been able to produce two international cricketers. “It makes me proud when I see Minnu and Sajana playing in India colours. It has served as an inspiration to other Kerala girls. I see a bright future for the Kerala women’s team and feel that more cricketers from the region will represent the country in days to come,” she said.Both Minnu and Sajana have acknowledged the role played by Suman in their achievements. Minnu, in fact, was taken by surprise when TOI informed her of Suman’s decision to quit as Kerala women’s coach. “I am attending a national camp in Pune and was not aware of the development. Her void will be difficult to fill,” Minnu said.“The biggest contribution of Suman mam has been that she has made our team a strong batting unit. On a personal level, she has been my go-to person. I used to call her before my matches in my debut series in Bangladesh. Her tips on mental preparation before each game at the international level were quite helpful. I will always be grateful to her as I believe she has made me a better cricketer,” added Minnu.The Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) has wasted no time in seeking a replacement for Suman as they have sought applications from suitable candidates for the post of head coach of the Kerala women’s team on its official website.","Suman Sharma has stepped down as the head coach of the Kerala women’s team.

NEW DELHI: The family of the late Diego Maradona is taking legal action to prevent the sale of the Golden Ball trophy he received after Argentina's victory in the 1986 World Cup . The trophy, which had been missing for years, recently resurfaced and is scheduled to be auctioned off in Paris by Aguttes auction house.Maradona's heirs claim that the trophy was stolen and that the current owner has no right to sell it.Gilles Moreu, a lawyer representing two of Maradona's daughters, plans to file an urgent request with the Nanterre judicial court to have the Golden Ball removed from the auction. He will also seek a judicial sequestration of the trophy and file a complaint for theft and concealed theft.According to Aguttes, the trophy reappeared in 2016 as part of a private collection acquired at an auction in Paris. Maradona received the award in 1986 at a ceremony at the Lido cabaret on the Champs-Élysées, but it subsequently disappeared, leading to various rumours about its whereabouts. Some speculate that it was lost in a poker game or sold to pay off debts, while others believe it was stolen from a Naples bank where Maradona had stored it.Maradona's family only recently discovered that the trophy had been stolen and wants the sale to be prohibited, as they believe the Golden Ball rightfully belongs to them. The auction house argues that the person who purchased the trophy years ago was unaware that it had been stolen.The Paradox Lawyers firm, representing Maradona's heirs, stated, ""If the owner of an object can claim ownership under French law, it is on the obvious condition that his or her good faith cannot be called into question. This cannot be the case for the owner of a trophy that was famously stolen from Diego Maradona and whose heirs can legally claim ownership.""The auction house expects the trophy to fetch millions due to its uniqueness, and bidders will be required to make a deposit of 150,000 euros ($161,000) to participate in the June 6 auction.","Diego Maradona's family is taking legal action to prevent the sale of the Golden Ball trophy he received after Argentina's victory in the 1986 World Cup.

He leaves PSG as the club's all-time leading scorer with 256 goals since joining from Monaco in 2017 for a fee of 180 million euros ($194 million).PSG had already secured a record-extending 12th French title and their 10th in 12 years before the match against Toulouse. The celebrations following the game were intended to focus on their title triumph rather than serving as a specific tribute to Mbappe. PSG can still complete a domestic treble by winning the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25, having already claimed the Champions Trophy, France's equivalent of the Super Cup.In other Ligue 1 action, Monaco secured second place and direct qualification for next season's Champions League with a 2-0 victory at Montpellier.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal revived their hopes of clinching the Premier League title by overcoming their Old Trafford struggles with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Sunday, propelling them back to the top of the table.Leandro Trossard 's goal in the 20th minute proved decisive as Arsenal secured only their second win in 17 away games at United, reclaiming the league summit by a single point.While Manchester City still control their fate in the title race with two matches remaining compared to Arsenal's one, Mikel Arteta 's side kept the pressure on the defending champions ahead of their crucial clash with Tottenham Hotspur .The defeat further compounded United's woes, diminishing their hopes of European competition next season.Despite showing more resilience than in their previous match against Crystal Palace, where they suffered a 4-0 loss, Erik ten Hag's side have struggled for consistency, winning just one of their last eight Premier League games.Arsenal's resurgence in 2024 has been remarkable, winning 15 and drawing one of their 17 league matches since the turn of the year. However, their victory at Old Trafford was far from convincing, as they battled stifling heat and a determined United side.United's injury woes and defensive vulnerabilities were exposed once again, with Casemiro's error leading to Trossard's decisive goal. The absence of key players like Bruno Fernandes only added to their struggles.Despite a spirited second-half display from United, Arsenal held firm defensively, securing their sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games. United's late efforts, including Alejandro Garnacho's chance that hit the side-netting, were not enough to salvage a result.Arsenal's determination to see out the game was evident in their defensive resolve and tactical discipline, denying United any clear-cut opportunities to equalize.As the title race heads towards its conclusion, Arsenal's victory sets up an intriguing finale, with Manchester City still in control of their destiny.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United clinched their first Women's FA Cup title with a commanding 4-0 triumph over Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Sunday. Under the guidance of manager Marc Skinner , the team avenged their defeat in last year's final to Chelsea by putting on a dominant display.The match saw United assert their authority, with midfielder Ella Toone breaking the deadlock on the stroke of halftime with a spectacular strike.After the break, Rachel Williams extended their lead with a well-timed header, followed by two goals from Spanish forward Lucia Garcia , sealing a comprehensive victory.This triumph marks a significant milestone for Manchester United's women's team, who have steadily progressed since their reformation in 2018. Winning their first major trophy will undoubtedly serve as a source of pride and motivation for the players and staff alike as they continue to make strides in women's football.""Wembley is always special. Last year we spoke as a group and said 'one day that will be ours' and today's the day so I'm buzzing,"" said goalkeeper Mary Earps.The atmosphere at Wembley Stadium was electric on a sunny day, with a staggering 76,082 fans in attendance, including Manchester United's co-owner Avram Glazer and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. Despite the anticipation, the first half of the match produced few noteworthy chances, with the breakthrough coming in the second minute of stoppage time.It was England's Ella Toone who seized the moment, driving the ball forward and unleashing a powerful strike from outside the area that found the top corner of the net. This stunning goal gave Manchester United a crucial lead heading into halftime.Tottenham, appearing in their first-ever FA Cup final, struggled to pose any attacking threat throughout the match, failing to register a single shot on target. Their hopes were further dashed after the break as United's Rachel Williams, a former Spurs player who had previously won the FA Cup with Birmingham City, rose high to head in a free kick, extending United's lead.Spanish forward Lucia Garcia capitalized on a mistake from Tottenham goalkeeper Becky Spencer, intercepting a poor pass and slotting the ball into the net to make it 3-0 in the 57th minute. Garcia then secured her brace, and United's victory, with another goal in the 74th minute, this time via a deflection.This triumph comes as a bright spot in Manchester United's challenging season, where they have struggled in the league standings, currently sitting fifth. Winning the Women's FA Cup represents a significant achievement for the club and underscores their progress since reforming the women's team in 2018.""We don't like to admit it but it does mask over the issues we've had,"" goalscorer Williams, 36, told the BBC. ""We have had some ups and downs this year. That's for Marc (Skinner) and the backroom staff to be like 'right, this is what we have to do in the summer'.""We are going to have change things next year. We have had some injuries, three or four ACLs, at the start of the season.""That's football, teams go through transition. You have a good year, you have a dip. Next year we might just come back bigger, better and stronger and, who knows, we might just be lifting the league.""",Manchester United beat Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 in the Women's FA Cup final.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi played the full 90 minutes in Inter Miami's 3-2 victory over Montreal on Saturday night, despite a brief injury scare in the first half. Benjamin Cremaschi scored the decisive goal in the 59th minute, helping Inter Miami secure their fifth straight Major League Soccer win after overcoming a two-goal deficit.Luis Suarez and Matías Rojas also found the back of the net for Inter Miami, while Jules-Anthony Vilsaint and Bryce Duke scored for Montreal (3-5-3).Inter Miami (8-2-3) stretched their unbeaten run to seven matches (5-0-2), even though Messi failed to score or assist for the first time in his nine MLS appearances this season. The team has a 7-0-2 record in those nine games, with one of their losses coming against Montreal in March when Messi was not playing.Messi experienced a concerning moment towards the end of the first half when he was fouled by George Campbell . The impact of the challenge caused Messi to fall to the ground, visibly in pain and clutching his left knee.Inter Miami's medical staff attended to Messi on the field, and after about two minutes, he got up and walked to the sideline. He was not substituted, allowing him to return to the game shortly after.Remarkably, the match dynamics shifted following Messi's injury scare. Inter Miami was trailing 2-0 when Messi got hurt, but the score was 2-1 when he returned, and they equalized moments after he re-entered the field. Rojas scored from a free kick that Messi would typically take, putting Inter Miami on the scoreboard. Suarez then tapped in a goal from a corner kick late in first-half stoppage time, becoming the third player in MLS history to score 11 goals in his first 800 minutes of a season.Cremaschi's go-ahead goal came when Rojas sent a ball into open space, and the young midfielder ran it down, nudging the ball just past two defenders and into the net for a 3-2 lead. Messi had two chances to extend the lead in the final minutes but narrowly missed both.The match attracted a sellout crowd of 19,619 spectators, with Montreal selling out its 15,000 season tickets for the first time since joining MLS in 2012, largely due to Messi's arrival in the league last summer. Messi has now scored in 31 countries throughout his career.",Lionel Messi played the full 90 minutes in Inter Miami's 3-2 victory over Montreal.

""I don't know, to be honest. I have to check that. Training was different. I was going for kind of easy training yesterday. I didn't feel anything, but I also didn't feel the same.

The defeat came just two days after he was struck on the head by a bottle, an incident that left him experiencing symptoms of nausea and dizziness.Djokovic's bid for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title came to an abrupt end at the hands of Alejandro Tabilo , a Chilean player ranked 32nd in the world.Tabilo's victory marked his first win over a top-10 opponent, as he defeated Djokovic convincingly with a scoreline of 6-2, 6-3.The 24-time Grand Slam champion attributed his subdued performance to the blow he sustained while greeting fans after his second-round win.Despite initially downplaying the incident and even wearing a cycling crash helmet to training the following morning, Djokovic acknowledged that the effects of the injury may have contributed to his underwhelming performance on the court.The unexpected loss in Rome serves as a setback for Djokovic, particularly as he had enjoyed success at the tournament in the past, having won six titles there.The incident highlights the physical toll that even seemingly minor injuries can have on professional athletes, underscoring the importance of health and safety in sports.""I don't know, to be honest. I have to check that. Training was different. I was going for kind of easy training yesterday. I didn't feel anything, but I also didn't feel the same,"" Djokovic told reporters.""Today under high stress, it was quite bad -- not in terms of pain, but in terms of this balance. Just no coordination. Completely different player from what it was two nights ago.""Djokovic also said that he would have scans to ""see what's going on"" before the French Open in Paris, where he will head not just worried by the after-effects of the bottle incident but also his form.The last time Djokovic got to Roland Garros without a title to his name that season was in 2018, when his first honour of the campaign came at Wimbledon.With the French Open getting underway in two weeks and where he is the defending champion, Djokovic admitted that ""everything needs to be better in order for me to have at least a chance to win"" a 25th Grand Slam.""The way I felt on the court today was just completely like a different player entered into my shoes,"" added Djokovic. ""It's a bit concerning.""With Djokovic's unexpected early elimination from the Rome Open, the landscape of the last major men's tournament before Roland Garros has become wide open. The absence of the top-ranked player leaves an opportunity for other contenders to make their mark.In the day's final match on center court, third seed Alexander Zverev is set to face off against Luciano Darderi, a home hope ranked 54th in the world. This match presents an intriguing battle between an established top player and a rising talent, with both players eager to make their presence felt in the tournament.Meanwhile, Tabilo's impressive victory over Djokovic has captured attention, as he demonstrated exceptional skill and composure against his superstar opponent. Tabilo's performance, marked by 22 winners, only four unforced errors, and no break points faced, solidifies his status as a formidable contender in the tournament.""Honestly in no moment was I like, Okay, I can win this,"" said a delighted Tabilo.""I was playing incredible tennis. Just wanted to keep that level... The whole match I was just trying to take it point by point, not think about the score. Every point was like the start of the match.""Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka cruised into the last 16 of the women's tournament with a straight-sets victory over Dayana Yastremska, 6-4, 6-2.Second seed Sabalenka claimed her first win in four matches against Ukrainian Yastremska to set up a clash in the next round with Elina Svitolina, a two-time winner at the Foro Italico, who comfortably beat Anna Kalinskaya 6-3, 6-3.The 26-year-old Belarusian made short work of Yastremska, dispatching her opponent in one hour and 28 minutes without dropping a service game and never looking in trouble.Sabalenka, who has never won in Rome but is a two-time champion on the Madrid clay, looks in good shape to at least match her 2022 run to the semi-finals.""Every time I was losing here, I was so sad,"" she told reporters.""I felt like I lost on the Grand Slam because it was one of the dream tournaments for me to win.""Earlier fifth seed Maria Sakkari lined up a probable last-16 clash with Victoria Azarenka who beat 80th-ranked Egyptian Mayar Sherif 6-2, 6-7 (6/8), 6-3.","Novak Djokovic loses to Alejandro Tabilo 6-2, 6-3 in third round of Rome Open.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic 's early exit from the Rome Open 's third round on Sunday came as a shock, as he faced a stunning 6-2, 6-3 defeat at the hands of Alejandro Tabilo . This loss, against a player ranked 32nd in the world, marked Djokovic's bid for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title.Tabilo's victory was particularly noteworthy as it marked his first win over a top-10 opponent.Djokovic's subdued performance raised questions, especially since he had recently endured an accidental blow to the head by a bottle, just two days prior, following his second-round win over Corentin Moutet.Despite light-hearted responses such as wearing a cycling crash helmet during practice, his performance suggested lingering effects from the incident.Djokovic's elimination is a setback for him just before Roland Garros, the next major tournament. Additionally, the absence of notable players like Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz has disappointed fans.The absence of Italian favorites Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Musetti, along with Djokovic's clay-court rival Rafael Nadal's early exit in the second round, has further dampened the event's atmosphere.Tabilo's victory was well-deserved, with the Chilean dominating from the start, quickly securing a 4-0 lead in the first set and displaying an array of impressive shots. Despite Djokovic's efforts, Tabilo continued his momentum, ultimately claiming victory in remarkable fashion.","Novak Djokovic loses 6-2, 6-3 to Alejandro Tabilo in third round of Rome Open.

He's just bigger than the sport at the end of the day.""In other matches, defending champion Daniil Medvedev advanced to the third round, while Stefanos Tsitsipas and Andrey Rublev had to fight back from a set down to secure their victories.World number one Novak Djokovic , who was accidentally hit by a water bottle while signing autographs, showed up to practice wearing a cycling crash helmet.In the women's tournament, Iga Swiatek , Naomi Osaka , and Coco Gauff all progressed to the last 16.

Rafael Nadal suffered a disappointing exit from the Rome Open on Saturday, bowing out in the second round with a 6-1, 6-3 loss to Poland's Hubert Hurkacz .This defeat to the seventh seed raises questions about whether the clay-court maestro will participate in the upcoming French Open, where he boasts a record 14 titles.Nadal has emphasized that his decision to compete at Roland Garros hinges on his sense of competitiveness, particularly given his recent string of injury setbacks.Currently ranked 305th in the world, Nadal remains cautious about committing to the prestigious tournament.And the manner of his elimination in his first ever encounter with 27-year-old Hurkacz was a step backwards after reaching the last 16 in Madrid.Nadal held his own in the first two games in the first set, which took 26 minutes to complete, but then fell away as errors handed Hurkacz points.The 37-year-old twice gave away breaks of serve with miscued drop shots in the first set which Hurkacz closed out in 49 minutes as he blew through five straight games.And the match was as good as done when Hurkacz, who did not drop a single service game, broke Nadal in the third game of the second set to set up a famous victory.That level of dominance over Nadal on clay, much less a court where he has won a record 10 titles, would have been unimaginable a few short years ago.But Hurkacz will face Tomas Etcheverry in the third round after likely ending Nadal's love affair with Rome as the 22-time Grand Slam winner looks set to call time on his career at the end of the season.","Rafael Nadal loses 6-1, 6-3 to Hubert Hurkacz in the second round of the Rome Open. The defeat raises questions about whether the Spaniard will play at the French Open.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic emerged victorious with a 6-3, 6-1 win over France's Corentin Moutet , advancing to the third round of the Rome Open on Friday. However, as he was signing autographs for fans while exiting the centre court at the Foro Italico , Djokovic was struck by a hard plastic water bottle on the back of his head, leaving him in agony and crouched on the ground.Security staff led the 24-time Grand Slam winner from the arena, covering him as he made his way into the stands. It remains unclear from the video footage whether the bottle was deliberately launched from the stands or accidentally fell onto Djokovic's head.Watch:However, giving an update on his situation, Djokovic wrote on X, ""Thank you for the messages of concern. This was an accident and I am fine resting at the hotel with an ice pack. See you all on Sunday. ""His next opponent will be Chile's Alejandro Tabilo.

Similarly, Djokovic found his rhythm after a brief challenge from the flamboyant Moutet, winning seven consecutive games from 3-1 down in the first set to take control of the match.A moment of levity occurred when Moutet's phone went off during an absorbing opening game of the second set, which lasted nine minutes and saw the Frenchman save four break points before conceding, allowing Djokovic to cruise to victory.","Novak Djokovic beats France's Corentin Moutet 6-3, 6-1 at the Rome Open.
