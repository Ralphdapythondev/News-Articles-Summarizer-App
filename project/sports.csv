NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket is facing severe backlash following their historic defeat against Bangladesh on Sunday, marking their first-ever Test loss to Bangladesh in 14 matches. The disappointment and frustration among fans and experts have shifted from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and team management to captain Shan Masood , whose leadership is now under scrutiny.Pakistan cricketer Ahmad Shehzad did not hold back in his criticism of Masood, openly questioning his captaincy skills during the Test match in Rawalpindi. Shehzad accused Masood of lacking a basic understanding of Test cricket and criticized his performance both as a captain and a batter.In a video shared on social media platform X, Shehzad expressed his dismay at how fans are now losing interest in watching Pakistan play cricket. ""Whenever Pakistan has a match, people turn off their TVs. And this is something I'm telling you from the public's perspective. If you go to the people, you will understand what they are saying. You can't control the fans anymore,"" Shehzad said.Shehzad went on to criticize Masood's tactical decisions during the game, including his selection of the playing XI and his inability to read the pitch correctly. ""You are the captain of the Pakistan team now, but there is no clarity about your vision. There’s no understanding of your playing XI. You couldn't even read the pitch. You didn't play a spinner. The excuses you gave in the press conference, about managing player workloads with a fourth fast bowler, were incorrect. The brand of cricket we want to play, you explained it wrong,"" Shehzad stated.Further questioning Masood's leadership qualities, Shehzad remarked, ""Aapki apni performance kuch nahi hai. Koi leadership skills aapne dikhayi nahi is pure match ke ander ke. Samajh aati hai aapki bowlers ne performance nahi kiya, unka caliber yahi hai. Samajh aati he ki aapki batsmen ne bura khele paanchwe din, caliber yehi hai. Lekin aap ne bhi as a leader kuch nahi kiya [Your own performance is nothing. You did not show any leadership skills throughout the match. I understand if your bowlers underperformed—that's their caliber. I understand if your batsmen played poorly on the fifth day—that’s their level. But as a leader, you did nothing].""Shehzad emphasized the importance of knowledge and strategic thinking in Test cricket. ""In Test cricket, there is enough time and so much to do, but for that, you need knowledge. You need to be smart. You need to understand these things to execute them through your players. If you don't have the knowledge yourself, how will you guide your players? When there are some minor successes, like a small partnership, you start making forced decisions, moving fielders around unnecessarily, trying to show you're doing something,"" he continued.In his closing remarks, Shehzad was blunt about Masood's shortcomings as a captain, saying, ""You're just trying to cover your face. The problem is that every decision has a method behind it, and you don't know the method. We know that you don't know. Yet, you are the captain of the Pakistan team.""The strong words from Shehzad reflect the growing frustration and disappointment within the cricketing community and among fans. With Pakistan set to face Bangladesh again in the second Test, the pressure is mounting on Masood and the team to deliver a turnaround performance.","Pakistan cricket is facing severe backlash following their historic defeat against Bangladesh on Sunday.

Test spot

COIMBATORE: The recent T20I series in Sri Lanka marked the beginning of not only Gautam Gambhir 's India coaching stint but also Suryakumar Yadav 's tenure as the permanent captain in the shortest format.Both Gambhir and Suryakumar had a lot to smile about at the end of the assignment as they got off to the perfect start with a 3-0 drubbing of the Lankans.With Gambhir throwing his weight behind him, Suryakumar, one of the most destructive batters in T20s, hardly put a foot wrong as skipper. The 33-yearold did not shy away from thinking out of the box when required, a move which enabled India to pull off an improbable win in the third and final match.Gambhir's decision to give a ""free hand"" to the team members is helping players express themselves, according to Suryakumar. ""The way he (Gambhir) played his cricket for India, it was amazing. He understands each player's game. He knows what players like to do on the ground and during practice sessions,"" said Suryakumar, who is in Coimbatore to represent Mumbai in the Buchi Babu tournament Group C match against TNCAXI.""He has given a free hand to everyone. As a team, when we come together, it is important to jot down all the thoughts that players have. We will think about it, go out and be ourselves.""While Suryakumar has been the backbone of India's T20I batting line-up in the last three and-a-half years, he has struggled to break into the Test squad. His only appearance in the longest format came against Australia in Nagpur in Feb 2023.But Suryakumar is motivated to force his way back into the red-ball scheme of things. ""There are a lot of players who have worked hard to earn their place in the Test squad. Even I want to earn a place. After I made my debut for India in Tests, I got injured. The players who have got opportunities, they have done well. Those are the players who deserve the opportunity right now,"" he said.Suryakumar emphasised that playing red-ball cricket has been his top ""priority"" since the time he made his state-team debut. ""The love for red-ball cricket has always been there. Though I made my debut for India in the shorter formats first, I have always enjoyed playing this format. Red-ball cricket has always been the first priority. There is no question about it and that is why I am here ahead of the Duleep Trophy ,"" Suryakumar said.""This format is a little challenging, you have to be one step ahead. You cannot bat like in a T20 game. But at the same time, intent is very important. What body language you carry on the ground, that is very important. If you do well, stay humble.

"Asha, Sajana thank WPL for their T20 WC selection",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/asha-sajana-thank-wpl-for-their-t20-wc-selection/articleshow/112845557.cms,"KOCHI: After making their international debut four months ago in the T20 series against Bangladesh, two women cricketers from Kerala, leggie Asha Shobana and all-rounder Sajana Sajeevan , have been included in the Indian squad for the T20 World Cup to be played in the UAE in October.Apart from the two, the Hyderabad pacer Arundhati Reddy, who plays for Kerala in domestic cricket, has also been included in the Harmanpreet Kaur-led squad.This is the first instance in state cricket history that two Malayali cricketers have been included in India’s World Cup squad. S Sreesanth (2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup) and Sanju Samson (2024 T20 World Cup) have been part of India’s World Cup-winning squads, while Sunil Valson, who has his roots in Kannur but represented Delhi in domestic cricket, was part of Kapil Dev’s World Cup-winning squad in 1983.Asha, who hails from Thiruvananthapuram, has played three T20Is and two ODIs in India colours and has claimed four wickets each in both formats. Wayanad girl Sajana has only played nine T20s for India and has scored 30 runs from four innings.The duo has been the biggest beneficiaries of the Women’s Premier League. Asha, who toiled in domestic cricket for more than a decade, burst into the limelight last season as she claimed 12 wickets to emerge as the second-highest wicket-taker in WPL.“The WPL experience would come in handy in a tournament as big as the World Cup. I bowled to most of the top batters in WPL and know where I should bowl to them. Variations are important for a leg-spinner, and I am working on some innovations. Hopefully, I will be able to bowl some of those in the World Cup and catch our rivals by surprise,” the 33-year-old told TOI.Sajana, on the other hand, grabbed eyeballs after smashing a last-ball six to help Mumbai Indians pull off an unlikely win against Delhi Capitals in the WPL opener last season. The 29-year-old from Chootakadavu near Mananthavady feels that adapting to pressure is the key to success at the international level.“I wouldn’t have been here if it was not for the WPL. Playing for India is a great responsibility, and I must admit I have felt pressure while batting in the middle. I am trying to get better at it and hope to capitalize on the opportunities I get,” Sajana said moments after arriving home from Australia, as she was part of the India ‘A’ squad that was touring Down Under.Sajana also added that having Asha as her teammate in the Indian team is a blessing. “Asha chechi (sister) was my captain when I made my debut for Kerala. She knows me very well and always encourages me to give my best. Since we speak the same language, it is easier to communicate and discuss our approach to the game,” said Sajana.While both Asha and Sajana are elated at their World Cup selection, another Kerala cricketer, Minnu Mani, should be feeling hard done by. Minnu was captain of the Indian ‘A’ team that toured Australia and had claimed a ten-wicket haul in the one-off unofficial Test against the hosts.","Two women cricketers from Kerala, Asha Shobana and Sajana Sajeevan, have been included in the Indian squad for the T20 World Cup to be played in the UAE in October.

Equation with Players

NEW DELHI: The verdict on Jay Shah 's legacy in Indian cricket administration remains uncertain, but his ascent to power, both domestically and internationally, has been undeniably smooth and unobtrusive.At the age of 35, Shah was elected unopposed as the chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC), making him the youngest person ever to hold this position.Those familiar with his work as BCCI secretary attest to his ability to forge personal connections with players.Shah's formal entry into cricket administration was in 2009 when he started working at the district level with the Central Board of Cricket Ahmedabad (CBCA), reported PTI.He later progressed to state-level administration as an executive with the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) and eventually became its joint secretary in 2013.During his tenure at GCA, Shah is recognized for establishing a structured age group coaching system that ensured players were well-prepared for senior cricket by the time they reached the Ranji level. This approach yielded results, as evidenced by Gujarat'sRanji Trophy victory in 2016-17.Shah has managed to establish a strong rapport with players across different levels of the Indian cricket team. Unlike his predecessors, who sought opinions from trusted senior players before heading to the ICC, Shah has a unique equation with anyone who wants to be heard, including skipper Rohit Sharma, star batter Virat Kohli, bowling spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, and next-in-line players like Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya.Rohit even described Shah as one of the ""three pillars"" that made the T20 World Cup triumph possible in the West Indies earlier this year.Shah has successfully navigated through challenging times, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.He oversaw the creation of bio bubbles during the IPL, handled positive cases by creating medical teams within those bubbles, and ensured the completion of tournaments. However, his biggest achievement would be the launch of the Women Premier League (WPL), which offers the best pay package for women's T20 games in the market and sets him apart from his predecessors who never realized the potential of the women's game.Shah's decision to ensure parity by offering equal match fees to the Indian women's cricket team and incentivizing Test cricket with a 10-Test season this year demonstrates his commitment to walking the talk.He also showed that he does not believe in a one-size-fits-all policy by giving deserving breaks to players like Rohit, Kohli, and Bumrah when sought by them. Under his watch, no deserving India cricketer could claim that they were overlooked despite good performances.Shah's tenure has also seen the completion of the new NCA ( National Cricket Academy ), a Centre of Excellence with the capability of holding multiple first-class games at one venue during the domestic season.His bold calls, such as allowing chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar a free hand on matters like Kishan and Iyer's contracts and the elevation of Suryakumar Yadav as captain of the T20 team, showcase his leadership and vision for Indian cricket.","Jay Shah becomes youngest ever ICC chairman at the age of 35.

NEW DELHI: Jay Shah , the 35-year-old BCCI secretary , has been elected unopposed as the youngest ICC chairman in Dubai on Tuesday. Shah will succeed 62-year-old Greg Barclay , who decided not to seek a third consecutive two-year term, and will assume the position on December 1.As a result of this appointment, Shah will step down from his role at the BCCI during the Annual General Meeting, which is expected to take place in late September or October.Shah becomes the fifth Indian to hold this prestigious position, following in the footsteps of Jagmohan Dalmiya , Sharad Pawar, N Srinivasan, and Shashank Manohar .As a key decision-maker in the world's wealthiest cricket board, which contributes over 75 percent of the global body's revenue, Shah's election was virtually assured once he announced his candidacy, reported PTI.It is believed that one of the influential SENA cricket boards (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) proposed Shah, while another seconded the nomination, leaving him as the sole contender on the final day of nominations.The ICC constitution stipulates that there are 17 votes, comprising 12 full Test-playing nations, the chairman, deputy chairman, two associate member nominees, and one independent female director.Shah has been nominated by all 15 members of the ICC Board.Shah's suitability for the role was evident when he was appointed head of the ICC's most influential sub-committee, the Finance and Commercial Affairs (F&CA), in 2022.The timing of Shah's election is advantageous, as he would have been required to take a mandatory three-year cooling-off period from 2025 to 2028 under the BCCI constitution.The constitution allows office-bearers to serve for a cumulative period of 18 years, with nine years in the national board and nine years in state units. However, an individual can only hold office for a maximum of six consecutive years, after which a three-year cooling-off period is required.If all goes according to plan, Shah can serve two terms in the ICC and return to complete his remaining four years in the BCCI in 2028, potentially as the board's president.","Jay Shah elected unopposed as next ICC chairman in Dubai.

It's been disappointing, stop-start throughout my career,"" said the 30-year-old.""This year especially, I've tried to just not look too far ahead. I love playing the game and I just knew that if I go out there and produce those performances, this call might come.""England's pace bowling line-up is undergoing a transformation due to the retirement of seasoned players Stuart Broad and James Anderson .

Stokes sustained a hamstring injury while participating in The Hundred tournament, further impacting the team's dynamics.Amidst these changes, Stone is determined to fill the void left by Wood's absence. Throughout the summer, including England's 3-0 victory against the West Indies, Wood consistently delivered blistering pace. Stone aims to replicate that speed and provide the team with a formidable fast bowling option.""It's been pretty frightening the way he's been bowling,"" added Stone.""Hopefully, I can go out there and try and touch his speeds.

This structure ensures a broader range of matchups and aims to enhance competitive balance and sporting interest by increasing the number of meaningful matches.The top eight teams in the standings will advance directly to the pre-quarterfinals, while those ranked ninth to 24th will enter a new knockout playoff round, leaving the bottom 12 teams eliminated.The allocation of the four additional spots in the competition has been strategically designed to reward performance and promote inclusivity.Two places have been awarded to the national leagues of Italy and Germany, reflecting their clubs' strong performances in UEFA competitions in the previous season.Meanwhile, France's Ligue 1 , being the fifth-ranked national league, secures a third direct entry, and an additional place has been allocated to the champions' path for national champions from lower-ranked countries, enhancing their representation in the tournament.The draw for the competition is conducted using a seeding system based on the UEFA club coefficient, ensuring a mix of teams from different leagues and performance levels.This system, coupled with a sophisticated software program, determines the match schedule, aiming to avoid city clashes and ensuring a diverse and engaging lineup of fixtures.The revamped Champions League format represents a bold step by UEFA to invigorate the competition, offering more games, increased financial rewards, and a more inclusive structure.While it addresses the desires of Europe's footballing elite for enhanced competition and commercial benefits, it also raises concerns about player welfare and the sustainability of an ever-expanding football calendar.","UEFA Champions League has introduced a significant format overhaul for the current season.

It can get us a chance to play with the elite women’s clubs in Asia and it’s through games like that we can assess our true place among the top continental teams,” the coach added.Chhetri also played down the injury that Pyari Xaxa sustained during the game but said the final call will be taken only after more examination.",Odisha FC Women beat Singapore's Lion City Sailors 4-1 in their first game of the preliminary stage of the AFC Women's Champions League.

is admittedly shy, but with every passing season she gets a bit more comfortable under the arclights. After a hectic summer which included the

Paris

Olympic Games, she is now striving to go that extra mile heading into the

US Open

...

There was a moment early in Paris 2024 that resonated with a wholesome Olympic vibe. World No.1 Iga Swiatek, the pre-tournament favourite who finished with a bronze medal, gathered silver medalist Donna Vekic and gold medal winner Qinwen Zheng, the Pole's conqueror in the semifinals, following the presentation ceremony.The medallists arranged themselves for a podium selfie that became the feature of the Games. A keep-sake frame, a proactive call from Swiatek, who held up her medal in a victory statement. A bronze that was as good as gold. For the moment at least.Swiatek, 23, the top-seed at the US Open, who opens against the 104th-ranked Kamilla Rakhimova in the first round on Tuesday, is admittedly shy. But with every passing year, having logged more time in the sports' elite bracket, she's becoming increasingly comfortable in the spotlight.Swiatek, who could meet the fourth seed Kazakh Elena Rybakina in the last four in New York, is the owner of the most solid counter in the draw. In the off-season she added steel to her serve, and it has reflected in the stats.The Pole has won 83.6% of her service games this season, more than any other player in the top 10. She has also saved the most breakpoints in that elite bracket besides winning 64.9% of points on the second serve, the best figures in the top 10.Swiatek, the 2022 US Open champion, has lower expectations from the fortnight this year, given that it has been a hectic summer. ""It has been an intense season, and after the Olympics , it hasn't been easy,"" said Swiatek, who played just one tournament in the lead-up to the major. ""I feel the best when I'm focused on practicing and grinding on the court, focused on making my game better and not thinking about the results. I'm just going to try to keep that mindset,"" she said.What does comfort look like on a tennis court? Reaching wide for a ball on the backcourt, or punching an ace at breakpoint? ""It's a feeling, you're able to do things naturally,"" said Swiatek. ""You don't have to think extra, take care of technicalities or movements, because you can do it just with your intuition.""Swiatek's response to Danielle Collins at the end of their quarterfinal clash at the Olympics carried those very stripes. Organic. For the unversed, the world No. 11 was struggling physically in the clash against Swiatek and when trailing 1-4 in the decider she retired with an abdominal injury.Swiatek, who was walking up to Collins, was met by the American on her side of the court. Collins told Swiatek that she didn't want anyone 'faking' concern over her injury, and that she didn't care for 'insincere' talk.The Pole was visibly stunned. ""I haven't had the best experience, and I don't really feel like anybody needs to be insincere,"" Collins said in her post-match media interaction.Swiatek, who could meet Collins in the last-eight in New York, refused to get into a verbal exchange. ""I would rather not get into this because it is her last year on Tour,"" the world No.1 said. 'I haven't had a chance to tell her she had a great journey and that she has really played well.""That's Swiatek sending a heavily spun forehand into an open court.

Despite being on the back foot early on, world number seven Zheng managed to secure a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over her American opponent.Zheng, who is the first Olympic singles champion from China, was particularly happy to build on her Olympic success.""It's the typical match I will lose, especially after huge success,"" AFP quoted Zheng. ""Usually after huge success I will get a little bit too high, until reality slap me down again and I come back to the ground and trying to be humble and work hard.""At 21, Zheng emphasized the importance of maintaining her focus and avoiding any post-triumph let-downs. Anisimova, however, made it challenging. ""It was really difficult, the match today,"" she noted. ""She's hitting the ball very strong and the only things I feel like I can do today during the match is just to stay with her and find my moment.""Anisimova entered the US Open in good form, having climbed from a ranking of 373rd in the world at the start of the year to within the top 50. Her performance this month in Toronto, where she reached the final, earned her a wildcard invitation to the main draw at Flushing Meadows.""Every ball (from Anisimova) went inside in the beginning and I couldn't do anything,"" Zheng admitted.

Little by little I started to get into the rhythm.""After the match, an on-court interviewer praised Zheng’s Olympic gold medal achievement, prompting her to redirect the focus to her current goals. Reflecting on her runner-up finish to Aryna Sabalenka at the Australian Open, Zheng expressed her desire not to let her form slip again.""This time when I get a success, I'm telling myself, I don't want to let this happen.

"US Open: Under scrutiny, how will Jannik Sinner respond?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-under-scrutiny-how-will-jannik-sinner-respond/articleshow/112793386.cms,"World no. 1 must battle opponents, pressure and glare amid doping row

'My friends know I would never do that'

Never has a world No.1 come into a major as much under scrutiny as Jannik Sinner - the top-seed at the US Open , starting Monday in New York's Queens borough.Anything the 23-year-old says or does in the next fortnight will thunder louder than the air planes that fly over the Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre.A mistimed ball. Silence over speech? Deafening. The Italian, who tested positive twice in March for the banned steroid Clostebol - also used to build muscle mass and fast-track recovery-was cleared of fault or negligence by an independent tribunal on Aug 20.Sinner, who succeeded in compartmentalising the situation these last five months, claiming the Masters 1000 crown in Cincinnati the day before he was cleared of anti-doping violations, was playing with a weight on his shoulders. But now that the positive tests is public knowledge, the pressure will be far greater. Stratospheric levels.Social Media is on steroids. Every other player at his pre-championships press conference was asked about 'the Sinner situation'. The court of public opinion and judgement of the peer group.In a post, Aussie Nick Kyrgios wrote, 'should be gone for two years'. Frances Tiafoe, the last man to play Sinner before the story broke, produced a verbal shrug. ""He's cleared to play,"" the American said. ""That's pretty much what I have to say about it.""Sinner, who was third on the list on Media Day, after Tiafoe and Aryna Sabalenka, started on the front foot. USTA moderator, Gary Sussman, attempted to shut down further questions on the subject, but the world No.1 took it on.""I had to play for months with this on my mind, reminding myself that I haven't done anything wrong,"" Sinner said while adding that he took anti-doping rules seriously.Dr Chaithanya Sridhar, a Bengaluru-based sports psychologist, who has worked with a cross-section of athletes in individual and team sports, said the coming weeks would be a measure of top seed's mental heft.""In the lead up to a major mental preparation and mental energy is big,"" she said. ""There's a routine you follow, to get yourself in that optimum space. His preparation would be shaken in the aftermath. The question is can Sinner use this infraction as an opportunity?""The Italian, in the more brutal half of the draw, is scheduled to open his campaign against American Mackenzie McDonald on Tuesday. He's seeded to play the third ranked Carlos Alcaraz, champion at Roland Garros and Wimbledon , in the semifinal.""It's a difficult moment for him,"" Alcaraz said while billing the situation as complicated.""I believe in a clean sport. I'm pretty sure that there are a lot of things that we don't know. But if they let Jannik to keep playing, (that means) is for something, they said he's innocent.""A lot of the angst in the player community is against the system, which is being seen as having protected the Italian.Novak Djokovic , senior statesman of the sport, going for a historic 25th major title, said cases like that of Sinner's was the reason the Professional Tennis Players Association was founded. ""I understand the frustration of the players,"" the 37-year-old said. ""His case was cleared the moment it was announced, I think five months since the news was brought to him and his team. There is a lot of issues with the system-we lack standardized and clear protocols.""Clostebal it seems also has divisive properties. The locker-room's Mr Nice until a week ago is under the electron microscope now.""Here, I also know who my friend is,"" Sinner said. ""Because my friends, they know that I would never do that.""In the days and weeks to come, the man with the unruly crown will learn that this is not about friends or knowing or not knowing what he would and wouldn't do, this isn't about reputation either. This is about playing your best shots in the face of fire.
