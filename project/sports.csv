Navdeep and coach Naval Singh

NEW DELHI: From enduring taunts about his dwarfism to achieving glory at the Paris Paralympics , Navdeep Singh 's journey is a tale of remarkable resilience. The 4 feet 4 inches tall para javelin sensation secured the gold medal in the F41 classification at the Paris Paralympic Games .After finishing fourth at the Tokyo Paralympics three years ago and claiming bronze at the 2024 World Para Athletics Championship, Navdeep was determined to change his fate this time.He stood proudly atop the podium, with tears in his eyes, as the Indian national anthem played and the tricolor was raised at the roaring Stade de France.Initially awarded the silver, Navdeep's medal was upgraded to gold after Iran’s Sadegh Beit Sayah was disqualified for repeatedly displaying an objectionable flag, violating the International Paralympic Committee’s rules, which prohibit political gestures.Sayah’s unsporting conduct led to his disqualification, allowing Navdeep to take his place as the champion.""I was so surprised when the red card was shown to the Iranian javelin thrower. He started crying. He was in tears and weeping. I also became so emotional that I went to him and hugged him. I consoled him. Until then, I didn’t know what exactly had happened and the reason behind this big decision,"" Navdeep told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview from Paris.For Navdeep, the gold medal is redemption for the heartbreak of finishing fourth at the Tokyo Paralympics.""When I was given the gold medal, I was so happy. Tokyo is in the past now, Paris is the present. I am really delighted that I could make my country proud. I’m really happy I could add one more gold medal to India's tally. People always remember gold,"" an elated Navdeep said.""My first throw was a foul. I looked at my coach, and he asked me to remain calm. In my second attempt, I threw 46-plus. I turned toward my coach and asked him how much I threw in my second attempt. He said 46-plus. I was amazed because I didn’t put much effort into it. It gave me so much spark and motivation to do even better. And then, the rest is history,"" he said.""I never imagined I would throw 47-plus, honestly. I don’t have any idea how I did this. Because during my training just before departing for Paris, I was throwing 41 or 42. But I don’t know how I managed to throw 47-plus,"" Navdeep added.Navdeep follows in the footsteps of two-time Olympic medalist Neeraj Chopra and believes that the technique of falling just before releasing the javelin gives a powerful boost, much like Neeraj does with his throws.Navdeep credits this technique to his coach, Naval Singh, who has been instrumental in shaping his career.""My coach, Naval Singh, has worked a lot with me. He has trained me for almost seven years. He has played a big role in my career. Whatever I am today, it’s because of him. He has made me an international-level javelin thrower. All the credit for my technique and foundation goes to him,"" Navdeep said.""Mera girna mera akhiri upay hota hai. Jab gir jata hun, wo throw acha jata hai [Falling is my last resort. When I fall, that throw goes well],"" (laugh) Navdeep said.Having just returned from Paris, coach Naval watched Navdeep's final with confidence, knowing his student would bring home a Paralympic medal.""I knew Navdeep was going to make me and India proud. He has done a lot of hard work. Navdeep ki technique Neeraj Chopra se bhi behtar hai (Navdeep's technique is even better than Neeraj Chopra's). If he were in able-bodied athletics, he would have done wonders. But we are all proud of Navdeep. This is just the start for him—he is going to break several records,"" a confident coach said.",Navdeep Singh secured the gold medal in the F41 classification at the Paris Paralympic Games. The 4 feet 4 inches tall para javelin sensation was initially awarded the silver medal. Iran’s Sadegh Beit Sayah was disqualified for repeatedly displaying an objectionable flag.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113177053,imgsize-31676,width-400,resizemode-4/113177053.jpg"

They then shifted gears offensively in the middle quarters, building a 15-point lead by the start of the fourth period.Despite two of India's top performers fouling out in the final quarter, Lebanon mounted a spirited comeback, but their efforts were thwarted by a sensible play of 5-foot-9 point guard Ankush from Haryana. Ankush scored a game-high 14 points on 47.6-percent shooting to take control of the proceedings after India's tallest cager Mohammad Ishan and skipper Lavish left the court one after the other for committing five personal fouls.Before being fouled out, Ishan and Lavish played crucial roles in India's impressive performance in the second and third quarters, which ultimately propelled the team to a 55-40 lead at the start of the final period. Ishan recorded a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds, along with 4 assists, a steal, and 3 blocks, resulting in an efficiency rating of 21. Lavish contributed nine points and six assists. With timely baskets, Sahibjit Singh Bhullar and Mirthun Danasekar scored identical 10 points.The quarter-wise scores in India's favour read 16-16, 19-13, 18-11, 11-22. This two-point victory over the higher-ranked Lebanon also served as sweet revenge for India's 2016 quarterfinal defeat against their West Asian counterparts.India's American head coach Scott Flemming was a happy man. Speaking with TOI, Flemming said, ""This is a great win for India. I was pleased with how we competed. We struggled late with 2 of our top players fouled out. Overall, we outplayed a very good Lebanon team. Really happy for our players.""Explaining the strategy, Flemming added, ""Defensively, we wanted to protect the paint. Make them beat us from the perimeter. We needed to rebound with them. When we made our run, we executed that. Offensively, we wanted to push the ball but run our offences when they stopped our break. We needed more consistency, but overall we did what we needed to do to secure the win.""Though India were outrebounded by Lebanon 53-43, the 26.39% three-point shooting and 68.4% free throw conversion did the trick for the boys donning blue outfits. The quarterfinal will be the biggest test for India as they face the tournament's winningest nation, China, on Saturday.",India beat Lebanon 64-62 to confirm their last eight berth at the U-18 Asia Cup in Jordan.

'What he might be able to...': Kane Williamson on Joe Root breaking Sachin Tendulkar's Test records,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/what-he-might-be-able-to-kane-williamson-on-joe-root-breaking-sachin-tendulkars-test-records/articleshow/113160397.cms,"Talking about 'Fab 4', NZ star calls England batsman 'phenomenal'

GREATER NOIDA: It was first coined by the legendary Martin Crowe in one of his articles a decade back. The term 'Fab Four' was a collective expression for four of the best ""young Test batters"" - Virat Kohli Joe Root and Kane Williamson - of that time.The four have gone on to captivate the cricketing world with their exceptional skill and batting prowess in the last 10 years.Crowe had, in fact, drawn their comparison to The Beatles in his article.Interestingly, in the last decade, at varying time points, all four have also captained their respective sides in international cricket.As the four enter the final phase of their careers, the debate still rages on as to who is the best among them with the scales tilting towards all four of them at different points. Recently, Australian women's cricket team's wicketkeeper-batter Alyssa Healy ranked the four, and placed Williamson on the No. 1 spot, while consigning Kohli to fourth.In the last five years, Williamson and Root have been in sparkling form in Test cricket, while Smith and Kohli have struggled to even come close to their golden years in the red-ball format, which was between 2014-19.Root's recent twin hundreds against Sri Lanka at Lord's last week underscored his appetite for runs. Root's twin hundreds, in fact, are as many as Kohli's in the Test arena in the entire period from 2020-24.In this period, Root has 17 Test centuries to his name. While Williamson has 11 hundreds to his credit, the former New Zealand Test captain has played much less than Root in the period between 2020-24. Williamson's average in this period is 67.54.As Williamson himself continues to scale new heights, the affable New Zealander lauded Root for his ""consistent performances"" in Test cricket. Speaking before the one-off Test against Afghanistan here, Williamson said, ""I am a big fan of him (Root).""""He has been phenomenal. He has been something else for a long period of time. Obviously, there is a lot of attention on what he might be able to achieve in the years to come. It's just incredible that the kind of conversion (from fifties to hundreds) he has been able to achieve, can even be had,"" Williamson added, while referring to talks from the cricketing fraternity that Root is in a position to break Sachin Tendulkar 's Test record for most centuries as well as runs.Besides his high praise for Root, Williamson also applauded the other ""two members"" of Fab Four. ""I enjoy watching Virat Kohli, Steve Smith bat in Test cricket. It's just amazing how they have sort of moved the game forward in a big way,"" Williamson said.Williamson, however, downplayed the discussions about whether performances from Kohli, Smith and Root serve as a motivation for him to push harder. ""Not really! Playing for my country, for my team, makes me perform on the field,"" said the 34-year-old.New Zealand, the champions of the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC), will be playing six Tests in the next two months in the sub-continent. Following the one-off game against Afghanistan, New Zealand will travel to Sri Lanka for a two-Test series from September 16-30. Subsequently, they will return to India to face Rohit Sharma 's team in a three-Test series from October 16 to November 5.""In some ways, it's like a tournament sport, even though it's over a long period of time in the World Test Championship. Naturally, having six Test matches together is a big part of our calendar. It's one that we are very excited about,"" said Williamson.","'Fab Four' was a collective expression for four of the best ""young Test batters"" - Virat Kohli Joe Root and Kane Williamson.

"Duleep Trophy: Musheer Khan, pacers steer India 'B' to victory",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/duleep-trophy-musheer-khan-pacers-steer-india-b-to-victory/articleshow/113178793.cms,"Brief scores:

BENGALURU: From the selectors' point of view, the Duleep Trophy serves an important purpose, as it allows them to judge the form of top players and get a good look at greenhorns waiting to get their foot on the door in international red-ball cricket.This year, the opening round fixtures were meant to be a dress rehearsal for the 10 Test matches India play over the next four months.Some caught the eye, while others failed to grab the opportunity. Rishabh Pant (61), who did little in the first innings, came good with the bat for India 'B' with a half-century on Saturday. Then top-order bat KL Rahul (57; 121; 4x7) got amongst the runs, albeit in a losing cause.Rahul's teammate Akash Deep also shone, even if his team collectively failed. The 27-year-old pacer, who made his Test debut against England earlier this year, finished with a match haul of nine wickets (4/60 & 5/56). This was before turning in the second-best score for his team, (43; 42b; 3x4; 4x6).Young Musheer Khan 's (181) exploits in the first innings and Pant's crucial innings in the second helped India 'B' set 'A' a target of 275. India 'A' fell short, handing 'B' a 76-run win. The difference really was a plethora of dropped catches that cost India 'A' dearly.With the bat, the spotlight was on homegrown hero Rahul. In his first essay, he had made a patient if laboured 111-ball 37. At the M Chinnaswamy stadium on Sunday, Rahul showcased a glimpse of his preparedness for the long season ahead.In tricky conditions, Rahul, whose career has regularly been punctured with injuries, decided to grind it out for three hours. He waited for the loose deliveries and dispatched them to the boundary. There was little sign of the rustiness and hesitation of the first innings. Kuldeep Yadav had kept him good company, but just when the two appeared poised to pull off a heist through their partnership, Mukesh Kumar struck with an off-cutter that ended Rahul's stay. The top order bat went for a cut but didn't get enough bat and edged it to Pant.Kuldeep went shortly after and Avesh Khan followed him in quick time. The run out of Akash Deep signalled the win for India 'B'. While 275 was daunting on the surface, India 'A' had the quality in their ranks to pull it off. It was not to be.Openers Mayank Agarwal and Shubham Gill , who was thrown a lifeline with Nitish Reddy putting down a sitter, could not make their presence count. Gill would be disappointed with his dismissal - an expansive mistimed drive off Navdeep Saini 's (2/41) after contributing just 21.India B 321 (Musheer 181, Saini 56, Akash 4-60) and 184 (Pant 61, Akash 5-56) beat India A 231 (Rahul 37, Mukesh 3-62) and 198 (Rahul 57, Akash 43, Dayal 3-50, Saini 2-41) by 76 runs","India 'B' beat India 'A' by 76 runs in Duleep Trophy. Rishabh Pant (61) and KL Rahul (57) scored half-centuries for India 'B', who set a target of 275. Akash Deep took nine wickets and scored 43 runs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113178749,imgsize-65422,width-400,resizemode-4/113178749.jpg"

New Zealand:

NEW DELHI: New Zealand is set to face Afghanistan in their first-ever Test match, aiming to capitalize on the latter's lack of experience in the longer format of the game. This match marks the beginning of a challenging period for the Black Caps , who will play six consecutive Tests in the subcontinent, a feat they haven't attempted in four decades.Considering their less-than-impressive record in the subcontinent (40 losses in 90 matches), New Zealand is keen to start on a positive note.Kane Williamson, a senior batter, has stressed the importance of adapting to the conditions, and with three games under their belt, the team should be well-prepared for the crucial series against India next month.Spin is likely to play a significant role in the match, and New Zealand has arrived with five slow bowling options. Ajaz Patel , who returns to India after his remarkable 10-wicket haul in Mumbai in 2021, is expected to be included in the playing XI.Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, and Michael Bracewell are also vying for spots in the spin department.While Matt Henry is New Zealand's best seamer at the moment, captain Tim Southee 's recent dip in Test form is a concern. Will O'Rourke or express pacer Ben Sears may be given an opportunity.Afghanistan, who obtained Test status in 2017, will be playing only their 10th Test match. They have lost their last three Tests against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Ireland, but have managed to secure victories against Ireland, Bangladesh, and Zimbabwe in their brief Test journey.The absence of key players such as Rashid Khan , Rahamnullah Gurbaz, Mohammad Nabi, Fazallaq Farooqui, Mujeeb ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad, and Naveen-ul-Haq is a significant blow for the team.The batting responsibilities will fall on the shoulders of Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, and skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi, who averages 44.09 in Tests. Seam-bowling all-rounder Azmatullah Omarzai is likely to make his Test debut, while Zia-ur-Rehman, Zahir Khan, Khalil Ahmed, Qais Ahmad, Shahidullah Kamal, and Bahir Shah are the spin options for Afghanistan.With rain and thunderstorms forecast throughout the week, the match is likely to be affected. Despite the disparity in Test experience between the two teams, Afghanistan will look to leverage their familiarity with the Shahid Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex in Greater Noida, where they have previously played five ODIs and six T20Is, to put up a strong challenge against New Zealand.The one-off Test match between Afghanistan and New Zealand is scheduled for September 9, which falls on a Monday.The venue for the AFG vs NZ one-off Test match is the Greater Noida Sports Complex Ground, located in Greater Noida.AFG vs NZ one-off Test match will take place at 10:00 AM IST (Indian Standard Time).The Indian fans can livestream Afghanistan vs New Zealand one-off Test on the FanCode app and website and will be broadcast on the Eurosport TV channel.Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Abdul Malik, Riaz Hassan, Afsar Zazai (wk), Ikram Alikhil (wk), Bahir Shah, Shahidullah Kamal, Azmatullah Omarzai, Shams Ur Rahman, Zia-ur-Rehman, Zahir Khan, Qais Ahmad, Khalil Ahmad and Nijat Masood.Tim Southee (c), Tom Blundell (wk), Michael Bracewell, Devon Conway, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Will O'Rourke, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Ben Sears, Kane Williamson, Will Young.","New Zealand set to face Afghanistan in their first-ever Test match.

The other coaching staff will include assistant coach Puneet Yadav and bowling coach Nishant Singh.It was during a meeting by the Cricket Advisory Committee on Saturday that the names were finalised.The committee has been appointed by the Rajasthan Cricket Association ( RCA ) ad hoc panel.It will be Bishnoi's (Sr) first coaching assignment after his retirement in 2022. Since the former Bikaner batter knows most of the players and is aware of how things operate in the state, it will not take time for him to connect with the players.Bishnoi (Sr), who made his debut for Rajasthan in 2006-07 Ranji Trophy, has represented Rajasthan in 62 First Class matches where he scored 2788 runs. Moreover, the 36-year-old was the highest run-getter for the state in 2017-18 Ranji season with 436 runs in six outings.Former left-hand batter Jaya Sharma has been given the responsibility of the head coach of the state's senior women's team. The 43-year-old represented Delhi and Railways before playing for Rajasthan between 2013-14 and 2014-15.There are a few 'questionable' appointments, said a source at the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA). ""How can a Rajasthan State Sports council coach Manish Verma also serve as the state's Under-16 team's bowling coach?

NEW DELHI: Pathum Nissanka 's impressive unbeaten fifty positioned Sri Lanka for a potential victory over England in the third Test at the Oval on Sunday.By the end of third day's play, Sri Lanka stood at 94 for 1, requiring only 125 more runs to achieve the win and end a streak of seven consecutive Test defeats by England. Dimuth Karunaratne was dismissed for eight when he was caught and bowled by Chris Woakes after a drive hit his pad and ballooned into the air.However, Nissanka continued his excellent form, remaining unbeaten at 53, having reached his second fifty of the match by powering debutant Josh Hull through covers for his seventh four in just 42 balls.Meanwhile, Kusal Mendis made the most of several loose deliveries to score an unbeaten 30, which included 24 runs from boundaries.Sri Lanka's challenging target of over 200 runs was primarily due to Jamie Smith's superb counter-attacking 67, which pulled England out of a significant collapse. Following a dramatic slump where England lost five wickets for 26 runs to fall to 82 for 7, Smith's determined display at his home ground in Surrey helped them recover to post a total of 156.Smith's innings gave England a renewed hope of achieving a first home Test series clean sweep since 2004, when Michael Vaughan led them to seven consecutive wins. Smith's aggressive approach provided a brief respite, scoring 67 off just 50 balls, comprising 10 fours and a six, but he fell on the stroke of tea, chipping a ball from Vishwa Fernando to short midwicket.Fernando, exploiting significant swing, claimed three wickets for 40 runs, including the valuable wicket of Joe Root for just 12.Lahiru Kumara also made a remarkable contribution, taking four wickets for 21 runs in seven overs.Former England captains Vaughan and Alastair Cook criticized the hosts for their poor batting performance, which saw them collapse from 221-3 to 325 all out in their first innings.Ben Duckett was another early casualty for England, falling for seven after an ill-judged shot off Asitha Fernando. The problems continued as Ollie Pope, fresh off a 154 in the first innings, also fell cheaply for seven by chopping onto his own stumps off Kumara's bowling.Dan Lawrence, having been promoted to open in place of the injured Zak Crawley, managed to score 35 runs, including a six off Asitha Fernando, but ultimately edged behind to wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal off Kumara's delivery.As Sri Lanka closes in on a potential victory, Nissanka's role has been crucial in keeping their hopes alive for a memorable win over England in the Test series.Root's square-driven boundary off Vishwa Fernando meant he surpassed Sri Lanka great Kumar Sangakkara's tally of 12,400 Test runs to go into sixth place in the all-time list.Two balls later, however, Vishwa Fernando's excellent inswinging yorker struck Root on the boot and he was lbw.Brook was also lbw to another fine inswinger from Vishwa Fernando.Smith counter-attacked, scoring 20 runs in one over from fast bowler Milan Rathnayake that featured a flashing cut for four and crunching pull for six off successive deliveries.He also lofted Rathnayake down the ground for four before ending the over by punching the paceman through the covers for another boundary.Earlier, Olly Stone and 20-year-old quick Hull did the bulk of the damage as Sri Lanka, who resumed on 211-5, lost their last five first-innings wickets for 52 runs in 16.2 overs, with captain Dhananjaya de Silva and Kamindu Mendis unable to add signficantly to their overnight unbeaten fifties.Stone took 3-35 in nine overs and the towering Hull 3-53 in 11.",Pathum Nissanka scores 53 as Sri Lanka reach 94-1 on third day of third Test at the Oval. Sri Lanka require 125 more runs to win and end a streak of seven consecutive Test defeats by England. Jamie Smith's 67 pulls England out of a significant collapse. England lost five wickets for 26 runs to fall to 82-7 in their first innings.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113173293,imgsize-46810,width-400,resizemode-4/113173293.jpg"

The stadium is the 30th ground and Noida the 23rd city in India to host a Test match.The Afghans are well-acquainted with the Greater Noida stadium, having played five One-Day Internationals (winning three) and six T20 Internationals (five wins) at the venue since 2017.On Sunday, Noida witnessed incessant rain in the afternoon which saw the groundstaff at the stadium cover the ground – primarily the playing area – with blue tarpaulins. The Afghanistan team had trained in the morning, when it didn’t rain, but the New Zealanders weren’t so lucky and didn’t get to practice a day before the Test.Rain has been a regular and perpetual feature in Greater Noida for the last one week. The forecast is pretty much the same for all five days of the Test match, with an occasional thunderstorm looming large. The Test, therefore, in all likelihood, is going to be a stop-and-start affair with chances of getting abandoned not ruled out completely.The stadium, managed by local authorities rather than a state cricket association, lacks the advanced equipment and resources typical of other international venues in India.One could clearly witness that the drainage of the stadium isn’t something to write home about. There are two super-soppers at the stadium, out of which only one was being used to dry the ground. The covers stayed on even after the rain stopped. The groundstaff made attempts to dry the outfield with table fans.“We cannot control the rain, just hope that it does not rain during the match and we can enjoy the game,” Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi said.“The match referee has the right to take stock of the field conditions and declare them playable or not. As players our job is to go on the field and play. We are hoping for clear weather and the game to take place,” New Zealand skipper Tim Southee said.It’ll be interesting to see how the Test match progresses, as much-superior grounds across the world, equipped with all the modern facilities, take a lot more to hit the ground running.","Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathak Cricket Stadium will become the 124th venue, and Noida the 95th city to host an international Test match.

Afghanistan skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi yearns for more Tests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/afghanistan-skipper-hashmatullah-shahidi-yearns-for-more-tests/articleshow/113172279.cms,"GREATER NOIDA: Afghanistan cricket has been on the rise. It’s not a slow rise, they’re moving up the ladder at full tilt. The last two ICC tournaments are a testimony to that.In the 2024 T20 World Cup, Afghanistan caused one upset after the other, including getting the better of a heavyweight team like Australia, to reach the semifinals of the tournament where they lost to South Africa.The 2023 ODI World Cup in India saw Afghanistan beat the defending champs England, and former World Cup winners Pakistan and Sri Lanka. A 69-run decisive victory over England was immediately followed by an 8-wicket drubbing of Pakistan. In fact, Afghanistan would’ve reached the semifinals had it not been for Glenn Maxwell’s once-in-a-lifetime double ton at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Afghanistan had Australia reeling at 91/7 in a chase of 292, before Maxwell unleashed an unbeaten 201 (off 128 balls) to pave way for Australia’s eventual 3-wicket win.In the Test arena too, Afghanistan achieved their first Test victory in only their second match, becoming the fourth team after Australia, England, and Pakistan to win one of their first two Tests. Afghanistan enjoyed back-to-back success when they followed their first Test win (against Ireland) with a victory over hosts Bangladesh by 224 runs in a one-off Test in Chattogram.All the achievements notwithstanding, Afghanistan have played just 9 Tests in their six years at the Test level so far. As per ICC’s Future Tours Programme (FTP), after the one-off Test against New Zealand in Greater Noida, Afghanistan is scheduled to play Zimbabwe (six Tests), Ireland (three), India (one), Australia (one) and West Indies (one) in the 2023-27 FTP cycle.“In six years, nine games is not… I cannot say it’s a lot,” Afghanistan’s Test and ODI skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi said, a day before the Test versus New Zealand here.“If we get more chances against good teams, we will improve. Like with New Zealand… if you see their history of Test cricket and where they are in the rankings right now. Our cricket board is trying hard to give us opportunities against good teams. I think if we get more chances on a regular basis, we will improve a lot. You see, as a team, and as a country, we are brave people, and we always accept challenges.”“If we get a 3 or 4-match Test series, I think it will be very good for us as a side. If you look at our past, we get one Test match and we start preparing for that 10 days before. It’s not easy to play red-ball cricket just like that. Playing more matches will give us better judgment in comparison to playing just in the nets. So, if we play three-four games back to back, I think we will get better,” Shahidi added.Going forward, the Afghanistan skipper also wished for “one good venue”, while they play their “home Tests” in India. While Greater Noida’s Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathak Stadium hosts their match against New Zealand from Monday, Afghanistan have played their home Tests in Dehradun, Lucknow and Abu Dhabi since getting ICC’s Full Membership status.“If you see, India is our home and when we host teams, the other nations have played more cricket here than us. Hopefully, we will get one good venue here in India and we stick with that. If we stick with one venue, it will be more effective for us,” Shahidi said.“If you see our players, they have good record in first-class cricket because we play in our own grounds (in Afghanistan). We know our own conditions very well. So, hopefully, that time comes in the future when teams come to Afghanistan. Then our averages will be even higher than what they are right now.”",Afghanistan play one-off Test against New Zealand in Greater Noida. Afghanistan have played just 9 Tests in their six years at the Test level so far.

But, the most important thing is the process…like while bowling, which are the areas that can still be improved upon,"" he added.Akash, who debuted in Test cricket against England in Ranchi earlier this year, returned to the red-ball format after a break. Despite the layoff, he explained that he had been preparing for the season in his own way.""After my India debut in Ranchi and the IPL, I did not play any competitive match. It's tough to play a game as a pacer after such a long gap, but I have been practicing since last month.""We were playing the practice matches as actual games. So, we had that mindset to get our muscles used to that sort of bowling, and it helped me a lot,"" he noted.India is scheduled to play 10 Tests this season and Akash's performance in the Duleep Trophy has likely positioned him as a strong candidate to support leading bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. However, Akash prefers not to look too far ahead.""Every contest that I play, I consider it as my last. I don't think too far enough. All I have is the present with me.The 27-year-old showed immense control on both incoming and outgoing deliveries here, and he delved into it.""When I started my career, I was an in-swing bowler. But I hurt my shoulder around two to three years ago, and I could not bowl in swings anymore.""It is tough to live with one variation as a bowler and I began looking for options. I switched to out-swingers. And once my shoulder was back to normal, I gained total control on both variations,"" he elaborated.The ball that moved away from middle-stump line to rattle the off-stump of Nitish Reddy in India A's first innings underlined his mastery over the away-going delivery.Akash also remembered how senior India teammate and fellow Bengal pacer Mohammed Shami helped him with the nuances of his craft.""I do take input from him (Shami) as our actions are pretty much similar. I asked him 'how to move the ball out by bowling from around the wicket to a left-hander', to which he asked me not to try for it as it would happen naturally.""It did happen to me naturally, which then became a wicket-taking delivery. It also creates confusion in the batters' mind, as he is used to playing the ball generally outside,"" he explained.Despite Akash's heroics, India A succumbed to India B by 76 runs. He admitted that the batters played some wrong shots and the bowlers did not have the best preparation in place.""We (bowlers) did not have the right planning in place. We should have kept things tighter. Our plan (today) was to play until tea, as things would have become tough in the final session.""But we played some wrong shots in a hurry, leading to a pressure situation for us,"" he said.",Akash Deep takes nine wickets in Duleep Trophy match for India A against India B.

But, for a club that is just a few years old like ours and to battle against much more experienced sides, it (losing out on the title) is not a disappointment,"" said Samir Kamerkar, director and a founding member of the club.Kemp FC took shape after six parents, including five women, came together when their kids and other girls were on the verge of losing game time when a newly promoted Bengaluru-based club lacked the zeal and resources to push the squad into the Super Division league. “The girls in the team were in a state of lurch,” said club president Kathleen De Saran .Even when the same parents, who were pumping money for the club in the ‘A’ division, asked for ownership, it did not materialise. Exploring other options and opportunities, theygot news about another Super Division club, Bengaluru Braves , who were looking for a new owner. The enterprising parents latched on to the chance to attain ownership and rebranded Braves as Kemp FC.“We came together because we had this common goal and love for the sport and also at that moment, the immediate goal was to ensure that these girls had a team to play as they were a talented bunch of players.

In the recently concluded KWL, 11 players from Karnataka were in the squad which also had talent from Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and North East.Having already established their presence with a top-2 finish and getting on to the national football scene, the new challenge for Kemp will be to keep improving and chasing more glory as they move up the ladder.","Kemp FC were formed in 2022 by six parents, including five women.

Led by the seasoned Anas Edathodika , Malappuram totally outplayed the home side, giving great joy to the fans who had travelled from Malappuram to support the district’s first professional football team. Pedro Manzi (3) and Faslurahman Methukayil (40) scored a goal each for the winners.Forca Kochi came into the opening match after a training camp of just two weeks, while Malappuram, under ISL-winning coach John Gregory, underwent a pre-season camp of a month and a half. The difference was evident on the pitch as Malappuram totally dictated terms right from the start.Capitalising on Forca Kochi FC's sluggishness, Malappuram needed just two minutes and 43 seconds to seize an early lead, setting the stage for a thrilling encounter. Spanish forward Pedro Manzi soared high to head home a precisely delivered cross from Malappuram's Nandu Krishna from the right wing, leaving Subhasish Chowdhary helpless in the Kochi goal.In the 40th minute, Malappuram extended their lead through Faslurahman. Gurjinder Kumar launched a long ball into the Kochi penalty area, which Manzi headed into Faslu's path. The 29-year-old forward slid onto the ball, deftly placing it beyond the goalkeeper's reach and into the back of the net.Despite a couple of attempts from Kerala Santosh Trophy captain Nijo Gilbert, Kochi's forwards were completely neutralised by Malappuram's resolute four-man defence. Brazilian midfielder Raphael Santos, who was once the favourite of ISL sides, was just a shadow of his former self, while Arjun Jayaraj was nowhere to be seen in the picture.Kochi's most promising scoring opportunity arose in the first minute of added-on time in the first half. Receiving a long ball from a free-kick, Tunisian midfielder Said Mohamed Nidhal attempted a header from a challenging angle. Although his effort was successfully thwarted by Malappuram goalkeeper Midhun V, the ball remained loose, falling to defender Dziri Omran.

Player-of-the-tournament Mashoor Shereef found the net with a piledriver in the 23rd minute before an own goal by J&K Bank 11 minutes later took them to the break with a 2-0 lead.The script didn’t change after the change of ends as Thapuia earned them their third just a minute after restart and Vaseem Imamdar put one more into the net in the 87th minute as Gokulam sealed the game with a 4-0 margin for the hard-won trophy.“Playing here was difficult, but I think it is a good thing to win ahead of the pre-season,” said Mashoor. “This was a good experience and I hope we can carry it into the new season.”The dearth of oxygen makes it difficult for players unused to it to play their natural game for 90 minutes, something that the only Indian Super League team at the contest – NorthEast United FC – would vouch for.Coming to Ladakh with their U17 players and beaten by J&K Bank in the semifinals, NEUFC academy coach Suhel Nair, who coached them at Climate Cup, said, “Our boys are very young and enthusiastic and ran a lot more than they should have at this altitude. A couple of them also needed to be administered oxygen during or after the matches.”However, for 90% of them, it was the first time outside the northeast and was a great experience in a new terrain and interacting with a different culture,” he added.Indeed, the Climate Cup – with its wooden trophy in sync with the tournament’s ideology – did not just provide the most beautiful scenic backdrop to a football tournament in India but also brought teams from different parts of India, and Tibet, in contact with the hospitality of the Ladakhis and their unique culture.And the best example of that was witnessed after the presentation as Gokulam players danced with young Ladakhi boys and girls to the tunes of popular Indian songs as music and sports broke barriers and united people from two extreme ends of the country.","Gokulam Kerala FC beat J&K Bank FC 4-0 in the final of the Climate Cup.

Shortly after arriving on Merseyside, he was named captain, a position he would hold for eight more full seasons.The most enduring image of his playing days at Anfield likely occurred the next year, when Yeats ascended the Wembley steps to claim the FA Cup for the first time.Yeats appeared in 454 matches for Liverpool, with over 400 of those as captain. Only Steven Gerrard has donned the armband more times for the Reds.After leaving Liverpool, Yeats played for Tranmere Rovers, Stalybridge Celtic, Los Angeles Skyhawks, Barrow, Santa Barbara Condors, and Formby before retiring in the late 1970s.However, his Liverpool story was not finished. In 1986, Yeats returned to the club as chief scout, a role he held for 20 years until his retirement in 2006.Reflecting on his greatest accomplishments at Anfield, Yeats once remarked, ""There have been two of them. Being the captain that took the club out of the Second Division after eight years was a very, very proud moment.""We won the league by eight or nine points that season and to follow that by being the first captain of Liverpool to lift the FA Cup is something I am very proud of.

The encounter showcased both players' exceptional tennis skills, but it was also marred by controversy and heated exchanges.The match took a dramatic turn after Medvedev won the first set, as he received a warning for making an obscene gesture towards the crowd.This incident triggered a series of outbursts from the Russian, who vehemently complained to the umpire , Jaume Campistol , about the alleged coaching Tsitsipas was receiving from his father and coach, Apostolos.During one exchange of conversation he was asking the umpire "" bro, are you mad? and his father can talk every point, bro are you stupid?"" He repeatedly asked the referee if his father can talk after every point.Medvedev's frustration escalated, and he even suggested that the umpire would be a coward if he failed to penalize Tsitsipas. ""If you don't, you are – how can I say it – a small cat,"" he said.It appeared that Medvedev's complaints were finally acknowledged, as Eva Asderaki-Moore, a well-known Greek umpire and tournament referee, positioned herself in the tunnel near Tsitsipas' team box during the fourth set.She signalled to the umpire that Tsitsipas was indeed receiving coaching, resulting in an immediate warning for the Greek player.Tsitsipas expressed his frustration, stating that he has been targeted for a long time and feels like a victim of biased attention from the umpires.

outlasts Tiafoe in five-set home matchup,

World No.1

awaits in final

Taylor Fritz , the top-ranked American, likes his chances against world No.1 Jannik Sinner in the US Open final. Fritz, ranked 12, will have the house with him when he looks to end the host nation's 21-year wait for a male Grand Slam singles champion.The 6 ft 5' Californian, armed with a whiplash serve, does a lot of things well on a tennis court, but recently he has sharpened his mental game.The 26-year-old's fight is in top gear as he showed against compatriot Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals where he rallied to claim a memorable 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 win late on Friday.Fritz teared up during the on-court interview when fellow pro Chris Eubanks reminded him that he would be playing for the title on Sunday. ""I get emotional when I'm happy. I cry at happy endings of movies,"" said Fritz. ""It's just joy, the crowd cheering and that realization, like wow, I'm in the final of the US Open. It's a lifelong dream come true.""Fritz had written a critical note to himself when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the third round at Wimbledon three years ago. 'Nobody in the whole world is underachieving harder than you, you are so f**king good, but 40 in the world,' Fritz wrote, underlining his ranking.Against Tiafoe, Fritz played a splendid waiting game. He knew if he was patient enough Tiafoe's level would drop, especially on the forehand side, and he would have the opening. ""I was waiting the whole third and fourth sets… When is it going to come? I'm drilling balls to his forehand, he's drilling them back, whipping me off the court, changing direction,"" Fritz said. ""Once he started making mistakes, started lifting the ball a little bit more, allowing me to attack more, it calmed me down.""The 26-year-old, who goes into the final with a 1-1 head-to-head record against Sinner, reckons there will be less pressure on him on Sunday. ""It was two Americans in the semifinals (on Friday), both of us wanted to be the guy to make it to the final. It's a stressful situation to be in,"" he said. ""I was the favourite, it's tough to go in with a 6-1 head-to-head record.""""That's different from playing the world No. 1 who you're probably not going to be the favorite against,"" he said. ""I've played well against Jannik. We're 1-1 (head-to-head). I typically play well against him.""Sinner, who ended Jack Draper 's breakthrough run in New York with 7-5, 7-6 (3), 6-2 win in a physical encounter, understands that he'll be up as much against Fritz as the Arthur Ashe stadium that will be packed to the rafters. ""He has a big serve. Very solid from the back of the court. He can hit strong. He can hit with rotation. He can mix up the game very well. He has played a lot this year, he has a lot of match rhythm,"" said Sinner, who took a tumble in the semifinals using his hands to cushion the impact of the fall.

I have a feeling I'm going to come out and play really well and win. When I play good tennis, I think that level is good enough to win.""Fritz, currently ranked 12th in the world, has taken full advantage of the unexpected early departures of Novak Djokovic , a four-time US Open champion, and Carlos Alcaraz, the 2022 winner. Their absence has created a significant opportunity for the remaining players in the tournament.Fritz secured his place in the semifinals by defeating Alexander Zverev, the fourth-ranked player and 2020 runner-up, in the quarter-finals. Prior to that, he overcame Casper Ruud, the eighth seed and 2022 finalist, in the round of 16.His upcoming opponent, Jannik Sinner, has made history by becoming the first Italian man to reach the US Open final. Fritz and Sinner have faced each other twice before, with their head-to-head record standing at 1-1.Fritz won their first meeting on the hard courts of Indian Wells in 2021 with Sinner gaining revenge at the same California desert venue two years later.""I've always played well against Jannik. He hits the ball big. He's like a very strong ball striker, but I feel like I always hit the ball really nice off his ball,"" explained the American, who had never got past the quarter-finals of a major before this US Open.Sinner claimed his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January and, despite controversy surrounding two failed drugs tests, has advanced to his second Slam final of 2024.He boasts a flawless record in finals this year, winning all five, with titles in Rotterdam, Halle, Miami, and Cincinnati, alongside his Melbourne victory.At 23 years old, he has accumulated 54 wins and only five losses this season. He is excited about not only facing Fritz but also performing before a lively crowd of 23,000 at the vast Arthur Ashe Stadium.""Being in America for sure, the crowd will be a little bit more on his side,"" said Sinner.""But it's normal. It's like when I play in Italy, so I'm going to accept that.""I have my team and my people who are close to me. In my mind, I know that there are many people watching from home from Italy, and it's just take some support from them.”One concern for the Italian is the condition of his left wrist, which he injured while breaking a fall during his semi-final win against Britain's Jack Draper.Sinner needed a medical timeout to address the injury but quickly reassured that it won’t be a problem on Sunday.""The physio loosened it up very fast on court and it went away by playing, which is good,"" explained Sinner.""Let's see how it is tomorrow when it's cold. It's going to be a different feeling. Hopefully it's nothing to be concerned about. I'm quite relaxed, because if it's something bad, you feel it straightaway a bit more.""Win or lose on Sunday, Fritz believes American men's tennis is on the brink of a new golden age as the country boasts five players in the top 20.""I think it gives hope and shows that we're knocking on the door of winning a Slam,"" Fritz said.""We're all moving in the right direction.

You have to focus on yourself,"" the statuesque Belarusian said, adding, ""There were people supporting me. I was trying to focus on them. There is your team. There is your family.""Sabalenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, found the Ashe crowd on Thursday more respectful than the crowd in the final twelve months ago. ""Last year they were super loud, even during the point. It was so loud, it was blocking my ears,"" she said. ""The mistake was I was focusing on myself, I didn't think that she (Gauff) was also on the same court, feeling the same loudness from the crowd. Yeah they were cheering for her, but how can they help her to win the match? Only if I let them get into my head.""Sabalenka, pulling herself together against Navarro, was a theatre unfiltered.
