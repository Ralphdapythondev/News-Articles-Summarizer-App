Paris Olympics 2024: India’s Olympics uniforms create a buzz for the wrong reasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/paris-olympics-2024-indias-olympics-uniforms-create-a-buzz-for-the-wrong-reasons/articleshow/112073510.cms,"Bigger isn’t always better— the cliché was proved right during the Olympics opening ceremony. In Paris, the world’s fashion capital, it was Team Mongolia’s Seine-sensational gold-embroidered ensemble that scored big.Haiti (super arty), Czechia (splattered trench coats) and Sri Lanka (white silk) wowed too even though the US (Ralph Lauren) and Italy (Emporio Armani) pulled out the big guns.As for India, let’s say if there was a medal for the best ceremonial uniform, we wouldn’t even be close. Though India’s ikat-inspired kurta-bundi and sarees were designed by no less than Tarun Tahiliani, many thought it was a missed opportunity to celebrate Indian craftsmanship. While it’s rare to see a polarized social media agree on something, this time the criticism was almost unanimous.“Today, the Indian fashion industry is talked about for its traditional yet modern clothing. This was an opportunity to make something unique and creative.,” says Delhi-based fashion designer Shilpi Gupta.This was also the first time a designer had been roped in to design the official ceremonial attire for Team India.Fashion commentator Shefalee Vasudev says the debate shouldn’t be about print vs handwoven as Tasva, a collaboration between Tahiliani and Aditya Birla Group, was contracted to design the contingent uniforms. “Tasva is into quality mill-made fabric. It’s not a handloom brand. If someone had wanted a hand -loom imprint, the contract would have been given to those known for their handloom signature,” says Vasudev. But she adds that even within the mandate, the aesthetics did not come together.Responding to the comments, Ashish Mukul, brand head of Tasva, told TOI that the ceremonial attire for Team India was crafted with a sense of national pride and an aim to balance tradition with modernity. “Our intention is to create an attire that represents India’s rich heritage and ensure our athletes feel comfortable and confident,” Mukul said, adding that the fabrics, including cotton and viscose crepe, were selected for their practical and aesthetic qualities.Nutritionist Nandita Iyer, who does not consider herself a fashion expert, says she was left dissatisfied as a connoisseur of Indian textiles, crafts and handlooms. “Any such global event is a stage for us to proudly show -case our heritage and history and doing it with viscose fabric and Ikat print tackily stitched as a border seems like hasty work,” says Iyer.However, others pointed out the challenges of creating uniforms that balance aesthetics, functionality, and cultural representation. In a post on Instagram, Susan Thomas, ex-director of NIFT Bengaluru, pointed out that viscose is used for uniforms as “ Olympics is a performance-driven event that hinges on fitness.”Designer Rina Dhaka pointed out that there are budgets and briefs to fill. “When we do productions on this scale, digital is used over weaves to give consistency and quality,” says Dhaka. For her, badminton player PV Sindhu’s beautiful smile lifted the ensemble.",Team Mongolia's Seine-sensational gold-embroidered ensemble scored big.

Witty Ashish Nehra leaves Yashasvi Jaiswal speechless with Virat-Rohit remark - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/witty-ashish-nehra-leaves-yashasvi-jaiswal-speechless-with-virat-rohit-remark-watch/articleshow/112073595.cms,"WATCH

India didn't face much trouble in beating hosts Sri Lanka in the first T20I international in Pallekele on Saturday once their batsmen had put the home team under pressure with a total in excess of 200, but Ashish Nehra 's witty observation after the match left opener Yashasvi Jaiswal speechless.Led by skipper Suryakumar Yadav's half-century (58 off 26 balls), India's top-order fired all cylinders to take the team to a commanding 213 for 7 after the Lankan skipper Charith Asalanka won the toss and put the visitors in to bat.Jaiswal (40 off 21 balls) and Shubman Gill (34 off 16 balls) gave India a dominating start of 74 runs before both fell on consecutive deliveries. Surya and Rishabh Pant (49 off 33 balls) then entertained the crowd with a stroke-filled 76-run partnership, which was enough to push India past the 200-run mark despite the middle-order faltering.Talking to Jaiswal after the match, former India pacer Ashish Nehra stumped the young batsman with his comment and he could only smile about that with a you-caught-me expression.""Ajay Jadeja asked you what's the difference when Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma were there (to open in T20Is). According to me, there is just one difference. If Virat and Rohit were still playing this format, then whatever strokes we saw from you today, you would have played those in the nets. Now you are getting to play those shots in the match because they (Virat and Rohit) are not there,"" quipped Nehra.Both Virat and Rohit had announced their T20I retirement after India won the T20 World Cup last month.Nehra's cheeky comment left everyone in splits and the video clip of the small interaction was shared by Sony Sports Network on X (formerly Twitter).Coming back to the match, Sri Lanka started their stiff run-chase on a positive note, as their openers Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis added 84 runs in 8.3 overs. Arshdeep Singh (2 for 24) broke that stand by dismissing Mendis (45 off 27 balls). But Nissanka's bat continued to blaze away in another quickfire stand of 56 with Kusal Perera.But once Axar Patel (2 for 38) cleaned up Nissanka (79 off 48 balls) with his left-arm spin, the Lankans succumbed to the scoreboard pressure and the climbing required run-rate.Riyan Parag (3 for 5) made the most of that pressure and struck thrice in the 8 balls he bowled in the match, which took the fight out of the home team.",India beat Sri Lanka in first T20I international in Pallekele on Saturday. Suryakumar Yadav and Shubman Gill scored half-centuries for India.

India posted a challenging total of 213 for 7, and subsequently bowled out Sri Lanka for 170 in 19.2 overs, securing a 1-0 lead in the series.The highlight of the match, however, was the rare display of ambidextrous bowling by Sri Lanka's Kamindu Mendis .The spinner captured the audience's attention by switching his bowling arm during the same over, a sight seldom seen in international cricket Mendis bowled left-handed against Suryakumar Yadav and switched to his right hand when facing Rishabh Pant .

However, Mendis managed to contain the batsmen, allowing only five singles in the remaining five balls.Fans took to social media to express their astonishment and praise for Mendis's ambidextrous talent.

He has even forgotten his passport two or three times, which was very hard to retrieve.”Rohit has had a stellar career, becoming only the second Indian captain after Mahendra Singh Dhoni to lead India to a T20 World Cup title.Under Rohit’s leadership, India won the T20 World Cup by defeating South Africa in a thrilling final last month.Having retired from T20 Internationals following India’s T20 World Cup victory, Rohit is now preparing to lead the Indian team in the upcoming three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka.",India's Test and ODI captain Rohit Sharma is known for his tendency to forget things.

He stressed the importance of Suryakumar quickly understanding and managing India's diverse bowling options to ensure success in his new role.""One thing that he (Suryakumar) will have to learn from his side is what are the strengths of his bowlers and what are their limitations,"" Shastri remarked, as quoted by ICC. ""I never say a bowler has a weakness, I say a limitation, and then there are strengths. And then focus on the right things and set fields accordingly. I think that is what he will have to learn,"" the former head coach added.Suryakumar Yadav already has leadership experience, having captained India in T20I series against Australia at home and South Africa away in Rohit’s absence following the last year's ICC ODI World Cup. Additionally, he has led Mumbai domestically on several occasions.Shastri is optimistic about Suryakumar's capabilities and believes his dynamic batting style will influence his leadership.""We know he is street smart... he is one of the best T20 players in the world at the moment,"" Shastri said. ""He is a match-winner on his own, walks into the team day in, day out in that format of the game on his own steam, so I think it is not a bad idea at all.""Reflecting on Suryakumar's potential captaincy style, Shastri added, ""I think it will [captaincy style] be much like his personality, the way he plays the game.

Ponting recently expressed his views on Shaw's situation.""I mean to start with I don't like talking about individual players, but Prithvi shouldn't be an outlier. He should be someone that's in every team; the first pick in most teams with the skill that he's got. He's had a chance to represent India as a youngster, making a hundred on his Test debut,"" Ponting told Cricbuzz.""And as you say, halfway through this year, we couldn't find a slot for him in our DC team. So that's disappointing for me as a coach not to be able to make certain players better and get the best out of them. But sometimes there's only so much you can give and so many times you can try,"" he added.Ponting revealed that he had multiple discussions with Shaw in an effort to improve his cricketing skills. Despite these efforts, he acknowledged a limit to the impact a coach can have, saying, ""When you feel like you're not making players better and they're not doing what you need for the team, then you've got to look for other players that can do it for you. So that then comes back to the player. With him in particular I've had a lot of chats with him, a lot of conversations to try and make him a better cricketer.""""I mean, he's still a young man. And he's still a very talented young player. And hopefully one day the penny really drops for him and he works out what he needs to do to be the best cricketer that he can be,"" the former Australia captain explained.As the Delhi Capitals begin preparations for the IPL 2025 season , speculation about Shaw's future with the team has arisen. It remains to be seen whether Shaw will be retained by the team, considering the strategic planning underway ahead of the mega auction.","Former Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting has acknowledged his decision to move on from Prithvi Shaw. Ponting blamed Shaw's consistent inability to meet team expectations. Shaw debuted for India in 2018 at the age of 18, marking his arrival with a century. He went on to play his first ODI in 2020 and his first Twenty20 International in 2021.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112068056,imgsize-28506,width-400,resizemode-4/112068056.jpg"

Will support national team by developing players at Inter Kashi: Habas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-support-national-team-by-developing-players-at-inter-kashi-habas/articleshow/112029904.cms,"Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.

Five first-team players – Samik Mitra, Bikash Yumnam, Vincy Barretto, Alexander Romario and Irfan Yadwad – have been included in the camp. What is the plan for them?

What do you make of the youngsters in the squad?

How has the preparation been so far?

Coyle is well known for his positive brand of football. Will the reserve team have a similar style of play going forward?

You have reunited with Coyle, after having worked at Jamshedpur FC. How does it feel?

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC ’s newly appointed assistant coach Noel Wilson said the club opted to play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure that the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL). In an interaction with TOI at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium – Chennaiyin’s current training base – Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team, Durand Cup preparation and more.Excerpts:You (first team) need to have a six-week pre-season (ahead of the ISL), which is about one-and-a-half months. I think, after the Durand Cup, there is going to be a gap of two months. You cannot be stagnant in that period. Coyle will have better ideas. He does not want the main team to play in the Durand Cup as there are chances of players getting injured. Maybe he does not want to take risk with the main-team players. He knows what is right.The players who have come here did not get much game time last season. When you play competitive matches, your confidence level will increase. After playing here, they will perform better once they return to the main team.There are some young players who have good quality. They need the experience and exposure of playing with the bigger guys (seniors). The difference between playing in a reserve team and a senior team is huge. But I can see that there is potential.Besides players from the main and reserve teams, we have shortlisted a few players from the trials. The team is good; the young boys are working hard. No matter what the team is (opponent), you will win if you play well. That is what I believe in. I have asked the boys not to worry about the opponents, whether they are from the ISL or I-League.It is difficult to implement a style of play when you have only a month to prepare. We began training at the start of the month and our first match is on July 31. But in general, I like it when the boys keep the ball in the front (attacking areas). I do not want the boys to keep the ball at the back for a long time. I do not want them to do that because it might create problems; errors at the back could lead to goals. I would rather expect the players to take the ball forward and play in the opponent’s half. That will be safer for us.Coyle is a wonderful coach; we can see it in his personality and coaching. Last season, he got Chennaiyin to the playoffs. It is always good to work with good coaches.
