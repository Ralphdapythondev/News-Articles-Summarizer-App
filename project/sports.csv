England

in semifinal; Men in Blue take on SA in final

GEORGETOWN: The dream is within touching distance. The years of wait that grew longer and longer - and then went deep into the night on Thursday - is now a step away from being over. A lot has been told about India getting a few undue advantages here and there, but Rohit Sharma 's boys showed the world on Thursday that they probably didn't need any of those.They are simply miles ahead of the pack.It was this same England, one and half years ago in Adelaide, who thrashed India by 10 wickets with almost the same number of runs to chase down. This time they fell way short, as India braved the conditions to pull off a 68-run victory that will leave them mentally on top ahead of their final against South Africa in Barbados on Saturday.India scored 171-5 after being asked to bat first when the conditions were infinitely more difficult. The total was way over par on a pitch that had a lot in it for the bowlers. In reply, England folded for 103 in a mere 16.4 overs, with Kuldeep Yadav , Axar Patel and Jasprit Bumrah all causing major damage.Bumrah and Axar broke the back of England within the Powerplay, getting the dangerous Jos Buttler and Phil Salt out, and the rest was just one way traffic. England didn't have anything in their lineup which could make a match of this chase against the allround brilliance of this Indian bowling attack.The locals had stayed away from the game, the West Indies defeat and the decision to have a day game on a week-day were good enough to make them go about their lives instead of spending a day at the cricket ground. But there were a few thousand Indian fans who flew in from different parts of the world and they enjoyed every moment of this joy-ride which seemed like a marathon, courtesy, the rain.The first innings took a record four hours to be bowled amidst the numerous stoppages and that halted India's momentum significantly on a pitch that was as it is difficult to bat on. And when Virat Kohli failed again, getting bowled trying to hit a cross-batted shot, one felt that things might just get tough. But then, there was a Rohit Sharma.The skipper knows this will probably be his last chance to win a limited-overs ICC trophy --both as a captain and as a player. There's been an element of determination in every step that he has taken so far, and it wasn't any different on Thursday. Rohit showed during the course of his 57 off 39 balls his incredible ability to alter his style, and yet be effective. He knew that the game that he played in St. Lucia against Australia wasn't possible on this pitch, so he didn't try to throw his hands at every ball. Here he played the waiting game and the odd loose ball was dealt with.In Suryakumar Yadav , he got the absolute perfect man who could help him steady the ship through choppy waters without compromising on the speed of the boat. The two ran furiously and played the odd innovative shot against the likes of leggie Aadil Rashid (1-25), who used the conditions very well to keep the duo in check. It was Rashid's perseverance that helped him get the wicket of Rohit, when he tried to dispatch his googly out of the park.For the innings to get a final surge of momentum, it was necessary for Surya to carry on. But the best batsman in T20 cricket too was done in by the slowness of the track and Jofra Archer's change of pace, giving a catch at the deep.But by then India had enough in the bag.","India score 171-5 after being asked to bat first.

to be fairer

GEORGETOWN: The wait kept getting longer. The world's eyes were on the weather radar and as the clouds seemed to keep moving away, the smiles were back on the faces of the fans who have been trooping into Guyana from across the United States and other parts of the world. The toss got delayed, the super-soppers were on, but nothing mattered more than the hot sun that was burning in full glory after morning showers.But as the teams got on to the field and started to prepare themselves for a long day, quite a few questions about how the tournament has been scheduled surfaced.To start with, there is no reserve day between games in the knock-out stage, which is beyond belief for anybody who is associated with cricket in this part of the world. To compensate for that, the rule of the tournament was amended at the 11th hour, with two days to go for the match, allowing four hours of extra time.Pakistan, who had been knocked out in Lauderdale because their game could not be started despite a hot sun blazing through the day, are justified to ask a few questions after rules got amended before the semis.While that's one issue, the fact that India knew way before the World Cup started that their semifinal would be played in Guyana has also come up for discussion. India captain Rohit Sharma tried to shut it down saying that ""it's the same for all teams"" and that ""England have enough experience of playing in these conditions"", the theory that India got a bit of unfair advantage cannot be disputed.Former England captain Michael Vaughan didn't mince his words when he said that the T20 World Cup is ""purely set up for India"" and ICC should have been a bit more ""fairer"" to other countries because this is not a bilateral event.""Well, it's their tournament isn't it? Literally it's that. You know that. They get to play whenever they want, they know where their semifinal is, they play every single game in the morning so people can watch them at night, obviously in India on TV,"" Vaughan said during a podcast with Australian great Adam Gilchrist on the YouTube channel Club Prairie Fire.The Ashes-winning captain feels it is purely the financial might of Indian cricket that has led to such a situation. ""I get that money is a big play, and I get that in bilateral series but when you get to a World Cup, the ICC should be a little bit fairer to everybody. There can't be sympathy or any kind of sway towards one team and this tournament is purely set up for India,"" Vaughan said.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan says T20 World Cup is ""purely set up for India"" ICC should have been a bit more ""fairer"" to other countries because this is not a bilateral event, says Vaughan.

Worked very hard as a unit and it was a great effort from all. We adapted really well, conditions were challenging. That's been the success story for us so far. If bowlers and batters adapt, things fall in place. At one stage, 140-150 looked par. But we got runs in the middle, SKY and I were going and thought we can get 20-25 more. I didn't want to give that away, wanted to let the batters play on instinct. 175 was a very good score, bowlers were fantastic. Axar, Kuldeep are gun spinners.

Whether he'll continue to do that in the semifinal, because this is a guy who has taken up the responsibility on the big stage, he feels that he's the guy who's got to do it. Plus he's short of runs. The thing to look for is if he's hit a four or a six and if he picks a single, then you know that he's batting a little differently,"" Manjrekar said.Team India is looking to win their first major title in over a decade and bury any doubts about their backbone in the knockout rounds.Rohit's team head into Thursday's semis in Guyana on a six-match unbeaten streak in the tournament and determined to emulate the title success of the 2007 side in the inaugural edition.",India lost 10-wicket mauling at the hands of England in 2022 T20 World Cup semis.

NEW DELHI: India is on the cusp of a significant milestone as they prepare to face defending champions England in the Twenty20 World Cup semi-finals on Thursday in Guyana .A victory would not only propel them closer to their first major title in over a decade but also silence any doubts about their ability to perform in knockout rounds.Despite the backing of the world's wealthiest cricket board, India has struggled to achieve consistent success on the global stage, with their most recent triumph being the 2013 Champions Trophy.Rohit Sharma 's team enters the match against England riding a six-match unbeaten streak in the tournament, determined to replicate the success of the 2007 side that won the inaugural edition. Rohit, along with Virat Kohli, both of whom may be playing in their last World Cup, has found form with a blistering 92 off 41 balls against Australia in the Super Eight stage and has emphasized the team's aggressive approach.However, Indian fans remain apprehensive due to the team's inconsistent performances in the latter stages of major tournaments. They suffered semi-final exits in the 2019 50-overs World Cup against New Zealand and the 2022 T20 World Cup against England. Additionally, they faced heartbreak in the 2023 World Test Championship final and the 2023 ODI World Cup title decider, both losses coming against Australia.Despite these setbacks, India appears to be in excellent form with both bat and ball in this tournament. Rohit has amassed 191 runs in six matches, while pace bowlerJasprit Bumrah has claimed 11 wickets, and spinner Kuldeep Yadav, a late addition to the team, has taken seven wickets in three games.England's campaign, on the other hand, has been inconsistent, with losses to Australia and South Africa in the group stages. They narrowly advanced to the Super Eights due to a superior net run rate compared to Scotland. However, they now stand just two wins away from becoming the first team to successfully defend the T20 World Cup trophy.The pressure is on skipper Jos Buttler and coach Matthew Mott to deliver, and they will rely on the performances of West Indies-born pacers Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan in the knockout rounds. Buttler and opener Phil Salt have been England's top scorers, with 191 and 183 runs, respectively, and their form will be crucial to the team's success.The winner of the India-England semi-final will face the victor of the first semi-final South Africa in final, which takes place on Saturday.As the T20 World Cup 2024 approaches its climax, India (IND) is set to face England (ENG) in the second semi-final match. The game will take place on June 27 at 8:00 PM IST at the Providence Stadium in Guyana, West Indies.In their head-to-head T20I encounters, India and England have played 23 matches, with India holding a slight advantage of 12 wins compared to England's 11 victories.The Providence Stadium in Guyana has offered a balanced playing surface throughout the tournament. The pitch has favoured the batsmen, particularly in the first innings, while the bowlers have also played a crucial role in shaping the outcome of the matches.Providence Stadium has hosted five matches in the T20 World Cup 2024, with three matches won by the team batting first and two by the team batting second. The average first innings total at this venue is 146, while the average second innings total is significantly lower at 77. The highest recorded total is 183/5 by Afghanistan against Uganda, and the lowest is 39/10 by Uganda against West Indies.For fantasy cricket, it is advisable to wait for the toss and then select impactful batters from the team that bats first. Pacers have shown greater efficiency on this pitch, but spinners can also be effective.

NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh 's iconic six sixes still remain fresh in everyone's memory after 17 long years, and the man himself hasn't forgotten an inch of that epic moment when he smacked England pacer Stuart Broad half a dozen times out of the park.While recalling that historic feat in a video interview with ICC , Yuvraj said, ""In the last couple of innings I didn't do well so I was very keen to get out there and get some big hits and some kind of form.It was the 19th over and I had to swing everything.Freddie ( Andrew Flintoff ) bowled two really good balls actually and on the last ball of the 18th over I took a single. (Few words were exchanged between the two of them). And I was just like. I am sorry, what did you say? Obviously I was angry then the umpire came in. Anyways I was furious. I was so furious that I just wanted to hit every ball out of the ground. The first ball went out of the park. I remember hitting this one without even realising how big that hit is.""When the anchor asked Yuvraj that after hitting four sixes to Broad, do you have six sixes in mind at that point? To which he replied after taking a big breath,"" No, I have actually five sixes in my mind since I was hit for five sixes by Dimitri Mascrenahas in the final over of the 2007 Oval ODI. It was very demeaning as well. You don't want to get hit for five sixes. I had been in this place and getting hit for 5 sixes is not a good feeling.I was like Dimitri was standing at deep mid-wicket and Flintoff was at deep square leg. I know where he was standing. Here what happened was Broad actually switched to over the stumps at the last moment. When he did that, in my mind I was like I knew where he was going to bowl. I was ready that it was going to be a full yorker towards my legs, and I just wanted to get my bat on it.""On being nervous before the sixth and final six, Yuvraj said, ""I was not nervous at all. He (Broad) was the one who was nervous as I can see his body language. If you will see there was a smile on my face at that moment, and that smile was for Dimitri. I normally bat at No. 4 and MS Dhoni at No. 4 and after I hit the final six, MS said to me that everytime you come out to bat after me your strike rate is double.The great thing about Freddie is he talked about it after the game and shook hands, and that is why I have a lot of respect for Flintoff. (On Broad) I think that was a big moment of his career because he knew from here on he had to add more variety in his bowling. He just can't come and bowl yorkers. He has to bowl slower balls, bouncers. Obviously he was young and learning as well. And from there on he went on to take 600 Test wickets. I don't think without this moment, he would have ended up with 600 wickets. This moment probably made him work harder and realise how important it is to succeed. Definitely this is the moment that made him a legend.""""Ya, this was one of the iconic moments and I cherish it but if we wouldn't have won the World Cup, it wouldn’t have been that special I guess,"" concluded Yuvraj.Yuvraj's blistering innings came to an end when he was caught at long-on off the penultimate delivery of the final over, having amassed a stunning 58 runs from a mere 16 balls. His explosive performance proved decisive, as India went on to secure a 20-run victory.","Yuvraj Singh hit Stuart Broad for six sixes in the final over of the 2007 Oval ODI.

How do you see the role of spinners in the

T20 World Cup

till now?

What do you think about the Indian spin-attack, and more specifically Kuldeep Yadav?

You were a top finger-spinner yourself. Do you think the role of finger spinners is diminishing in white-ball cricket?

Who according to you is the best white-ball spinner at the moment?

You played at a time when the West Indies pace quartet ruled the roost. How does it feel now to see spinners opening the attack for West Indies?

Who according to you was the best-ever player of spin?

What do you think of the modern-day trend of dishing out big turners in Tests, where it spins from ball one? Is the art of playing spin taking a beating?

How do you compare the two great modern-day offies

Nathan Lyon

and

GEORGETOWN: It wasn't easy to be a spinner in the West Indies when Roger Harper played his cricket. Those were the days of the famous pace quartet. The tall off-spinner from Guyana was seen more as a restrictive option. But he was more than effective, especially in ODIs where he got 99 wickets at an economy-rate of a phenomenal 3.97.In a chat with TOI, Harper spoke about the role of spinners in modern-day cricket, his admiration for Kuldeep Yadav and a lot more besides.Some of the pitches have turned a bit and the spinners have been able to make an impact. Some of the boundaries have been slightly bigger as well and the batsmen have not been able to dominate all the time, which I think has been a welcome relief.I think they have come here with the idea that they will have to play against a lot of right-handers. So they have taken three left-arm spinners in the playing XI. But they have been able to make an impact. As for Kuldeep, he is a left-arm wrist-spinner and there is a little bit of mystery about him. Batsmen find it difficult to read him. The fact that he is a left-armer helps him create more challenges and he can be a wicket-taker at times.The role of the finger-spinner is often to come in the middle of the innings, stop the runs and take wickets. Wrist-spinners provide more difficulty because they can probably be a little harder to read. But finger-spinners have bowled well in this World Cup, with Roston Chase of the West Indies being one of them. The finger-spinner still has a significant role to play, provided he knows how to adapt to different situations and bowl accordingly.Probably Rashid Khan . He has proven time and time again that he has the ability to take wickets. Batsmen sometimes get a hold of him, but he is difficult to hit and he takes wickets. So, he has to be up there.Firstly, I keep emotion out of it and see how conditions are and what can be done accordingly. In this World Cup, spinners are proving very successful at the top of the order, somebody like an Aiden Markram, who is a part-timer, bowls four overs at the top of the innings. It is about conditions, situations, and I am happy that spinners are playing a very big role. And don't forget this is not Test cricket. I don't think West Indies open too often with spin in Tests, unless they are playing on absolute turners.I always felt Sunil Gavaskar looked very broad but Javed Miandad was brilliant too. He had the ability to nudge the ball and find the single. Javed Miandad too was really challenging to bowl to.Back in our day too, there were pitches where the ball turned pretty early. What is more important is that the bounce has to be consistent so that it is a fair challenge between bat and ball. Now the approach has changed. Years ago the focus was about occupying the crease and accumulating runs. Some of the highly-skilled players could not score that fast. These days the urgency is to keep the scoreboard ticking, but having said that, some of the shots the England players played in India during the Tests a couple of months ago were horrendous. The mental attitude about playing spin has changed.Both have more than 500 Test wickets... I wouldn't want to say who is the better bowler. They are different and I admire both of them. Lyon is more the orthodox off-spinner who will plug away and bowl consistently, get turn and bounce and vary his pace. Ashwin spins the ball as well and gets turn and his carrom ball adds mystery and intrigue. Both have the ability to bowl long spells and can get on top of a team and run through the batting line-ups.","Former WI off-spinner tells TOI why it is important for offies to adapt to different situations.

He focused on delivering the ball in the optimal areas of the pitch to maximize his effectiveness.""I have bowled in the powerplay in the past, so I had to bowl in the powerplay, that was the plan.

The opening batter feels the lack of domestic red-ball cricket makes Test cricket even more challenging for them.“We don’t play domestic cricket. Most of us don’t have any sort of preparation in the format.So, just coming straight into an international multi-day game is difficult. For example, balls that I've been cover-driving my whole life, I now need to leave, which is difficult for me because it just happens on instinct, and I have to fight the way that I've been batting for my entire career. So, I think we need to play a lot more Test cricket and incorporate it into our domestic practice and training. Or we must just leave it because playing one in three years is very hard to adapt to. But I'm on the side to have more of that,” said Wolvaardt.Wolvaardt hopes that there are discussions within the Cricket South Africa board leading to more opportunities for women to play red-ball cricket.“I think getting the opportunity to play more Test cricket is awesome. And something that a lot of our girls are really looking forward to. Having three Tests scheduled in a calendar year is pretty cool. And something that I’ve wanted to see for a long time. I’m hoping there are conversations about it higher up (the board),” said Laura.The Proteas will be playing three Tests this year; they played a Test against Australia in February, after a gap of almost two years.

On the other hand, the defeat resulted in the Czech Republic's exit from the tournament.Despite their efforts and a history of reaching the quarter-finals in the previous tournament, the Czech team's aspirations were significantly hindered by the early dismissal of midfielder Antonin Barak , who received a second yellow card in the 20th minute.The match concluded with heightened tensions, leading to Tomas Chory of the Czech Republic receiving a red card during a post-game altercation. The game was notable for the high number of cards issued by the referee, totalling 18, including two red and 16 yellow cards, setting a new record for the Euros.The encounter was characterized by aggressive play from both teams, with the Turkish team enjoying substantial support from their fans, reflecting their large diaspora in Germany.The atmosphere was intense and the competition fierce, despite the challenging hot conditions. Hakan Calhanoglu , at 30 years old, scored his first goal in his third Euros participation in the 50th minute, a moment that ignited the Turkish supporters.His goal came from a low shot that not only bypassed the Czech goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek but also resulted in Stanek sustaining a shoulder injury, forcing him to leave the game.A missed opportunity by Turkey's Arda Guler to extend their lead was quickly followed by an equalizer from the Czech Republic, with Tomas Soucek scoring in the 66th minute amidst a chaotic scene following a long throw.The match's intensity continued to build until Cenk Tosun scored the decisive goal for Turkey in stoppage time, eliciting jubilant celebrations from the Turkish bench and fans alike.

They achieved this feat by defeating Portugal, a team that previously won the Eruo, with a scoreline of 2-0.The victory was primarily orchestrated through an early goal from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and a penalty converted by Georges Mikautadze .Despite facing a Portugal side that fielded many of their reserve players, having already qualified for the next round, this triumph is considered Georgia's most significant achievement since gaining independence in 1991.Georgia's journey to Euro 2024 was not straightforward. After finishing fourth in their qualifying group, they had to navigate through the Euro Nations tournament, where they topped their group before overcoming Greece in a playoff.This backdrop makes their group stage performance and progression to the knockout rounds even more commendable. Under the guidance of Coach Willy Sagnol , a former defender for Bayern Munich and France, Georgia not only advanced but also secured a third-place finish in Group F, setting up a last-16 clash with Spain, a team that has won the Euro tournament three times.The implications of Georgia's victory extend beyond their own achievements. It has also determined the matchups for other teams in the round of 16, with England facing Slovakia, Romania taking on the Netherlands, and Portugal meeting Slovenia. Hungary, who were contenders for advancement, were ultimately eliminated.Georgia's assertive start in the match was highlighted by Kvaratskhelia's goal in the second minute, following a mistake from Portugal's Antonio Silva.Cristiano Ronaldo , despite his efforts and the historical significance of potentially becoming the oldest goal-scorer in Euro tournament history, could not influence the game's outcome.Georgia's defence remained impenetrable, effectively neutralizing Portugal's attempts to score, and their strategy to exploit counter-attacking opportunities was further validated when Silva's foul led to a penalty, confirmed after a VAR review. Mikautadze's successful penalty not only secured the win but also made him the tournament's leading scorer at that point.The match saw Ronaldo, visibly frustrated, receive a booking for dissent and later express his disappointment by kicking a water bottle following his substitution. Georgia's goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili played a crucial role in the final moments to preserve the lead, culminating in jubilant celebrations from the Georgian players and coaching staff at the final whistle, witnessed by thousands of their supporters.","Georgia secured their passage to the knockout stages in what is their inaugural appearance at the European Championship.

However, the 37-year-old stated on Thursday that he would carefully consider his participation and take as much time as needed before making a final decision.The ATP , the governing body for men's tennis, had initially announced on Sunday through a social media post that Murray would not be competing in the tournament.The post was later deleted, and Britain's Davis Cup captain Leon Smith clarified that ""no decision had been made.""""I'm going to wait until the last minute to see if I'm going to be able to play and I've earned the right to do that,"" Reuters quoted Murray's statement shared by his management team.""This isn't clearcut where I'm 100% going to be ready to play or there's a 0% chance I can play.

All tennis players have degenerative joints in the back but it’s all predominantly been left-sided for me for pretty much my whole career. I’ve never had too many issues with the right side.“Maybe there’s something which can be done between now and then [Wimbledon] with my right side – I will have a scan tomorrow and re-check and see what can be done. I don’t know exactly what the problem is. I just know I haven’t experienced that before – the back pain today and yesterday. I don’t know what the procedure will be or what to expect,” he added.As the tennis world looks forward to Wimbledon, the absence of Andy Murray serves as a reminder of the physical demands of professional sports and the unforeseen challenges athletes may encounter.","Andy Murray has been compelled to withdraw from the prestigious Wimbledon tournament following a surgical procedure to remove a spinal cyst.
