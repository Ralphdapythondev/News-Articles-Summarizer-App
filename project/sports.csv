Neeraj Chopra: Paris Olympics: Defending champion Neeraj Chopra ready to begin his quest for another gold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/paris-olympics-defending-champion-neeraj-chopra-ready-to-begin-his-quest-for-another-gold/articleshow/112303973.cms,"PARIS: A phone call woke me up early in the morning. This was in July of 2016. ""You must meet this guy. He is tall, he is good looking, he is humble. Above all, he is your future athletics superstar. Javelin phekta hai. It will be a great photo-op too."" Neeraj Chopra ? Javelin? The name didn't ring a bell. Sounded like a PR pitch. We let that pass.A few days later, this Chopra boy won the World junior javelin gold in Poland with a huge throw of 86.48m.It was a junior world record to boot. Any elite thrower would be proud of that in a Diamond League competition. He was just 18.He returned home a hero. The photo-ops and interviews did happen. Journalists scrambled to find where Khandra village was on Haryana's map; what he ate, when he slept.After the initial buzz, the excitement died down. The sponsors stayed away; the media was lukewarm. The army stepped up and offered him the job of a junior commissioned officer (JCO) as naib subedar. The boy from humble beginnings was relieved. The future had been secured. Neeraj could have lost his focus there, the hunger inside him could have been satiated by a government job, as has happened way too often with many talented athletes in the past. But he knew that it was just the beginning of his journey. The script was different. This man was different.That was then. Cut to the present, Neeraj Chopra is a superstar. Rockstar, if you like. Yes, he is tall, good looking and humble. He is also the best in his business, in the world.Neeraj's story of how he picked up sports as a young boy to fight obesity is well documented. It is well known that he loves choorma made by his mother. It is well known that he loves eating dal and can have bowls of it at a go. That's not important today.Neeraj has come here with an unprecedented load of expectations. He has won it all – from Asian Games gold to Commonwealth Games gold. He is the defending Olympic champion and a world champion too. He is just 26, at the peak of his prowess.The past eight years have not been easy for Neeraj, though. The journey of an elite athlete never is. After the Poland spark, Neeraj suffered a back injury. After recovering from that, he won the Asian athletics championship gold with an 85-plus throw. The world championship next was below expectations and then, injury struck again. A groin injury.He was also forced to part ways with his Australian coach Gary Calvert, the man who honed his skills and made him a world athlete. Calvert's contract was not renewed by the government. He left for China and later died there in 2021.Neeraj had to move on. Now, he was training with Werner Daniels in Germany. After a slight tweak in his technique, Neeraj was ready for bigger challenges. He won the Commonwealth Games gold medal first in May 2018 and followed it up with the Asian Games gold with a best effort of 88.04m. He had become a national star.The focus was now the Tokyo Olympic Games 2020. Neeraj was shaping up well and then suffered another injury. He had to undergo surgery to remove bone spurs in his right elbow in Mumbai in May 2019. There were doubts whether he would be the same on his return.After a six-month rehab and recovery programme, Neeraj joined hands with German biomechanics expert Klaus Bartonietz and went to South Africa to prepare for the Tokyo Games. He returned to competition in January 2020, won it and qualified for the Olympics Due to the pandemic, the Games were postponed. Neeraj returned home and trained at NIS, Patiala and in Bhubaneswar. He then went to Sweden for training and competition and then went to Japan. A throw of 87.58m was enough to get him the gold. He made it look so easy. He was now just the second Indian after Abhinav Bindra to win an individual Olympic gold.After Tokyo, Neeraj crossed the final frontier. He won the World athletics gold with a throw of 88.17m. The second Asian Games followed, and his personal best followed. 89.94m, at the Stockholm Diamond League in Sweden in June 2022.All this while the talk had centred around the 90m-mark. When will that come? It was the question he faced everywhere he went. He would take a deep breath and say, it is around the corner. Deep inside, he knew it was irrelevant. It is the medals that matter, not small, little numbers.This year has been a quiet one for Neeraj. He took part in only three competitions on the road to Paris. He finished second in the Doha Diamond League in May with 88.36m and was first in the Paavo Nurmi Games in June with 85.97m. In between, he returned home to take part in the Federation Cup in Bhubaneswar in May.Neeraj's preparations were hampered by an adductor muscle issue early this year. Is he fit enough to go for gold, or at least a medal? His coach had said a month ago that the adductor niggle was gone. ""It is fine, it is looking good. He is having full throwing sessions,"" Bartonietz had said.Neeraj is on track. He is ready. The nation will hold its breath and keep fingers crossed when he competes on Thursday here at the Olympic Stadium. Before that, there is this small routine of competing in the qualifications today.","Neeraj Chopra is the defending Olympic champion and a world champion too. He has won it all – from Asian Games gold to Commonwealth Games gold. He is just 26, at the peak of his prowess.

He would also be the first Indian to win two gold medals in an individual event at the Olympics.Only four athletes have achieved this feat before: Eric Lemming of Sweden in 1908 and 1912, Jonni Myyra of Finland in 1920 and 1924, Jan Zelezny of the Czech Republic in 1992, 1996, and 2000, and Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2004 and 2008.",Lakshya Sen misses out on a bronze medal in badminton.

ONE-MATCH SUSPENSION FOR ROHIDAS

HOW ROHIDAS'S ABSENCE AFFECTS INDIA

The Indian men's hockey team has received a jolt ahead of their Paris Olympics semifinal against Germany and are already at a disadvantage in their quest for a place in the final after 44 years.The Tokyo Olympics bronze medallists will have only 15 players available to play the last-four clash instead of a full squad of 16 after defender Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match following his red card in the quarterfinal against Great Britain.The 31-year-old Rohidas was spotted swinging his stick across the face of British forward Will Calnan in the second quarter of the match on Sunday. The on-field umpire did not rule the offence as serious to get a red card, but Rohidas was shown red and given the marching orders after a video referral.Subsequently, India played the British team with 10 players for more than 40 minutes. However, the Harmanpreet Singh-led side defended heroically, thanks largely to PR Sreejesh's presence in the goalpost, to hold onto the 1-1 scoreline and take the game to a shootout.Goalkeeper Sreejesh once again turned out to be the star, saving two attempts by the GB team in the one-on-one shootout to help India earn a dramatic 4-2 win and a second successive entry into the semis at the Olympics.After the match, India officially raised a concern ""about the quality of umpiring and decision-making"" and citied ""several inconsistencies in officiating"" that ""potentially influenced the game's outcome"".Among the issues raised by India were ""inconsistent video umpire reviews, particularly regarding the red-card decision"" and the fact that the British goalkeeper was being coached from behind the goalpost during the shootout.""Hockey India calls for a thorough review of these matters to uphold the integrity of the sport and ensure fair play in future matches,"" the complaint read.However, later in the evening, the tournament's organising committee handed Rohidas a one-match ban for breaching the FIH Code of Conduct, which means India will have one player less in their usual squad of 16 men for the semifinal against Germany.“Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match for a breach of the FIH Code of Conduct which occurred during the India vs Great Britain match on August 4,” read the official statement by the FIH.“The suspension affects match No. 35 (India’s semi-final match against Germany), where Amit Rohidas will not participate and India will play with a squad of 15 players only.”Rohidas's absence will seriously hamper the Indian defence, their options of drag-flickers on penalty corners and rolling substitutions. Most importantly, the team will miss the rushing skills of Rohidas.He is considered one of the best rushers in the world when it comes to penalty-corner defence, and his absence will force India's chief coach Craig Fulton to alter India's short-corner strategy against Germany.",Amit Rohidas has been suspended for one match by the FIH.

NEW DELHI: The Indian men's hockey team delivered an outstanding performance to secure a spot in the Olympic semifinals for the second time in a row while Lakshya Sen 's dreams of gold medal shifted to a potential bronze on a mixed-result day for India at the Paris Games.India's 53rd position in the medal tally did not improve on Sunday as no new medals were added but the hockey team's incredible shoot-out win over Great Britain turned out to be the highlight of the day.India's current tally includes bronze medals, all in shooting events -- from the women's 10m air pistol, 10m air pistol mixed team, and men's 50m rifle three positions.In boxing, Lovlina Borgohain, a bronze medalist in the welterweight category at the Tokyo Games, faced disappointment. Borgohain lost in the quarterfinals to Chinese veteran Li Qian in the women's middleweight (75kg) category.Lakshya Sen also faced a setback in his bid for gold, losing 20-22, 14-21 to defending champion Viktor Axelsen.However, Sen has another chance for a medal as he will compete against Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in the bronze playoff scheduled for Monday evening.Despite the challenges, the Indian contingent had a reason to rejoice. The men's hockey team showed remarkable resilience, particularly after key defender Amit Rohidas received a red card for unintentionally hitting a rival player 20 minutes into the game.The team managed to hold off Britain to 1-1, leading to a decisive shoot-out.Veteran goalkeeper PR Sreejesh , often referred to as the 'Great Wall of India', then played a crucial role in the shoot-out.

We're all in this together,"" he said.India's boxing campaign came to an unsuccessful end after Lovlina Borgohain, the Tokyo bronze-winner, lost in the women's 75kg quarterfinals to China's Li Qian.The defeat followed a close loss by Nishant Dev in the men's 71kg quarterfinals, leaving the team without any medals.Borgohain, who is the reigning world champion in her category, was defeated 1-4 in a challenging match against Li Qian, the Tokyo Games silver medalist. Both boxers received repeated cautions for clinching and holding during the contest.India was represented by a six-member boxing contingent at the Games, consisting of four women and two men. Four of these boxers were eliminated in the preliminary stages.India's pursuit of a historic first Olympic gold in badminton was dashed when Lakshya Sen lost to Viktor Axelsen in the men's singles semifinals.The 22-year-old Sen, who previously won a bronze at the World Championships, could not hold onto his early leads in either game of the 54-minute match against the two-time world champion.Sen initially had a three-point advantage in the first game and followed with a 7-0 lead in the second game.Despite the promising starts, he ultimately succumbed to Axelsen's prowess, leaving the dream unfulfilled.India is yet to clinch an Olympic gold in badminton.PV Sindhu won a silver and bronze in the 2016 Rio and 2020 Tokyo Olympics , respectively, while Saina Nehwal secured a bronze at the 2012 London Games.Shooters Vijayveer Sidhu and Anish Bhanwala put up commendable performances in the qualifications of the 25m rapid fire men's pistol event in Chateauroux but fell short of making it to the finals.Vijayveer and Anish displayed brilliant shooting skills over the two stages of qualification.They remained strong contenders until the final 10 shots of the second rapid-fire stage.However, they shot scores of 92 and 93, finishing in ninth and 13th places respectively. Unfortunately, only the top six shooters advance to the final round.In the women's skeet competition, Maheshwari Chauhan and Raiza Dhillon also showed competitive spirit. Maheshwari ended in 14th place, scoring a total of 118 across five series. The first three series, which took place on Saturday, saw her scoring 23, 24, and 24, followed by 25 and 22 in the subsequent series.Raiza finished in 23rd place with a total score of 113, after recording 21, 22, 23, 23, and 24 in her series.Similar to the men's event, only the top six in the qualifications moved on to the final stage.India's performance in the athletics competition saw national record holders Parul Chaudhary and Jeswin Aldrin falling short in their respective events.While Parul failed to qualify for the women's 3000m steeplechase, Jeswin Aldrin did not make it through the men's long jump qualification, both ending their campaigns at the Paris Olympics .Parul finished eighth in her heat and 21st overall in the women's 3000m steeplechase.Jeswin fouled his first two attempts in the men's long jump qualification before recording a jump of 7.61 meters on his third try.He concluded the competition 13th in Group B and was placed 26th overall.",Lakshya Sen loses to Viktor Axelsen in men's singles badminton.

When Cassell played his first ODI against Oman in Dundee, he stole the show.However, Cassell left a lasting impression by taking an incredible seven wicket haul (7/21) and shattering Kagiso Rabada's nine-year record (6/16) for the best bowling stats on an ODI debut.In his debut international match, Cassell took two wickets in his first two deliveries, capping a fairytale start.The right-arm bowler took five wickets by the eighteenth over, and he went on to demolish the last few overs to finish with numbers of 7/21.In addition to shattering records, Cassell's performance was listed as the seventh-best bowling stats in ODI history, only surpassed by Andy Bichel , Wanindu Hasaranga, Rashid Khan , Glenn McGrath, Shahid Afridi, and Chaminda Vaas.","India's Washington Sundar is a nominee for the July ICC Player of the Month Award.

Will 'Skeleton bone test' be able to end the age fraud menace in Indian grassroots football?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-skeleton-bone-test-be-able-to-end-the-age-fraud-menace-in-indian-grassroots-football/articleshow/112229085.cms,"What is a skeleton bone test?

NEW DELHI: If you google "" age fraud in Indian football "", you'll find countless entries, articles, short-form, long-form, evidence-driven ones, written by countless writers, journalists, and observers of the beautiful game of football.One can find the news of the Indian under-15 football team's captain turning out to be almost eighteen months over the age limit for the Asian under-16 championship in April 2019 or an under-17 player initially rejected by coach Nicolai Adam for his ""unnatural height"" at age 14 was later accepted into the team under Luis Norton de Matos, everything is already so well-documented.While age fraud remains a persistent issue in Indian football, we should now be looking for a more permanent and accurate solution to fight it.And it should begin early, from the grassroots level of Indian football, like the Subroto Cup , an annual school football tournament held in India, named after Subroto Mukerjee, the founder of the Air India Football Club. The prestigious tournament, established in 1960, was once graced by players like Baichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri and will enter its 63rd edition on August 5.Aimed at promoting the sport at the grassroots level, it will host a jaw-dropping 111 teams across three categories, with the sub-junior (under-15) category introduced for the first time this year. It will also have some teams from foreign countries too.To fight the demon of age fraud, the organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament, offering a promising solution to address this issue effectively.During the opening press conference of the Subroto Cup, TimesofIndia.com raised concerns about age fraud. Answering, an Air Force Sports Control Board (AFSCB) spokesperson stated, ""All and every footballer (who will be participating in the Subroto Cup) is registered on the AIFF website. And each of them gets a unique code. We also want to avoid age fraud. As per the AIFF guidelines, a skeleton bone test will be done for the under-15 boys category. For the under-17 category, it will be normal medical. The skeleton bone test or the age-detection test will all be done under the guidelines of AIFF.""The skeleton bone test, commonly known as a bone age assessment, estimates a person's age, especially in children and adolescents, by analyzing their bones.This process typically involves taking an X-ray of the left hand and wrist, as this area contains bones that undergo predictable developmental changes with age. The X-ray is then compared to standard reference images, such as those in the Greulich-Pyle Atlas, to determine the bone's developmental stage, including the appearance of growth plates and the fusion of epiphyses.It is understood that 22 teams in the under-14 category were disqualified and did not participate in the Subroto Cup after failing the age-determination test last time. According to AIFF guidelines, if four or more players from a team are found to be over-aged, that team will be immediately disqualified and barred from the tournament.""Apart from that, all the players who have already registered through AIFF and CRS (central registration system), have their age verified. The people who are coming are less in numbers. So, in times to come, age fraud, which is prevalent in football, is likely to reduce,"" he ended on a positive note, sounding hopeful, as we all are, of a better future.","The Subroto Cup is an annual school football tournament held in India.
