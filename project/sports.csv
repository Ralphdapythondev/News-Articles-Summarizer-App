Bumrah ke paas aisi kala hai

NEW DELHI: As India defeated Afghanistan by 47 runs to make a winning start to their Super Eights campaign, in the T20 World Cup on Thursday, Jasprit Bumrah returned with another match-winning performance.Chasing 182, Afghanistan were bowled out for 134 with Bumrah registering astounding figures of 4-1-7-3.Lauding his performance, former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif said on his official X handle, ""India's opponents should thank God that Bumrah wasn't there in the 2022 T20 World Cup. India had lost to England by 10 wickets and we were smothered by Jos Buttler and Alex Hales, it was a shameful defeat but Bumrah wasn't there.""Kaif adds, ""He (Bumrah) makes a comeback in the Asia Cup after injury, India wins, he plays ODI World Cup and India reaches the finals. And here also, he played first in New York, took wickets there and here also on a slow pitch with no swing, he used the slower ball and the cutter to dismiss the batsmen.""Summing up the dismissal of Afghanistan opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz , Kaif says, ""Gurbaz left the wicket to hit but Bumrah doesn't change the action when he bowls a slower delivery that spins like a top in the air with so many revolutions and the ball also dips there. Gurbaz reached for the ball, couldn't play it properly and was out caught behind.""Kaif reckoned the same happened with the other Afghanistan opener Hazratullah Zazai, ""Zazai went to the leg side to play, but the ball was a slower one and stopped a bit after bouncing and was caught at third man.""Summing up Bumrah's three-wicket haul against Pakistan earlier in the tournament Kaif said, ""So(Bumrah has the art) of bowling according to the conditions. His deliveries hit the deck in seaming conditions. He dismissed Babar (Azam) caught in the slips, clean bowled Rizwan (Mohammad) and in the last over dismissed Iftikhar (Ahmed) by a yorker. So there he was bowling different.""""And here (in Barbados) on a slow pitch where there's no help, he took wickets by changing the pace of deliveries. You won't get a bowler like Bumrah, we Indians are very fortunate that we have a bowler like him who is in such a good form that he will play a crucial role in India winning the World Cup. Thank you so much Bumrah,"" Kaif concluded.On a slow-paced Barbados wicket, Bumrah took three wickets for just seven runs and his four-over spell was aided by Arshdeep Singh , who finished with 3-36. Spinners Kuldeep Yadav (2-32) and Axar Patel (1-15) shared three wickets after Suryakumar Yadav scored 53 off 28 balls — his fifth T20 World Cup half-century — as India reached 181/8 in 20 overs after deciding to bat.","India defeated Afghanistan by 47 runs to make a winning start to their Super Eights campaign, in the T20 World Cup on Thursday.

Ambrose warns about burn-out

Test cricket creates legends

Fast-bowling legend Curtly Ambrose holds Jasprit Bumrah in high regard. Despite the Indian spearhead's history of stress fractures, Ambrose believes that Bumrah's unorthodox action should remain unchanged, mainitaining that all fast bowlers face the risk of injury when they step onto the field.""What I can tell you something about Jasprit Bumrah, I'm a big fan -- ever since I saw him for the first time,"" said Ambrose in an interview with PTI.""He's so unconventional but highly effective, and that's what I like about him. When you look at traditional fast bowlers, you wouldn't look at Bumrah, he's so unorthodox.""At 30 years old, Bumrah possesses the ability to take wickets at any stage of a limited-over match. In Test cricket, he is equally effective with both the new and old ball, particularly when the ball starts to reverse swing.Widely considered the best all-format pacer in the game currently, Bumrah has encountered his share of back issues and underwent surgery in March of the previous year. Following an extensive rehabilitation period, he made his comeback prior to the ODI World Cup in India in November and has been in top form since then.Ambrose emphasized that Bumrah should maintain his current approach and technique, making no alterations to his bowling style.""He has done a great job for India and still doing a great job in all formats. I met him a couple of years ago when India played in Antigua. He's someone I've always enjoyed watching because he's so different,"" said Ambrose, part of promotions for the T20 World Cup being jointly hosted by the US and the West Indies Bumrah's unique bowling action, with his chest open at the point of delivery, can potentially put extra strain on his back. However, Ambrose believes that every pace bowler has to cope with certain risks associated with their craft.""From my little experience, there are no two bowlers who are exactly alike. Bowlers may have similarities but they are never exactly alike and we all have our different styles everyone is different. In terms of his longevity, in terms of injuries, (for) every fast bowler, there is always risk of being injured. But at the same time you can't go out there thinking that wa,"" said the 60-year-old Ambrose.""You've got to go out there and do the job to the best of your ability and whatever happens, happens. The only way he should change is if he, may be, sustains a serious injury or has to re-model his action or something,"" said the legendary pacer, who featured in 98 Tests for the West Indies and took 405 wickets.Ambrose, a towering figure at 6 feet 7 inches, consistently challenged the world's elite batsmen with his ability to generate extra bounce. However, he doesn't attribute the strain on Bumrah's back solely to his bowling action.""I've never been through it (stress fracture). So it would be unfair for me to even try to say what to do. I will leave that for the medical expert. I don't think Bumrah's stress comes totally from his action.""You can look at Ian Bishop, he had a perfect action and he also had stress fracture,"" reasoned the cricketer from Antigua.The global cricket schedule is more packed than it has ever been, with numerous T20 leagues across the globe occupying a significant portion of the calendar. Ambrose recognized the substantial changes the sport has undergone and the detrimental effects of an overloaded itinerary.""The game has become a bit more commercialised. Too much cricket is being played as well. Players are leaving from one series to the next, there is franchise cricket as well. Guys could get burnt out,"" he said.""It's still exciting. There are wonderful players around but too much cricket is being played and that to me would be a bit of a concern.""Ambrose, who hails from Antigua, participated extensively in limited-overs cricket throughout his career. However, he firmly believes that Test cricket is the only format that produces legends.""I've always preferred Test match cricket over anything else. I've played ODIs, I've played four-day cricket, but for me it isn't international cricket. Test match cricket for me is a real cricket.""I believe at the end of a career, if you've been judged, if you want to become a legend, you have to play Test cricket. You would not become a legend playing ODIs or T20s. There is talk about Tests dying, I don't really think so.""...the powers that be, need to do something to make Test match cricket a little more attractive and we're going to be okay. But Test match cricket is not going anywhere,"" he asserted.Ambrose dominated the cricketing world during the 1990s, cherishing his duels with legendary batsmen such as Sachin Tendulkar. If he were playing in the current era, the formidable bowler would have eagerly embraced the challenge of bowling to the contemporary greats of the game like Virat Kohli.""When I played, I thrived on challenges. In every team, there were at least a handful of great batsmen. And you know, with a reputation as well. So for me, they tend to bring the best out of me when I play.""To dismiss them gives me more pleasure than dismissing numbers 9, 10, 11. You talk about these guys, they are great players (Kohli & Co). It would be nice to play against them but having said that, I've played against some greats in my time as well,"" he said.Highlighting the increasing competitiveness of the sport at the international level, Ambrose expressed happiness with the performance of teams like USA and Afghanistan.""Well, prior to the start of the World Cup, I predicted some upsets and so far we've seen a few. So, I am quite happy for that, it makes the tournament more interesting as opposed to all of the big teams just running away,"" he said.",West Indies legend Curtly Ambrose holds Jasprit Bumrah in high regard. Ambrose believes that all fast bowlers face the risk of injury when they step onto the field. The 60-year-old believes that Test cricket is the only format that produces legends.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111131720,imgsize-33268,width-400,resizemode-4/111131720.jpg"

Former India opener Virender Sehwag didn't hold back in expressing his opinion on Pakistan cricket in the wake of their T20 World Cup debacle, accusing their current chief selector Wahab Riaz of bias, which is hurting the country's cricket.Riaz, a former Pakistan pacer, was in November last year appointed the head of the selection committee by the Pakistan Cricket Board .Incidentally, it coincided with the comeback of veteran pacer Mohammad Amir to the national squad.Amir, who used to play alongside Riaz, was part of the Pakistan squad that played the ongoing T20 World Cup and exited in the group-stage itself after defeats against India and USA.It led to the team drawing a lot of flak from the Pakistan public and former cricketers, with Riaz and skipper Babar Azam central to that criticism, besides questions on team's fitness and selection of certain players.Reacting to that on a Cricbuzz show, Sehwag said: ""Wahab Riaz and Mohammad Amir, these are two names who criticized Pakistan team on the same TV channel, giving their comments...Today, one of them is a selector (Riaz) and one is in the playing eleven (Amir).""""So the same persons who were criticizing (Pakistan cricket), if today they have power, became the selector, what have they done first up? 'Mohammad Amir was with me, let's select him'. It's like if Ajit Agarkar is chairman (of BCCI selection committee) today, he will say 'come Viru, come Zak (Zahir Khan)', I will facilitate your comeback',"" Sehwag added.While not mincing his words on the biased attitude of Pakistan selectors, Sehwag advised them to ""not do favours"".""You have become a selector, you have to look at the future.

He pointed out what went wrong for the co-hosts in the game.""Can’t afford 51 dot balls on a good batting surface,"" Bishop wrote on X.England captain Jos Buttler 's decision to bowl first after winning the toss quickly proved to be a wise one.Despite a cautious start, Brandon King ignited the crowd with a massive 101-metre six and three boundaries. However, misfortune struck when King, on 23, suffered a side strain and had to retire hurt, leaving the West Indies in a vulnerable state.The responsibility of stabilising the innings fell on the shoulders of Nicholas Pooran and Johnson Charles. Charles began to play more aggressively, but England's bowlers maintained discipline and kept the scoring rate under control.When Charles was dismissed for a well-played 38, Rovman Powell elevated himself in the batting order and provided a much-needed boost with a scintillating cameo. Powell's 36 off just 17 deliveries, which included five massive sixes, three of them off Liam Livingstone, raised hopes of the West Indies reaching an imposing total.England's bowlers, however, mounted a comeback just as the hosts appeared poised to surpass the 200-run mark.Livingstone made amends by removing Powell in the same over, while Jofra Archer dismissed the struggling Pooran, who scored 36 off 32 balls. Adil Rashid then struck a vital blow, luring Andre Russell into a poorly executed shot that resulted in a catch.The West Indies ultimately posted a total of 180, despite a late flourish from Sherfane Rutherford, who contributed a quick-fire 28 from 15 balls.Salt spearheaded England's dominant performance with a blistering knock, amassing runs off just 47 deliveries. His innings featured seven boundaries and five maximums. Bairstow provided valuable support, remaining unbeaten on 48 off a mere 26 balls, including five fours and two sixes.However, the English bowling unit deserves equal praise for their disciplined effort. They collectively delivered an impressive 51 dot balls, with Jofra Archer and Adil Rashid being the standout performers.Archer conceded only 34 runs in his spell, while Rashid was even more economical, giving away just 21 runs. Together, they accounted for 22 of the total dot balls bowled.The convincing victory, achieved with 15 balls to spare, significantly boosted England's net run-rate to 1.343. This impressive performance propelled them to the top of the standings, surpassing South Africa, who had earlier secured a win against co-hosts USA on the same day.West Indies will next take on the United States on Saturday in Barbados, while England will face South Africa on Friday in St Lucia.","West Indies legend Ian Bishop criticises his team for conceding defeat too easily.

Pakistani Legend Wasim Akram on Rishabh Pant : The Greatest Comeback

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram commended India's wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant 's remarkable comeback following a severe accident, describing it as an inspiring tale for future generations. He referred to Pant as a 'miracle child,' acknowledging his extraordinary performance on comeback in the Indian Premier League and the T20 World Cup .Akram expressed relief upon seeing Pant's recovery and lauded his batting prowess. The former pace legend conveyed these sentiments in an interview with Sportskeeda, emphasizing the collective concern felt even in Pakistan over Pant's condition after the accident.""Pant ki performance dekh rahe hai. Miracle jo iss ladke ne kiya hai, dikhaya hai ki he is super human. Jis tragedy se woh wapas aaya hai. Jis tarah se uska accident, maine clips dekhe the, we were all worried in Pakistan [The kind of performance Pant is giving after that accident, he is proving he is a super human. We saw the clips and all were worried about him]. I was worried, actually maine tweet bhi kiya tha unke baare me. And he came back and he averaged 40 this year in IPL - 446 runs, strike rate of 155. Woh toh miracle bachcha hai,” Akram said.In the ongoing T20 World Cup, Pant maintains his exceptional form, leading as the top run-scorer for Team India after the group stages, having scored 96 runs in three innings with an average of 48.Akram also praised Pant's Test career achievements, pointing to significant innings against Australia and England.""Jis tarike se usne Test cricket me performance di. Jo Australia me jaake usne 100 kiya. Phir uske baad England ke khilaaf usne batting ki. Test cricket me reverse sweeps, [James] Anderson ko, [Pat] Cummins ko. He is special,"" Akram said.Reflecting on Pant’s resilience and mental strength post-accident, Akram deemed his story a powerful example for young people globally.""And especially what he has been through in that horrific accident. Uske baad comeback karna. Kitna mentally strong yeh ladka hoga. That's a story to be told for generations to generations in my opinion. To motivate young people of the world - ki comeback ho sakta hai, jaise Pant ne kiya,” he added.Akram echoed former India captain Sourav Ganguly 's perception of Pant as a natural and instinctive leader.""I will second Ganguly that Pant ek natural captain hai, instinctive captain he jo mauke par decision karta hai. Woh bada jaruri hai T20 format mai [Agree with Ganguly that Pant is a natural, instinctive captain and took decisions according to the situation, which is very important in T20 cricket],"" Akram said.""Aap T20 format me yeh nahi jaa sakte ki yaar ek raat pahle - do overs yeh karega, do overs yeh karega, do overs yeh karega, na. Aap jaate ho ki pehla over yeh karega and then situation kiya hai. Agar pahle over me ek wicket le liya hai toh usko me dusra bhi kara dunga. Agar nahi toh main kisi aur ko le aaunga. Yeh instinctive captaani hoti hai. Batting order bhi aap pehle se nahi plan kar sakte hai, situation ki mutabiq change karte ho aap. That's where I think Pant is good at,"" Akram elaborated.","Former Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram commended India's wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant's remarkable comeback following a severe accident.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions England cruised to an eight-wicket win against hosts West Indies in their Super Eights clash of the T20 World Cup at Gros Islet in St Lucia on Thursday.Opener Philip Salt smashed an unbeaten 47-ball 87 as England chased down the 181-run target with 21 balls to spare.Salt was first involved in a 67-run stand with his captain Jos Buttler (25) and then in an unbeaten 97-run partnership with Jonny Bairstow (48*).Salt hit 5 sixes and 7 fours in his knock and a major factor for England cruising to victory was a brutal assault by the England opener in one over off West Indies' pacer Romario Shepherd .The assault came in the 16th over of the run chase when Shepherd came on to bowl his second over having conceded 11 runs in his first over.Salt smashed 4, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4 in the over to heap misery on the Windies and shut out any hopes they were harbouring of a victory.Salt hit the first ball over extra cover for a four to reach his fifty. The second ball was mistimed but such was the power behind the shot that it went all the way straight down the ground for a six.Salt hit the third delivery over the keeper for a four and smacked the fourth delivery over long-off for another six.The carnage continued as the fifth delivery, a slower ball, was dispatched over deep square leg with a pull for another six and the last ball, a juicy full toss was sent sailing over mid-off to complete the 30-run over.It was the West Indies' first loss of the tournament and their first defeat in eight Twenty20 internationals.The West Indies made 180/4 batting first on the same pitch on which they made 218/5 against Afghanistan in the final match of the group stage on Monday.",Philip Salt hits unbeaten 87 as England beat hosts West Indies by eight wickets.

NEW DELHI: England leads Group C at the European Championship after a 1-0 victory against Serbia, while Denmark and Slovenia ended their match in a 1-1 draw. The two group rivals, England and Denmark, are set to face off on Thursday at the Waldstadion in Frankfurt, with the match starting at 6 p.m. local time (16:00 GMT).Denmark is in dire need of a win, particularly considering their final Group C game against Serbia will be a tough challenge. This encounter brings back memories of their Euro 2020 semifinal, where England triumphed 2-1 in extra time after Harry Kane scored from a rebound off his saved penalty. Despite still being upset about the penalty decision, Denmark's coach Kasper Hjulmand is concentrating on the upcoming match.Both teams have players who are teammates at Manchester United, Crystal Palace, and Brentford, making the squads well-acquainted with each other. Gareth Southgate, England's coach, is in his fourth tournament and is less worried about the style of the win against Serbia, having previously navigated England through group stages with ease.Southgate is considering keeping Trent Alexander-Arnold in central midfield and must make decisions on options such as debutants Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton. With left-back Luke Shaw still unavailable, Kieran Trippier may continue to play on the left side.Denmark has no reported injuries, and captain Simon Kjaer is ready to return to the line up. A draw might be enough for Denmark to stay in contention for a spot in the knockout stage, while another victory for England could see them finish at the top of the group and face a third-place team in the round of 16.It's worth noting that England has never won their first two games in a Euros tournament, and Denmark's Kjaer, who did not play against Slovenia, now has 132 caps, just one more than Christian Eriksen, who scored in the 1-1 draw.The UEFA European Championship 2024 Group C match between England vs Denmark is set for June 20, Thursday.The UEFA Euro 2024 match is scheduled to kick off at 9:30 PM IST on Thursday at Frankfurt in Germany .

An early goal by Scott McTominay gave Scotland the lead, while Switzerland equalized through a stunning strike from Xherdan Shaqiri following a defensive error.After suffering a humiliating 5-1 loss against Germany, Scotland aimed to restore their pride. They found success early when Scott McTominay's shot deflected off Fabian Schar and into the net, putting them ahead in the 13th minute. However, Switzerland quickly responded with Xherdan Shaqiri intercepting a poor Scottish pass and sending a curling shot into the top corner, making it 1-1.The match saw Switzerland create numerous chances and appear more dangerous, but Scotland's defense, bolstered by enthusiastic traveling fans, managed to hold them off. Swiss forward Dan Ndoye came close to scoring multiple times but was kept at bay by Scotland's resolute defense.Despite being on the brink of securing advancement alongside Group A rivals Germany, Switzerland missed their chance due to Scotland's spirited defense and near scoring opportunities in the second half. This spirited performance marked a significant turnaround from Scotland's disorganized display against Germany.Scotland manager Steve Clarke expressed satisfaction with his team's performance.""That's what we expected. This is the way we've been playing for the last three or four years,"" Clarke was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""We knew what we had to do it. It was a good team performance against good opponents and a good reaction... We're still alive.""Switzerland's coach Murat Yakin reintroduced forward Xherdan Shaqiri into the starting lineup, and the veteran made an immediate impact, causing significant difficulties for the Scottish defense.Shaqiri's return paid off when he intercepted a poor pass and delivered a spectacular curling shot to equalize after Ricardo Rodriguez narrowly missed earlier with a volley wide of the post. Scotland's goal came after Andy Robertson led a counter-attack, passing to Callum McGregor, who set up McTominay.Ndoye nearly gave Switzerland the lead before halftime, forcing a save from Angus Gunn and having a goal disallowed for offside. In the second half, Scotland came out aggressively. Grant Hanley almost restored the lead for Scotland, hitting the post with a header.McTominay also had a late chance, but his shot was blocked by Manuel Akanji.""We had our chances, but so did they, it was an open game, two really good teams going at it,"" said Scotland captain Andy Robertson.Robertson highlighted the team's effort, stating, ""It was just about getting back to being us. We've also left absolutely everything out there today.""Swiss coach Yakin acknowledged his team's missed opportunities but remained optimistic about their position in the group.",Scotland and Switzerland draw 1-1 in their Euro 2024 Group A match.

The Scot, who is a two-time Wimbledon champion and five-time Queen's winner, had already shown signs of discomfort during his first-round victory over Alexei Popyrin on Tuesday.As Murray enters what is expected to be his final year on tour, fitness issues continue to plague him, potentially jeopardizing his hopes of making a final appearance at Wimbledon, which is set to begin in less than two weeks.Reflecting on the brief encounter, the 30-year-old Thompson noted, ""I could see he had a problem in the warm-up and then his first serve.""""I thought, 'hit the ball in and make him run'. I actually learned that from him, when he was playing, and if a guy was hurt or cramping or something, he'd always use a drop shot or just try and take it up the line.""He added: ""I learned a lot of things watching him play, so it's an honour to share the court with him, but it's just sad that it ended like that.""","Andy Murray forced to retire after just five games due to injury.

"Not satisfied with Olympics entry, want to win the medal: Sriram Balaji",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/not-satisfied-with-olympics-entry-want-to-win-the-medal-sriram-balaji/articleshow/111120088.cms,"PUNE: It has already been an incredible journey as a professional tennis player for Sriram Balaji .Having started comparatively late at the age of nine in the southern city of Coimbatore, the 34-year-old Balaji is now on the cusp of playing in the Olympics — as Grand Slam champion Rohan Bopanna ’s doubles partner in Paris.Only Nirupama Sanjeev from the city known for its textile and auto industry has wielded the racquet for India at the Summer Games before.Yet, Balaji has come a long way, so much so that he is not ready to be satisfied by simply turning up in India colours, but go all the way and fetch the coveted medal.“Last year I played couple of slams. I did have the game, but was not sharp enough. The last couple of months I have been playing much better tennis. Earlier I would question myself, now I believe in myself much more, my confidence level has gone up. Right now, I am not getting satisfied (with) just making the entry, I want to win the medal,” Balaji, world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles, said.Balaji conceded playing in the Olympics had not been his goal until recently.“It is truly dream come true for me, thanks to Bops (Bopanna). Yuki (Bhambri) is 10 spots ahead of me in rankings,” said Balaji.“When I started, wanted to take it step by step. First the Under-14s (for India), then the Davis Cup. Olympics was not in my thoughts.""The right-hander who began his tennis journey at Perks Tennis School near his home in Coimbatore under the guidance of Elango Ranganathan, whose daughter Madura was a women’s pro.The first major step-up for Balaji was moving to Chennai at the age of 16 and beginning to work Hiten Joshi and Ilyas Hussain.“They (Joshi and Hussain) told me 'don't play juniors' … so I started playing the men’s (circuit). I earned my first ATP ranking point when I was 16. They were the ones who put me on to (Alexander) Waske (in Germany),” he said.Moving base to Europe was another steep learning curve for the Tamil Nadu lad as he had to adapt fast to the difference in culture and tennis.“It was totally different. My ranking was 800 but I was not even getting into qualifying (of ITF men's events),” Balaji said.“That's how tough it was, the standard was very high. It took me one year (to start winning) ... I lost all my matches. I went there in 2010, it was only in 2011 summer that I started getting into qualifying and winning.“It was also mentally very difficult. It makes you think, 'what am I doing here?' I got a lot of help from the coaches and my parents. They never let me down. They pushed me, they believed in me.”Balaji encountered another speed bump a few years later when his game began to stagnate at between 300 and 400 in world rankings. He was at a crossroads and needed to choose his path — continue to pursue success in singles or switch to doubles.“I did have limitations in my game. It was 2017 and I had to make a choice. That was also my best year,” he said of winning nine doubles titles, including his maiden Challenger, with Vishnu Vardhan .The preceding year the duo had won seven ITF titles.“My belief in singles was less. I believed I could get to top-200, but to get inside top-100 ... I could see that I had limitations, and I knew that in doubles I was capable of top-50.“So the choice was whether to go for top-200 in singles or top-20 in doubles. I chose top-20 doubles.”Almost immediately his ambitions suffered a setback as Vardhan decided to stop playing full schedule.“I didn't have a set partner after that. Every four-five weeks I had a different partner. In 2022, I started playing with Jeevan, in 2023 we did well and then he wanted to take a break,” Balaji said.But the tide began to turn when he started forging a partnership last year with Andre Begemann, a 39-year-old German who had ranked 36 in 2015 and won four ATP Tour titles.The Indo-German combination won three Challengers with Balaji getting into the top-100 in rankings for the first time and Begemann returning to the elite bracket too.“Both of us play in the German league, so I knew him already. It is only in the slams I play with a different partner since we don't get in. Otherwise in Challengers I play with Andre,” said Balaji who had beaten Rajeev Ram and Scott Lipsky in the company of Jeeven Nedunchezhiyan at the Chennai ATP Tour event in 2012.Balaji credited the ‘Doubles Dream of India’ programme for supporting the top-200 ranked players in the country.“It makes a lot of difference. Having a coach through the whole year is not affordable, especially with the less prize money in doubles,” he said.“Someone watching from outside can tell you what you cannot absorb when you are playing.“Providing a coach and a trainer during the matches in doubles, you don't find that in many countries. We have eight players in the top-200 ... without this (programme), players would have a lot of struggle.”This year’s French Open was a sort of dress rehearsal for the Olympics tennis competition, which will be held at the Roland Garros.Balaji had made it to the second round last year, and went one step further this year in tandem with Mexican Miguel-Angel Reyes-Varela. The pair lost to none other than Bopanna and Aussie Matthew Ebden.The fortnight proved to be a rewarding one in many ways for the Indian.“I was not in the tournament to begin with, we were sixth out,” Balaji said.“Rohan also has been mentoring me, telling which tournaments I should be playing. This time I told him I want to come to Paris, it's ok if I miss a Challenger.“I decided I was going to take my chances and signed in. The other thing is you also get to practise with the top players during the Grand Slam.“Finally we got in, thanks to the (inclement) weather also, as the singles players pulled out.”The match against the Australian Open winners in the third round was a difficult one but also brought out the best in Balaji and Begemann.“It was not an easy match, it was really hard (to play against Bopanna),” Balaji said.“I look up to him, he is like a mentor to me. I felt I handled it well.”",Sriram Balaji is on the cusp of playing in the Olympics as Rohan Bopanna’s doubles partner in Paris. The 34-year-old is world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles. The right-hander began his tennis journey at Perks Tennis School near his home in Coimbatore.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111120064,imgsize-124106,width-400,resizemode-4/111120064.jpg"

The decision, driven by concerns over potential injury risks, highlights the demanding physical challenges faced by professional athletes navigating a packed tournament calendar across diverse playing surfaces.Jabeur's withdrawal centres on the Olympic tournament's utilization of clay courts, the same surface used for the French Open .Having concluded her clay court season earlier this month with a quarter-final appearance at the French Open, the world no. 10 is currently transitioning to grass court competitions, followed by the hard courts of the US Open shortly after the Olympics This rapid succession of surface transitions poses a significant challenge for athletes. Adapting to the unique characteristics of each surface – clay's slow bounce and high friction, grass's low bounce and speed, and hard court's medium bounce and pace – requires significant physical adjustments. These adjustments impact movement patterns, footwork, and the strain placed on various muscle groups, particularly the knees.Jabeur, in consultation with her medical team, determined that subjecting her body to such a rapid transition, particularly after an already demanding clay court season, would significantly increase the risk of injury to her knee.""After consulting with my medical team regarding attending the Olympics in Paris we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardise the rest of my season,"" Jabeur wrote on social media.""I have always loved representing my country in any competition.
