HOW DOES RTM COME INTO PLAY?

WHO IS AN UNCAPPED PLAYER?

REGULATIONS FOR OVERSEAS PLAYERS

It's that time of the year when IPL franchises take a call on who to retain or release. With the deadline for 10 teams to submit their list of retained players ending today at 5 pm, TOI takes a look at the rules that have been put in place and how much room teams have to juggle their strategies before the 2025 mega auction...To help the teams keep their core intact, IPL has allowed the franchises to retain a maximum of six players of which five can be capped players (Indian or overseas) and two uncapped. For example: A team can pick a combination of five capped players and one uncapped or four capped and two uncapped.Salary purse each team will have at their disposal. That's a 20 per cent increase from last year's auction. During the last mega auction held for the 2022 edition, the salary cap was Rs 90 crore.A team will end up spending Rs 79 crore if they retain five capped players and one uncapped player to fill their quota of six players and they will be left with a purse of Rs 41 crore during the auction.They can divide the purse of Rs 75 crore among the capped players in any proportion if they choose to retain all five. For example: If the first player is retained for Rs 25 crore they will have to convince the fifth player to be retained for Rs 7 crore.If the franchise spends more than Rs 75 crore on retaining capped players, that amount will be deducted from their auction purse.If a team decides to release all its players, they can enter the auction with six Right to Match (RTM) cards. It depends on the team, how many players they want to retain first or buy through RTMs during the auction.In the 2025 auction , the franchise that bids the highest for a particular player will be given another opportunity to raise their bid to keep hold of that player. They will only lose that player if his previous team matches the increased bid to buy him back. MS Dhoni falls under this category as he hasn't been a part of the starting XI in an international match in the last five years. Also players who are yet to debut for India fall in this category.The minimum base price for a player will be Rs 30 lakh which is a 50 per cent increase from the last auction when the base price was Rs 20 lakh.We have seen in the past that overseas players have pulled out of the IPL just before the start of it. To address this concern, the BCCI has asked all the overseas players to register for the mega auction if they want to take part in the IPL. If they don't, they can't be part of next season's mini auction.Exceptions will be granted only for medical and injury reasons. If one withdraws post auction, he will be banned for two years.",The deadline for 10 teams to submit their list of retained players ending today at 5 pm. IPL has allowed the franchises to retain a maximum of six players of which five can be capped players (Indian or overseas) and two uncapped.

MUMBAI: Will India's cricket stars Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer, who have captained the Delhi Capitals and Kolkata Knight Riders in the past few years, be available at next month's IPL auction, along with KL Rahul , who led the Lucknow Super Giants till last season? The suspense will lift at 5.30pm when all 10 franchises announce their retentions today.Struggling to cope up with India's maiden Test series defeat to New Zealand, the retentions will also serve as a distraction for India's passionate fans. While Rahul is a certainty in the auction as of now, there are indications that Pant and Iyer too could go into the auction pool, but things could well swing at the last minute.""Except the big guns - the Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings , expect a lot of other franchises to save their money for the likes of Pant, Iyer (who led KKR to the IPL title last season) and Rahul, who could all be available in the IPL auction. Rahul, who captained LSG for three seasons, taking them to the playoffs twice, could be a hot buy, especially as he offers captaincy skills.""There are four franchises who have expressed their interest in him - Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Gujarat Titans, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings. Expect all four to go hard for him in the auction,"" a source told TOI.TOI looks at what the 10 franchises are likely to do in terms of retentions on Thursday:According to a reliable source, they are set to retain skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad (Rs 18 crore), Sri Lankan pacer Matheesha Pathirana (Rs 14 crore), Mumbai big hitter Shivam Dube (Rs 11 crore), Ravindra Jadeja (Rs 18 crore) and the legendary MS Dhoni (Rs 4 crore), who will be treated as an uncapped player as he last played for India in the 2019 ODI World Cup. ""They are extremely keen to retain Pathirana, who is likely to play for them in the other T20 leagues too. They will try their best to retain Mumbai seamer Tushar Deshpande, who has done well for them in the past three years, through the RTM (right to match) card,"" a source told TOI.""They might also try the RTM card to get one among New Zealand duo Devon Conway and allrounder Rachin Ravindra. Conway has an edge because he can keep wickets too,"" revealed the source.According to sources, the Mumbai Indians have managed to retain all their India superstars in the lineup - allrounder Hardik Pandya , who captained them in the last season, India skipper Rohit Sharma, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav , ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah and batsman Tilak Varma, which means that they are likely to spend around Rs 75 crore just on retaining their top players.The final word on who will be the MI captain for IPL-2025 is still not decided.Yashasvi Jaiswal is set to be the first player they will retain, at Rs 18 crore. Skipper Sanju Samson, who recently scored his maiden T20I century against Bangladesh (Rs 14 crore), allrounder Riyan Parag (Rs 11 crore) should be their other retentions. They are keen to retain India leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who has done well for them previously in the IPL, and in county cricket recently, but it's reliably learnt that they haven't locked him in yet.Even as they parted ways with their previous captain KL Rahul, the Lucknow Super Giants are set to announce West Indies' explosive batter - wicketkeeper Nicholas Pooran as their primary retention at a salary of over Rs 18 crore, the price slab decided by the BCCI, for the No. 1 retention. As per a source, the only other player they are likely to retain is express pacer Mayank Yadav, who made his debut against Bangladesh at home in the T20Is.Their likely retentions could be skipper Shubman Gill , Afghanistan's ace leg-spinner Rashid Khan, Sai Sudharsan, and Rahul Tewatia (uncapped). They could let go of India's ace pacer Mohammed Shami, who is currently out due to injury.There is a buzz that they could reinstate Virat Kohli as their captain. Other than him, the only other player they may choose to retain is middle-order batter Rajat Patidar, who smashed 159 off just 102 balls for Madhya Pradesh against Haryana in the Ranji Trophy recently and did well for them in the last IPL.Their first retained player is set to be South Africa power-hitter Heinrich Klaasen, who is set to get as much as Rs 23 crore. The franchise's other retention deals are Australia's Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins, who was Sunrisers captain in 2024, at Rs 18 crore, India's T20 opener Abhishek Sharma at Rs 14 crore, and allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy.While Pant's future at the franchise is uncertain, they are set to retain Axar Patel (Rs 18 crore), chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav (Rs 14 crore) and wicketkeeper-batter Abhishek Porel (uncapped, Rs 4 crore). They could retain both their foreign big hitters, South Africa's Tristan Stubbs, and Australia's opener Jake Fraser-McGurk.They will try their best to retain India's left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, even if it means using the RTM card in the auction. ""Arshdeep is someone in whom they have invested a fair bit in, and now he's a top pacer in white-ball cricket. However, they may find it difficult to retain him at a steep price. They are keen to retain two out of the four impressive, uncapped players they have in their line-up, left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar, Shashank Singh, Ashutosh Sharma and 'keeper-bat Prabhsimran Singh,"" a source told this paper.They could let go of not just Iyer, who led them to the IPL title in 2024, but also Sunil Narine and Andre Russell. Their first retained player is set to be mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who has been taking plenty of wickets for them in the last few seasons.'Finisher' Rinku Singh, talented pace bowling allrounder Harshit Rana (uncapped), who has been picked for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy next month, and aggressive English opener Phil Salt could be their other retentions.",IPL teams set to announce retentions today in lead-up to auction. Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer could be available at next month's IPL auction. MS Dhoni will be treated as an uncapped player as he last played for India in the 2019 ODI World Cup.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114798504,imgsize-91346,width-400,resizemode-4/114798504.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Nicholas Pooran could become one of the highest paid retained players in the history of the IPL, TOI has learnt. Lucknow Super Giants and Pooran have reached an agreement where the hard-hitting Trinidadian could end up getting over Rs 20 crore from the franchise, according to IPL sources.""There is a buzz in IPL circles that LSG have agreed to pay Pooran over Rs 20 crore to retain him ahead of the mega auction. The agreement between the two parties was reached in two minutes after consultation with mentor Zaheer Khan and coach Justin Langer ,"" IPL sources said.However, this agreement is no indication of captaincy. The franchise will wait for the auction to see what resources they have. LSG are keen on going all out for Rishabh Pant if DC don't retain him, it is learnt.TOI had reported on October 23 that Pooran was going to be LSG's top retention followed by Mayank Yadav and Ravi Bishnoi. LSG are expected to spend around Rs 50 crore on the retentions.""There is a chance that Lucknow will spend Rs 40 crore on retaining overseas and capped players like Pooran, Mayank and Bishnoi. Uncapped players like Ayush Badoni and Mohsin Khan will be paid as per understanding with the players and the franchise,"" sources said.In the mini IPL auction last year, Mitchell Starc became the most expensive player when KKR paid Rs 24.75 crore. However, no player has been ever retained for an amount of Rs 20 crore.","Nicholas Pooran could become one of the highest paid retained players in the history of the IPL, TOI has learnt.

NEW DELHI: England cricket captain Ben Stokes claims that while he was away in Pakistan , masked robbers broke into his house and took valuables while his family was inside.Stokes said on Wednesday that the burglary occurred at his northeast England house in Castle Eden on October 17.His Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) medal, which was awarded on behalf of the nation, was one of the objects stolen.""By far the worst thing about this crime is that it was carried out whilst my wife and 2 young children were in the house. Thankfully, none of my family came to any physical harm,"" he wrote on X. ""Understandably, however, the experience has had an impact on their emotional and mental state. All we can think about is how much worse this situation could have been.""The thieves took jewelry and ""other valuables and a good deal of personal items. Many of those items have real sentimental value for me and my family. They are irreplaceable.""In an effort to assist the police in apprehending the burglars, Stokes claimed he made the news public.

I was desperate for India A call... dream is to play for the country: Baba Indrajith,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/baba-indrajith-exclusive-interview-tamil-nadu-india-a-squad-australia/articleshow/114775370.cms,"Baba Indrajith. (PTI Photo)

exclusive conversation with Timesofindia.com

Excerpts:

Baba Indrajith plays a shot during the Ranji Trophy match between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka at M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. Image: PTI

Twelve years back, you missed the U-19 World Cup bus and were naturally very dejected. Cut to 2024, you are very close to taking the next step, a very crucial step, in your career, and it's going to happen in Australia too. Was there desperation to get that call after years of consistency with the bat?

Did you approach this season any differently? Duleep Trophy squads were picked by national selectors and good outings would have made the right noise. Did you think about what the future had in store - the A tour... ?

And when it finally happened, did it feel overwhelming? Like you put your feet up and say, boss this has finally happened!

How have your preparations been like for the challenge Down Under?

Even after playing First Class cricket for so long, you don't have a lot of overseas exposure and there have been only few outings in Bangladesh some time back. How much are your picking from your brother Aparajith because he has been to Australia multiple times.

Two of your senior state-mates have been very vocal in their support for you. Both Dinesh Karthik and R Ashwin have been regularly highlighting your efforts in the domestic circuit on social media. How special is it to get their support, and how has it been spending a lot of time with Ashwin during the TNPL?

How's the mood in the house - parents, Aparajith...

You have had some freak injuries in the past but how frustrating was it to get injured during the Duleep Trophy fixture. You have batted with stitches, returned from multiple surgeries but this was very close to the Australia tour...

Some twelve years back, Baba Indrajith was at one of the lowest points of his cricketing career when he wasn't picked for India U-19 squad for the World Cup. He was dejected but very happy for his twin brother Baba Aparajith who made the cut and had a good outing Down Under with the side which won the title.With no U-19 launchpad, Indrajith had no option but to undergo the domestic grind for Tamil Nadu but little would he would have imagined that it would take more than a decade for the next step.Also See: Cricket Live Score Season-after-season, he kept piling on the runs for Tamil Nadu in the middle-order but could never go beyond the Zone side. Multiple A tours happened during this duration but Indrajith's name was constantly missing from the squad sheets.He did get frustrated at times, desperation creeped in to do things differently but one thing remained constant - the runs. After 80 First Class appearances, the sweet reward finally came his way when he was named in India A squad for the tour of Australia Yes, Australia. The same Australia where he wanted to go with India U-19 side as a teenager and 12 years later, he will be donning the shining whites and will take a crucial step towards realising his ultimate dream of playing for the country.In an, Tamil Nadu's run-machine talks about his long journey, the injury fears in Duleep Trophy, the ""different feeling"" in the household and the desperation to get the India A opportunity.Australia has been a special place in our family. Because Apar (Aparajith) travelled to Australia a lot of times and won the World Cup. I would have wanted to be at the U-19 World Cup as well but I never felt like that they should have picked me or something like that. I was very happy for Apar but never thought on these lines. Only when you told me, I was able to recollect all of that.And yes, I think you can say I was desperate. It's not wrong to say I was. I was actually desperate to get this opportunity because being in the domestic circuit for so long, and obviously that expectation of getting the break would be there. Very, very happy that everything happens for a reason and comes at the right time. So I'm happy that it's happened now.Was the opportunity coming up in my mind? Definitely, yeah. But I wanted to focus on the things I could do correctly because if I put too much pressure on myself then it would be very difficult. But at the same time, if I say that, okay, I didn't think about all of these tours or whatever that is coming up, I would be lying. So it was there in the back of the mind. And obviously, whenever I wrote it down and I said, like, if I get my eye in, or if I get set, then I will think of these tours or whatever it is coming up, and then I will push myself to score big. So that was there in my mind. But I wasn't putting too much pressure on myself saying that, okay, this is the thing. I know Duleep Trophy is very very important and I knew if I score runs, I would get an opportunity.You have been at it for more than a decade in the First Class circuit. You play Tamil Nadu Premier League, have been part of IPL teams and there has been continuous cricket. Did it get exhausting at some point? Did you ask questions like - what more is needed, what do I need to do to take that next step...Obviously, I mean, all of these thoughts came in. Because, as you said, the domestic scene is not very easy. It's a very hard toil for so long. So all of these hardships come to you, I mean, come to your mind. So whenever you get the opportunity, or whenever you get the break, that realisation will be even more, because you know how hard you work to get here. So. yeah, in a way, I feel it's a good thing, because when you get an opportunity like this, you know the value of it, yeah.I understand what you're saying, but I mean, like, it hasn't gone to that level. But obviously it was emotional. I will be very honest, it was emotional because, yeah, I've been waiting for this opportunity for a very long time. It was kind of emotional but at the same time, I told myself that, okay, this is just one step ahead because my dream is to play for the country. It is a little bit overwhelming, but not too much, because I don't want it to be too overwhelming. If that happens, then I will be satisfied just getting selected for India, which I don't want. I want to go there and do well. I know there will be a lot of hype. Obviously there will be a lot of expectations.I have done whatever preparation I could do in terms of skill, mentally, physically, whatever it is, because I know the value of this. So I will give everything. And obviously that dream to play for the country and do well for the country is there. So I don't want this to be too overwhelming, yeah, but at the same time, I'm leaving the result to the universe. So I will do everything... whatever I've been doing in the domestic circuit. I will try and do the same thing there.I will somehow get to the same pattern. Obviously, wherever you go, even if it is from Chennai to Delhi or from Chennai to Mumbai, conditions are going to be different, correct? So similarly, when you go to Australia, it's going to be even more different. And you will not crack the code or find the pattern, or even if you play the domestic circuit for so long.With whatever experience I have, I should go there and adapt quickly. So the adaptation is going to be very, very important, yeah. And if I adapt and things go well, God willing, then I would be very happy.I have been picking his (Aparajith) brain. And a lot of other people too because if I can get something out of everybody then I feel it's going to help me. And no better person than Apar because I'll be able to relate to him much better than anybody else. He has gone there thrice, not just once. So it's going to be very helpful.And outside of India, I have played just three games in Bangladesh and that too rain affected. So to be very honest, I have not had exposure outside of India. So as I said, even if it's outside of India, even if it's in the subcontinent or outside the continent, it is going to be different. You are going to take time to adapt, and when it's in Australia, obviously, conditions are going to be even more different. So I don't want to be overwhelmed or be worried about it.I've accepted the fact that it's going to be different. It is better to adapt. That's the one thing I could do from my side, apart from that kind of preparation because you're not going to play a domestic season there for a month or two or for a year and then get used to the conditions. Apart from that, I feel like I can do a lot of visualisation and preparation in terms of watching matches and everything. I've been doing that personally but want to get too much into the details but I've been preparing myself.I think their help has been great... immense. DK, I know him personally for a very long time and he's been supportive and also helpful in my game as well, in terms of preparation and everything, whatever it is, he doesn't hold back. I can call him anytime and then ask for his help, Even before the Duleep Trophy, he told me certain things as to how to practice and go about things, and Ashwin has been an immense help too.There is no need for Ashwin or Dinesh Karthik to put out a tweet or be supportive on social media for me, but they take that extra initiative and step because whenever someone does well, they make sure that it is seen outside. Because you know it's not easy. If they don't put it, nobody's going to ask them why. If they don't show their support, nobody is going to ask... but to take that initiative and be supportive has been very, very helpful.And one thing with Ashwin is that he doesn't make you feel like you're talking to someone who's taken over 500 Test wickets. He comes down to your level and talks. And it's not like he plays in the TNPL for the sake of it. He plays it with intensity and wants you to improve your game all the time. So all of these things, even if it's a different format, it definitely helps.And when you play Ashwin in the net(s) you will definitely get the confidence. So you feel like that if you can play a bowler who has picked 500 Test wickets, you will be able to manage other players. Sometimes you get overwhelmed with the players who you've seen on TV, and then directly go and play with them. Okay, these are like, big bowlers, big players. You feel like that. But when you are able to face the challenge and take the challenge of Ashwin, who has taken 500 Test wickets you will gain a lot of confidence.And if he gives a pat on the back, saying that, okay, you are doing well, then nothing more than that. That confidence is going to be very, very high. And obviously DK has a lot of experience in the IPL, is commentating all around the world, is coaching and everything. So they both have been very, very instrumental.It's a bit different because obviously it's a new challenge for Apar moving to another state and playing as a professional. It's a different challenge and it's different for us also because we are so used to playing for the same team. So it's a bit different. But in the household, I think they're very, very happy for me. Father, mother... because they have seen my struggles for all these years, and they're very, very happy for me, and obviously Apar is also very happy. But it's difficult for my parents also because 10 or 12 years back, the scenario was different. Now the scenario is different.So as parents, you want both your kids to do well. But sometimes it is different. It is different. Difficult for them to handle all of that. But the good thing is that between me and Apar there's always been a good rapport. We have always helped each other become better cricketers. So that has been okay, but overall, right now, everybody is happy for me, and they want me to go there, enjoy myself and do well.To be very honest with you, the minute I fell down, because I knew the Australia tour was coming, I didn't tell anybody, but I was aiming for it. But the minute I fell down, the first thought went to Australia, will I be missing it again? Missing the India opportunity again? So I troubled a lot of my strength and conditioning courses and physios asking, What is the grade? One, what if it's Grade 2? How long will it take? In 10 days, one week and all of that. And I did a lot of research.When you are scared or worried or anxious, you will do all of those things to make sure that you somehow get on the flight to Australia, because it happened on the third game. I thought, okay, I was going to play the Rest of India game, and I will get the opportunity because I got two good scores in Duleep Trophy. And that third game, I was batting on 35 so I thought I have a decent chance to go to Australia.But the minute I fell down all those things... like I was really, really upset. The physical pain was there but mentally I was gone. But I think with a lot of help from the strength and conditioning coaches I did everything possible. I did absolutely everything possible, right from my diet to my sleep time to everything to make sure that I got fit for the first Ranji Trophy game. Because only if I played Ranji, I will be cleared for fitness. So all of these things were running in my mind, and I think, as they say, everything happens for a reason, and I'm happy and thankful that I was able to be fit for the first time.","Baba Indrajith has been named in the India A squad for the tour of Australia.

NEW DELHI: Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola 's recent comments on the historic rivalry between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have sparked a fresh wave of discussion and debate in the world of football .Speaking at a pre-match press conference on Tuesday, the Spaniard opened up on a long-running rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo.""No one could beat Messi, only Cristiano. Cristiano was a monster and the father of that monster is Messi. The two have achieved something incredible in the last 20 years,"" said Guardiola.Guardiola's remarks came on the back of the 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony, where Manchester City's Rodri emerged as the winner, breaking the long-standing duopoly of Messi and Ronaldo.The Spanish midfielder's triumph was celebrated as a victory for Spanish football and a recognition of the often-overlooked role of midfielders in the game.Rodri's win marked a significant milestone, as he became the first defensive midfielder to claim the Ballon d'Or since Lothar Matthaus in 1990 and only the third Spaniard to receive the honour, following in the footsteps of Alfredo Di Stefano and Luis Suarez.His win is particularly noteworthy as it ends a long drought for Spanish players in the Ballon d'Or rankings, with no Spaniard having won the award since Luis Suarez in 1960, despite Spain's ""golden generation"" achieving significant success on the international stage.“Maybe Xavi and Iniesta deserved it at that time, so I think yesterday Rodri achieved what Spanish football deserved worldwide,” Guardiola further added.The 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony was massively dominated by Rodri's compatriots, national teammate Lamine Yamal winning the Kopa Trophy for the best Under-21 player, Aitana Bonmati securing the women's Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year, and Jennifer Hermoso being honoured with the Socrates Award for her role in the fight for women's rights in football and her courageous stance against sexism in sport.","Guardiola's comments come on the back of the 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony.

AHMEDABAD: Opener and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (100 off 122 balls; 10x4) answered questions about her form with a timely century as India chased down a 233- run target with six wickets to spare in the third and final ODI against New Zealand here on Tuesday.With meaningful contributions from captain Harmanpreet Kaur (59 not out; 63b; 6x4), No. 3 Yastika Bhatia (35; 49b; 4x4) and finishing touches from Jemimah Rodrigues (22; 18b; 4x4), the hosts chased down the target in 44.2 overs to take the series 2-1.India’s pursuit of 233 commenced with Shafali Verma striking two exquisite boundaries before she was caught down the leg side by Isabella Gaze off pacer Hannah Rowe. However, Mandhana and Bhatia batted in a composed manner, rotating the strike and hitting the odd bad ball for boundaries as India reached 40 for 1 in the first 10 overs.Mandhana’s first boundary came off the 27th delivery she faced while Bhatia got off the mark with a straight drive off Lea Tahuhu. Smriti lofted Eden Carson for a boundary over mid off before Yastika smashed the same bowler over extra cover for another four. Bhatia then hit Sophie Devine straight down the ground before spooning a catch back to the bowler off the next ball.Harmanpreet and Smriti's partnership started off slowly but eventually all the bowlers bore the brunt of their hitting prowess. Devine was struck for three boundaries while left-arm spinner Fran Jonas and pacer Rowe were smashed to all parts of the ground.Smriti was bowled just after she completed her hundred, off Rowe’s scrambled seam delivery. Jemimah's cameo, in which she struck four exquisite boundaries, was cut short by Jonas, who trapped her in front.Earlier, India had New Zealand in a spot of bother, first at 36 for 3 and then again at 88 for 5, but the White Ferns added 144 runs for the last five wickets to reach 232 in 49.5 overs.India 236 for 4 (Mandhana 100, Harmanpreet 59; Rowe 2 for 47) beat New Zealand 232 (Halliday 86, Deepti 3 for 39, Mishra 2 for 41) by 6 wickets.","Opener and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (100 off 122 balls; 10x4) answered questions about her form with a timely century.

Indian captain Rohit Sharma has seen a dramatic decline in his ICC Test batting ranking, dropping to his lowest position since December 2018 in the latest ICC update on Wednesday.This update brought notable changes across the rankings, with one of the most striking shifts being Sharma's nine-place drop from 15th to 24th, according to Wisden.This marks his lowest ranking in nearly six years. Previously, he had fallen to 44th after scoring 63 not out and 5 against Australia in Melbourne in December 2018.Sharma's form saw a significant boost following his twin centuries (176 and 127) against South Africa in October 2019, elevating him to 17th in the rankings. Since then, the lowest he had slipped was to 23rd in February 2021 after scores of 6 and 12 against England.From February 27, 2021, to February 21, 2023, Sharma consistently remained in the top ten, reaching a career-high rating of 813 and ranking as the fifth-best Test batter globally in September 2021.Currently, Sharma's rating has dropped to 649, his lowest since February 2021 when it stood at 626. His recent poor performances in home matches against Bangladesh and New Zealand have contributed to this decline. In the Bengaluru Test against New Zealand, he managed scores of only 2 and 52, followed by 0 and 8 in Pune, leading to India's first home Test series defeat in 12 years.Other Indian players also experienced ranking drops.

PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday said that South African Gary Kirsten ended his tenure as Pakistan white-ball head coach as he made ""some breaches"" of his contract with the Board. However, it was widely reported that Kirsten, who guided India to 2011 World Cup triumph, resigned following a rift with the Pakistan Cricket Board after the coaches were stripped of their powers in selection matters.Kirsten has so far not made any comments to give his side of the story.Naqvi said Kirsten had ended the contract with the Board and it was not the other way round.""He (Kirsten) broke his contract with the PCB and made some breaches. He ended the contract with us,"" Naqvi told the media Tuesday night during an informal discussion.He refused to make any more comments on the matter.Though the PCB had not given the reason for Kirsten's sudden resignation, sources have confirmed that it was because he was not involved when the Board announced the squads for the Australia and Zimbabwe tours and the new captain of the white ball format on Sunday.PCB sources, on their part, claimed that Kirsten had breached some clauses of his contract, notably by not spending enough time in Pakistan and insisting on having a full foreign coaching support staff.Naqvi said that the PCB had started the process of finding a new head coach of the white ball team and he had already spoken to some 4-5 candidates.""We will have a new white ball head coach by the end of this month because Jason Gillispie has only agreed to manage the team in Australia for the white ball matches on an interim basis. He is more focussed on his role as red ball head coach,"" Naqvi said.""The team will have a new white ball coach for the Zimbabwe tour.""Insiders say that Aaqib Javed , a senior selector who Naqvi wanted to take over as Kirsten's replacement, has said he is more interested in working on development of players and grooming of young talent at the National Cricket Academy.Naqvi also said that the selectors had the authority to decide on whether to pick Fakhar Zaman or not.Senior player Fakhar did not figure in the Pakistan squads for Australia and Zimbabwe tours as he is facing an inquiry from the PCB for tweeting in support of Babar Azam before the selectors dropped him for the England Tests.""The issue of the show cause notice will be handled by a special committee of the board while the selectors have authority over selection matters.""Naqvi insisted he never interfered in selection matters nor had ever pushed for the selection of any particular player.""I don't interfere in the selectors and coaches work.""","PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi says Gary Kirsten ended his tenure as Pakistan white- ball head coach as he made ""some breaches"" of his contract with the Board.

NEW DELHI: Since Virat Kohli stepped down as captain of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) after the 2021 Indian Premier League ( IPL ) season, the team has experienced a mixed bag of results under the leadership of Faf du Plessis While RCB have managed to qualify for the playoffs in two out of the three seasons, they have struggled to maintain consistency and have failed to secure their maiden IPL title.Under Faf du Plessis's captaincy, RCB finished fourth in the 2022 IPL season after qualifying for the Eliminator. They won the Eliminator against Lucknow Super Giants but were subsequently eliminated by Rajasthan Royals in Qualifier 2.In the 2023 season, RCB finished sixth with 14 points from 14 games, failing to make the playoffs.The 2024 season saw RCB once again finish fourth, securing a spot in the Eliminator. However, their campaign came to an end as they were knocked out by Rajasthan Royals in the Eliminator.While du Plessis brought tactical acumen and a fresh perspective to the side, complemented by his strong individual performances, RCB continued to grapple with familiar challenges.Over-reliance on key players and occasional inconsistency across matches remained persistent issues.Despite that, the South African holds a better win/loss ratio of 1.00 than Kohli's 0.94. Having managed 100 fewer games than the Indian, du Plessis, captaining 42 games for RCB, has a 50% winning rate, which also stands out in front of Kohli's 46.15.Kohli, despite not being the official captain, remained actively involved in a supporting role and was often seen in discussions with du Plessis during crucial moments.The shift from Kohli to du Plessis as captain was an attempt by the franchise to reshape its identity and break the title drought that has eluded them for years.However, the change in leadership has not yet translated into major success, as RCB continues their hunt for their first IPL trophy.With du Plessis's age (40) becoming a factor, reports suggest that Kohli is set to return as RCB captain from the 2025 IPL season .The franchise is banking on Kohli's experience, leadership qualities, and determination to finally break their title drought in the upcoming IPL campaign.",Virat Kohli stepped down as captain of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) after the 2021 IPL season.

East Bengal FC ended their winless run of the season in style, blowing away Bangladesh champions Bashundhara Kings 4-0 in their second Group A match of the inaugural AFC Challenge League in Thimphu on Tuesday.Oscar Bruzon’s side, with its back to the wall, finally came to the fore with a statement win, with Dimitri Diamantakos opening the floodgates in just 35 seconds — the club’s quickest goal in international football .Goals from Souvik Chakrabarti (20), Nandhakumar Sekar (26) and Anwar Ali (33) helped East Bengal kill the game as a contest in the first half itself. It was East Bengal’s first win since beating Downtown Heroes in the Durand Cup on August 7, during which period they have lost 8 matches in a row before sharing the spoils 2-2 with Bhutanese side Paro FC in the Challenge League opener.East Bengal got off to a rampaging start, and the way they stormed the Bashundhara area with so much magic and menace that the Bangladesh champions didn’t have an answer to it.Diamantakos started the rout, turning in Lalchungnunga’s low centre across the face of the goal with his left foot. Bruzon’s strategy of pressing the opponents high on the pitch and then finding an attacker with pinpoint and purposeful crosses often bypassing the middle third while Nandhakumar posing a constant threat with his pace and potency along the left flank — kept bearing fruit with almost every move in the first half.In the 20th minute, Naorem Mahesh blew Nandhakumar’s cutback over the bar, but when they came calling again barely a few seconds later, they found an unlikely scorer in Souvik. Bashundhara captain Topu Barman managed to deal with a Saul Crespo attempt, but the East Bengal No. 23 found the back of the net with his left-footed snap shot from the edge of the box.Six minutes later, it became 3-0.Nandhakumar, receiving the ball from Talal, entered the box with his trademark pacey run, took rival defender Raiman Kazi in his stride with a swift outside dodge and drilled the ball into the far corner past goalkeeper Anisur Rahman.There was no let-up in East Bengal’s attacking intensity and Anwar joined the party with a spectacular left-footed strike from near the D. Bashundhara did trouble East Bengal on a few occasions with goalkeeper Prabhsukhan effecting a couple of saves to deny Foysal Fahim while Jonathan Reis had his shot denied by the woodwork.East Bengal too could have swelled their tally had second-half substitutions Cleiton Silva and David Hmar been on target with their shots.East Bengal with 4 points are second in the group and will take on leaders Nejmeh FC of Lebanon, who have won both their matches. The top two finishers of each group from the East will progress to the quarterfinals.","East Bengal FC ended their winless run of the season in style, blowing away Bangladesh champions Bashundhara Kings 4-0 in their second Group A match of the inaugural AFC Challenge League in Thimphu. It was East Bengal’s first win since beating Downtown Heroes in the Durand Cup on August 7.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114755455,imgsize-44384,width-400,resizemode-4/114755455.jpg"

Kochi: Dorielton Nascimento proved to be Forca Kochi FC ’s star yet again as he netted the winner with a late strike to help his team edge Thrissur Magic FC in their final Super League Kerala match at Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium , Kochi, on Tuesday.The match outcome had no impact on the standings as Kochi secured their semifinal spot earlier.

Rahul missed the ball and it went to Thrissur defender Hendry Antonay. But his back pass was mistimed and fell to Nascimento.

It was also Nascimento’s fifth goal from eight matches.SLK final in KozhikodeThe tournament organisers have moved the SLK final from Kochi to EMS Corporation Stadium, Kozhikode, scheduled for November 10.

You need to get to a situation for luck to play a role: Arjun Kadhe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/you-need-to-get-to-a-situation-for-luck-to-play-a-role-arjun-kadhe/articleshow/114661630.cms,"Arjun Kadhe

PUNE: It was his grandparents who sowed the seeds for Arjun Kadhe ’s career as a professional tennis player.More than two decades ago, when Arjun was taking baby steps in tennis, his paternal grandfather decided to sell their house and set aside the proceeds exclusively to help his grandson follow a dream.“I remember when I was eight years old … at that point we were not financially so super to think about tennis as a viable option for my career. But my granddad had a vision. He told me, ‘Okay, I will do anything. You just play tennis, you want to represent India, you want to play a Grand Slam ’. My parents were living on rent. It was unbelievable,” an emotional Kadhe, 30, said as he jogged his memory back.All the sacrifices, of his and of those around him, and the years of tireless pursuit of excellence bore fruit last week when Arjun claimed his first ATP Tour doubles title , in partnership with Rithvik Choudary at the Almaty Open in Kazakhstan last week.“The credit goes first to my parents, they've made huge sacrifices, then my coaches. Obviously, it's a team effort,” he said.""Obviously, Balu sir (coach M Balachandran) traveling with us, (former South African player) Raven (Klaasen) traveling with us, the Double Dream of India programme is helping us a lot.“And as you said, the journey is long, but it feels really, really good, because you get rewarded. In doubles you're playing 35 weeks alone on the road, and it can be really brutal sometimes.“So this win, we both want to take it in, get confidence, enjoy and go ahead again.”The Indian combination beat three teams ranked in the top-30 on the ATP Tour, including No. 13 pair Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul of France in the second round.In a thriller of a final, Arjun and Rithvik saved five match points in the super tiebreak to beat Germany’s Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, ranked 26th, 3-6, 7-6 (3), 14-12. Remarkably, the Indians won only 68 points to their rivals’ 80 in the match.Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard to get there in the first place.“I think luck played a big part. But at the same time, we were just talking, the coaches were telling us we lost two finals in the super tiebreak, where we were the better team, in the Challengers. As (personal coach) Hemant (Bendrey) sir was also saying, luck is there, but you have to get yourself into that situation for luck to play it out,” Arjun said.The Punekar, supported by Punit Balan group , rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win.“I'm really grateful that it has happened, but at the same time, I feel I was playing a good level,” he said.“It's about, you know, being there, giving yourself that chance, getting rejected, at some point it will come.“It's not in your hands when that click comes. For some people, it comes early. If they can sustain it, they move to the next level.“Some people get rejected, and get that breakthrough. It's about working hard and trying to improve, and take the next step. Everyone has their own journey, in my opinion.“I feel we deserve it, because I truly believe we have the level. Now it's about going the long way and trying to improve every day and not be satisfied with this one tournament.”Arjun had partnered Rithvik in the latter half of last season but parted ways at the start of 2024. Even before they combined, the Telangana lad had mentioned to Arjun of his desire to play with his previous partner Niki Poonacha whenever he decided to focus on doubles. So, the Maharashtra player was understandably cautious when Rithvik reached out to him in the middle of this season.“I feel like every challenge brings opportunity. At that point (when Rithvik chose to go back to Niki at the start of 2024), I was like, ‘oh my God. we are doing well, blah, blah, blah, what is happening?’ But then, if I look back now, I won (two Challenger) titles (with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Anirudh Chandrasekar),” Arjun said.“So it was really good for me.”This time around, Arjun said, the two were in for the long haul. And long-term partnership is something he strongly believes in.“To develop a good team, you need time,” he said, “because if you keep switching partners, the first few weeks of understanding how we want to play, understanding how my partner wants us to play in the future, what is our best?“For all that to align it takes a little bit of time, and in doubles you have super tiebreak. Sometimes you are winning from (facing) match points, sometimes losing from match points.”The Almaty title had given a pleasant surprise for both Arjun and Rithvik in terms of ranking jump — the latter had broken into the top-100 for the first time in his career, reaching 85 in the ATP charts.That means they will now give it a shot to make the Australian Open cut before closing the season.“Now it's about planning it smartly, taking care of your body, because it's the end of the year, you don't want to overplay,” he said.“If we want to be top-50 in the world, we need to improve a lot. We won this tournament, but those teams are doing so many things better than us. So, it’s important also to play the big events, lose, and then realize this is where we are at.“So, we are not thinking too far ahead, just trying to think next week. How can we try and make Australia? If we don't make it, we still have to try and make French.“The plan will go forward from there.”","Arjun Kadhe claims his first ATP Tour doubles title with Rithvik Choudary at Almaty Open in Kazakhstan. The 30-year-old rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win. Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114661721,imgsize-157286,width-400,resizemode-4/114661721.jpg"
My fighting spirit helped me win my first ITF title: Tanisha Kashyap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/my-fighting-spirit-helped-me-win-my-first-itf-title-tanisha-kashyap/articleshow/114554193.cms,"Tanisha Kashyap in action during the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru last week. (Photo Credit: KSLTA/Deepthi Indukuri)

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured. I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week. It was her first pro title on the pro circuit. The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season. She was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114554211,imgsize-34268,width-400,resizemode-4/114554211.jpg"
