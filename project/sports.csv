HYDERABAD: Even before she was born, scans showed several 'bends' in Vijaya Deepika Gangapatnam's bones. Her father says the 13-year-old is like ""glass"" because of Brittle Bone Disease that has caused 45 fractures till now.Yet, her life seems to have more steel than glass as she turns the tables on fate to become a star para table tennis player: She was the youngest to win a medal at the UTT Para Table Tennis National Championship in Indore this March.In fact, the Secunderabad girl clinched silver in singles and bronze in doubles.The bespectacled home schooled girl was drawn to the sport after seeing elder brother Vijaytej (20) playing tennis and travelling for tournaments. But given her condition -unlike other teenagers her age, a fall for Vijaya doesn't mean just a bruised knee or a scraped elbow, but a fracture - her father Vijay Bhaskar Raju introduced Vijaya to TT at home.""She suffered fractures even during the delivery as doctors didn't know she was already suffering from the disease,"" Bhaskar, a defence accounts auditor, says as he recalls daughter Vijaya's pre-birth scan that showed feeble bones.Vijaya suffered most of her fractures while crawling as a toddler. ""Her body weight was on her hands. Now, she uses different wheelchairs at home and to play. While changing wheelchairs, she fell a few times and fractured her legs and hands. She slipped many times in the bath and broke her legs,"" Bhaskar adds.It was an ordeal for Vijaya to walk till she turned seven and her fractures led to hip and knee surgeries. These affected her movements, requiring her to take help for most day-to-day chores. ""We have to take care of her like glass,"" Bhaskar says.Unlike other teens, Vijaya can't go to school because of her multiple surgeries and risk of further injury. ""My parents and brother are very supportive. They teach me at home. I plan to write my Class X exams through open school this year or next,"" she says.Mother Aruna recalls that one of Vijaya's fractures occurred when she fell trying to reach an upper berth in a train. They were travelling to one of Vijaytej's tennis tournaments. ""We carry crepe bandages and painkillers all the time,"" Aruna says.While Vijaytej hit the courts, Vijaya took to table game. In Indore where she took the second spot, she lost only to Bhavina Patel, the silver medallist at the 2020 Paralympics . Vijaya now dreams of representing India and winning a medal at the Paralympics.Bhaskar outlined the challenges. ""Travelling is costly and we are looking for sponsors to achieve her dream,"" he says.","Vijaya Deepika Gangapatnam, 13, has Brittle Bone Disease that has caused 45 fractures.

With two runs needed off the last delivery, Bhuvneshwar Kumar trapped Rajasthan's Rovman Powell lbw as he missed a full toss.Kumar, who ended with figures of 41-3, had earlier dented Rajasthan's chase by dismissing key England batsman Jos Butler and skipper Sanju Samson for ducks in the opening over.Earlier, Sunrisers had an atypically slow and tentative beginning to their innings. However, Australian Travis Head and all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy accelerated the scoring rate with a 96-run stand off just 47 deliveries. The pair took a heavy toll on leg spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who conceded 62 runs in his four-over spell.After Head's pivotal innings of 57 off 44 balls came to an end, Nitish Kumar Reddy, who remained unbeaten on 76 off 42 balls, was then joined by South African power hitter Heinrich Klaasen, as they propelled Hyderabad past the 200-run mark for the fifth time in the tournament.-- First defeat in a run chase for RR this season.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Rajasthan Royals by one run in IPL match.

Sanju Samson 's consistency has always kept him in contention to represent India, but stiff competition for places in the Indian batting line-up and Rishbah Pant being the first-choice wicketkeeper meant that Samson was in and out of the national squad. However, he has been given another opportunity, this time alongside Pant, to wear the India jersey with a recall to the T20 World Cup squad.Samson is currently leading Rajasthan Royals in the ongoing Indian Premier League season, and it's his consistent performance in the league, both as a captain and as a batsman, that has earned him a recall ahead of KL Rahul.Speaking on Star Sports show 'Captains Speak', the 29-year-old Samson opened up on how he looks at his career graph and the change in approach he has adopted to enhance his chances of cementing a place in the Indian team.""When you are playing cricket in the world's best (cricket-playing) country, I think India is number one in the whole world (in terms of) the number of players who play and the number of talent we have and the competition we have, a guy from Kerala, if he has to come and cement his place in the national side, he has to do something special,"" Samson said.He made his international debut in a T20I against Zimbabwe in July 2015 but played his first ODI only six years later in 2021. In nine years since wearing the India jersey for the first, Samson has played only 16 ODIs and 25 T20Is. In 14 ODI innings he has scored 510 runs with a century and three fifties, while in 22 T20I innings he has accummulated 374 runs with one fifty at a strike rate of 133.09.However, Samson has re-invented his game lately, which shows in his current IPL numbers.Under Samson's captaincy, Rajasthan presently top the points table with a remarkable 8 wins in 9 matches. The skipper ranks 7th in the list of leading run-scorers of IPL 2024, accumulating 385 runs in 9 matches, including four half-centuries. He maintains an impressive strike rate of 161.08 and an average of 77.0.""I just always wanted to be special, always wanted to stand out the way I bat. I just wanted to create my own style of batting. No matter even if it's the first ball, I want to go out there and hit a six,"" said Samson.""So that's the shift in the mindset, which I had. I just wanted to do something different, like why do we have to wait for 10 balls to hit a six? So I just walk in and if I feel like, I do that the first ball. That was the motive behind development of my power stroke.""The T20 World Cup, slated from June 2 to 29, will be jointly hosted by the West Indies and the USA. India are set to kick off their campaign against Ireland on June 5 in New York.""I think I put in lots and lots of effort during the Covid time. A lot of people did help me.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Krishnamachari Srikkanth has launched a blistering critique against the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) for overlooking Chennai Super Kings' rising star Ruturaj Gaikwad in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2024 squad selection. Srikkanth's scathing remarks highlight concerns of favoritism and biased selection practices within the cricketing hierarchy.Expressing his dismay over Ruturaj Gaikwad's omission, Srikkanth denounced the decision as he questioned the inclusion of Shubman Gill , despite his subpar performances across formats.""There's no doubt that Ruturaj Gaikwad deserves a place. He scored more than 500 runs in 17 T20I innings. Also he scored a century against Australia,"" Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel.""Shubman Gill is totally out of form, but why is he selected in the team? Shubman Gill is the selectors' delight. He gets a chance even if he fails. He finds a place even if he fails in Test, ODIs and T20s. There's too much favoritism in selection. The team selection is all about favoritism,"" voiced Srikkanth, pointing out what he perceives as unjustifiable favoritism towards Gill.Srikkanth's criticism stems from Ruturaj Gaikwad's impressive display in the IPL 2024 too, where he has emerged as the highest run-scorer with over 500 runs in 10 innings. Despite his stellar form, Ruturaj found himself snubbed from the national squad, raising eyebrows among cricket enthusiasts and pundits alike.Furthermore, Srikkanth's condemnation extended to the exclusion of Rinku Singh from the T20 World Cup squad , which he branded as ""rubbish"" selection.

NEW DELHI: Bhuvneshwar Kumar shone with a sensational final over as Sunrisers Hyderabad stunned Rajasthan Royals by just one run in a last-ball thriller, keeping their IPL playoff hopes alive on Thursday.With two runs needed from the final delivery, Bhuvneshwar (3/41) trapped Rovman Powell (27) lbw with a full toss, leaving RR at 200 for seven while chasing a target of 202.After choosing to bat, Sunrisers Hyderabad posted 201 for three thanks to explosive fifties from Nitish Reddy (76 not out) and Travis Head (58), as well as Heinrich Klassen's unbeaten 42 off 19 balls.Things were looking up when Bhuvneshwar removed Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson for ducks in the opening over to leave RR at 1 for 2.However, youngsters Yashasvi Jaiswal (67) and Riyan Parag (77) came up with counterattacking fifties on way to a massive 134-run partnership to lay the foundation of the runchase.But once the duo was back in the hut, Shimron Hetmyar (13) hit a four and a six as it seemed like a regulation chase butT Natarajan got rid off Hetmyar, who perished at long-on and then skipper Pat Cummins removed Dhruv Jurel, who was caught at deep square leg in the 19th over.The sudden loss of wickets gave SRH hope of a turnaround but Powell produced a six in the last ball of the 19th over to bring the equation down to 13 off six balls.The West Indian kept a calm head to bring it down to 2 off the last ball but Bhuvneshwar denied him the glory.Following the win, SRH snapped their two-game losing streak and moved to the fourth spot with 12 points, same as Kolkata Knight Riders, Lucknow Super Giants, while RR stayed at the top with 16 points.Chasing the total, Jaiswal and Parag were dropped early in their innings and they capitalised on the reprieves to script a quick recovery.Parag broke the shackles in third over when he carted Bhuvneshwar for two fours and a six. Jaiswal then blasted Marco Jansen for two boundaries after Cummins spilled a straight forward catch.Parag, who was dropped on 24 by Abhishek Sharma, hammered Cummins for another maximum, before carting Jansen for two more fours.Cummins finally introduced spin into the attack but Jaiswal smashed Shahbaz Ahmed for a four to complete his fifty. Three balls later, Parag produced a reverse sweep four to reach his milestone in 32 balls.Jaiwal then played a T Natarajan delivery onto the stumps, while two overs later Parag was holed out at long-on.Earlier, Head forged a 96-run stand off 57 balls for the third wicket with Nitish, who also added another 70 off 32 balls with Klassen to take SRH across the 200-mark for the fifth time this season.Head, who was dropped by Parag in the first ball of the innings, hit six fours and three sixes, while Nitish smashed eight maximums and three fours during his brutal assault.Playing his 300th game, Yuzvendra Chahal, who has been picked for the T20 World Cup, was on the firing line as he conceded 62 in his quota of four overs.Avesh Khan (2/39) produced the first breakthrough, having Abhishek (12) caught at deep midwicket. Sandeep Sharma (1/31) then claimed a first-ball wicket, removing Anmolpreet Singh (5) as SRH scored 37 for 2 in the powerplay, their lowest this IPL.The spin duo of Chahal and R Ashwin (0/36), however, disappointed as the batters milked them for runs to set SRH on the road to recovery.Chahal had a horrible night as Head smashed him for two sixes and a four during an 18-run over after he came on to bowl immediately following the powerplay.The leg-spinner was then taken apart by Nitish, who plundered him for two sixes and two fours to accumulate 21 runs.Nitish, who also clobbered Ashwin and Avesh for two maximums, then sent Sandeep sailing over extra cover, while Head pulled Avesh for another six in the 15th over.The Australian, however, played the pacer onto his middle stump as SRH slipped to 131/3.New man Klassen then joined the party, sending Chahal into the orbit with back-to-back sixes.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders ' assistant coach Abhishek Nayar on Thursday shared insights into Shreyas Iyer 's journey, highlighting how the cricketer has embraced setbacks with a positive mindset.Despite facing significant disappointments, including injury setbacks leading into a crucial international season, Iyer has approached these challenges constructively and is gearing up to return stronger by engaging in domestic cricket.In the build-up to IPL 2024, Iyer encountered a back problem, raising concerns about his availability for KKR's matches. However, demonstrating resilience and determination, the skipper made a remarkable comeback. Throughout the tournament, he has showcased his prowess, amassing over 250 runs, which notably includes a half-century innings.Nayar's remarks shed light on Iyer's commendable attitude and commitment to overcoming obstacles. By focusing on his recovery and performance on the field, Iyer exemplifies the spirit of perseverance and dedication, traits that are essential for success in the competitive realm of professional cricket.The BCCI also dropped Iyer from the annual central contract list.""Mentally, to have a mindset like that after being rejected or not getting his due, he has taken it very positively. Even when he talks about it, he is not negative, he understands he needs to go back and do well,"" Nayar told the media during KKR's training session in Mumbai.""His mindset is to score runs, whether he plays the IPL, the Ranji Trophy or for India. He looks to score runs, it (disappointments) has affected him but the way he has handled it, kudos to him because I can imagine a lot of people reacting very differently than he has,"" he added.""Having known him for a really long time, without any bias, he is one of the strongest people mentally I have ever known, just in terms of how he has accepted certain things that have happened with him.""I would have seen a lot of people cribbing and talking about it, but I haven't heard him whine about it or complain about it at all. The way he has approached life is in a positive manner, what is in front of you, you try and accept it.""His fitness is in his control, and he is feeling a lot better now. He is great on the field, he is batting longer hours, he's trained really hard. Our strength and conditioning (coaches) and physios have worked hard with him,"" Nayar added.Under Iyer's leadership, Kolkata Knight Riders have demonstrated impressive performance, securing six victories out of nine games and currently occupying the second position on the table with 12 points. This strong standing puts them in a favorable position to qualify for the playoffs.However, despite their promising position, Nayar refrained from making any firm commitments regarding their playoff prospects.""I wish I could tell you that 16 (points) is good or 14 is good, but we never know. I think this competition is one of the toughest in the world. It's a two-month competition which is a long competition,” said Nayar.He drew parallels between IPL and Ranji Trophy, saying teams have to perform consistently throughout the tournament to achieve their goals.""I often think about it like a Ranji Trophy, wherein you have to constantly play well and it's not so much about how you play the first half but it's also as important to play the second,"" he said.""Just in terms of points, we have seen teams that have been at the bottom of the table do really well against table toppers. It's very hard to say this is going to be safe and this is enough. The more (points) the merrier (it is) for any team,"" Nayar added.Giving an update on batter Nitish Rana , Nayar said no timeline had been set for his return from a finger injury.""He is on his way back to recovery. We are hoping that he is fit soon. We don't have the timelines yet. But hopefully, he (has) started batting now. Still, getting match-fit is something he is working towards,"" Nayar said.Nayar said the motivation to beat Mumbai on their home turf, be it the IPL or Ranji Trophy, drives several rival sides.""...wanting to go out and beat Mumbai, whether it is Ranji Trophy or the IPL, everyone wants to beat Mumbai,"" he said.",Kolkata Knight Riders assistant coach Abhishek Nayar shares insights into skipper Shreyas Iyer's journey.

NEW DELHI: The United States and Mexico have withdrawn their joint bid to host the 2027 Women's World Cup , just weeks before FIFA is set to vote on the tournament's host at a meeting in Bangkok.The two countries' football federations announced in a joint statement that they will now focus on submitting a successful bid for the 2031 tournament.This unexpected decision comes as FIFA officials prepare to hold an open vote at the FIFA Congress in Bangkok on May 17 to determine the 2027 hosts.With the US-Mexico bid withdrawn, two contenders remain: a joint bid from Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and a solo bid from Brazil.The United States had been aiming to host the women's football flagship event for the third time, having successfully hosted the tournament on its own in 1999 and 2003.However, the withdrawal of the US-Mexico bid for 2027 comes amidst a crowded calendar of large-scale sporting events in North America. The region is already preparing to host the men's 2026 World Cup , the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in 2024, and this year's 16-team Copa America.According to US Soccer, postponing their bid until 2031 will provide tournament organizers with more time to plan and incorporate lessons learned from the region's hosting of the 2026 men's World Cup. ""Hosting a World Cup tournament is a huge undertaking -- and having additional time to prepare allows us to maximize its impact across the globe,"" said US Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone .""I'm proud of our commitment to provide equitable experiences for the players, fans and all our stakeholders. Shifting our bid will enable us to host a record-breaking Women's World Cup in 2031 that will help to grow and raise the level of the women's game both here at home as well as across the globe.""Mexico Football Federation chief Ivar Sisniega echoed Parlow Cone's sentiments, stating, ""After careful analysis, we feel that moving our bid back to 2031 will allow us to promote and build up to the most successful Women's World Cup ever.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football legend Ronaldo has reached an agreement to sell his majority stake in Cruzeiro , the club where he began his senior career, as announced by the Brazilian Serie A team on Monday.The 47-year-old, who acquired a 90% stake in the club for $70 million through his company Tara Sports Brasil in 2021, has agreed to sell the shares to BPW Sports company.The financial details of the transaction have not been disclosed.During his tenure, Ronaldo successfully cleared the club's $195 million debt and played a crucial role in their return to the top flight in 2022 after spending three seasons in Serie B. Despite this achievement, recent poor performances led to criticism and calls for his departure from some fans.In a statement, the club said, ""Ronaldo and BPW Sports signed an agreement to acquire all the shares of Tara Sports Brasil, the company that owns 90% of Cruzeiro SAF.""The statement also praised Ronaldo's administration for bringing a new perspective to the club, implementing professional management, and establishing a governance structure aligned with international best practices.

The former striker made his professional debut with Cruzeiro at the age of 16 in 1993 before going on to become one of the world's best strikers.At a news conference, Ronaldo expressed mixed feelings about the decision, stating, ""A mix of feelings hit me today, but above all, the feeling of fulfilment. It's impossible not to remember when I took on the great challenge of buying Cruzeiro.""He acknowledged the challenges faced during his tenure and expressed satisfaction in handing over the club in a better situation than when he took over.""We've faced many challenges, the majority of which we've overcome. We've stumbled along the way, but today I can say that I'm handing Cruzeiro over with a sense of having done my duty, given that the club's situation was very precarious,"" said the former striker.In addition to selling his stake in Cruzeiro, Ronaldo is also expected to sell his 51% stake in Spanish second-tier side Real Valladolid , as he told reporters, ""Valladolid is next.""","Brazilian football legend Ronaldo has reached an agreement to sell his majority stake in Cruzeiro.

NEW DELHI: Renowned Inter Miami star and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi took a break from his football duties to attend the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics on Monday night.Accompanied by his teammates Jordi Alba , Sergio Busquets , and Luis Suarez , who also played with him at Barcelona, Messi arrived at the arena just before tip-off.The group, with some wearing Heat attire and Busquets donning a Heat hoodie, entered through the players' parking garage and were escorted via a VIP entrance to their suite seats above the lower level.Although Messi had previously visited the arena for at least one other event, this marked his first arranged attendance at a Heat game since relocating to Miami last year.Inter Miami have been performing exceptionally well in the Major League Soccer (MLS) this season, boasting a 6-2-3 record and currently leading the Eastern Conference with the highest points tally in the league.Messi's contributions have been instrumental, with two goals and an assist in Inter Miami's recent 4-1 victory over New England on Saturday. He has achieved the remarkable feat of having multiple goal contributions in five consecutive matches, a first for any MLS player.Throughout his illustrious career, Messi has amassed over 800 goals for both club and country, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in soccer history.His crowning achievement came in 2022 when he led Argentina to the World Cup title, scoring twice in the final against France. The match ended in a thrilling 3-3 draw, with Argentina ultimately triumphing 4-2 on penalty kicks.","Lionel Messi attended the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics.

ISL: Mumbai see off Goa to set up final showdown with Bagan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mumbai-see-off-goa-to-set-up-final-showdown-with-bagan/articleshow/109703553.cms,"MUMBAI: Jorge Pereyra Diaz wanted to lap up every second of it. The Argentinian striker had just given Mumbai the lead in the second leg of their Indian Super League semifinal against FC Goa , putting the Islanders 4-2 ahead on aggregate, and he was in the mood to celebrate.Joining him were thousands of Mumbai City fans who made sure their delight was heard around the 7000-capacity Mumbai Football Arena.They had to wait until the 69th minute for that joyous moment, and it was to get even better seven minutes from the end of regulation time.This time it was Lallianzuala Chhangte who timed his run perfectly from inside his half to latch on to a sublime assist from Vikram Partap Singh, neatly take it past Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, and tap the ball into the net to make it 2-0. For the second time in five days, Goa were left crestfallen.They had been looking good to arrive here with a 2-0 lead from their first leg at Fatorda last Wednesday. But in a matter of six crazy minutes in the closing stages of that game, the Gaurs watched in agony as Chhangte and Vikram turned that lead into a 3-2 win in favour of the Islanders.Despite that slap in the face, Manolo Marquez's side, backed by around 250 travelling fans, would have come to Mumbai encouraged by their form on the road, having scored in their last nine away games. It's another matter that they were up against the league's meanest defence, and the latter eventually won.Mumbai's 2-0 victory on Monday and a 5-2 win on aggregate has earned them the right to take on Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Saturday's final. Petr Kratky's side will look at it as a chance to avenge their narrow defeat to the Kolkata giants a fortnight ago on the last day of the league stage which saw Bagan thwart Mumbai's hopes of becoming the first team to defend the League Winners Shield.For now though, the Islanders will cherish a win they had to work extremely hard for, against an opponent who has challenged them each time they have met this season.They may have endured a nightmare finish to the first leg of this semifinal but Goa managed to make a positive start here, looking clearly to their American winger Noah Sadaoui to launch attacks down the left channel.After his tremendous impact as a second half substitute in Fatorda, where he produced two sublime assists for the goals that contributed to Mumbai's jaw-dropping comeback, Jayesh Rane was duly rewarded with a starting spot on this occasion. But the midfielder struggled to get his teeth into the game for most of the first half.The home side soon settled and would come the closest to scoring in the opening 45 minutes when they struck the post twice, first through a Tiri header off a corner, and later when Chhangte wasn't able to curl his left-footed effort enough.In his pre-match press conference, Marquez had admitted that the Gaurs could well find themselves in a situation where they would have to take increased risks. That moment arrived in the second half when Mumbai captain Rahul Bheke saw his header off Yoel van Nieff's corner cleared off the goal line by Goa defender Nim Dorjee Tamang. But Pereyra Diaz was there, as he usually is, perfectly placed, to poke the ball home.Vikram has scored eight times for the Islanders in the league this season, including a hat-trick against NorthEast United in March, but the forward showed how well he can create opportunities too, releasing Chhangte with a delightful pass around Goa's defence, as Mumbai's number 7 got the home support going again with a fine finish.There are likely to be questions raised about the relevance of the ISL playoffs going forward, with the format now really holding no significance apart from the prize money on offer. What there can be little doubt about though, is the two best teams over the course of the 2023-24 campaign will clash for the trophy at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday!","Mumbai City beat FC Goa 4-2 on aggregate to reach Indian Super League final.

Premier League clubs take step towards spending cap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-clubs-take-step-towards-spending-cap/articleshow/109702643.cms,"(With Reuters inputs)

Premier League clubs have taken a significant stride towards introducing a spending cap, with a vote on Monday endorsing the completion of economic and legal assessments necessary for such a model.Reports from British media indicate that the proposed model will be presented to clubs ahead of a final vote at the league's Annual General Meeting, potentially in June.If approved, it would supplant the existing Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR) starting from the 2025-26 season.The introduction of a spending cap aims to curb excessive spending by clubs, thus mitigating the risk of super-rich teams monopolizing the league. Concerns over the widening gap between financially endowed clubs and their counterparts have underscored the necessity for such measures.Discussed at a Premier League shareholders' meeting, the proposed cap would be tied to the revenue of the lowest-earning club in the league, primarily derived from television rights.Implementation could be as early as the 2025-26 season, marking a proactive step by the league to promote financial fairness and competitive balance among its member clubs.""We will obviously wait to see further details of these specific proposals but we have always been clear that we would oppose any measure that would place a 'hard' cap on player wages,"" the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said.""There is an established process in place to ensure that proposals like this, which would directly impact our members, have to be properly consulted on,"" the statement added.Media reports indicate that 16 Premier League clubs have voted in favor of the league exploring the implementation of a salary cap. However, notable clubs such as Chelsea abstained from the vote, while Manchester City , Manchester United, and Aston Villa dissented.Manchester City's dissent is particularly noteworthy as the club faces over 100 charges of allegedly breaching the league's financial regulations. Despite the allegations, the club has maintained its innocence.The urgency for financial reform in the league has been highlighted by recent penalties imposed on clubs like Everton and Nottingham Forest for breaching the Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Everton faced a deduction of points, while Forest appealed a similar penalty.In April, Premier League clubs had initially agreed to introduce new financial regulations for the upcoming season, opting for squad cost ratio rules to replace the PSR. If adopted at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in June, the new rules could limit clubs to spending 85% of their revenue on transfers, wages, and agents' fees.Although the PSR will remain in place for the next season with a transition period in 2024-25, points deductions will continue to be a part of the league's disciplinary measures even under the new regulations.","Premier League clubs have taken a significant stride towards introducing a spending cap.
