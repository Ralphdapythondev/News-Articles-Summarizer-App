Experience and pedigree score over IPL form in India's T20 World Cup squad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/experience-and-pedigree-score-over-ipl-form-in-indias-t20-world-cup-squad/articleshow/110517782.cms,"ALSO SEE:

The IPL’s overbearing presence can often mask the T20 World Cup ’s unique imprint on the format. The IPL is at once allencompassing in its scope and specific in its requirements, so India’s selectors chose to be influenced only to an extent by performances in the league.The Ajit Agarkar-led committee has been both pragmatic and conservative while picking the 15-member World Cup squad.Naturally, this has somewhat dampened the excitement and anticipation around the younger crop of players who sizzled in this season’s IPL.Where’s Abhishek Sharma? Where’s Harshit Rana? Why Axar Patel over Varun Chakravarthy? Why have no Indian players from both IPL finalists been picked in the World Cup squad? And why does Rinku Singh, a proven finisher, find a place only among the reserves?It will be interesting to watch whether this safety-first selection approach pays off for Rohit Sharma’s team. It’s relatively easy to poke the weak spots in any IPL team but the T20 World Cup has been a fluid and unpredictable beast.Even the best teams have not enjoyed eras of World Cup domination, unlike in the 50-over format. The T20 World Cup format also makes it easy for the likes of India to reach the knockouts, so nothing less than a title win will be deemed satisfactory.When fates can hinge on a single hitor a no-ball, it’s human nature to bet on experience and pedigree. One can say the selectors have been guided as much by gut feel as data. In effect, this T20 World Cup is a farewell fling at an elusive ICC trophy for some senior cricketers who came so close to attaining that goal last year inthe 50-over format.It’s worth remembering that India have not won a T20 World Cup since the IPL first took off. There are hopes the trend can be broken this time, even with virtually the same crop of top-order players — barring Yashasvi Jaiswal — who faltered in the semifinal against England in Adelaide in 2022.The nagging feeling remains that in a short format, which lends itself readily to experimentation, shouldn’t this season’s IPL performances have counted for more? Should India have banked on in-form youngsters like they did back in the inaugural edition in 2007, when they won the tournament for the only time?It’s worth mentioning that T20 was in its infancy in 2007. The seniors had voluntarily opted out. Analysts still hadn’t run over every possible match-up in forensic detail. The T20 key now is the ability to reinforce experience with the ability to reinvent oneself, as Virat Kohli demonstrated in this IPL.The winning captain in 2007, MS Dhoni, was the first to red-flag the temptation to pick cricketers purely on immediate IPL form. During the 2009 Champions Trophy in South Africa, Dhoni had said such form must be put in “correct perspective”.Although Dhoni was talking about format-hopping selection choices back then, the ideology doesn’t seem to have changed 15 years on.“We decided on the core of the team long before the IPL,” captain Rohit Sharma said this time. “In IPL, performances change every day. Anyone will come and score a hundred or take five wickets. We knew 70%-80% of our squad (before the IPL).”So even though Kohli has remapped his T20 batting, taken on the spinners and lost none of his incredible consistency while striking at 154.69 in this IPL, Agarkar suggested his name had been pencilled in long before.“We haven’t even been discussing Kohli’s strike rate. You take positives from what is happening in the IPL (but) the pressure of a World Cup is different. You need experience,” Agarkar said.The pitches in the West Indies are different, slower. Unlike in the IPL, there won’t be just range-hitting at play in this World Cup. That doesn’t mean IPL performances haven’t mattered — just look at the impact Shivam Dube has had with his ability to clobber the spinners in the middle overs, answering India’s call for just such a requirement.Of course, pedigree is no guarantee of success. India’s squad is packed with proven performers but the same bunch has also tended to falter at the doorstep of an ICC trophy in the past.Also, India’s selections have been a bit random in the 28 T20Is they have played since the last T20 World Cup. That tournament was supposed to draw a line in the sand and mark a move on from the stalwarts. However, after trying out all and sundry — none of whom got a decent run — that transition process has now been abruptly halted.Having rejected any recency-bias in selection, Rohit and coach Dravid must now address some key issues: Should Kohli open, like he does in the IPL? Should the twin leg-spin attack be the norm on Caribbean pitches? Can Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja find form? Will the Dube ploy work? Will Jasprit Bumrah lack pace support? And how do they cover up for Rinku’s absence?India’s performance in this tournament will not only reveal if this conservative approach was justified, but also shape future selection policies. By the end of it all, we’ll know if recent form — specifically of the IPL kind — should matter more in a T20 World Cup.",The IPL’s overbearing presence can often mask the T20 World Cup ’s unique imprint on the format. Ajit Agarkar-led committee has been both pragmatic and conservative while picking the 15-member World Cup squad.

Over the past couple of seasons, Rinku has begun to truly showcase his potential, delivering match-winning performances for KKR and earning a call-up to the Indian national team .One of the finest finishers in the T20 format in India, Rinku remains part of India's T20 World Cup squad as a reserve player.His contributions, however, have not been matched by a lucrative salary, as he earns a relatively modest INR 55 lakh at KKR. In stark contrast, his teammate Mitchell Starc commands a whopping INR 24.75 crore.Speculation abounds that if Rinku were to enter the IPL auction pool, even a INR 10 crore bid might not suffice to secure his services.

I am very happy even with 55 lakh rupees. When I didn't have this, I realized the value of money.""Rinku emphasized that chasing money is not his priority.""If I tell you the truth today, then all this is an illusion.

Rayudu's Previous Remarks on Virat Kohli and RCB

Rayudu's Criticism of RCB Management:



NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Ambati Rayudu has once again courted controversy following his comments on Virat Kohli and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) after the IPL 2024 final.Despite Kohli's stellar performance, Rayudu pointed out that the consistency of the star batter might actually burden the team, even as he emerged as the highest run-scorer in the competition.During an analysis on Star Sports, Rayudu, along with Kevin Pietersen and Mayanti Langer, discussed the impact of having a player of Kohli's caliber on a team like RCB.""When you have a stalwart and a legend like Virat Kohli, who has set really high standards, it's very hard for the youngsters to be in a side like that and try and match his standard because he always wants the team to be performing at his level.""""No, it should be good for youngsters…""""But sometimes the burden of really trying to be Virat Kohli in a sport where you know nobody is going to be like him.""""But didn't Patidar step up to the plate?""""Patidar can only be a Patidar but not a Virat Kohli, and I think RCB, as a management, understands that you cannot have 11 Virat Kohli in the team. You need to have 1 Virat Kohli with 10 others being themselves, having their own identities and strengths and weaknesses. And you need to use them well in terms of resources. You can't expect somebody to win the game in the first season. You need to give him that leeway and time to grow into a match-winner. So I think the management has its task out, and even Virat Kohli needs to ease his standards a bit when it comes to youngsters, nurturing them, and letting them grow.""Earlier, in his congratulatory message to the Shreyas Iyer-led KKR, Rayudu subtly criticized RCB, emphasizing that individual accolades like the Orange Cap do not guarantee IPL titles, but rather it is the collective contributions from the entire team that lead to success.""Congratulations to the KKR team for really standing up for stalwarts like Narine, Russell, and Starc, and also contributing their share in the team's win. That’s how a team wins the IPL. We have seen this over the years. It's not the Orange Cap that wins you the IPL but it is the contributions like 300 runs each (from many players),"" Rayudu remarked.Kohli had an outstanding individual season, winning the Orange Cap with 741 runs in 15 innings, including one hundred and five fifties, at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of over 154. Despite his impressive performance, RCB once again fell short of the title.This isn't the first time Rayudu has criticized RCB. Following their exit from IPL 2024 after a loss to Rajasthan Royals in the Eliminator, Rayudu took to X to express his thoughts. He pointed out the shortcomings in RCB's management and leadership, suggesting that prioritizing individual milestones over team interests has hindered their success.""My heart truly goes out to all the RCB supporters who have passionately supported the team over the years. If only the management and the leaders had the team's interests ahead of individual milestones, RCB would have won multiple titles. Just remember how many fantastic players have been let go of. Force your management to bring players who will put team interests first. A great new chapter can start from the mega auction,"" Rayudu had written.Rayudu's remarks have sparked a significant debate in the cricketing community, highlighting the ongoing struggles of RCB to convert individual brilliance into team success.","Former India cricketer Ambati Rayudu has courted controversy following his comments on Virat Kohli and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) He pointed out that the consistency of the star batter might actually burden the team.

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has found itself inundated with an overwhelming response, receiving over 3,000 applications for the coveted position of the Indian men’s cricket team head coach. The surge in applications followed the BCCI 's decision to share a Google form on its website earlier this month, inviting interested candidates to apply for the top coaching role.However, amidst the flood of applications, the BCCI now faces the daunting task of sifting through numerous fake applicants who have purportedly used famous names, including cricketing legends Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni, along with prominent political figures such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah.Highlighting the challenge posed by the influx of fake applications, a BCCI official was quoted as saying by Indian Express, ""Last year too, the BCCI received such a response where imposters applied, and the story is similar this time. The reason the BCCI had to invite applications on Google forms is it’s easy to scrutinise the names of applicants in one sheet.""The deadline for submitting applications for the coaching position concluded on May 27, marking the end of a period marked by a flurry of activity and interest in the cricketing fraternity.Amidst the deluge of applications, it has been confirmed that Rahul Dravid , the current head coach, has opted not to reapply for the role, citing his desire to prioritize spending time with his family. Dravid's tenure is set to conclude with the culmination of the T20 World Cup 2024.While the BCCI has yet to disclose the names of genuine applicants, speculation abounds regarding potential candidates for the prestigious role. Notable former cricketers such as Gautam Gambhir , VVS Laxman , Justin Langer, Ricky Ponting, and Stephen Fleming are reportedly under consideration by the BCCI.The term of the new head coach will span three-and-a-half years, commencing from July 1st, 2024, until December 31st, 2027. Among the myriad responsibilities outlined by the BCCI in the job description for the role is a willingness to meet the work expectations and pressures associated with handling marquee athletes, underscoring the magnitude of the position and its demands.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has received over 3,000 applications for the coveted position of the Indian men’s cricket team head coach.

NEW DELHI: Australia's veteran support staff stepped up to fill in as they comfortably defeated Namibia in their opening T20 World Cup warm-up match in Trinidad. David Warner , putting his disappointing IPL season behind him, led the charge for the nine-man Australian team, helping them chase down Namibia's total of 9-119 with ease.Despite having four support staff members over the age of 40 acting as substitute fielders at one point, the Australians restricted the 14th-ranked men's T20I team to a modest total at Queen's Park Oval.Also see: India T20 World Cup squad: List of players, match date, time and venue Namibia had been struggling at 6-50, but managed to recover somewhat. However, Warner's unbeaten 54 off just 21 balls, which included three sixes and six boundaries, ensured a seven-wicket victory with 10 overs to spare, showing no signs of the hand injury he sustained during the IPL.The Australian team was short on players, with only nine of their World Cup squad having arrived in Port of Spain. The remaining six players -Pat Cummins , Travis Head , Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Starc, Glenn Maxwell , and Cameron Green - were given extra time at home following the conclusion of the IPL.As a result, selection chief George Bailey (41), fielding coach Andre Borovec (46), batting coach Brad Hodge (49), and head coach Andrew McDonald took to the field at various points during the match, all performing admirably.Captain Mitch Marsh, still recovering from a hamstring injury, only fielded for half of the Namibia innings and was run out due to a mix-up with Warner while opening the batting. Tim David (23 off 16) and Josh Inglis (5) also contributed to the chase.Josh Hazlewood, playing his first match in nearly three months, was impressive with figures of 4-3-2-5, while Adam Zampa (3-25) and Nathan Ellis also performed well. Namibia's Zane Green (38 off 30) took advantage of part-timer Tim David's bowling (0-39) to boost their total.Australia will play their second and final warm-up game against West Indies on Thursday at the same venue, with the possibility of Marcus Stoinis returning to the squad.Mitch Marsh (c), Ashton Agar, Pat Cummins, Tim David, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, David Warner, Adam ZampaJune 6: v Oman, Kensington Oval, Barbados, 10.30am AESTJune 9: v England, Kensington Oval, Barbados, 3am AESTJune 12: v Namibia, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua, 10.30am AESTJune 16: v Scotland, Daren Sammy Stadium, St Lucia, 10.30am AEST","Australia beat Namibia by seven wickets in their opening T20 World Cup warm-up match.

NEW DELHI: Former New Zealand captain Ross Taylor has showered praise on former India captain Virat Kohli , describing him as a ""global superstar in the world of sports,"" transcending cricket alone.Kohli, who boasts a massive fan following on social media, has garnered admiration not only for his cricketing prowess but also for his broader impact on sports culture.Speaking about the influence of social media on a cricketer's life, Taylor highlighted that players are now more accessible, which he views as a positive development in the modern era.Taylor, who has represented New Zealand in 112 Tests and 236 ODIs, shared his perspectives in Episode six of the podcast series ""180 Not Out.""""Players are putting outposts endorsing products and things like that. Who would have thought of that in 2008? Someone like Kohli, who is a superstar in the world of cricket, but is also a global superstar in the world of sports. In terms of Instagram and social media, he’s up there with Ronaldo and Messi!""""Yeah, I think you are more accessible, I don’t think sportsmen are just as critiqued. I think movie stars, Bollywood stars, politicians are all under the microscope now because of social media but I don’t think that is a bad thing,"" Taylor told Raman Raheja, a media professional, and creator who put together this Podcast “180 Not Out”.Former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee expressed mixed sentiments about the invention of the mobile camera in the context of social media. He remarked that while the mobile camera has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks, particularly in the realm of social media.Lee reflected on the evolution of social media from its early days to its present state, highlighting how it has transformed over the years.""In the early 2000s, when the phones came in, people would take a photo with you. There was an autograph and a photo. In mid-2015 and 2020, what happens now is that the players are always on show now. Anyone that is playing in the Indian Premier League, they are always on show, they go out for dinner, and someone comes with a phone camera,"" said Lee.""The phone camera was the best thing and the worst thing ever invented. The best thing is to capture beautiful memories with your family and friends, and as a spectator and lover of the sport, you also capture those moments. But also, the privacy now, for players, has been cut in half because you are on show everywhere.""If you are having dinner with your family, your loved ones, friends…someone takes a snap and it goes instantly all over the world. Now, you also have to be able to deal with that and accept that,"" he added.Former Australian cricketer Michael Bevan was also featured in the podcast series, offering his insights. The esteemed batsman underscored the potential impact of social media on the performance of young players.""The younger generation uses social media that would impact their situation and circumstance and career. They would have to make a decision on whether they want to read the comments, or how much they want to post,"" said Bevan.""I could imagine it would be extra difficult for some of the modern-day players, with T20 cricket, with social media…but as a player, you’ve always got to make the decision on how you handle. Do you want to read things or do you not want to read things? That’s the most important thing… to understand yourself, and to understand your game,"" he added.","Virat Kohli is a ""global superstar in the world of sports,"" says Ross Taylor.

Ronaldo and his team will face the unbeaten Al-Hilal in the King Cup final on Friday.Ronaldo joined Al Nassr in December 2022, signing a contract that reportedly earns him $75 million per year, making him the highest-paid footballer in history, according to ESPN.Prior to his move to Saudi Arabia, Ronaldo had two successful stints withManchester United , where he won three Premier League titles and a UEFA Champions League trophy.He also enjoyed a remarkable nine-year spell at Real Madrid, becoming the club's all-time leading goalscorer and winning two La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo concluded the Saudi Pro League season by establishing a new goal-scoring record on Monday. In Riyadh, Ronaldo found the back of the net twice as Al-Nassr secured a 4-2 victory over Al-Ittihad, bringing his league goal tally to 35, surpassing the previous record of 34 set by Abderrazak Hamdallah in 2019.In the closing moments of the first half, Ronaldo, who had already seen two goals disallowed for offside, brought down a long pass from Mohammed Al-Fatil with his chest and scored with a low shot from the left side of the area. With 21 minutes left to play, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner celebrated enthusiastically after heading in a corner from Marcelo Brozovic . Five minutes later, he was substituted off the field to a standing ovation from the home supporters.Ronaldo's season was filled with notable moments, including four hat tricks and one red card. He also faced a suspension in February for making an obscene gesture towards Al-Shabab fans who had been chanting the name of his long-time soccer rival, Lionel Messi.Al-Nassr secured a second-place finish in the league, trailing local rival Al-Hilal by 14 points. Al-Hilal clinched the championship more than two weeks ago and completed the 34-round league undefeated on Monday. Even without the services of Neymar, who joined the club in August from Paris Saint-Germain but suffered a season-ending ACL injury in October, Al-Hilal proved to be a formidable force.Aleksandar Mitrovic , signed from London club Fulham last summer, stepped up and concluded the season with a goal in the final seconds, sealing a 2-1 win over Al-Wehda. The Serbian striker finished with 27 league goals, second only to Ronaldo. Al-Hilal's title-winning campaign included a 34-game winning streak across all competitions, setting a new world record for a top-tier team.""This season has been truly exceptional for the team, arguably our best ever,"" coach Jorge Jesus said. ""The credit goes to the immense talent within the squad and the incredible sense of unity that transcends both on and off-field interactions.""Al-Ittihad's loss to Al-Nassr capped off a disappointing season for the defending champion. Karim Benzema, acquired from Real Madrid, struggled with injuries, and despite the presence of N'Golo Kante and Fabinho in midfield, signed from Chelsea and Liverpool respectively, the Jeddah-based team could only manage a fifth-place finish. Poor results led to the dismissal of coach Nuno Santo in November, who returned to the English Premier League a month later to take charge of Nottingham Forest.Al-Ahli, the fourth of the 'Big Four' clubs acquired by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund last June, secured a third-place finish, 17 points behind Al-Nassr. Al-Ahli defeated Al-Fayha 1-0, courtesy of a late goal from former Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino, his ninth of the season.Amid various storylines, Ronaldo dominated the headlines, and the 39-year-old still has one more opportunity to end the season with a trophy when Al-Nassr faces Al-Hilal in the King's Cup final on Friday.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice as Al-Nassr beats Al-Ittihad 4-2 in Saudi Pro League.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona concluded their season with a 2-1 win against Sevilla in LaLiga on Sunday, leaving departing coach Xavi Hernandez with mixed emotions following a campaign without any trophies and a second-place finish, 10 points behind champions Real Madrid .In Xavi's final match, after being dismissed on Friday, Barcelona faced the disappointment of a season that saw them lose the Spanish Super Cup final to Real Madrid and suffer elimination from the Champions League by Paris St Germain in the quarter-finals.""I don't think the work has been appreciated enough,"" said Xavi. ""A double last year (LaLiga and Super Cup) and this year we haven't been up to the task because of details.""I leave with some mixed feelings because the work is positive even though we didn't win the titles this season. I think we were on the right track and I still think so.""Barcelona started the match aggressively and took the lead in the 15th minute when Robert Lewandowski scored his 19th league goal of the season from close range, capitalizing on a cross from Joao Cancelo .Sevilla equalized through Youssef En-Nesyri 's goal in the 31st minute and threatened again but couldn't beat Marc-Andre ter Stegen before Fermin Lopez secured the winning goal for Barcelona on the hour mark.Ter Stegen reflected on the future, saying, ""Today is not the best time to talk about the future but we have a lot of good players. We have to work a lot more on an individual level to be able to compete with anyone next year. Xavi has always given us a lot. He worked every day so that we could succeed. On a personal level he's been a friend for many years and it's never easy to let him go.""","Barcelona end their season with a 2-1 win against Sevilla in LaLiga on Sunday.

I know how to play in different conditions,” Rybakina said of the heavy conditions. “For sure physically I'm much better than last year since I had to withdraw. The questions are quite the same, so I don't know what to say anymore.”Rybakina’s serve and sharp shot-making has helped her claim three titles in 2024, including Brisbane and Abu Dhabi, but it is her most recent triumph, at Stuttgart, that she takes into the clay court major. Rybakina beat world number one and three-times French Open winner Iga Swiatek in three sets in the semi-finals at Stuttgart to record a form result.The Moscow-born Kazakh, who has a clay court win-loss record of 8-1 this year, has split meetings (1-1) with Sabalenka this season.“The goal is for me to win titles. That's what I want. That's what I'm aiming for,” Rybakina said.","Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina are the second and fourth seeds in the Roland Garros women’s draw.

Need to clear my head and be ready for Olympics: Rafael Nadal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/need-to-clear-my-head-and-be-ready-for-olympics-rafael-nadal/articleshow/110506220.cms,"PARIS: The 2024 season was supposed to be Rafael Nadal ’s last in the sport. A curtain call. The tennis world had steeled itself.After a year spent in repairing and rehabbing a repelling body, the 37-year-old was ready to start in Australia in January. Until he wasn’t. More issues. Abdominal, then hip or the other way round. The Spaniard was in an impossible race to get his body ready for Roland Garros . In the end, he was short by a few tournament weeks.In the lead-up to this fortnight’s clay court major, Nadal’s body was falling in step, and in the last week, it allowed him the elasticity to stretch, to go beyond the boundaries of restraint. He was reaching further than he had in two years.It made the 22-time major winner think. Was it time yet, or did he have more steps in those legs? If anything, his straight sets loss to the in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev late on Monday, was a confirmation.Maverick Frenchman Gael Monfils wasted no time in seconding it. “With what Rafa showed us today,” Monfils said, “he would beat so many in the draw. So many.”For now the goal is the Olympics in July-August at Roland Garros, where he hopes to play singles and doubles.“I need to clear my head and be ready for my main goal which is now to play the Olympics,” he said.The legendary Spaniard was all over the court in the first-round outing here, earning huge approval from fans on Court Philippe Chatrier. Every time his muscular frame swiveled for a sizzling forehand the fans were in a tizzy.Nadal doesn’t want regrets.“At the end, it’s about not having the (competitive) feeling for one year and a half,” he said, “but that I didn't give myself a real chance, because when I started to become a little bit healthier, I stopped.”The press conference room at Roland Garros was straining with moist-eyed adults, who were trying to assemble words for questions to the 14-time champion.“In terms of what's driving me, I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I’m passionate about sport, I’m passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis,” he said. “I'm in a different moment of my personal life too, traveling with my son and wife. I’m enjoying these moments.”“So, if I keep enjoying doing what I’m doing and I feel competitive and healthy, I want to keep going for a while,” Nadal said. “I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while. I need to give myself a little bit longer to see if my level is (getting better) and my body is holding.”“That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,” he finished.In Spanish media circles there’s an understanding that if Nadal’s body holds up he may play next year. It can be a prayer, a hymn, playing on loop. Or as Nadal would say, it’s a true, no?",Rafael Nadal loses in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in first round of French Open. The Spaniard had been expected to retire at the end of the 2014 season. The 22-time major winner says he wants to keep going for a while.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110506208,imgsize-42628,width-400,resizemode-4/110506208.jpg"

The first cut will be very strong, probably in the region of 70,” he said, adding, “we’ll have to see what follows.”Nagal, who was disappointed with his Roland Garros main draw debut, said the goal was to be able to consistently push players ranked in the top-20.“He (Khachanov) was playing almost every point with a lot of intensity,” the 26-year-old said. “That’s something I can work on, where you give opponents very few free points, it’s happening quite a bit from my side.”“The goal is to keep improving,” Nagal said, “keep battling these top-20 players. If I can do that by the end of the year, I will be at the level I want to be competing in. The only way that can happen is to play these kind of players more and more.”","Sumit Nagal will attempt a final push at the Heilbronn ATP Challenger in Germany, starting June 3.
