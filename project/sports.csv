However, Kohli stood solid as a rock at the other end and played the anchor role to perfection.He first arrested India's slide with a 72-run stand with Axar Patel and then took India forward in the second half alongside Shivam Dube and others, taking India to a solid total.But former cricketer-turned-commentator Sanjay Manjrekar feels that Kohli's knock was too slow and could have put India in a tight corner.Reigniting the Kohli strike-rate debate that haunted the opener during the IPL, Manjrekar said Kohli's conservative approach didn't allow the likes of Hardik Pandya too much time in the middle.""By playing that innings, Hardik Pandya, one of their most devastating batters, had just two balls to face.

Fighters, heroes, champions, Rohit Sharma and his team gave India one of its most joyous cricketing moments on Saturday night.The T20 World Cup triumph was a team effort but overall, seven men stood taller than the rest.He was in woeful batting form in IPL & stripped of MI captaincy. But cometh the hour, cometh the man! As in ODI World Cup, Rohit again put the team before himself.He played with abandon and flow; his strike rate was a staggering 157 and he scored 257 runs, highest in the squad. More importantly, as commentators said, he exudedcraft and calm in captaincy executing dressing room plans to perfection. His ebullience at the top will be as missed as his captaincyHis 24 fours and 15 sixes were the highest in the team.In 1999, South Africa had dropped the World Cup. Thanks to Yadav, India didn’t. His once-in-a-generation catch in the deep was as memorable as Kapil Dev’s backward sprint and grab of Vivian Richards’. ‘SKY’ had the pressure of living up to his rank as world’s no. 1 T20 batter. His knocks against USA and England were vital to the team’s cause. And his destructive intervention served India well against Australia (31 off 16) and Afghanistan (53 off 28)He scored 60% of his runs in fours and sixes.He rewrote his life story at the World Cup. A foot injury had forced Pandya to quit 2023 ODI WC midway. His MI transfer and captaincy became a huge controversy; his IPL form the subject of cruel digs. But the 30-year-old all-rounder underlined why he is irreplaceable. He scored runs at an electrifying pace (strike rate: 151)this WC and mixed his pace to claim 11 wickets while breaking partnerships and providing vital breakthroughsHis 3/20 included the game changing wickets of Klaasen and Miller in the finalHis aggressive batting and sharp left-arm spin provided India’s most serendipitous moments in the championship. He knifed through England’s top and middle order (3/23), helped India regain momentum with the bat (47 off 31, 4 sixes) in the final and against Pakistan. He arrived as a utility player, left as a premium all-rounderHis breathtaking catch of Oz captain Mitchell Marsh swung the game India’s wayThe thrashing in the final aside, the joyful ‘chinaman’ with curly hair delighted India cricket lovers with his subtle guile and craft from Super 8 onwards. Was at his best breaking England’s back in the semisThe delivery that bowled England’s Harry Brook around the legs can be watched on a loopHe played eight games and was unplayable in each of them. Every batter handled him like expensive glass, with utmost care, and yet all were bamboozled by his video game-like craft. Bumrah is the world’s best paceman, and by a mile. Nobody has his deception, movement, variation, a lethal cocktail that earned him 15 wickets at 8.2 runs apiece for an astonishing economy rate of 4.2. He was The Man of this WC. His ER is the best ever in a T20 WC by a bowler to deliver at least 20 oversToo many. But most notably the wickets of Mohammad Rizwan (Pakistan), Phil Salt (England), Reeza Hendricks and Marco Jansen (SA). All bowled.The 25-year-old Chandigarh-born claimed the second pacer’s spot exploiting the sharp movement and bounce of USA’s uneven pitches and proved to be an admirable foil to Bumrah. His 17 wickets, which made him the tournament’s joint-highest wicket-taker with Afghanistan’s Fazalhaq Farooqi, is also the joint-highest of any T20 WC.Dismissals of the dangerous Tim David and Mathew Wade (Australia) in one over.Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja and Shivam Dube also had their moments. Pant’s 42 off 31 against Pakistan on a treacherous pitch was invaluable.Squad members Sanju Samson, Yuzvendra Chahal and Yashasvi Jaiswal didn’t get a game.got the best out of his wards, finishing his tenure on a high note.Before the final, his scores were: 1, 4, 0, 24, 37, 0, 9. Balance and focus are his forte. But Kohli, who scored runs by the bagful at IPL 2024, seemed to lose both at the WC. It turned out he had reserved his best for the final. His 76 off 59 balls against SA was more than his total in 7 earlier innings: 75. India will miss his class and reassuring presence in the game’s shortest versionKohli has 16 MoMs in T20I, a world record. Eight of them at WC, again highest for anyone.","The T20 World Cup triumph was a team effort but overall, seven men stood taller than the rest.

While acknowledging the legality of the dismissal, Root emphasized the importance of players being more vigilant on the field.The incident occurred during the second Test of the Ashes series, with England facing a daunting chase of 371 runs.Jonny Bairstow, known for his tenacity, was on 10 runs when the controversial moment took place.After evading a delivery, Bairstow inadvertently wandered out of his crease, believing the ball to be dead. However, Alex Carey , the Australian wicketkeeper, capitalized on the situation and swiftly stumped Bairstow before he could return to safety.The dismissal, which occurred on the fourth day, proved to be a turning point in the match. England, requiring 371 runs for victory, was bowled out for 327, resulting in Australia taking a 2-0 lead in the series. The nature of Bairstow's dismissal ignited a controversy that reverberated throughout the cricketing world.As the Australian team returned to the Long Room for lunch, members of the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) expressed their discontent with the incident.The cricketing community engaged in heated discussions about the 'Spirit of Cricket', with some arguing that Bairstow should have been cautioned before the stumping, while others maintained that the dismissal, although contentious, adhered to the laws of the game.In the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) Board's documentary, 'The Ashes 2023 Our Take', Joe Root openly discusses the event. ""Initially I was quite angry, but I think when you are involved in the game it is very difficult to put yourself in the other position. So I would like to say I would have dealt with it differently (than Australia), but I could very easily have done the same thing,"" IANS quoted Root as saying.Root's perspective is one of understanding and realism. ""Jonny will hate me saying this, but if you stay in your crease you can't get given out can you? At the end of the day it is within the laws of the game. You should be aware as a player,"" he added.Root praised the exceptional leadership of captain Ben Stokes , who guided the team through challenging circumstances. Despite the controversial dismissal at Lord's, Stokes' determination and tactical prowess helped England achieve a 2-2 series draw. The team secured decisive victories in the third and fifth Tests, while rain prevented a potential England win in the fourth Test at Manchester.Root also discussed the broader impact of the Lord's incident on the team's morale. ""It deserved more than for us to come out on the wrong end of that (Lord's) result. For England's captain to show us this is how we play our cricket regardless of the situation, regardless of what people might have said in the first innings, how we got dismissed, reckless, careless, no thought behind it. It was a really powerful moment for us as a team and the rest of the series as well,"" he concluded.Although Australia retained the coveted Ashes urn by drawing the series, they were unable to secure a series victory in England, a feat they haven't achieved since 2001.","England batsman Joe Root discusses controversial dismissal of Jonny Bairstow.

LONDON: If there was a question surrounding Novak Djokovic ’s right knee – which went under the knife in Paris less than a month ago – the seven-time champion’s sparkling performance under dull skies at Wimbledon was an adequate response.The 37-year-old, playing with a knee brace, was all over Centre Court -- sliding, stretching, reaching and charging - playing without a care in the world.The Serb's play sparked the missing sun in his near two-hours in the middle.Djokovic’s record-extending 371st Grand Slam match win 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 came at the expense of the 27-year- old Vit Kopriva, a qualifier, who was making his main draw debut at SW19.“Coming into Wimbledon this year was very different because of the knee, I didn’t know how everything was going to unfold, practice sessions are very different from actual match play,” Djokovic said as the sun finally made an appearance at this leafy London suburb, where light rain had interrupted the schedule on the outside courts.Djokovic, making his 19th consecutive Wimbledon appearance, said, “I tried to really focus on the game and not think about the knee too much. Everything I could’ve done, I have done over the last three weeks to be able to play here today. If it was any other tournament, I probably would not have risked it, would not have rushed it as much, but I just love Wimbledon.”Djokovic, who has had one other surgery in his career, on the elbow six years ago, sent out love to fellow athletes battling injuries.“I’ve been fortunate, comparing myself to other 37-year-olds. I had injuries like anybody else, but they come and go. It’s part of what you do. You just have to accept it and embrace it,” he said. “Andy Murray withdrawing is a great blow to the tournament. Great respect to him. All he’s done in this tournament… In this sport. I hope he’ll be able to finish his career on his terms. I heard he’s going to play doubles. Hopefully he’ll give it another shot next year in singles. I just send him my best… It’s worth acknowledging all these athletes that are struggling.”A combination of nerves and physical struggles coupled with an inspired performance from the world No.83 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, put out defending champion Marketa Vondrousova in the first round.Bouzas Maneiro, the 21-year-old from Spain, looking for a maiden tour-level win on grass, scored a 6-4, 6-2 win on Centre Court, which was also her first match win in a Grand Slam.The 25-year-old world No.6 seemed to be bothered by her right hip which she hurt after a nasty fall on court in Berlin last month, the Czech was clutching her leg in the second set.“Today I was a bit scared because of my leg,” an emotional Vondrousova said. “But I don't think that was the reason. I felt nervous from the start. She was playing a good match. That was kind of tough too. I feel like everybody just expects you to win maybe.
