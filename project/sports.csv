Virat Kohli: 'Open the innings or bat at No.3?': Debate intensifies over Virat Kohli's batting position for T20 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/open-the-innings-or-bat-at-no-3-debate-intensifies-over-virat-kohlis-batting-position-for-t20-world-cup/articleshow/110192548.cms,"NEW DELHI: The cricketing world is abuzz with speculation not only about Virat Kohli 's strike rate but also about his potential batting position for India in the upcoming T20 World Cup . The key question: Should Kohli open the innings or stick to his familiar No. 3 spot?While India's decision-makers, including captain Rohit Sharma , coach Rahul Dravid, and Kohli himself, may have already made their decision, the cricket community remains in suspense until Rohit addresses the matter in the pre-match press conference ahead of India’s fixture against Ireland.Several cricketing legends have weighed in on the debate. Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly had advocated for Kohli opening the batting. Supporting Ganguly's view, former Australian captain Tim Paine echoed similar sentiments on the 'Around the Wicket' podcast.""I certainly would [have Kohli open]. I think Virat Kohli has earned the right to bat wherever he wants, particularly when he's in this kind of form,"" said Paine. ""If I were part of the management, I would want my best player facing as many balls as possible.""""Virat is an experienced player, and I would want him at the top to face the maximum number of deliveries,"" Paine asserted. ""When a player of his caliber is in red-hot form, you want him to have the most impact on the game.""On the other side of the debate, former India cricketer Suresh Raina believes Kohli should continue at No. 3, a position where he has traditionally thrived.Aaron Finch , another former Australian captain, also supports Kohli batting at No. 3. Finch highlighted Kohli's impressive strike rate of 155 this IPL season, the highest of his career, and suggested that Kohli at No. 3 provides the stability needed for the team.""There was so much talk around it at the start of the tournament. Will he be in the World Cup squad? To be able to put that aside and go out there and do his job… striking at 155 is the highest he has struck throughout his career, so it's a great point,"" Finch noted. ""I would still keep him at 3. The stability he offers at No. 3 creates an environment for everybody else to play their natural game.""Finch also proposed that Yashasvi Jaiswal , with his aggressive style, should partner Rohit Sharma at the top.""You've got Jaiswal who can hit them out of the park. He can give them a flyer. I am just not sure whether Virat and Rohit at the top would create that dynamic approach that you need in the West Indies,"" Finch added.As the T20 World Cup approaches, the debate over Kohli's batting position remains a hot topic. Fans and experts alike await the final decision, hoping it will best serve India's ambitions on the global stage.",The cricketing world is abuzz with speculation about Virat Kohli's potential batting position for India in the upcoming T20 World Cup.

How do you see the current form of the T20 team?

Which teams, according to you, will be strong contenders at the T20 World Cup?

It is the second time that India is ranked No. 1 in all three formats (Tests, ODI and T20I). What is your role in this achievement?

How do you divide responsibilities between Roger Binny (BCCI president) and yourself?

How does BCCI spot talent? It has done some great work in bringing to the fore talents like Yashaswi Jaiswal.

I am sure you have heard the criticism of the impact player rule in the IPL this year.

How about the batting-friendly pitches in IPL? Even

Sunil Gavaskar

commented they are too one-sided.

Is there any other innovation you have introduced for the IPL?

What do you do with all the money BCCI gets?

Do you enjoy other sports too?

Who are your three favourite cricket icons of all time?

Which is your favourite IPL team?

Your favourite cricket stadium?

What is your management mantra?

Expressing optimism that the Indian men's cricket team will win the 2024 T20 World Cup after suffering a loss in the final of the ODI tournament last year, BCCI secretary Jay Shah said the squad has a good balance between form and experience.""The selectors can't choose on the basis of IPL performance alone, as overseas experience is also necessary,"" he said.In an exclusive interview, Jay Shah, secretary and key mover and shaker at BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) spoke to Harsh Vardhan Goenka, industrialist and cricket aficionado, at the board's headquarters at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.Shah said the biggest achievement of his tenure so far was holding the 2020 IPL in UAE in the midst of Covid-19. ""Olympics, EPL and French Open had already been postponed or cancelled... We demonstrated to the world what BCCI could achieve,"" he said.Asked about the criticism of IPL's impact player rule by several former and present cricketers, Shah replied, ""It's a test case. We are consulting players, franchisees and all concerned. I feel the matches are getting more interesting, more Indian players are getting a chance to play. If our consultations reveal dissatisfaction, we will change it.""On whether he thought IPL pitches have become too batting friendly, he said, ""I do not quite agree. If you look at the game between LSG and SRH, LSG scored 165/4 in 20 overs. On that pitch, SRH chased the target in around 9 overs without losing a wicket. Pitches are very good, created transparently and overseen by BCCI's central curator.""When I took over, my first decision was to strengthen the National Cricket Academy. We have invested more than Rs 250 crore to improve it and we hope to open the world class, new facility this July or August. My biggest achievement in my tenure was holding the 2020 IPL in UAE in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.The Olympics, English Premier League and French Open had already been postponed/cancelled. We created an isolation bubble within which we conducted the tournament. We demonstrated to the world what BCCI could achieve. We also changed the IPL broadcasting bidding process, separating the TV and digital feeds into separate bids netting us an extra Rs. 5,000 crore (out of a total Rs 48,390 crore). As BCCI's representative in ICC, I also helped boost our revenue due from ICC. As per the new revenue distribution model (2023-27), BCCI will be allocated a share of 38.5%. In the previous cycle, BCCI's revenue share stood at 22.4%.To me, one of your greatest achievements is your encouragement to women's cricket.When I decided to create WPL (Women's Premier League), I had a lot of convincing to do. One of the arguments I used was that 51% of IPL viewership was female. When we had the women's series against Australia in Navi Mumbai, we made the entrance free and we got a full house. I also insisted on pay parity because this would encourage women to come out and play. After my decision, I am glad to inform you that ICC also announced pay parity in prize money for the Women's World cup. We have also introduced a sports psychologist for the women's team and hired Amol Mazumdar as a dedicated coach for them.We did really well at the last ICC Men's World Cup 2023, but the final victory eluded us. I am optimistic that we will bring home the T20 World Cup trophy this year.It has a good balance between form and experience. The selectors cannot choose on the basis of IPL performance alone, as overseas experience is also necessary.India, Australia, New Zealand and the hosts, West Indies, because they are good in T20.As an administrator, I leave the cricketing decision to the experts. In BCCI, we have appointed VVS Laxman to look after NCA and Rahul Dravid as the Indian team coach. So, my job really is to choose the best and support them. I have full faith in them, and I know they are doing a fantastic job.Roger Binny is the cricketing brain. He is involved in each and every cricketing decision while I look after the administration and finance part. But finally, we do everything together. We have a very transparent and consultative process.Yes, talents like Yashaswi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh were test cases for BCCI. We empower state associations and give them guidelines to develop infrastructure, and we are searching for talent in all states. If they feel someone can do well for India, we recruit them to NCA. Right now, we have a pool of 50 players. So, if we need to play bilateral cricket with three different countries, we are in a position to do that. In NCA we train them to have all-round development, including helping them in personality development and wealth management.It's a test case. We are consulting players, franchisees and all concerned. I feel the matches are getting more interesting, more Indian players are getting a chance to play. If our consultations reveal dissatisfaction, we will change it.I don't quite agree. If you look at the game between LSG and SRH, LSG scored 165/4 in 20 overs. On that same pitch, SRH chased the target in around 9 overs without losing a wicket. Pitches are very good, created transparently and overseen by BCCI's central curator.This time we have introduced the 'smart' replay feature wherein the third umpire has access to all broadcast cameras operated by dedicated operators. The decision making for umpires and players' reviews have been much more time efficient due to this. This year we have also added a fast bowling insurance clause in the contract. So, if somebody gets injured, like Mayank Yadav, he will be compensated. We have a mega auction every third year. This will give an opportunity for players to get shuffled, providing different teams the opportunity to win the trophy. Another thing we have introduced is video graphing the entire process of bidding for new teams. It used to be a closed bid. Now all the bids are opened by the bidders themselves, providing complete transparency.A large proportion is pumped into state associations to improve their infrastructure and facilities. The major stream of revenues for BCCI is media rights and sponsorship of BCCI and IPL. In the case of IPL, the additional stream is franchise fee from IPL teams. From the revenues that BCCI generates, 70% is given to state associations for grassroots programmes, development of Infrastructure, conducting various tournaments across age groups, junior and senior levels to tap the talent across the length and breadth of the country. Then 26% of revenues are utilised for payment to players by way of retainership and match fees to men's international players, women's international players and domestic players. In case of IPL, the revenues are split 50:50 between BCCI and the 10 franchises, while 70% of franchise fee received by BCCI is also given to the associations.I love tennis and football. My favourite tennis player is Rafa Nadal who I believe is unbeatable on clay.Sunil Gavaskar of course, Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni. From the current crop it's Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya as well.As BCCI secretary, I need to remain neutral, but I'm proud of all IPL teams for their unique style and contribution to the league's success.Of course, the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad. It is the largest sports stadium in the world with great facilities. I took the responsibility and had the entire stadium built in two-and-a-half years.Put the right people to oversee the game and at the same time maintain transparency in financial matters. I am also inspired by Swami Vivekanand - 'Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is achieved'.","BCCI secretary Jay Shah spoke to Harsh Vardhan Goenka, industrialist and cricket aficionado, at the board's headquarters at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. Shah said the biggest achievement of his tenure so far was holding the 2020 IPL in UAE in the midst of Covid-19.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110192423,imgsize-24874,width-400,resizemode-4/110192423.jpg"

It's not going to be easy for both teams. RCB has the momentum, a solid momentum. And if they win with this momentum and qualify for the playoffs, it will be a big danger for the other three teams in the playoffs as there is no more dangerous side than the one in strong momentum,"" Pathan remarked.RCB's recent performance surge positions them as a formidable opponent, but Pathan also underscored the enduring pedigree of CSK, despite their current struggles.""CSK bring in the pedigree of being the team who knows how to win crucial moments. But they have lots of issues at the moment. Injury issues, new captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is no longer leading them,"" he noted.""You might have seen him occasionally setting the field, but he is not the captain. You might have remembered what happened when [Ravindra] Jadeja led the side and it didn't end well, the same can happen again. CSK fans will hope that they march ahead of these issues and win the crucial two points.""The match promises numerous intriguing subplots, not least of which is the potential end of an era for CSK with what could be Dhoni's last game.""It could be the last game for Mahendra Singh Dhoni, or it may not,"" Pathan suggested, adding to the drama surrounding the fixture.Pathan also pointed to the potential impact of RCB's bowling unit, particularly Mohammed Siraj.""We can see a different bowling attack from RCB, their weak point so far. [Mohammed] Siraj can come up with six yorkers in an over and win the match for RCB as he is gaining form in the last few games,"" Pathan observed.Concluding his analysis, Pathan expressed his hopes for standout performances from the two legendary figures: ""For me, two main things I want to see in the match are -- Virat Kohli scores runs and from the other end, Dhoni comes to bat a little higher [Mere liye toh Virat Kohli runs banaye aur MS Dhoni thoda upar aaye ballebaazi karne].""As RCB and CSK prepare to face off in what Pathan describes as a ""mouth-watering clash,"" fans eagerly await the outcome, knowing that the result will significantly shape the playoff landscape.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru take on Chennai Super Kings on Saturday.

inaugurated by

Usain Bolt

CHENNAI: Cricket is at a crossroads with a part of the T20 World Cup in June taking place in the USA ahead of the sport's re-entry into the Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.The world is waiting with bated breath to see how the public accepts cricket in the United States , which is a new market for the sport.For cricket in the US to be successful, the India-Pakistan game group league game on June 9 in the Nassau County Stadium, 35 kilometres east of Manhattan, must be a hit.And the ICC and United States Cricket have left no stone unturned to produce a stadium with a capacity of 34,000 in six months' time.The stadium, where eight matches will be played including three games featuring India, was inaugurated by legendary Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt on Wednesday.Ahead of the occasion, Chris Tetley, head of events, ICC, said that the ground meets international standards comfortably.""Whenever a new stadium comes up, there are a lot of questions about the size. But the Nassau County ground is not a token-sized ground - it is 75 yards east west and 67 yards north south from the centre. It is similar to the size of Wankhede . The drainage facilities, too, will be world-class,' Tetley said during an interaction.Not too long ago, it was just a municipality park and the ICC worked on war-footing to get the facility ready. Other than the four centre wickets, there are six practice pitches near the ground and drop-in pitches will be used for the tournament.The pitches have been prepared in Florida under the supervision of Damian Hough, head curator of Adelaide Oval, and have been brought to New York in trucks. Hough, who knows all about producing great wickets, says that it was a major challenge but they are happy with how things have shaped up.""The pitches will have pace and bounce and the ball should come on to the bat, something that the players prefer. The idea is to produce good pitches that will stay good throughout the tournament and the players will enjoy playing on,' Hough said.The galleries for the venue are makeshift. The temporary structure will be brought in from the Formula One track of Las Vegas and returned after the tournament is over.","Nassau County Stadium in New York will host the T20 World Cup in June.

However, despite their downward spiral towards the end of the league stage after a dream start to the season, Royals have booked a place in the Qualifiers.“Obviously, we are disappointed.It is never a great feeling when you are losing games in a row. Then your mind plays back to what if. What if we won against Sunriesrs? But you have to get some perspective too. Even with the four losses in a row, we are second (on the table), we have qualified. It just takes one better game to turn things around and I think we are the capable ones,” assessed the Kiwi.Heaping praises on their highest scorer of the game and the season, local boy Riyan Parag , Bond said, “Riyan has had an amazing season, hasn't he? His promotion to No. 4 really suited him. He’s had a number of years batting in a position that was pretty tough down the order and people forget how young he is. It just takes some time when you’re young. Obviously, I saw how well he played in the domestic tournaments this season, particularly in T20s.”“I’m proud of him the way he has played so far. I think the team is super excited for him. He’s borne the brunt of some criticism over the last few years in terms of performances and so to put that aside and come out the way he’s played this season, real credit to him for the work he’s put in,” added Bond.Meanwhile, the Impact player rule got Bond’s backing.“I like the rule, I like seeing sixes, I like seeing runs and I like seeing bowlers put under pressure. The beauty of the game of cricket is that you have to adjust and adapt. Even from last year the batters have done that, the scores have gone up. I love watching it and it still amazes me the quality of hitting in cricket. Bowlers haven’t caught up, they have to plan better, they have to think better and make better decisions,” Bond, himself a former pacer, said.Were playing for pride only, says Ellis: Punjab pacer Nathan Ellis , playing his first game of the season, said after the match, “Coming to the ground we didn’t really know what to do – bat or bowl. But we decided on batting first. Losing the toss wasn’t a desired outcome but I was actually happy that we bowled first, and it gave us the chance to set the tone for the day. I think the position that we are in we were playing for pride today (Wednesday).”",Rajasthan Royals lost to Punjab Kings by five wickets on Wednesday.

'This was a season to forget': Parthiv Patel on Sam Curran's performance in IPL 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/this-was-a-season-to-forget-parthiv-patel-on-sam-currans-performance-in-ipl-2024/articleshow/110187282.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Parthiv Patel 's assessment of Punjab Kings (PBKS) skipper Sam Curran 's performance in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 suggests that it was a season that Englishman would likely want to put behind him.Throughout the season, Curran's performance with the bat was below par, scoring 270 runs in 13 matches at a strike rate of 123.29. His inability to make significant contributions with the bat might have been a contributing factor to PBKS's mixed fortunes in the tournament.Similarly, with the ball, while Curran managed to pick up 16 wickets, his economy rate of 10.15 indicates that he struggled to contain the opposition's batting line-up effectively.This could have put additional pressure on PBKS during crucial phases of the game.Overall, Parthiv's assessment suggests that IPL 2024 was a challenging season for Curran, both in terms of his batting and bowling performances, and he would likely be looking to bounce back stronger in future seasons.Speaking at the JioCinema, Parthiv said Curran batted well against Rajasthan Royals (RR) on Wednesday. He further praised the English cricketer and said he helped the Punjab-based franchise win matches when they needed him the most.""This was a season to forget, but he batted well today. He played a great innings, took responsibility, and played 41 balls. He took his time at the start and whenever it seemed like he was getting stuck, he pulled out some big shots. He's experienced under pressure as an international cricketer, that is what we saw today. When Punjab needed him the most, he won them the match,"" Parthiv was quoted in a release from Jio Cinema as saying.Recapping the match, RR won the toss and chose to bat first. However, they encountered early setbacks, losing wickets at regular intervals. Despite this, valuable contributions from Riyan Parag , who scored 48 runs off 34 balls with six fours, and Ravichandran Ashwin, who added 28 runs off 19 balls, including two fours and a six, guided RR to a total of 144/9 in their allotted 20 overs.Punjab Kings (PBKS) showcased disciplined bowling, with skipper Sam Curran, Rahul Chahar, and Harshal Patel each claiming two wickets, conceding 24, 26, and 28 runs respectively.In the chase, PBKS found themselves struggling at 48/4 initially. However, a remarkable half-century from skipper Sam Curran, who remained unbeaten on 63 runs off 41 balls, comprising five fours and three sixes, steered the team to a crucial five-wicket victory with seven balls to spare.Avesh Khan emerged as the top bowler for RR, picking up two wickets for 26 runs.Despite RR's loss marking their fourth consecutive defeat, they maintain the second spot in the standings with eight wins and five losses, accumulating a total of 16 points. On the other hand, PBKS currently occupies the ninth spot with five wins and eight losses, totaling 10 points in the IPL 2024 season.","Punjab Kings (PBKS) skipper Sam Curran scored 63 runs against Rajasthan Royals.

NEW DELHI: After Rajasthan Royals (RR) suffered a five-wicket defeat against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024, Mike Hesson , the former Director of Cricket and Coach for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), didn't mince words in his assessment. He criticised RR's performance, suggesting they need to revisit the fundamentals of their game.In the ongoing IPL 2024 season, RR has been struggling, having lost four consecutive matches.Despite starting strong with eight wins out of thirteen matches, their recent form has raised concerns.With a total of 16 points, they currently occupy the second spot, but their recent string of losses has cast doubts on their ability to maintain their position.Hesson's comments likely reflect the frustration of watching a team with potential underperforming. Going back to basics often implies focusing on fundamental skills, strategies, and team dynamics, which might have been neglected amidst their recent struggles.RR may need to regroup, analyze their weaknesses, and make necessary adjustments to regain their winning momentum in the IPL.Speaking to Jio Cinema, Hesson said the same thing is happening for the Royals every year where they lose form at the end of the tournament.""It has happened every year. Every year when we are seven or eight games through, we are like, 'RR are the team to beat!' Every year for the last three years, they have got to that point and all of a sudden, they have gotten quite funky. They lose one, have a bit of a confidence drop, lose a couple, then they start to look over their shoulder and overthink things. I think that's the issue at the moment. They just need to go back to the basics and go back to everyone doing their job and standing up,"" Hesson was quoted in a release from Jio Cinema as saying.In the match, RR won the toss and opted to bat first. However, RR faced early setbacks, losing wickets at regular intervals. Despite this, contributions from Riyan Parag , who scored 48 runs off 34 balls, embellished with six fours, and Ravichandran Ashwin 's knock of 28 runs off 19 balls, including two fours and a six, propelled RR to a total of 144/9 in their allotted 20 overs.PBKS's bowling attack, led by skipper Sam Curran with figures of 2/24, supported by Rahul Chahar (2/26) and Harshal Patel (2/28), kept the RR batsmen in check and restricted their scoring opportunities.In the chase, PBKS found themselves struggling at 48/4 initially. However, a resilient half-century from skipper Sam Curran, who remained unbeaten on 63 runs off 41 balls, comprising five fours and three sixes, turned the tide in PBKS's favor. With contributions from Curran and other batsmen, PBKS secured a crucial five-wicket victory with seven balls to spare.Avesh Khan emerged as the top bowler for RR, returning figures of 2/26.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League (IPL) playoffs scenarios have taken an intriguing turn following the washout of the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Gujarat Titans (GT) match on Thursday. The unexpected outcome pushed SRH into the playoffs, while simultaneously eliminating the Delhi Capitals (DC) from contention.The spotlight now shifts to the Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) clash on Saturday, which has morphed into a high-stakes knockout game.The equation is simple yet daunting for the RCB: to secure a victory by a margin of 18 runs or chase down a target (assuming a first innings score of 200) within 18.1 overs. This scenario sets the stage for an electrifying contest, with both teams desperate to extend their campaign.Meanwhile, the Rajasthan Royals (RR) have their destiny in their own hands. A win against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will not only seal their playoff berth but also ensure a second-place finish, granting them two shots at reaching the final. However, the plot thickens as SRH could leapfrog RR for the second spot, provided they defeat the Punjab Kings (PBKS) and RR succumbs to KKR in their respective fixtures.Despite accumulating 12 points and having a game in hand, the Lucknow Super Giants are facing an uphill battle in their bid to qualify for the playoffs. Their faint hopes are hindered by their poor Net Run Rate (NRR), which currently stands at -0.787.Adding another layer of intrigue, CSK have a pathway to climb to the second position, albeit requiring a concoction of results to go their way. A triumph over RCB, coupled with defeats for RR and SRH in their final games, would propel the Super Kings into a favorable playoff position.As the league phase nears its conclusion, the IPL playoff scenarios have never been more entangled.With teams vying for the coveted spots and the unpredictable nature of cricket, the final outcomes remain anyone's guess.

'Really hope he gets the send-off he deserves at Lord's': Former England skipper Andrew Strauss on James Anderson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/really-hope-he-gets-the-send-off-he-deserves-at-lords-former-england-skipper-andrew-strauss-on-james-anderson/articleshow/110186290.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Andrew Strauss , former England captain and batsman, has praised his former teammate and pace stalwart James Anderson as ""one of the great bowlers of all time."" However, Strauss also emphasised the importance of planning for the future of England's bowling attack beyond Anderson's retirement.Anderson, England's leading pace bowler, is poised to retire from international cricket following an illustrious 22-year career.The 41-year-old, renowned for his exceptional fitness and pace despite his age, took to Instagram last week to announce that the upcoming Test match against West Indies on July 10 will be his final appearance in international cricket.Speaking about Anderson's retirement, Strauss was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.""I really hope he gets the send-off he deserves at Lord's. People have been talking about this moment for years - in a way, we got lured into thinking it was never going to come. It has been an extraordinary career with extraordinary resilience and will to keep going. Playing sports at the highest level is not an easy thing, and bowling is even harder. He is one of the great bowlers of all time,"" said Strauss.Anderson played a crucial role in the England team's ascent to the number one position in the ICC Test Rankings during the early 2010s under the leadership of Strauss.Notably, Anderson was the leading wicket-taker in the 2010-11 Ashes series , which marked England's most recent victory in Australia. Additionally, he showcased his prowess by taking 21 wickets in four Tests against India the following summer, further solidifying his status as one of England's premier fast bowlers of all time.Recalling Anderson's fine run, Strauss said that he was ""utterly dependable"". He also lauded the bowler for rarely getting injured and expressed wonder how he himself made his debut after Anderson and retired before him too.""He was one of those bowlers that you knew what you were going to get, every time. He had a great competitive fire and instinct, and extraordinary skill. Any captain would love to have him in their team. The other thing is that he kept fit: he never - or at least, very rarely - got injured. It's quite depressing to think that he made his England debut before I did. I have been retired for 12 years now,"" he added.Strauss said that England has some certain number of fixtures, around 18 till the next Ashes series in Australia in 2025-26 and Anderson himself would admit that it would be a stretch if he plays the next Ashes series. He also said that it would be hard to replace Anderson and his partner-in-pace, Broad, who retired last year.""It is the right time to get some games into some new players and obviously a huge hole to fill. If you think about [Stuart] Broad going last summer and now Anderson, it is very hard to replace them overnight,"" said Strauss.""They were both utterly dependable and were senior bowlers, so you need to invest time and effort, and other people need to step up and take those leadership roles. So I think it is the right time. Often, you do not fully appreciate what you have lost until it is gone - but there has to be life after James Anderson,"" he concluded.","James Anderson is set to retire from international cricket after 22-year career.

NEW DELHI: Former Australian all-rounder Shane Watson criticized Rajasthan Royals for their lack of fight during their loss to Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League game. He emphasized that this is not the time for the franchise to be ""flat"" but rather to focus on delivering strong performances and building confidence ahead of the playoffs.Despite securing a playoff spot, RR faced a further decline in momentum with a defeat against PBKS in Guwahati on Wednesday.PBKS' excellent bowling performance and a resilient half-century by skipper Sam Curran led to a five-wicket loss for RR.This defeat marks RR's fourth consecutive loss, leaving them in second place with eight wins and five losses, totaling 16 points. Meanwhile, PBKS is currently in ninth place with five wins, eight losses, and 10 points.Speaking to JioCinema after the game, Watson expressed surprise at how RR began the season strongly, peaking early and maintaining a solid performance through the middle of the tournament without any apparent weaknesses in the team. However, he noted that the team has since lost momentum, as evidenced by their lack of fight against Punjab.""I have been very surprised with how the Rajasthan Royals have taken off. They were flying high with no weaknesses in their team. They were able to just mix and match when they really needed to. They have certainly lost momentum and tonight, it seemed no one was up for the fight. Sanju Samson is the captain, he is willing everyone to be up for the fight. Avesh Khan, Riyan Parag did a job, but outside of them, everyone looked flat. This is not the time to be flat. They need to get a few good performances under them and build their confidence to hit the playoffs flying. They are going in the other direction. For the Rajasthan Royals fans and players, that's not what they want,"" he said.Notably, Watson himself played for Rajasthan Royals from 2008-15 and was a part of the title-winning team in the inaugural season back in 2008. In 78 matches for RR, he scored 2,372 runs at an average of 36.49 with a strike rate of 141.27, with two centuries and 14 fifties. His best score was 104*. He also took 61 wickets for the team.Coming to the match, Rajasthan won the toss and elected to bat first. RR lost their wickets regularly. Knocks from Riyan Parag (48) and Ravichandran Ashwin (28) took RR to 144/9 in their 20 overs.Skipper Sam Curran (2/24), Rahul Chahar (2/26) and Harshal Patel (2/28) were among the top bowlers for PBKS.In the run-chase, PBKS was 48/4 at one point, but half-century from skipper Sam Curran (63*) helped the team secure a five-wicket win with seven balls left. Avesh Khan (2/26) was the top bowler for RR.","Former Australian all-rounder Shane Watson criticized Rajasthan Royals for their lack of fight during their loss to Punjab Kings.

'They have to figure out the middle order': Varun Aaron after RR's fourth consecutive loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/they-have-to-figure-out-the-middle-order-varun-aaron-after-rrs-fourth-consecutive-loss/articleshow/110185932.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Varun Aaron , former right-arm seamer, offered some advice to the Rajasthan Royals (RR) following their recent struggles in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024.After RR suffered their fourth consecutive loss against the Punjab Kings at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati, Aaron highlighted the need for the Royals to address their middle-order issues, especially during crucial stages of the game.Despite already securing a spot in the playoffs, RR's momentum has taken a hit with their recent string of losses. In their IPL 2024 fixture against PBKS, RR faced a defeat despite a commendable bowling performance, with PBKS skipper Sam Curran's fighting half-century leading them to a five-wicket victory.Currently, RR hold the second position with eight wins and five losses, totaling 16 points. Meanwhile, PBKS sit in the ninth spot with five wins, eight losses, and 10 points.Aaron's advice suggests that RR need to rectify their middle-order batting issues to regain their winning form as they head into the crucial playoff stages of the tournament.""I thought it is a blip and they would pick it up but now it is a worry. They should be worried, they have to figure out the middle order. In the pressure games, the middle order has to come to the fore and deliver. So they have to be worried especially of the middle order,"" Varun Aaron said on ESPNcricinfo TimeOut.In addition to the challenging playing surface, the Rajasthan Royals' sub-par total can be attributed to their struggling middle and lower-middle order. Since the beginning of May, RR's batsmen occupying positions 5 to 8 have averaged just 12.46 with the bat, which is the lowest among all teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL).The team has experimented with seven different players in these crucial positions, second only to the Chennai Super Kings, who have used eight players.Unfortunately, the absence of a settled combination in the middle and lower-middle order, exacerbated by Shimron Hetmyer 's injury and varied team tactics, has resulted in inconsistent performances for RR.These statistics underscore the importance of stability and reliability in the middle and lower order, and RR will need to address this issue promptly to regain their form and momentum as they progress further in the tournament.","Varun Aaron says Rajasthan Royals (RR) need to address their middle-order issues. RR have lost their last four matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. Since the beginning of May, RR's batsmen occupying positions 5 to 8 have averaged just 12.46 with the bat, which is the lowest among all teams.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110185913,imgsize-44222,width-400,resizemode-4/110185913.jpg"
"Sunil Chhetri gave his heart, soul & everything for India, says Renedy Singh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/sunil-chhetri-gave-his-heart-soul-everything-for-india-says-renedy-singh/articleshow/110187344.cms,"GUWAHATI: Sunil Chhetri might have announced his retirement as a player on Thursday, but his former teammates – seniors and juniors alike – want him to stay connected with the Blue Tigers in some capacity for the wealth of knowledge that the long-standing India captain has accumulated over the years.Speaking to TOI from Gangtok, Chhetri’s former India teammate, Renedy Singh , said, “Chhetri has been a great asset for Indian football for long.His dedication, discipline, hard work, energy level, everything is tremendous. Indian football has got bigger shoes to fill with his announcement today.“He gave his heart and soul and everything for India. I hope more youngsters come up like him in near future.”Reminiscing his first meeting with Chhetri, he said, “I remember the first time when I met him at Mohun Bagan . I was joining back from a long national camp, saw a young guy from Delhi. I remember he was not super talented back then, it took time for him to grow and because of his hard work he is here now.”“I believe the JCT stint (2005-2008) and his India debut under Sukhi sir ( Sukhwinder Singh ) helped him a lot to become the player he’s now,” Renedy added.“It gives me immense pleasure to look back on our journey together. Apart from national team, we have played together across clubs like JCT, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. Even now we are together at Bengaluru and I think he has another year there,” said an emotional BFC assistant coach.Asked about his message to Chhetri, the former India captain said, “I want him to enjoy his last game, last 90 minutes in national colours. And I will be there in Kolkata to watch him live one last time for India, don’t want to miss out on that opportunity.“And I hope with all the experience he has about Indian football, he should stay connected with it some way. Now enjoy the break with family, brother.”For younger teammate Jeje Lalpekhlua, who retired last year after losing his own battle with recurring knee injury, Chhetri meant Indian football.“For me, as a youngster joining national side, Sunil bhai meant Indian football back then.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic expressed concern over his unexpected third-round loss to Alejandro Tabilo at the Rome Open on Sunday, just two days after being struck on the head by a bottle, which he claimed caused nausea and dizziness.Tabilo, ranked 32nd in the world, secured his first victory against a top-10 player with a 6-2, 6-3 win, ending Djokovic's quest for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title in just over an hour.The 24-time Grand Slam champion suggested that his lacklustre performance on a court where he has won six titles might have been a result of the blow he suffered while interacting with fans on Friday night.Despite initially making light of the incident by wearing a cycling crash helmet to training on Saturday morning, Djokovic admitted to feeling different during the match. ""I don't know, to be honest. I have to check that. Training was different. I was going for kind of easy training yesterday. I didn't feel anything, but I also didn't feel the same. Today under high stress, it was quite bad -- not in terms of pain, but in terms of this balance. Just no coordination. Completely different player from what it was two nights ago,"" Djokovic stated after the match.With the French Open approaching, where Djokovic is the defending champion, he expressed concern not only about the after-effects of the bottle incident but also his current form. The last time he arrived at Roland Garros without a title that season was in 2018, when his first honor of the campaign came at Wimbledon. Djokovic acknowledged that ""everything needs to be better in order for me to have at least a chance to win"" a 25th Grand Slam.In other matches, third seed Alexander Zverev defeated home hope Luciano Darderi 7-6 (7/3), 6-2, while Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka set up a clash with Elina Svitolina in the women's last 16.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic expressed his dismay at his unexpected third-round exit from the Rome Open , describing it as ""concerning."" The defeat came just two days after he was struck on the head by a bottle, an incident that left him experiencing symptoms of nausea and dizziness.Djokovic's bid for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title came to an abrupt end at the hands of Alejandro Tabilo , a Chilean player ranked 32nd in the world.Tabilo's victory marked his first win over a top-10 opponent, as he defeated Djokovic convincingly with a scoreline of 6-2, 6-3.The 24-time Grand Slam champion attributed his subdued performance to the blow he sustained while greeting fans after his second-round win.Despite initially downplaying the incident and even wearing a cycling crash helmet to training the following morning, Djokovic acknowledged that the effects of the injury may have contributed to his underwhelming performance on the court.The unexpected loss in Rome serves as a setback for Djokovic, particularly as he had enjoyed success at the tournament in the past, having won six titles there.The incident highlights the physical toll that even seemingly minor injuries can have on professional athletes, underscoring the importance of health and safety in sports.""I don't know, to be honest. I have to check that. Training was different. I was going for kind of easy training yesterday. I didn't feel anything, but I also didn't feel the same,"" Djokovic told reporters.""Today under high stress, it was quite bad -- not in terms of pain, but in terms of this balance. Just no coordination. Completely different player from what it was two nights ago.""Djokovic also said that he would have scans to ""see what's going on"" before the French Open in Paris, where he will head not just worried by the after-effects of the bottle incident but also his form.The last time Djokovic got to Roland Garros without a title to his name that season was in 2018, when his first honour of the campaign came at Wimbledon.With the French Open getting underway in two weeks and where he is the defending champion, Djokovic admitted that ""everything needs to be better in order for me to have at least a chance to win"" a 25th Grand Slam.""The way I felt on the court today was just completely like a different player entered into my shoes,"" added Djokovic. ""It's a bit concerning.""With Djokovic's unexpected early elimination from the Rome Open, the landscape of the last major men's tournament before Roland Garros has become wide open. The absence of the top-ranked player leaves an opportunity for other contenders to make their mark.In the day's final match on center court, third seed Alexander Zverev is set to face off against Luciano Darderi, a home hope ranked 54th in the world. This match presents an intriguing battle between an established top player and a rising talent, with both players eager to make their presence felt in the tournament.Meanwhile, Tabilo's impressive victory over Djokovic has captured attention, as he demonstrated exceptional skill and composure against his superstar opponent. Tabilo's performance, marked by 22 winners, only four unforced errors, and no break points faced, solidifies his status as a formidable contender in the tournament.""Honestly in no moment was I like, Okay, I can win this,"" said a delighted Tabilo.""I was playing incredible tennis. Just wanted to keep that level... The whole match I was just trying to take it point by point, not think about the score. Every point was like the start of the match.""Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka cruised into the last 16 of the women's tournament with a straight-sets victory over Dayana Yastremska, 6-4, 6-2.Second seed Sabalenka claimed her first win in four matches against Ukrainian Yastremska to set up a clash in the next round with Elina Svitolina, a two-time winner at the Foro Italico, who comfortably beat Anna Kalinskaya 6-3, 6-3.The 26-year-old Belarusian made short work of Yastremska, dispatching her opponent in one hour and 28 minutes without dropping a service game and never looking in trouble.Sabalenka, who has never won in Rome but is a two-time champion on the Madrid clay, looks in good shape to at least match her 2022 run to the semi-finals.""Every time I was losing here, I was so sad,"" she told reporters.""I felt like I lost on the Grand Slam because it was one of the dream tournaments for me to win.""Earlier fifth seed Maria Sakkari lined up a probable last-16 clash with Victoria Azarenka who beat 80th-ranked Egyptian Mayar Sherif 6-2, 6-7 (6/8), 6-3.","Novak Djokovic loses to Alejandro Tabilo 6-2, 6-3 in third round of Rome Open.
