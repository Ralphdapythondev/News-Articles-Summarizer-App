NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians ' all-rounder Tim David came to the defense of skipper Hardik Pandya 's scoring rate in the ongoing IPL, emphasizing his role as the ""glue"" holding the batting together for the five-time champions.Despite Pandya scoring at a rate of 138.46, accumulating 108 runs in four matches while batting at various positions, there have been observations of his inability to accelerate the innings, particularly in the middle and lower order this season.In the opening match against his former team, the Gujarat Titans, Pandya faced pressure and managed only an 11-run innings off four balls in a challenging chase.Similarly, in the subsequent match against Sunrisers Hyderabad, the MI skipper could only muster a 24-run innings off 20 balls batting at No. 5, chasing a daunting target of 278.Pandya showcased his prowess on a challenging pitch against Rajasthan Royals , leading the scoring with a commendable 34 off 21 balls in a low-scoring encounter.However, his innings of 39 runs off 33 balls (including 3 fours and 1 six) stood in stark contrast to the aggressive approach of other Mumbai Indians batters in the last match. Despite this, the team managed to achieve its highest total of 234/5 at home.""We have had conversations about how we have played. Hardik has been playing a really important job for our team,"" David told the media during Mumbai Indians' training session at the Wankhede Stadium on the eve of their clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.""Look at the last match (vs Delhi Capitals), we struggled really hard for momentum towards the back end (against Delhi Capitals). Hardik played a perfect innings that set the platform for myself and Romario (Shepherd) to go on with at the end,"" David added.""We got ourselves to a platform and he got that one ball that he could have hit for six. He hit it high on the bat and missed the middle and he is out (and) that is how the game goes.""The Australian all-rounder said having an extra batter in the line-up with the impact player rule in place could allow some batting line-ups like Kolkata Knight Riders to go boom or bust, but Pandya holds the innings together.""With the extra freedom of having an extra batter, there is maybe a little bit less responsibility. Some people are playing with a little bit more freedom or throwing caution to the wind. It goes both ways. KKR, the way they have been playing, they have been scoring a lot of runs.""The other night, they were playing the same way (against Chennai Super Kings ). They were looking to go big or bust a bit. They fall in a heap in the middle order.""""Like I said at the start, we had Hardik playing a middle order role in the last match. He was the glue that held us together and gave us a chance to play with freedom at the back end,"" he added.""Hardik has been phenomenal in the way he has been playing for the team. That is what we need at some point. Sometimes it is me, sometimes it is other guys.""David said the team has absolutely no concerns with the way their skipper has batted so far.""You could go look at the first game where Hardik hit two boundaries in his first two balls. (We have) absolutely full faith in him. We know his power; we know how good he is. When he gets into that situation, he is going to win games for us,"" David added.","Mumbai Indians all-rounder Tim David defends skipper Hardik Pandya's scoring rate.

""MS Dhoni dropped quite a simple catch with the one hand and the cameras went straight on to most of the CSK team. Because it was

, most of them were like - ""That's fine,"" Vaughan said.

Doull: ""Nobody said a word. I would love to see the bowler give a reaction (makes animated gestures).""

Vaughan: ""You could see that he wanted to. He went for it and then he thought - Oh, it is MS Dhoni.""

NEW DELHI: In a recent Indian Premier League ( IPL ) match between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), fans witnessed an unusual moment involving the legendary Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Despite CSK ultimately securing victory by 7 wickets, the spotlight was on Dhoni for dropping an easy catch of West Indian marauder Andre Russell .The incident sparked a flurry of reactions among fans and pundits, as such occurrences are rare for someone of Dhoni's calibre, known for his exceptional skills behind the stumps.However, even the best can have off moments, and this instance served as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of cricket.The incident happened in the eighth ball of the 18th over, Mustafizur Rahman executed a deceptive slower delivery aimed at Andre Russell, managing to elicit an edge from the KKR all-rounder. Despite the skillful execution, Dhoni, positioned behind the stumps, failed to secure the catch, attempting it with just one hand.The incident left the jam-packed crowd at Chepauk in disbelief, with both Mustafizur and CSK skipperRuturaj Gaikwad , who was fielding near the boundary line, momentarily stunned by the missed opportunity. However, despite the lifeline provided by the dropped catch, Russell couldn't capitalise on the reprieve and was dismissed soon after for just 10 runs.Despite the initial setback, CSK's disciplined bowling effort restricted KKR to a total of 137/9 in their allotted 20 overs. While the missed catch generated a wave of surprise and anticipation among fans, it ultimately did not significantly alter the outcome of the match, as CSK emerged victorious in the end.Chennai chased down the target quite comfortably in 17.4 over riding on a fine half-century from skipper Gaikwad.Following the high-profile clash, former England skipper Michael Vaughan and ex-New Zealand cricketer Simon Doull engaged in a discussion about Dhoni's dropped catch on Cricbuzz.Meanwhile, CSK's stronghold at their home ground continued to be evident as they comfortably secured victory without facing significant challenges, effectively ending KKR's unbeaten streak in this season of the IPL.",Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 7 wickets in IPL match.

NEW DELHI: Ajit Agarkar , chairman of selectors, acknowledged that Virat Kohli 's fitness blueprint has created a significant impact throughout the Indian cricketing ecosystem.Despite being 35 years old, Kohli continues to excel in executing the most challenging fitness drills, setting himself apart from others.""You look at guys like Virat (Kohli), he is one of those guys who set the benchmark.10-15 years into his career, he has only got fitter, you can see the results. If someone like him sets an example and puts forward certain things that you need or certain fitness levels that you need, gradually it progresses across the ecosystem.""Gradually it has progressed (to the younger generation). The one difference you have seen over the last 15-20 years or so is the fitness levels of players,"" said Agarkar on SportifywithPRG.In the current season of the IPL, Kohli has showcased outstanding form, hitting his eighth century in the tournament, thus extending his record. Additionally, he tops the run charts with 316 runs from five games played thus far.Agarkar described former India skipper MS Dhoni as a true instinctual player in a sport that has long embraced the use of data and insights.Dhoni's intuition has led him to clinch five coveted IPL titles. Despite stepping down as skipper of the Chennai Super Kings , his mere presence on the field instills immense confidence in his team.The former India cricketer felt that artificial intelligence cannot be a substitute to someone like Dhoni whose captaincy instincts are incredible.""The amount of data that's available, is incredible. You can plan a whole innings and I think everybody does it now, but it doesn't mean it will work all the time. You need a captain on the ground because not everything that you've planned is going to go your way.""On a particular day it might, but most days it won't. And that's where you need human instinct. That's why you call MS Dhoni a great captain because he had a feel for the game. He knew what was happening and how the game was changing,"" opined the 46-year-old former India pace bowler.Agarkar said that the IPL had become a huge platform to spot talent but what mattered most was a strong temperament, which would set them apart from the rest.""You can see it, (IPL) keeps throwing up players out of the blue. Having been a selector for a few months, there are certain players who suddenly come and show even on the big stage. IPL is a fairly big stage because of the pressures involved, big crowds.""You might be bowling to the top batters in the world, or you might be facing one of the top bowlers in the world, and that's when you stand up and that's where you judge the temperament of a player, whether he can do it consistently,"" said Agarkar.""It's sometimes a difficult task because of the sheer numbers (of players coming through the domestic structure) that we have. But, eventually, the more you watch players and temperament sometimes separates it.""Agarkar believes a tight-knit side will, more often than not, be a winning side.""A tight-knit group generally helps.

NEW DELHI: The world's best T20 batsman Suryakumar Yadav is back to cricketing action after four months - a break forced by sports hernia injury.With Mumbai Indians set to play a crucial clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Thursday, the official handle of the IPL shared a video of Suryakumar talking about his comeback.The video is titled: 'Wanted to be a better version of myself post injury'.The videos starts with SKY saying, ""It's great to be back, but most importantly, nothing beats the feeling of getting back at the Wankhede .""Talking about his time off the game, Surya says, ""It's actually a litter difficult to describe the last three, three and a half months, it has helped me grow as a person, grow as an athlete. It was difficult for first two-three weeks because I felt very boring doing the same things again and again, the rehab, but then the fourth week fifth week, I realized it's important going forward because it's very important for me firstly to decide how I wanted to come back.""""When I spoke to my wife and all the people at NCA , they said it has to be a second version of you. You have to be a little different when you come back on the field and in terms of that I started doing all the small small things like sleeping on time, following a good diet, that was most important. I had never read a book in my life, but I started doing that as well, getting up in the morning, spending a good quality time at the rehab centre and focussing on everything, connecting my brain, my body, myself with the rehab and it really helped to recover a little faster because I had two-three niggles together - sports hernia, ankle and right knee, so I had to take one step at a time, follow small small things and here I am, really happy to be on the ground,"" Surya added.Talking about his comeback to his home ground the Wankhede Stadium , SKY said, ""Always exciting to come back to this place because everything started from here, my whole cricketing journey started from here and when I entered the hotel, entered the ground, it never felt that I left this place. The first day I did my practice session with the boys and everyone around, it felt that I was here since the IPL started.""""If you're playing this sport, you have to work hard, there's no substitute to hard work but as I said in the beginning I wanted to be a better version of myself. When I got injured I realized what were the things OI wanted to work on because I got 2-3 months to work on myself in terms of fitness and everything on my body as well, so I really pushed hard at that time,"" SKY added.Talking about his rehab at the NCA, SKY said, ""I am really grateful to the support staff at NCA, everyone, right from the trainers, physios, everyone, who took care of me right from the morning. For a few days I was feeling angry to do the rehab, but they took it in their stride and they understood really well how I wanted to work, really grateful to them.""""See it's always difficult when your team is playing and you're sitting in the room and watching the game. I can't say I didn't watch the game, I watched half the game because I was sleeping on time when I was in Bangalore at about 10:30-10:45. So I used to watch only half of the innings and of course I used to watch the whole game the next day in the highlights. It was difficult but at the same time but at the same time it gave me a lot of motivation and inspiration looking at them (teammates) that yes, they are playing there and I have to work really hard on myself, on my recovery and get there as soon as possible,"" SKY concluded.Suryakumar recently got clearance from the National Cricket Academy (NCA) after undergoing rehabilitation for sports hernia surgery in December, and returned to Mumbai Indians IPL 2024 match against Delhi Capitals on Sunday at the Wankhede Stadium.But the big-hitter's return turned out to be a damp squib as he fell for a two-ball duck even though the five-time champions registered their first win of the tournament.With one victory from four matches, five-time champions Mumbai Indians are at the 8th spot, one spot above RCB , in the points table.","World's best T20 batsman Suryakumar Yadav is back to cricketing action after four months.

Of course, the pitches and the conditions in the USA will be new to all the international teams.Morgan said that adapting to foreign conditions in T20 cricket ""can be difficult."" ""India's biggest challenge in the T20 World Cup will be adapting to conditions. They play Ireland and Pakistan in New York on a pitch, which we don't know what it is going to be like. It should be an excellent venue but there is no previous information about the pitch. For me, that can cause issues. It is one of the hardest things, winning away from home is about how you play conditions and in T20 it can be difficult,"" Morgan, an IPL Expert with JioCinema, said at a virtual interaction on Wednesday.Unsurprisingly, Morgan's No 1 choice for the India wicketkeeper's slot in the T20 World Cup is the dashing Rishabh Pant , who has miraculously returned to action in this IPL after being out for almost 16 months due to a horrific car crash.""He is the player that he is. I don't see him being hampered in any way coming back from his car crash. For me, he is a very disruptive player, and also left-handed. As a leftie, he can play a big role in the middle-order, and add a huge amount of pressure as opposed to the right-handers,"" the retired left-hander said.Of all the captains, particularly in the Indians in the IPL, Morgan marked out India 'keeper-batsman Sanju Samson, who has led the Rajasthan Royals to the top of the table (at the time of writing this) with four wins in four matches for special praise, crediting him for the way he has brought the best out of in-form young batting gun Riyan Parag by promoting him to the No 4 slot this season.""If you look at Hardik (Pandya), he had success in a short span of time with GT (Gujarat Titans) now he is with Mumbai and starting to turn things around. You can't put a price on winning, as a captain that is what you are judged on. Probably the standout has been Sanju Samson. I say that because of one key factor. His use of Riyan Parag, not just promoting up the order- how outspoken he has been about wanting him to bat at No 4. One of the hardest things to do as captain is to instill confidence and belief in a player to make them better players. Sanju has done with Riyan,"" Morgan complimented. Parag has scored 185 runs in four matches@92.50, at a strike rate of 158.11, with two fifties so far.The 37-year-old felt that it was unfair to blame IPL-2024's current 'Orange Cap' holder Virat Kohli (316 runs in five matches@105.33, with one century and two fifties) for his strike rate (146.29) when the rest of Royal Challengers Bangalore team is struggling in both the batting and bowling departments.""It is very difficult to point a finger at a guy who is the holder of the Orange Cap and the rest of the batting line is not scoring runs. I don't see a point in that. For RCB, they are struggling with the bowling and rest of the batting. Why would I place blame on someone who is scoring a majority of the runs,"" Morgan said.","Eoin Morgan says adapting to foreign conditions in T20 cricket ""can be difficult"" India's biggest challenge in the T20 World Cup will be adapting to conditions, says Morgan.

Alen Stevanovic played a through ball from the left and Doungel made no mistake of latching on it before making a run and finishing with a lob over the onrushing goalkeeper.At that point, it seemed that Jamshedpur would at least finish their season with a point but Goa went all out in search of the win after that. They hit the post twice and forced the goalkeeper to make more than one save.Goa’s relentlessness finally paid off as Borja Herrera González scored the winner in the 90+5 minute to break the hearts of the home fans.","Jamshedpur FC ended their campaign in the 10th edition of Indian Super League ( ISL ) on a disappointing note as they went down 2-3 to FC Goa.
