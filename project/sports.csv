How Rachin Ravindra trained for Test series in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/how-rachin-ravindra-trained-for-test-series-in-india/articleshow/114365076.cms,"Rachin Ravindra celebrates after completing his century

India vs New Zealand Test: Focus returns on India batters after high-scoring day

BENGALURU: Each time New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra is asked about his Indian lineage or his Bengaluru connection, he speaks about how special his parents’ hometown is. There is no denying the 24-year-old has a deep-rooted connection with the city, particularly the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.During the 50-over World Cup last year, he came up with a swashbuckling century (108) against Pakistan at the venue; and on Friday, he showcased why he is an exciting package of class and craft.On a day when over 450 runs came off the strip, Rachin’s 157-ball-134 (13x4; 4x6) was highlighted by quick but cautious scoring. With pacers Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah keeping it tight, Rachin concentrated on playing them off. It was the spinners he went after.He brought up his 50 by smashing the ball over bowler Kuldeep Yadav’s head and for his first maximum, he launched a floater from Ashwin into the stands beyond deep midwicket. Fittingly he brought up his century with a boundary off Ashwin.By the time he was dismissed by Kuldeep, for 258 minutes he had put up an exhibition of game awareness, nimble footwork and control.Rachin hasn’t learned to adapt to Indian conditions overnight. Instead, it has been ingrained in him by his father Ravindra Krishnamurthy, who was also his first coach. That has led to Rachin spending time in India adapting to the conditions and circumstances.In the build-up to the World Cup, he travelled with his home club, the Wellington-based Hutt Hawks, to Bengaluru and Anantapur. Before the Black Caps’ subcontinent tour beginning with the washed-out Test against Afghanistan, Rachin worked at the Chennai Super Kings Academy. The allrounder, who was roped in by the IPL franchise last season, went through strenuous batting drills during his time in Chennai.Ravindra, who witnessed his son’s second Test century, gave an insight into what Rachin worked at the Academy.“Rachin trained at the academy for about a week. In 40 degrees Celsius, in that humidity, he practiced on a gravel kind of surface. The ball is jumping and turning, dust is coming off, and you are drenched in sweat. I mean nothing can get worse than that. This century, I think, is because of that preparation,” he explained.Concurring with his father, Rachin, who showcased a remarkable temperament as wickets tumbled at the other end, said “It was an invaluable experience. I thought it’d be the best thing for me to go and have a few days of training there in more realistic conditions than what we’d have doctored in New Zealand. I""I was lucky enough, the CSK guys sorted me with 4-5 good days of training on red and black soil wickets. That helped me sort of shore up some game plans and work on a few positions that I wanted to.""","Rachin Ravindra scored 157-ball-134 (13x4; 4x6) against India.

India vs New Zealand Test: Focus returns on India batters after high-scoring day

BENGALURU: The swagger with which India’s top-order batters went about their business at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here on Friday against New Zealand was quite unlike a team that is looking to save a Test. After all, they had just conceded a 356-run first-innings deficit.For a team which had collapsed to a humiliating 46 all out in their first innings, there seemed no trace of anxiety when Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal strode out to bat towards the end of the second session.The intent was clear: play a fearless brand of cricket, the result be damned.This, perhaps, is what sets Rohit & Co apart. Fear of failure isn’t a part of the team’s fibre.It helped that the wicket had eased and the visiting pacers, who wreaked havoc the previous day, did not get as much purchase or seam movement as they had in the first innings. The fielding too had slipped a notch from the side that had plucked catches out of thin air, literally, in the first innings.When stumps were drawn, India were 231/3 in 49 overs, 125 runs still in deficit, but the game appeared to have been brought to even keel. India would have been better placed had not Virat Kohli (70; 102b; 8x4; 1x6) been dismissed off the final ball of the day. He looked good for a bigger partnership with Sarfaraz Khan (70; 78b; 7x3; 3x6).Even so, it was a good day for the spectators. They had cheered for ‘homeboy’ Rachin Ravindra (134; 157b; 13x4; 4x6), who went on to compile his second international century at this venue to help the visitors to a very competitive first-innings tally of 402.Then, when the Indians came out to bat, it was as close to a highlight reel as one could get in this format.Rohit, typically, began the assault, flicking Matt Henry through mid-on. He followed it up with another hit to the fence in the fourth over. Rohit (52; 63b, 8x4; 1x6) and Jaiswal (35) had India off to a flying start. That their association ended with 72 on board was in large part to the left-hander trying to increase the pace even further.Jaiswal stepped out against Ajaz Patel (2/70), misjudged completely, and wicketkeeper Tom Blundell did the rest. Not long after, Rohit was foxed by an Ajaz delivery that straightened a bit to sneak onto the stumps.Unlike Thursday, there were no infamous records. Instead, Virat Kohli became the fourth Indian after Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar to cross 9,000 runs in the format. Kohli and Sarfaraz turned the last session into a visual treat, until Glenn Philips dealt a body blow securing Kohli’s edge. A review only confirmed Kohli’s departure.India have depth in batting but it will take momentous innings from the likes of Sarfaraz, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant (if he is fit) to pull off an improbable result.Earlier, New Zealand had begun the day at 180/3, a 134-run lead, and the desperation for wickets was evident as Rohit shuffled his bowlers around.Mohammed Siraj (2/84) secured the breakthrough in the 13th over, getting Daryl Mitchell to offer Jaiswal a thick edge at gully. Phillips and Henry’s wickets were mopped up by Ravindra Jadeja (3/72) in quick succession.With the Black Caps at 233/7, India pressed hard to wrap up their innings but ran into the resolute Ravindra, who found the perfect foil in Tim Southee (65; 73b; 5x4; 4x6).The duo frustrated the Indian attack, easily finding gaps and taking a special liking to R Ashwin (1/94) and Kuldeep Yadav (3/99). At one point, the two were cruising along at over six an over.Along the way, Southee hit his 93rd six, surpassing Virender Sehwag.","When stumps were drawn, India were 231/3 in 49 overs, 125 runs still in deficit, but the game appeared to have been brought to even keel.

Return home after each match: PCB’s new proposal to BCCI for Champions Trophy 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/return-home-after-each-match-pcbs-new-proposal-to-bcci-for-champions-trophy-2025/articleshow/114356086.cms,"(Pic Credit - X)

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has proposed a return-to-India plan for the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) during the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy , Cricbuzz reported on Friday.Under the proposal, the Men in Blue would return to India - either Chandigarh or Delhi - after each match they play in Pakistan, providing a solution to address security concerns.The idea is to allow the Indian team to travel to Pakistan for their games and return home in between matches, rather than staying in the host country for the tournament's entirety.This proposal is seen as a way to ensure Team India's participation while addressing the Indian government's reservations about touring Pakistan.The Champions Trophy is scheduled to run from February 19 to March 9, with matches set to be held in Lahore, Rawalpindi , and Karachi. Due to logistical considerations and security concerns, the PCB has planned all of India's matches in Lahore.The city's proximity to the border makes it easier for Indian fans to attend the games by crossing over. India is slated to play three group-stage matches against Bangladesh on February 20, arch-rivals Pakistan on February 23, and New Zealand on March 2.""A PCB official confirmed this arrangement, citing that there is nearly a week-long gap between the last two matches,"" reported Cricbuzz.The decision on whether the Indian team will travel to Pakistan for the eight-nation 50-over Champions Trophy in 2025 ultimately rests with the Indian government. At this point, neither the BCCI nor the International Cricket Council (ICC) can confirm India's participation.However, key developments have emerged following the External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar 's recent visit to Pakistan, including discussions about the tournament's scheduling. These discussions indicate ongoing efforts to address security and logistical concerns, as both boards await a final call from the Indian government regarding the team's participation in the tournament.Recent updates have also surfaced concerning the tournament's itinerary. The ICC has distributed the schedule to all parties involved, including the teams set to participate. Subsequently, local media outlets reported that the broadcaster had asked the ICC to change the venue for an India match, specifically the India-New Zealand encounter. The PCB has put forward Rawalpindi as a potential replacement. Nevertheless, representatives from both the broadcaster and the ICC have stated that they are unaware of any such request.India's involvement in the Champions Trophy is crucial for the global cricketing community, whether the tournament takes place in Pakistan or another nation through a hybrid approach. The event's significance would be greatly diminished if India chooses not to participate.The ICC and PCB have also devised a backup plan to organize India's matches outside of Pakistan in case the Men in Blue are unable to make the trip.","The Pakistan Cricket Board has proposed a return-to-India plan for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy.

India vs New Zealand Test: Focus returns on India batters after high-scoring day

Teams to hit most Test sixes in a year

102* – India (2024)

89 – England (2022)

87 – India (2021)

81 – New Zealand (2014)

71 – New Zealand (2013)

(*68 sixes by England currently - the second most by a team this year in 2024)

NEW DELHI: India achieved a remarkable milestone by becoming the first team in the 147-year history of Test cricket to hit 100 sixes in a calendar year.The Rohit Sharma-led side reached this feat on the third day of the first Test match against New Zealand in Bengaluru on Friday, surpassing England's record of 89 sixes in 2022. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill have been the top contributors, with 29 and 16 sixes respectively.Despite facing a daunting deficit of 356 runs, India mounted a spirited fightback in their second innings, reaching 231 for three at stumps on Day 3. Virat Kohli , who completed 9,000 Test runs during his knock, scored 70 before falling to Glenn Phillips off the last ball of the day. Rohit Sharma (52) and Sarfaraz Khan (70 not out) also contributed with fluent half-centuries, reducing the deficit to a more manageable 125 runs.New Zealand's imposing total of 402 was largely due to a crucial 134-run partnership for the eighth wicket between Rachin Ravindra (134) and Tim Southee (63).India now face an uphill task to stage a comeback, with their largest successful run chase in Test cricket being 274 against Australia in the memorable Kolkata Test of 2001.","India become first team in 147-year history of Test cricket to hit 100 sixes in a calendar year.

Hotter conditions prompt Delhi Half Marathon organisers to move back race timings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/athletics/hotter-conditions-prompt-delhi-half-marathon-organisers-to-move-back-race-timings/articleshow/114291581.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi has been experiencing slightly hotter conditions at this time of the year, with the day’s maximum temperature hovering around 35 degrees Celsius.This has prompted the organisers of the Vedanta Delhi Half Marathon – scheduled on Oct 20 here – to push behind the timings of races in all five categories – half marathon amateur (21.097 km) at 5 am, half marathon elite (21.097 km) at 6:50 am, champions with disability and senior citizens’ run (2.5 km approx.) at 7 am, Open 10K (10 km) at 7:30 am and Great Delhi Run (4.5 km approx.) at 9 am.According to organisers, the live telecast of the event – starting from 6:15 am onwards – also played a part in decision-making.Talking to TOI, Hugh Jones , secretary general of the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races and VDHM race director, informed that the change in race timings due to weather conditions was done to benefit marathoners and encourage them to run a faster race.“No doubt, it is hotter than we expected. We moved back the timings to provide the runners a nice experience. The half marathon for elite international and Indian runners usually started at 7:20 am on previous occasions. This time, we have adjusted the timings, and it will start at 6:50 am. Similarly, the half marathon for amateurs previously began at around 6 am. This time, it’s starting at 5 am. The Great Delhi Run saw a 9:30 am start. This year, it will be 9 am. So, the hotter weather conditions did play a part,” Jones said.Jones, a retired British long-distance runner, spurred on the participants to break the course record. “There is always a tactical element involved in the race. It’s up to the participants how they personally approach the race. The opportunity is there to run faster, if people want to. The change in the start timing is quite helpful. We have pushed everything a little earlier. So, I hope the marathoners will look to break the course record.”Former 5000m world champion Muktar Edris will return to lead a star-studded international line-up at the VDHM. He will be joined by two-time Olympic gold medallist Joshua Cheptegei , which increases expectations for a course record in the men’s race. The women’s field includes the Birmingham CWG champion in 10,000m, Eilish McColgan .“The course record is up for grabs. But I don’t see the world record being broken given there has been significant advances in marathon running,” Jones said.At the VDHM, the international event record stands in the name of Ethiopians Amdework Walelegn (58:53s, year 2020) in the men’s section and Yalemzerf Yehualaw (1:04.46s, year 2020) in the women’s category.","Delhi has been experiencing slightly hotter conditions at this time of the year.

Pakistan have given themselves the best chance in recent times of beating a top side in Test cricket after they set England a daunting target of 297 to win in the second match of the series in Multan on day three.A 65-run stand for the ninth wicket between Agha Salman (63) and Sajid Khan (22) bailed Pakistan out of trouble in their second innings, after they had slipped to 156 for 8.The hosts were eventually bowled out for 221 to add to their first-innings lead of 75 runs and set England the task of achieving the biggest chase in the fourth innings to win a Test match in Pakistan.But before that partnership between Salman and Sajid, a hilarious banter was caught on stump microphone between Salman and Noman Ali .After Noman played a shot for a single off his hips to deep square leg, Salman asked him ""did you play it?""""Khud hi maari hai na yeh (you played it)?"" Salman asked Noman.""Haan, haan! Poora tere bhai ne Lara wala. Dekha nahi? Yeh dekh (yes, just like Brian Lara , didn't you see it?)"" replied Noman, possibly pointing his partner towards the giant screen to look at the replay, which left a beaming smile on Salman's face.Coming back to the current state of the match, England had lost their openers Zak Crawley (3) and first-innings centurion Ben Duckett (0) cheaply before close of play on the third day.Ollie Pope (21*) and Joe Root (12*) were at the crease with the visitors' total reading 36 for 2, still 261 runs away from the target.England lead the series 1-0.",Pakistan set England a daunting target of 297 to win in the second Test in Multan.

NEW DELHI: After India's dismal batting collapse on the second day of the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru, captain Rohit Sharma expressed his disappointment, saying it was painful to witness such a low score.Rohit also acknowledged that his decision to bat first may have backfired, but he emphasized that a rare poor call in a year is acceptable.""I am hurting to see this score of 46 as captain as it was my call to bat first.But one or two bad calls in a year is alright,"" Rohit said after the day's play.India collapsed to their lowest home Test total of 46 against New Zealand after pacers Matt Henry and William O'Rourke joined forces to bowl out the hosts in mere 31.2 overs during the second session.This was India's third-lowest score in Test cricket, following their 36 all-out against Australia in the 2020 pink-ball Test in Adelaide and 42 all-out against England at Lord's in 1974.India's previous lowest score at home was 62, also against New Zealand at Mumbai in 2021.Riding on opener Devon Conway 's 91, New Zealand powered into a lead of 134 at stumps on a dramatic day two in Bengaluru.New Zealand were 180-3 at close of play with Rachin Ravindra on 22 and Daryl Mitchell on 14 when stumps were drawn in an extended session.""On a pitch where there was assistance for the seamers, and now that we were bowled out for 46, you could say the shot selection wasn't up to the mark. It was a bad day. Sometimes you plan to do something but fail to execute,"" the Indian skipper added.India's decision to promote Virat Kohli to the number three spot did not pay off, as he was dismissed for a duck after taking on the responsibility following discussions with the team.Sarfaraz Khan, batting at number four, also fell cheaply, while KL Rahul, who was at number six, failed to capitalize on his familiarity with the local conditions and was dismissed without scoring.""We don't want to touch KL's batting position much. He has found a place at 6, so let's give him a rope there. Same with Sarfaraz, we wanted to give him a similar position to where he bats because he is new to international cricket as well. So Virat was the one who wanted to take responsibility. We had a discussion, and he was fine with it. That's a good sign that players are taking responsibility,"" Rohit said.",India collapse to lowest home Test total of 46 against New Zealand.

Brief scores (In Guwahati):

Assam had escaped to a draw against Jharkhand in their last game with their batters showing intent in the second innings on final day. But on Friday, in their second-round match of Ranji Trophy Elite Group D against Chandigarh in Guwahati, Assam batters could not carry the momentum they got from that inspiring draw.Opting to bat first at Barsapara Cricket Stadium , hosts Assam struggled to 249 for eight wickets in 87 overs at stumps as none of the top and middle-order batters could convert the starts they got on Day 1.It was Mukhtar Hussain ’s rearguard action at No. 9, where he scored a run-a-ball 55, that helped Assam to a respectable total in the end.Earlier, openers Parvej Musaraf and Rahul Hazarika didn’t last long as both went back to pavilion inside the eighth over scoring only nine and one, respectively. Captain Denish Das then joined forces with No. 3 Rishav Das but Assam’s hope of arresting any further damage wasn’t fulfilled as the skipper departed scoring a 26-ball 21 with three fours and the scoreboard reading 41/3 from 17 overs.Rishav (12 off 58 balls) returned soon after, being retired hurt in the 22nd over, which further damaged Assam’s prospects. Thereafter, the home team lost wickets at regular intervals with only Sibsankar Roy showing some resistance at No. 5 scoring 46 off 97 balls with five fours and a six as they were down to 162 for seven wickets. In between, debutant wicketkeeper-batter Ruhinandan Pegu (29) and Abhishek Thakuri (19) both failed to capitalise on the starts.The fall of Thakuri brought Sumit Ghadigaonkar as a substitute for Rishav and the experienced batter’s unbeaten, vigilant 41 off 123 balls with only two fours helped Assam pass the 200-run mark, albeit with the help of a cameo by Hussain down the order. The duo put on 87 runs for the eighth wicket to help Assam avoid more blushes.Hussain hit nine boundaries and two maximums to play a perfect foil to Ghadigaonkar’s patient knock, which was the need of the hour.Left-arm spinner Nishunk Birla was the pick of the Chandigarh bowlers with 3-60 as pacer medium Jagjit Singh scalped 2-35 to help the visitors’ cause. On Day 2 Assam would look for some brisk runs to add to their first innings total before trying to restrict the Chandigarh batters.Assam 249/8 in 87 overs (S Roy 46, S Ghadigaonkar 41 batting; Birla 3-60, Jagjit 2-35) vs Chandigarh.

Odisha

It was nothing short of a dream debut for Odisha spinner Sumit Sharma as he began his first-class career with a five-wicket haul against Jammu & Kashmir in their Elite Group A Ranji Trophy clash in Cuttack on Friday.His figures of five for 79 on the first day of the four-day fixture made sure that Jammu & Kashmir could not take the game away from the hosts as they finished the first innings on 270 despite top-order batter Abdul Samad (127) scoring an impressive century at Barabati Stadium .At stumps on Day 1, Odisha were 15 for the loss of opener Shantanu Mishra who was bowled by Auqib Nabi for naught in the second ball of the innings. Anurag Sarangi and Sandeep Pattnaik — batting on 8 and 6 respectively — will look to drive the innings and get them a crucial first-innings lead on Day 2 after Odisha saw their opening fixture against Tripura get washed away by rain.Earlier, J&K won the toss and chose to bat but found both their openers back in the pavilion with just 14 runs on the board. While Rajesh Mohanty (2-47) dismissed Abhinav Puri (6), Suryakant Paradhan (2-50) struck from the other end to claim the scalp of Shubham Khajuria (7).Thereafter, skipper Govinda Poddar brought debutant left-arm spinner Sharma into the attack and things began getting worse for the visiting J&K batting lineup. Even skipper Paras Dogra had no answer for Sharma’s bowling and was dismissed cheaply by the 29-year-old playing his first first-class match.Only Samad stood up to the Odisha attack and held on to one end as wickets kept tumbling at the other end. His 117-ball innings, with a strike rate of 108.5, that included six boundaries and a whopping nine sixers lifted the tempo of the J&K innings and took them to a competitive total.The highlight of their game was the 131-run partnership for the fifth wicket that Samad had with Sahil Lotra (39) and gave the visitors the optimism to fight on. While Pradhan broke the partnership by bowling out Lotra, it was the star of the day Sharma who got rid of the belligerent Samad with a catch to Sarangi.270 in 70.3 overs (A Samad 127, S Lotra 39; Mohanty 2-47, Pradhan 2-50, Sharma 5-79).15/1 in 9 overs.

Brief Scores

Vidarbha:

NAGPUR: Left proved right for Vidarbha on Friday, as two southpaw youngsters — Yash Rathod and Harsh Dubey — saved the team against minnows Puducherry. Rathod posted a century while Dubey finished Day 1 unbeaten on 69 to take Vidarbha to 261 for 8 after a top-order collapse.At 4 for 14, Vidarbha, who opted to bat, were staring down the barrel for the second time in as many matches.Big names like Dhruv Shorey , Karun Nair, and Atharva Taide along with Aman Mokhade were back in the pavilion inside eight overs. Host seamers Gourav Yadav and Sagar Udeshi were exploiting the home conditions at the Cricket Association Puducherry ’s Siechem Stadium to the maximum.Rathod (118;196b;8x4), though, timed his second Ranji Trophy century to perfection to guide Vidarbha to safety and also get back into the runs. Coming in at the crease in just the third over of the morning, with Vidarbha down at three for just four runs on the board, Rathod remained unbeaten over next 77 overs.Rathod's first ton of Ranji Trophy had helped Vidabrha make a comeback against Madhya Pradesh in last year’s semifinal. On Friday, Rathod’s 197-ball knock took Vidarbha to relative safety.The Vidarbha No. 5 batter stitched together three key partnerships — with skipper Akshay Wadkar Akshay Karnewar and Dubey — to script the Vidarbha fightback after the team was left gasping by the early blows of the morning session.Rathod’s last partnership of the day, with allrounder Dubey, was the most important one for Vidarbha. Before Dubey joined the rescue act, Rathod had two 50-plus partnerships each with Wadkar (31;50b;3x4) and Karnewar (16;53b;2x4). But with both the batters failing to convert starts into big knocks, Vidarbha were still tottering at six for 129.In Dubey, Rathod found a partner willing to stay long at the wicket. The two batted together for almost 40 overs, adding 120 runs for the seventh wicket and bringing Vidarbha to a position from where they can hope to make a match out of it.At the other end, allrounder Dubey (69*;150b;8x4) played the perfect supporting role. The day saw Dubey post his highest First Class score , as he posted his third fifty in the format. Vidarbha would hope Dubey carries on the good work on Day 2 and takes the team past the 300-run mark.261 for 8 in 83 overs (Yash Rathod 118, Harsh Dubey 69 batting, Akshay Wadkar 31; Gourav Yadav 3-57, Sagar Udeshi 2-40, Fabid Ahmed 2-51) vs Puducherry.",Yash Rathod and Harsh Dubey save Vidarbha against minnows Puducherry.

Out of national reckoning for his reluctance to play domestic red-ball cricket last season, Ishan Kishan is leaving no stone unturned to attract the selectors’ attention for a comeback in India shirt.On Friday, the wicketkeeper-batter surely took a step towards that as he had a dream start to the second-round match of Ranji Trophy Elite Group D, scoring a brilliant ton (101 runs in 158 balls, 13 fours, 2 sixes) in Jharkhand’s away game against Railways at ADSA Railways Cricket Ground in Ahmedabad.Coming to bat at No. 6, the southpaw showcased his batting skills, ensuring that his team reaches a commanding 325/5 at the end of the first day’s play.Apart from Kishan, former captain Virat Singh also scored a century and is unbeaten on 103 at stumps. Opener Nazim Siddiquie (96 off 131 balls, 15 fours) missed out on a three-figure mark when he was stumped off Karn Sharma’s bowling.Opting to bat first, Jharkhand had a disastrous start to their innings, losing in-form opener Aryaman Sen and Utkarsh Singh inside first 10 overs to medium pacer Himangshu Sangwan, who was the pick of Railways bowlers with 4-72.

KALYANI: It was an agonising day-long wait for Abhimanyu Easwaran to complete a cherished century. Going by his current form, a three-figure mark seems like regulation for him, but this milestone was something special and emotional for the Dehradun born boy as he prepared to take guard in his 100th first-class match.But sadly, he was kept waiting as the first day's play of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group C match between Bengal and Bihar was called off without a ball being bowled on Friday.Bringing back memories of the abandoned Test match between Afghanistan and New Zealand in Greater Noida last month, even the toss did not happen in spite of a sunny day here at the Bengal Cricket Academy (BCA).Overnight downpour left wet patches in the outfield making the ground unfit for cricket as the umpires called off day's play at 3pm after a series of inspections.""It makes me feel special,"" Easwaran said after being felicitated by the Cricket Association of Bengal on Friday. ""It's been a long journey and I did not even realise that I had played so many FC matches,"" he stated.However, the opener remains focused on achieving his dream. ""It was good to enjoy the journey. But my aim remains the same - to play for India,"" he said.Having scored four tons in his last four FC matches, Easwaran is perhaps going through the best phase of his career with the expectation of him getting picked as the reserve opener for India's series Down Under next month is gaining strength. ""Yes I also get to hear those murmurs,"" he smiled.""It feels nice to be thought of likewise. But I always concentrate only on my next match,"" he added.

But on Thursday, Chennaiyin FC made sure of bringing the fans at home the gift of the second win of the season, despite another late fightback from NorthEast United FC In the end, the Highlanders supporters could not witness an encore of their point-yielding late show of the last two games as 10-man Chennaiyin held their fort and snatched away a 3-2 Indian Super League win at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati.Former NEUFC recruit Wilmar Jordan Gill (25’, 51’) made an impressive comeback into Owen Coyle ’s starting XI this season with a crucial brace from set-pieces on either side of Lucas Brambilla’s (36’) goal from the spot despite NEUFC making a dream start with a 5th-minute opener by Nestor Albiach.Juan Pedro Benali’s men also came hard at the visitors in quest for at least a point after Laldinliana Renthlei was sent off the field for a second yellow card in the 83rd minute.Their wonder recruit Alaeddine Ajaraie was once again on the scoresheet – becoming only the second player after Chennaiyin’s former star striker Elano Blumer to score in all his first five games in ISL – when he put the ball in the opposition net from a confident penalty kick.However, Ajaraie, who was brilliant throughout the game but also missed a couple of sitters, was not able to add further to the score thereafter as Chennaiyin strived to maintain the one-goal lead to take away all three points on offer.The victory took Coyle’s side to the fifth spot with seven points from four matches – a jump of three spots on the ISL table. It also sent NEUFC down three places to the ninth position, with just four points from the five matches they have played so far.","Chennaiyin FC beat NorthEast United FC 3-2 at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati.

India thrash Pakistan 5-2 in SAFF Women's Championship opener,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/india-thrash-pakistan-5-2-in-saff-womens-championship-opener/articleshow/114323005.cms,"(AIFF Photo)

KATHMANDU: India made an excellent start to their SAFF Women's Championship 2024 campaign as they outclassed Pakistan 5-2 in a Group A match at the Dasharath Stadium on Thursday. The five-time champions led 4-1 at half time.While India grabbed three points with consummate ease in the opening game of the three-team group that also has Bangladesh , the match marked skipper Ashalata Devi 's 100th appearance for the Blue Tigresses and the 50th international goal of prolific striker Ngangom Bala Devi , who became the first Indian woman footballer to do so.While Grace Dangmei (2), Manisha, Bala Devi and Jyoti Chauhan scored for India, Suha Hirani and Kayla Marie Siddique found the net for Pakistan.The two traditional rivals have so far met four times in the international arena and India emerged triumphant on all occasions.With a goodly crowd present at the Dasharath Stadium to witness the clash of the arch-rivals, India wasted no time to launch an onslaught that fetched them the first goal in the fifth minute.The Pakistan defence, which had a rather difficult time to contain an overlapping Ranjana Chanu on the left, had the first test of the wing back when she sliced in to send a cross that was converted smoothly by Player of the Match Grace Dangmei with a shot from outside the box.If this was a fine strike and the result of a well-rehearsed move, then the next three goals also didn't lag behind in class and character.The second goal in the 17th minute had the signature of Bala Devi's skills written all over as the seasoned campaigner gave a through pass that had the entire Pakistan defence rattled. Manisha found the pass and beat goalkeeper Nisha Ashraf with a left-footer.Then came the moment of glory for Bala Devi. The elegant striker was spotted wiping her tears when the national anthem was played at the start of the match.In the 35th minute she banged the net off an indirect free-kick. The stamp of class the shot carried with it proved too much for the rival custodian.After Grace scored her second and India's fourth goal in the 42nd minute off another Ranjana cross, Pakistan pulled one back just before half time when India conceded a penalty. Suha Hirani's was an angular one to the top corner and Panthoi Chanu had little chance against it.India's neighbours suddenly looked rejuvenated after finding the target for the first time. They scored another through Kayla Marie Siddique immediately after the half taking full advantage of some confusion in the rival's area.As Pakistan pressed on the gas in search of more success upfront, their challenges were finally quelled with the fifth goal when substitute Jyoti Chauhan neatly heading in a Dalima Chhibber corner in the 78th minute to score her first senior India goal.",India made an excellent start to their SAFF Women's Championship 2024 campaign as they outclassed Pakistan 5-2 in a Group A match at the Dasharath Stadium on Thursday.

As Indian Super League ( ISL ) returns from the international break with NorthEast United FC hosting Chennaiyin FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati on Thursday, the home side will look to start afresh and comeback to winning ways.Beginning their ISL journey this season with a 1-0 away win over debutant Mohammedan Sporting Club, NEUFC have lost one and drawn two games thereafter. Sitting in sixth position on the league table, the Juan Pedro Benali-coached side will aim for a win in their fifth tie against the southern opponents, who have four points after three games.Speaking about their opponents, NorthEast head coach Juan Pedro Benali said that the Marina Machans are physically very strong.“We’re playing against a nice team, a team who has a very peculiar style. Owen Coyle ’s style, we know it. They’re a strong team, physically very strong and they don’t give you a chance to breathe. And we hope at home we can do much better than the last game and get the three points,” Benali said in Guwahati on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Chennaiyin have experienced all three results possible once each, and have undergone quite a similar fate like NEUFC after a winning start to the league. They have been on the road for two out of their first three matches this season. Speaking to the media ahead of their third away tie, head coach Owen Coyle praised NorthEast while highlighting the need for his boys to be more clinical.“What you have is two very good teams,” Coyle said on the eve of the game. “Two very attack-minded teams, going all out to win a tough game. NorthEast are always a very dangerous opponent — they were last year and they certainly are this year. I think Juan Pedro Benali has done a fantastic job.”“Equally, we know we have a good team, we know we have good players and can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams in this league when we are at our best. So that’s our focus, being very respectful of our opponents but focusing on our qualities. In truth, we should probably be sitting with 7-9 points; in the last two games alone, we had just under 40 chances, so we know we have to be more clinical,” Coyle added.Due to heavy rainfall in Chennai, the Marina Machans had to travel to Guwahati pretty early to resume training. Expressing his gratitude to the Highlanders for opening their facilities early, the Scottish coach wished for the safety of the people back home.“We haven’t been able to train for the last three days because of the severe weather in Chennai. But, more importantly, we want to make sure everyone’s safe and well, so that’s the priority,” Coyle said.",NorthEast United FC host Chennaiyin FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati on Thursday.

MADRID: Real Madrid have, for the moment at least, given their support to star forward Kylian Mbappe since the Swedish media reported that he is being investigated for an alleged rape during a visit to Stockholm.The reigning European champions, who have not commented publicly on the reports, do not appear to be overly concerned about the reports about the player who joined this summer from Paris Saint-Germain .An internal club source, who spoke to AFP on condition of their identity not being revealed, described the accusations as ""the biggest fake in the history of sport"".On Tuesday, Real were accused of deleting 25-year-old Mbappe from photos it published in a promotional campaign with its jersey manufacturer Adidas.Real told journalists the reason was simply because Mbappe's boot sponsor is Adidas's bitter rivals Nike.That explanation was questioned on social media though, with many people pointing out that several players in the photos are also under contract with Nike, like Mbappe's French international teammate Eduardo Camavinga.In the midst of the media storm -- and on the day his lawyer spoke to AFP and other French media to insist her client was ""shocked"" to be linked to arape investigation -- Mbappe trained with his teammates in Madrid on Tuesday.This time, the club had no hesitation in posting photos and videos of the Frenchman, who should be available for selection on Saturday for the visit of Celta Vigo to the Bernabeu as he is said to have recovered from discomfort in his left thigh that kept him out of France's squad for Nations League games.With a rare few free days on his hands, Mbappe chose to go to Stockholm with a group of friends, arriving on October 9 and departing on October 11.Reports in several Swedish media say they visited a restaurant and a nightclub. Once the group had left Sweden, a woman went to police to allege she was the victim of a rape.On Monday, after Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet became the first media outlet to reveal that a rape probe had been opened, Mbappe slammed the report as ""fake news"" on his social media and alleged there was a link between the accusations and his financial dispute with his former club Paris Saint-Germain.

To have the chance to represent England is a huge privilege, and the opportunity to work with this special and talented group of players is very exciting.""Tuchel won league titles at PSG and Bayern and the German Cup with Dortmund, but his greatest success came during his time in English football at Chelsea.He led the Blues to Champions League glory just months after taking charge in 2021 and also won the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup with the London club.Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 in a bold early move by Chelsea's new ownership group that did not pay off.He becomes the permanent successor to Southgate, who led the Three Lions to back-to-back finals of the European Championship, plus a World Cup semi-final and quarter-final in his four major tournaments in charge.England, though, are still yet to win a major men's tournament since the 1966 World Cup on home soil.""We are thrilled to have hired Thomas Tuchel, one of the best coaches in the world,"" said FA CEO Mark Bullingham.""Since Gareth resigned, we have worked through the candidate pool, meeting a number of coaches and evaluating them against that criteria.""Thomas was very impressive and stood out with his vast expertise and his drive.""Tuchel will inherit a richly talented generation of players, including Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham and Cole Palmer, that will be among the favourites for the 2026 World Cup .","Thomas Tuchel named England's new manager on Wednesday.

I am sticking to the game plan, and it’s working much better because my game has also become strong, helping me go deep in the draw in competitions,” he said.Tyagi, whose father Ajay Tyagi works in the Port Sector in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, is targeting a top-20 ranking by the end of the year.Tyagi, who is 6 feet 1’ and still growing, is likely to feature in the main draw of the Australian Open junior boys event, starting Jan 18. “I not only want to get into the main draw, I want to be seeded this time,” he said.The long-haired teenager, who lost in the qualifying event in Melbourne in successive years, is keen to shine at the big-ticket event. Considering his current form, Tyagi, who idolizes Serbian ace Novak Djokovic, will be much better prepared this time.Tyagi will limit himself to Grand Slams and J500 events in the junior category next year. He plans to gradually shift his focus to the men’s competition, playing Futures and Challengers.Tyagi, who trains at the Harsha Lingappa Tennis Academy in Bengaluru, will look to sharpen his game, particularly his serve in the coming weeks. “I have decent serves, but I want to improve it, I also want to get stronger and bigger,” said Tyagi.The India No.1 is scheduled to play the J500 in Merida, Mexico, (from Nov 25).

Every kid watches cartoons, right? But I didn’t watch cartoons. I just used to watch sports, tennis specially.“So, my parents were like, ‘she likes it.We have to put her on to that’. So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week. The Odisha girl, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, won her first juniors title in Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114255057,imgsize-39734,width-400,resizemode-4/114255057.jpg"
AITA files application in Delhi HC to unseal poll results,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/aita-files-application-in-delhi-hc-to-unseal-poll-results/articleshow/114225786.cms,"AITA

PUNE: The All India Tennis Association on Monday filed an application in the Delhi High Court to unseal the results of its recently held elections.The application was part of the response AITA filed in a writ petition brought forward against it by Davis Cuppers Somdev Devvarman and Purav Raja , who had sought a stay on the elections citing breach of National Sports Code .Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav had on September 24, while admitting the case, allowed the polls to go ahead but ordered the results to be not declared and presented to the court in a sealed envelope.“The returning officer today filed the sealed envelope to the court. From AITA, we have filed an application to open the envelope,” Ashish Prasad, advocate for AITA, told TOI from Delhi over phone.“Two weeks’ time has been given for all parties to file their response. Next hearing is on November 25,” he added.Prasad said that with the Union government , first respondent in the case, releasing a draft for a new sports code, AITA would prefer the “new bill to come into play” before the court makes a decision.“Until then the current office-bearers would continue. I don’t think the court would want the case to go into a limbo,” he said.“We are on the same page when it comes to what they (petitioners) are asking for, good administration and good compliance (of the sports code).“My advice has always been to abide by the law. If the new group (of office-bearers) comes forward, and if they are above 70 or (in breach of) tenure as per the (new) code, they will go.”Asked if there had been any overtures from either party to settle the case amicably, Prasad was diplomatic.“My advice is to talk and look for common ground,” he said.","The application was part of the response AITA filed in a writ petition brought forward against it by Davis Cuppers Somdev Devvarman and Purav Raja.

Shanghai, Oct 13, 2024 -Novak Djokovic insisted Sunday that he plans ""to compete and play next season"" despite suffering another loss at the hands of world number one Jannik Sinner .The 37-year-old Serb, the holder of a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles , went down 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to the Italian in the final of the Shanghai Masters .However, Djokovic said he has no intention of following career-long rival Rafael Nadal into retirement even though he endured by his own admission ""one of the worst-performing seasons in terms of results"".""I don't know what the future brings, I'll just try to kind of go with the flow to see how I feel in a given moment but I still plan to compete and play next season,"" he told reporters.Djokovic failed to add to his Grand Slam haul in 2024 as Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz , who claimed the French Open and Wimbledon titles, took possession of the sport's major honours.However, Djokovic was crowned Olympic champion , winning an emotional roller-coaster of a final against Alcaraz in Paris in August. That was his 99th career title.Sunday's loss left him frustratingly short of becoming just the third man after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer to win 100 titles.""It's not a live-or-die type of goal for me, I think I've achieved all of my biggest goals in my career,"" he said.""Right now it's really about Slams and about still seeing how far I can kind of push the bar for myself.""Djokovic hailed Sinner who at 23 is 14 years his junior. His title in Shanghai was his seventh of the year.""He's very solid from the forehand and backhand, doesn't make too many mistakes, and just tries to take away the time from the opponent,"" said Djokovic.""That's something that reminds me of myself throughout my career, that's what I've done for so many years consistently, playing fast-paced tennis , taking away time from the opponent, kind of suffocating the opponent in a certain way.""","Novak Djokovic says he plans ""to compete and play next season"" The Serb lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to Jannik Sinner in the final of the Shanghai Masters. The 37-year- old Serb is the holder of a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114195001,imgsize-33394,width-400,resizemode-4/114195001.jpg"
