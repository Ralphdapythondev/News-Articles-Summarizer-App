NEW DELHI: Swapnil Kusale clinched India's first-ever Olympic shooting medal in the 50m rifle 3 positions event on a day when four other medal contenders including PV Sindhu , Nikhat Zareen , Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty and Sift Kaur Samra were knocked out from their respective events at Paris Olympics on Thursday.Little-known shooter Kusale secured a bronze with an aggregate score of 451.4 despite being placed sixth at one stage in the eight-shooter final.Kusale's bronze takes India's overall tally to three medals, all in shooting, placing the country 42nd on the medal table.Kusale's impressive display follows the outstanding achievements of Manu Bhaker, who won bronze in the women's 10m air pistol and the mixed team 10m air pistol alongside Sarabjot Singh.This marked the first time India has secured three medals from one single sport in Olympic history.""I did not eat anything, was feeling the butterflies (in my stomach). Just had black tea and came here. The night before every match, I just pray to god,"" news agency PTI quoted Kusale as saying after his unprecedented achievement.""Today the heartbeat was on the higher side. I just tried to control my breathing and did not try anything different,"" he added.Kusale hails from Kambalwadi village near Kolhapur in Maharashtra, where his father and brother are teachers and his mother is the sarpanch. In the final, Kusale finished behind China's Yukun Liu, who shot 463.6, and Ukraine's Serhiy Kulish, who scored 461.3.The last Indian 50m rifle shooter to make it to the Olympic finals was Joydeep Karmakar in the 2012 London Games, where he finished fourth in the now-discontinued 50m rifle prone event.Kusale started the final's standing series in fourth place. His first shot in the kneeling position was a 9.6, a low score that he quickly recovered from with impressive 10.6 and 10.3 shots, momentarily placing him in second. Subsequent scores of 9.1 and 10.1 pushed him back to fourth, but a crucial 10.3 shot propelled him to third, a position he maintained to secure his medal.Kusale brilliant performance was followed by a series of disappointments as two-time Olympic medallist shuttler Sindhu, two-time world champion boxer Nikhat Zareen (50kg), badminton's celebrated men's doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, and promising rifle shooter Sift Kaur Samra made their way out of the event.In contrast, Anjum Moudgil and Sift did not manage to qualify for the final of the women's 50m rifle 3 positions event, finishing 18th and 31st in the qualifications round, respectively.Despite the day's disappointments in other sports, Lakshya Sen provided a glimmer of hope by advancing to the quarterfinals in the men's singles badminton event, defeating compatriot HS Prannoy.Lakshya Sen remained in contention for his first Olympic medal while Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty's hopes were dashed after a close men's doubles quarterfinal loss.Sen won against fellow Indian HS Prannoy to reach the last eight, becoming only the third Indian male badminton player to do so at Olympics.Sen comfortably defeated a tired HS Prannoy with a score of 21-12, 21-6 in the pre-quarterfinals, marking a significant achievement for the 22-year-old from Almora. He joins the ranks of Parupalli Kashyap and Kidambi Srikanth, who reached the quarterfinals in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, respectively. Sen, currently ranked 22, will face 12th seed Chou Tien Chen from Chinese Taipei in the quarterfinals.Satwik and Chirag, who were also seen as strong contenders for a medal and are the reigning Asian Games and Commonwealth Games champions, lost a thrilling match against Malaysia's Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik. Despite winning the first game 21-13, they could not maintain their lead and eventually lost 21-13, 14-21, 16-21 to the world number 3 pair.Adding to the day's disappointments, Sindhu fell short in her bid for a third Olympic medal. She lost her match to China's He Bing Jiao, with scores of 19-21, 14-21. Despite fighting hard, Sindhu, the 10th seed, struggled to keep up with the higher-ranked Bing Jiao.Sindhu, who had previously won silver in Rio and bronze in Tokyo, had topped her group to reach the knockout stage. Her loss ended her pursuit of another medal and dampened the spirits of her supporters.Nikhat Zareen, a two-time world champion, faced a disappointing end to her Olympic debut, losing 0-5 to China's Wu Yu in the women's 50kg boxing division.Despite being one of India's top medal prospects, Nikhat was unseeded due to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) not recognizing the International Boxing Association (IBA), which oversees the world championship.Nikhat's Olympic journey was further complicated by a difficult draw.""Sorry guys,"" an emotional Nikhat said after the loss.""She was faster. I will analyse this bout once I am home. I had worked hard, prepared myself physically and mentally for this Olympics. I will come back strong,"" she promised.The Indian men's hockey team faced its first defeat at the Olympic Games, losing 1-2 to defending champions Belgium in a pool match, despite holding an initial lead.Abhishek scored for India in the 18th minute, but Belgium turned the game around after halftime with goals from Thibeau Stockbroekx in the 33rd minute and John-John Dohmen in the 44th minute.With the win, Belgium remains unbeaten in the tournament.Both India and Belgium have already secured their spots in the quarterfinals from Pool B.India aim to improve upon the bronze medal they won in the Tokyo edition.India's athletics campaign was off to a poor start as 20km race walkers failed to put up creditable performances.Vikash Singh and Paramjeet Singh ended at lowly 30th and 37th positions respectively in the men's event while national record holder Priyanka Goswami finished a poor 41st in the women's 20km competition."," Swapnil Kusale secures India's first-ever Olympic shooting medal in 50m rifle 3 positions event.

NEW DELHI: Millions of Indian fans were left heartbroken when MS Dhoni was run out against New Zealand in the 2019 ODI World Cup semifinal at Old Trafford, Manchester on July 10.Chasing a 240-run target, India were 209/7 after 48 overs and had just lost Ravindra Jadeja who had played arguably his best ODI innings - a 59-ball 77-run knock that was studded with 4 sixes and 4 fours.Needing 31 runs off the last 12 balls, India still had the 'best finisher in the world' at the crease and still hopeful of victory.Lockie Ferguson bowled the penultimate over of the match and Dhoni hit the first ball of the over for a six over deep backward point. The second delivery was a got ball.It was the third ball of the over when hearts of millions of Indian fans skipped a beat as ironically, for a man who is so good between the wickets, was run out, in what turned to be his last ODI.Ferguson bowled a slower ball on a length and it popped up off the glove towards short fine leg as Dhoni got cramped on the pull.With Bhuvneshwar Kumar at the other end, Dhoni ran for two but there was a slight stutter on the second run and that cost Dhoni as he was just short of a direct hit at the keeper's end by Martin Guptill.Dhoni was run out after a 50-run knock that came off 72 balls and India lost the match by 18 runs and were eliminated from the World Cup.Now a video has surfaced online in which during an event, Dhoni is asked by a fan about that moment and how she dealt with it.Dhoni replies, ""It was a difficult one because I knew that this will be my last World Cup, so it would have been good to be on the winning side. It was heartbreak moment, so we accepted the result and we tried to move on.(It takes time and one gets some time after the World Cup. I haven't played any international after that, so I got a lot of time). So, yes, it was a heartbreak but at the same time you have to get out of it. So you just accept that you tried your best, but you were not able to win it.""Mahendra Singh Dhoni is widely regarded as one of the greatest captains and wicket-keeper batsmen in the history of the game. Dhoni became the captain of the Indian cricket team in 2007.Under his leadership, India won several major ICC tournaments, including the ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket in December 2014.

Former Pakistan bowler Waqar Younis likely to become PCB's Chief Cricket Officer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/former-pakistan-bowler-waqar-younis-likely-to-become-pcbs-chief-cricket-officer/articleshow/112201234.cms,"NEW DELHI: Renowned former Pakistan fast bowler, Waqar Younis , appears set to take on a pivotal role within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), potentially becoming the organization's new Chief Cricket Officer (CCO).While initially engaged as an advisor to the chairman on cricket affairs, sources, as reported by PTI, suggest that this appointment is a precursor to a more permanent and influential position.Contrary to initial reports, Waqar's current role is a paid position within the PCB, not merely an advisory one. This suggests a deeper level of commitment from both Waqar and the PCB, hinting at a long-term vision for his involvement.The creation of a CCO position, mirroring the role held by Rob Key in the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), further underscores the significance of Waqar's potential appointment.Should he assume the CCO mantle, Waqar's responsibilities are expected to be wide-ranging. These could include involvement in national team selection, shaping central contract policies, and contributing to the strategic direction of Pakistan cricket across all formats and levels.His vast experience as a player, captain, and coach, coupled with his recent immersion in various PCB departments, would equip him well for such a demanding role.Waqar's decision to relocate his family from Australia to Lahore last year demonstrates a clear commitment to contributing to Pakistan cricket. His willingness to initially familiarize himself with the PCB's inner workings as an advisor before taking on a more prominent position speaks to a measured and strategic approach.The potential appointment of Waqar Younis as CCO represents a significant development for Pakistan cricket. His experience, stature, and deep understanding of the game, both domestically and internationally, could prove invaluable in shaping the future direction of Pakistan cricket.However, it remains to be seen how this new structure will function within the existing PCB hierarchy and what impact it will have on the team's performance on the field.","Waqar Younis appears set to take on a pivotal role within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) He could become the organization's new Chief Cricket Officer (CCO) Waqar's current role is a paid position, not merely an advisory one.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112201760,imgsize-25990,width-400,resizemode-4/112201760.jpg"

A tough call: Rohit on choosing between Pant and Rahul as wicketkeeper batter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/a-tough-call-rohit-on-choosing-between-pant-and-rahul-as-wicketkeeper-batter/articleshow/112201329.cms,"Rohit remembers Gaekwad

NEW DELHI: Indian captain Rohit Sharma acknowledged the difficulty in selecting the team's wicketkeeper batter for ODIs, with both KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant being strong contenders. He emphasized that each player brings unique strengths to the table, describing them as ""match-winners"" in their own right.Having recently featured in the T20 World Cup, Pant is back in the Indian squad, while Rahul is set to make his ODI comeback since his last appearance in January.The upcoming series opener against Sri Lanka in Colombo on Friday will provide an opportunity for one of them to showcase their skills behind the stumps and with the bat.""It's a tough call (wicketkeeper-batter between Rahul and Pant) to make. Both are quality players, and you know the abilities of both the players. They are match-winners in their own way. They have won a lot of games for us in the past,"" Rohit said, as quoted by PTI, during his pre-match press meet.Rohit expressed his preference for dealing with an abundance of options rather than facing a scarcity.""It is not easy to pick a team or a player when you have quality like that. It is always nice to have problems like that while picking up the teams, so you know that there is quality in the squad. I look forward to these kind of problems till I am the captain,"" he said smilingly.Rohit emphasized that, regardless of who is selected, it's crucial for the player to express himself freely.The 37-year-old also mentioned that the management has already fostered a relaxed atmosphere in the dressing room, allowing players to focus on their game without any fear or hesitation.""The most important thing is to allow the freedom to players, so that they will be able to do that and it is our job to ensure that we create that environment. Yes, we have already created that environment for players to come here and play freely.""So, that they do not (need to) think too much about their own performance, result etc. If you are playing the game the team wants you to play, then we are more than happy,"" he added.Rohit said that Suryakumar Yadav, his successor as India's T20I captain, has done a commendable job in his first full series.""It's early days (in his captaincy); I don't want to talk too much about it. He has done a great job, and let him continue doing it.""We start jumping into things (judgement) quite quickly, regardless of wins or losses. Let him do things consistently, and then we can talk about it,"" he said.Under Suryakumar's leadership, India secured a 3-0 victory over Sri Lanka in the recent T20I series, which Rohit described as a promising start.""It's definitely a good start for them in that format. They played well as a unit, which is what Team India is all about. I'm sure they are heading in the right direction,"" he said.Rohit expressed that he was ""devastated"" upon hearing about the passing of former Indian cricketer Anshuman Gaekwad.Gaekwad succumbed to blood cancer on Wednesday night after a long battle.""Absolutely devastated to hear that news. We have had a few conversations during the BCCI awards and all. When I was playing the Ranji Trophy , he was there to watch.""There was a chance to speak to him,"" Rohit said.The skipper said it was a nice experience for him to learn from a senior cricketer, who played during a very different era of cricket.""He had a few things to talk about my game as well, which was overwhelming for me because he was such a great cricketer for India. It was always nice to learn things from your seniors, just to understand how cricket was played back in the day.""It was great learning for me then. Condolences to his family.

It was a great feeling to come back home after winning the World Cup...what we experienced in Delhi and Mumbai. But yeah, now we have to move on, cricket moves on,"" said Rohit, as quoted by PTI, on the eve of the first ODI against Sri Lanka.After the victorious campaign, Rohit decided to step away from T20Is.""Whatever we have done in the past, that was good for that particular period of time, but time keeps moving forward and we also need to keep moving forward,"" he added.After suffering a loss against Australia in the last year's 50-over World Cup on home soil, Rohit mentioned that the squad employed a comparable strategy.""That's what happened after the 2023 World Cup. There was a lot of disappointment, but we had to move on and look forward to this World Cup.""Now, that the T20 World Cup is over, we have to think about what lies ahead of us as a team.

You are still trying to do something different and you are not compromising on the standard.""We are a sports team, a cricket team, and we should also be allowed to lose while we are trying to do things differently,"" he elaborated.Rohit remained steadfast in his assertion that the team's focus would not shift from their objective of securing a victory in the ODI series against Sri Lanka.""We want to achieve something out of every series or game we play, but not at the cost of not showing intent or purpose.

NEW DELHI: When India plays Sri Lanka in a three-match series starting in Colombo on Friday, the Gautam Gambhir-led Indian team management will have the chance to select between KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant as India's long-term first-choice wicketkeeper-batter in ODIs.After the recent T20 World Cup victory, there will also be a lot of excitement surrounding the first sighting of veterans Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , as per PTI.Gambhir will be monitoring Rohit and Kohli's performances, as he stated they will be crucial to the future.This will also be the pair's first ODI following that heartbreaking loss to Australia in the World Cup final in Ahmedabad last year, and they will be keen to celebrate the return of the 50-over format with a memorable match.In a season that features several major one-day events, such as the Champions Trophy, the think tank will attempt to block out that outside noise and concentrate on figuring out the combination.Given that, it is inevitable that this series would give special attention to the Rahul vs. Pant dispute.As the current wicketkeeper-batter, Rahul has been in that position since last year's Asia Cup, when he returned from a protracted injury layoff. Rahul was part of the previous team led by Rahul Dravid.Rahul has since carried out his responsibilities both in front of and behind the wicket with diligence.Rahul has amassed 834 runs at a magnificent average of 69.50 from 21 matches since the continental showpiece last year, including two hundreds. In addition, earlier this year Rahul led India against South Africa in the ODI series.The thirty-two-year-old has been a decent stumper as well.But now that Pant is back in the mix, would Gambhir go the same path?Although it has been nice to see Pant return to the Indian team for a string of Twenty20 Internationals following that terrible accident in 2022, his performances have not ignited the field.Over the past month or so, hopeful signs have appeared. Is that, however, sufficient to persuade the ruling class to select him over Rahul?Gambhir and captain Rohit will need to consider how to make room for Shreyas Iyer , another strong performer in the 50-over version, if they choose to pick both Rahul and Pant in the starting 11.Iyer scored 52 runs in his final ODI encounter in Johannesburg against South Africa. His 2023 record is equally remarkable, with 846 runs at an average of 53 in 20 matches, including three hundreds.Rahul, Pant, and Iyer may therefore share the two batting positions in a three-way tie because India will need to use five bowlers if all three are picked.India would not want to follow such strict route, especially because Hardik Pandya will miss this series due to personal matters.Therefore, India may wish to give Riyan Parag or Shivam Dube a run at No. 6.But giving Parag bowling responsibilities in the recently finished Twenty20 Internationals may have been a sign of things to come, as he may have a bigger part in the ODI series.The fact that Parag can switch between leg-spin and off-spin well also improves his chances, as the Impact Player rule prevented him from showing off this ability much in the IPL.However, the Assamese player has a very notable body of work in the Deodhar Trophy, the domestic 50-over competition.With a respectable economy of 4.8, he finished sixth last season with 11 wickets, behind Vidwath Kaverappa (13), Shams Mulani (12), Mayank Yadav (12), Shahbaz Ahmed (12), and R Sai Kishore (11).Dube, on the other hand, did not get called up to bowl in the series against Sri Lanka and only participated in one ODI appearance five years prior.Even though they had spells of domination in the T20I series, Sri Lanka, a team made up of both young and seasoned players, will want to prevent the batting collapse that ultimately proved to be their downfall.However, they will not have the services of pacers Matheesha Pathirana and Dilshan Madhushanka, who have been ruled out of the series with injuries.Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd.

Unpredictable dangers in cricket: Umpire hit by flying bat - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/unpredictable-dangers-in-cricket-umpire-hit-by-flying-bat-watch/articleshow/112184240.cms,"WATCH:

NEW DELHI: In a startling incident that has reignited discussions on safety protocols in cricket , an on-field umpire was struck on the leg by a flying bat during a player’s celebratory outburst.The video of the incident has gone viral, drawing attention to the potential hazards faced by umpires.The incident occurred during a recent match when a batter, exuberant after hitting the winning six, threw his bat into the air as part of his celebration.The umpire, positioned at the opposite end of the pitch, was preparing to signal the six when the bat landed on his leg, causing visible discomfort. The batter’s celebration had commenced even before the umpire could complete the traditional signal for a six.Cricket, like many sports, involves inherent risks of physical injury, leading players to don extensive protective gear. Batters wear helmets, pads, gloves, arm guards, and thigh pads, while wicket-keepers use gloves to handle high-speed balls. Umpires, too, have begun adopting protective measures, a practice popularized by Australian umpire Bruce Oxenford .Oxenford designed an innovative arm guard, shaped like a lollipop, to shield his left arm. First introduced during a 2015 World T20 warm-up match and later seen in the IPL , the device features a black arm attachment and a transparent protective shield. Despite its utility for Oxenford, the contraption hasn’t gained widespread acceptance among other umpires. Some, like fellow Australian John Ward, prefer using conventional helmets for protection.However, incidents like the recent flying bat highlight the unpredictable dangers in cricket, suggesting that current safety measures may not be comprehensive enough. The unexpected nature of such accidents emphasizes the need for ongoing evaluation and enhancement of safety protocols for umpires.","Incident occurred during a recent match when a batter, exuberant after hitting the winning six, threw his bat into the air as part of his celebration.

Will support national team by developing players at Inter Kashi: Habas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-support-national-team-by-developing-players-at-inter-kashi-habas/articleshow/112029904.cms,"Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.
