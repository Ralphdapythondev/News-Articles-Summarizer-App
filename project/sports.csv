Aman

beats Cruz to clinch sixth medal for India

PARIS: Aman Sehrawat is just 21 but mature way beyond his age. He has been to hell and back.He lost both his parents when he was just 11 years old. His mother took her own life after battling mental illness for years. His father also died soon after. Aman battled depression and tried to take drugs to forget his pain.He was in a dark place. But his uncle Sudhir Sehrawat was a pillar of support. He backed his nephew to concentrate on his wrestling career , take his mind off negative thoughts. His grandfather Mangeram also motivated him.Inspired by Olympian Sushil Kumar 's exploits, Aman had joined Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi two years before his father passed away. With his uncle holding his hand now, life changed. Aman found peace on the mat. He had a mission in life. He made steady progress, kept reaching new milestones and made newspaper headlines when he became the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship .On Friday evening, at the Champs de Mars stadium, a makeshift arena right next to the Eiffel Tower, Aman took on Puerto Rico's Darian Cruz in the 57kg freestylebronze medal match, a weight category in which Ravi Dahiya had won silver for India in Tokyo.Aman dominated his seasoned 29-yearold rival, a three-time medallist at the Pan American Games. After an initial contest, he won comfortably at 13-5. The bronze medal was India's, the country's fifth medal at the Games here.In the first period, Cruz took the lead by grabbing Aman's left leg and pushing him out of the orange circle. 1-0. Aman tried hard to draw level and went up 2-1 soon as he pinned Cruz to the mat. Cruz returned the compliment to go 3-2 up.It was very close at this stage. But Aman started gaining confidence and started attacking more, lunging at Cruz's legs to get the crucial points. He managed to do that midway through the period, to get two points for a 4-3 lead. The Puerto Rican seemed to be tiring now and just before the hooter, Aman got a good grip, Cruz went down to avoid a takedown and Aman was 6-3 ahead.In the second period, Cruz came back determined and got two points. Aman was just a point ahead at 6-5 now. It could have gone either way, but Aman was not giving up. He took two points to go 8-5 ahead. There were just two minutes left for the final hooter. He was looking in control.At this point, Cruz opted for a break, pointing to his left knee. He was trying to catch his breath against the young Indian. After the medical assistance, Cruz was back on the mat, looking a bit tired. Aman saw that and went in for the kill. His strategy was simple. He attacked his rival by grabbing his leg, forcing him to go down and then got on top for two points.With a minute and 7 seconds to go, it was 10-5. With just 45 seconds left, it became 12-5. There was no way Cruz was coming back. Aman secured another point to emerge an easy winner and ran to his coach to celebrate his medal.Hailing from village Birohar in Haryana's Jhajjar district, Aman had a keen interest in mud wrestling as a kid. The move to the mat changed his life.The 21-year-old, the lone Indian in the men's section, had a good outing on Thursday here, posting two big wins to race through the pre-quarters and quarterfinals of the 57kg freestyle.In the quarterfinals, Sehrawat was up against Albania's Zelimkhan Abakarov. The verdict was 12-0 in the Indian's favour as he rattled up the points over the two periods. He had lost to Akabarov at the senior World Championships.Aman lost to his Japanese opponent in the semifinals but returned on Friday to fight for bronze. He was hungry, he was determined. He was the better wrestler.This medal would give some solace to India's wrestling contingent which was in a shock after Vinesh's disqualification. It came as a much-needed balm.","Aman Sehrawat is the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship.

Ashish Nehra's future as Gujarat Titans head coach hangs in balance: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ashish-nehras-future-as-gujarat-titans-head-coach-hangs-in-balance-report/articleshow/112405638.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ashish Nehra 's tenure as the head coach of Gujarat Titans hangs in the balance, with the IPL team planning to overhaul their coaching staff ahead of the upcoming mega auction, according to a report by Cricbuzz.Sources within the IPL have indicated that the management of the Gujarat Titans, with its administrative head situated in the UK and officials in Mumbai and Singapore, is contemplating alterations to their coaching personnel for the upcoming season.The current staff, comprising Vikram Solanki as the director of cricket, Ashish Nehra as the head coach, and Gary Kirsten as the mentor and batting coach, has been with the team since its inception three years ago.The management of the team is considering alterations to the coaching staff, even though the combination of Nehra, Solanki, and Kirsten has yielded impressive results. In their debut season in 2022, the team clinched the title, and they secured the runner-up position in 2023, demonstrating their prowess from the outset.However, a key figure in this triumvirate, Gary Kirsten, has already departed to take up a position with the Pakistan team. This change might be one of the catalysts prompting the contemplation of further adjustments within the coaching setup, despite the team's commendable performance under the current leadership.Solanki's future with the team remains uncertain amidst the ongoing overhaul, but there are signs that he may be able to weather the storm. However, the head coach position is less secure. Reports suggest that Nehra's presence may have caused discomfort among some team members.In previous seasons, including the 2023 final, the former India pacer was frequently seen on camera, offering guidance to Mohit Sharma after each delivery. However, his appearances on television during the 2024 season were noticeably less frequent, which might not be a mere coincidence.Regarding the speculation about a potential change in the Gujarat Titans' management - from CVC Capital to either Torrent Pharma or the Adani Group - it is likely that any such transfer will have to wait until February next year.This is due to the mandatory three-year lock-in period for franchise shares, which means the current management under CVC will likely oversee at least one more season; definitely the auction which is expected to take place in December.","IPL team planning to overhaul coaching staff ahead of upcoming mega auction.

While spending almost the entire day with his family, we had home-cooked lunch and tea, all made lovingly by his wife Andrea.""""We reminisced about some of his best knocks- facing the fearsome West Indies quicks in the 1990s, how he attackedShane Warne (at Sharjah in 1994), and listened to songs. He was in a jolly mood throughout our stay in his house and regaled us by singing old Hindi movie songs! While he has a few health issues, he didn't appear to be as fat as he's looking in the video, and looked in decent shape. He was eating well too. He told us: 'I am fine and fit.' When we asked him about the video, he said that it was from a few weeks ago. At that time, he had gone down to buy something, and suddenly felt dizzy, but it wasn't as if he was drunk or something,"" the 53-year-old explained.""He was giving batting tips to his son, Cristiano, who is also a left-handed batter like his father. Andrea, meanwhile, was helping out the kids with their homework,"" said Marcus. The duo then made Kambli speak to several of his friends, including former teammate Abey Kuruvilla , who is now BCCI GM, Ajinkya Naik, the president of the Mumbai Cricket Association and former Mumbai captain Shishir Hattangadi.""There was some leakage from the ceiling of his flat, but the family seems to have sportingly adjusted to that trouble,"" Marcus revealed.Incidentally, it was Marcus who played a massive role in telling the world about the famed 664-run partnership between Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli in 1988. Soon after that partnership, Marcus approached illustrious statisticians Anandji Dossa and Sudhir Vaidya, before another noted statistician, Mohandas Menon eventually established that it was a world record partnership.Ironically, Marcus' brother Ricky, who too paid a visit to Kambli on Thursday, was the 12th man for the Shardashram Vidyamandir school team, for whom Tendulkar and Kambli had that record partnership, in that match.","Vinod Kambli's condition hasn't been great for a few years now. Two of his close, old cricketing friends - school classmate Ricky and his brother, First- Class umpire Marcus Couto visited the 52-year-old at his fifth floor flat at the Jewel Cooperative Society in Bandra on Thursday.

There were not a lot of runs scored down the ground. They did not use the feet as much as we expected. It was about using sweeps and piercing that deep square leg and midwicket field. That is something we failed to do as a batting unit. We did not play enough sweeps, reverse sweeps, or paddle sweeps, and used our feet too much. That was the difference,"" said Rohit.""If you look at Kusal Mendis and Avishka Fernando today [who put on an 82-run stand], they got a lot of runs square of the wicket.

Will 'Skeleton bone test' be able to end the age fraud menace in Indian grassroots football?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-skeleton-bone-test-be-able-to-end-the-age-fraud-menace-in-indian-grassroots-football/articleshow/112229085.cms,"What is a skeleton bone test?

NEW DELHI: If you google "" age fraud in Indian football "", you'll find countless entries, articles, short-form, long-form, evidence-driven ones, written by countless writers, journalists, and observers of the beautiful game of football.One can find the news of the Indian under-15 football team's captain turning out to be almost eighteen months over the age limit for the Asian under-16 championship in April 2019 or an under-17 player initially rejected by coach Nicolai Adam for his ""unnatural height"" at age 14 was later accepted into the team under Luis Norton de Matos, everything is already so well-documented.While age fraud remains a persistent issue in Indian football, we should now be looking for a more permanent and accurate solution to fight it.And it should begin early, from the grassroots level of Indian football, like the Subroto Cup , an annual school football tournament held in India, named after Subroto Mukerjee, the founder of the Air India Football Club. The prestigious tournament, established in 1960, was once graced by players like Baichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri and will enter its 63rd edition on August 5.Aimed at promoting the sport at the grassroots level, it will host a jaw-dropping 111 teams across three categories, with the sub-junior (under-15) category introduced for the first time this year. It will also have some teams from foreign countries too.To fight the demon of age fraud, the organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament, offering a promising solution to address this issue effectively.During the opening press conference of the Subroto Cup, TimesofIndia.com raised concerns about age fraud. Answering, an Air Force Sports Control Board (AFSCB) spokesperson stated, ""All and every footballer (who will be participating in the Subroto Cup) is registered on the AIFF website. And each of them gets a unique code. We also want to avoid age fraud. As per the AIFF guidelines, a skeleton bone test will be done for the under-15 boys category. For the under-17 category, it will be normal medical. The skeleton bone test or the age-detection test will all be done under the guidelines of AIFF.""The skeleton bone test, commonly known as a bone age assessment, estimates a person's age, especially in children and adolescents, by analyzing their bones.This process typically involves taking an X-ray of the left hand and wrist, as this area contains bones that undergo predictable developmental changes with age. The X-ray is then compared to standard reference images, such as those in the Greulich-Pyle Atlas, to determine the bone's developmental stage, including the appearance of growth plates and the fusion of epiphyses.It is understood that 22 teams in the under-14 category were disqualified and did not participate in the Subroto Cup after failing the age-determination test last time. According to AIFF guidelines, if four or more players from a team are found to be over-aged, that team will be immediately disqualified and barred from the tournament.""Apart from that, all the players who have already registered through AIFF and CRS (central registration system), have their age verified. The people who are coming are less in numbers. So, in times to come, age fraud, which is prevalent in football, is likely to reduce,"" he ended on a positive note, sounding hopeful, as we all are, of a better future.","The Subroto Cup is an annual school football tournament held in India.
