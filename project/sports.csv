Women's T20 World Cup: How India can qualify for the semifinals after Australia's big win over New Zealand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-womens-t20-world-cup/womens-t20-world-cup-how-india-can-qualify-for-the-semifinals-after-australias-big-win-over-new-zealand/articleshow/114062034.cms,"Indian cricket team (BCCI Photo)

India's path to the semifinals complicated by Australia's win

Scenarios for India's progression

If India secure two convincing wins, they will accumulate six points. However, if New Zealand also win their remaining matches — against Pakistan and Sri Lanka — and Australia defeat Pakistan, all three teams (India, New Zealand, and Australia) will end up with six points each. In this scenario, NRR will decide which two teams advance to the semifinals from Group A.

Pakistan also remain in the race for a semifinal spot. They currently hold second place and need to beat both Australia and New Zealand to finish on six points. If Pakistan win both matches and India also beat Australia and Sri Lanka, then India and Pakistan will qualify for the semifinals.

If Australia win all their remaining matches, there could be another scenario of India, Pakistan and New Zealand finishing on four points each. Then NRR will decide the second spot in the group. With India already behind the other two contenders in terms of NRR, they will need a huge victory over Sri Lanka on Tuesday to be ready for such a scenario ahead.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Australia delivered a commanding performance, defeating New Zealand by 60 runs to climb to the top of Group A in the ICC Women's T20 World Cup , held in the UAE. On Tuesday, Australia set a challenging target of 149 runs, before dismissing New Zealand for just 88 in 19.2 overs.With this comprehensive victory, Australia now have four points from two matches and lead the group with an impressive net run rate (NRR) of +2.524.The loss dropped New Zealand from the top spot to third place in the standings.India's qualification to the semifinals has become more challenging after the Australia vs New Zealand match. But the heavy defeat substantially decreased New Zealand's NRR, giving India an opportunity to catch up with a one-sided victory in their next match.Currently, India sit in fourth place in Group A with two points from two games, the same as Pakistan (now second) and New Zealand, but trail behind due to an inferior NRR. India's NRR of -1.217 is significantly lower than Pakistan's +0.555 and New Zealand's -0.050.To advance to the semifinals, India must win both of their remaining matches — against Sri Lanka on Wednesday and Australia on Sunday — by substantial margins. Improving their NRR is crucial to surpass their rivals and finish in the top two.So, India's chances hinge on not just winning their matches but doing so decisively to boost their NRR above their competitors, starting from today's match against their Asian rivals Sri Lanka.",India's path to the semifinals complicated by Australia's win.

SKY's new-look Team India will look to seal series vs Bangladesh today

NEW DELHI: It's a rarity for an India captain to turn up for an optional training sessions on the eve of an international game. Suryakumar Yadav did so on Tuesday afternoon, ahead of the second T20I against Bangladesh at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. His happy-go-lucky reputation precedes him but it is now evident Surya is emerging as a capable leader since being appointed T20I captain in July.Surya himself went through an intense batting session for over half an hour. He then sat with Abhishek Sharma and Jitesh Sharma next to the nets and had a lengthy chat about international cricket and the importance of not being predictable. Sources said the gist of the talk was that to survive at this level, one has to keep evolving and trying new things to stay ahead of the opposition.It appears Suryakumar is now warming up to the direction the T20I team must take. The presence of many fresh faces means there's a definite path laid out. This team has been specifically picked keeping the T20 World Cup in 2026 in mind. Head coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar too were involved in lengthy chats with the likes of Varun Chakravarthy, Harshit Rana and Sanju Samson The preparation for India's title defence has already begun. Speed sensationMayank Yadav , for example, has been told to focus more on T20s than the longer formats. Selectors have identified him as a potential trump card for the next T20 World Cup. This series, followed by the four T20Is in South Africa next month, will be a sort of audition.The plan is to create format-specific player pools, say those in the know. For the shortest format, it's about investing in players who are doing well in the IPL. The endeavour is to rid the players of confusion. There will be more players who are not seen as all-format prospects.Surya is now a statesman in T20 cricket and he has been given the clear mandate of building this team for the next T20 World Cup. This Bangladesh team may well be lacking in T20 abilities, but the Indian team management is looking for markers to judge its own players.Going by the emphatic win in the first T20I, there are going to be more players pushing the seniors in times to come.","Suryakumar Yadav is emerging as a capable leader since being appointed T20I captain in July.

Harman fit, but team needs to improve NRR vs

Sri Lanka

The Indian women's team's T20 World Cup campaign has not got off to an ideal start, and they have only themselves to blame. Among the pre-tournament favourites, Harmanpreet Kaur and Co's performance has been below par. Heading into their third match, coach Amol Muzumdar and his support team will be working overtime to correct course.India endured a mixed start, losing the opener to New Zealand by 58 runs and then managing to get past Pakistan with an unconvincing six-wicket win, which put them in a spot of bother. On Wednesday, they will take on Group A's bottom-placed Sri Lanka looking to shore up their net run rate (-1.217).The good news for Team India is that skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who had hurt her neck in the game against Pakistan, is fit for the clash against Sri Lanka. ""She (Harman) is doing fine and she will be fine for tomorrow,"" vice-captain Smriti Mandhana told reporters. Pooja Vastrakar , who missed the previous game due to a niggle, is uncertain for the game.The side's biggest concern, however, is the poor show of the batting unit. The explosive openers have failed to make an impact so far.Shafali Varma has struggled against spin, scoring just two against New Zealand and labouring to 32 against Pakistan.Similarly, Mandhana has had a disappointing start, with scores of 12 and 7 respectively. The team's Powerplay scores of 43/3 against New Zealand and 25/1 against Pakistan have been dismal as well.The onus will be on Mandhana to take the lead against Sri Lanka's spin-heavy attack. Although her record against Sri Lanka is not impressive, with only 379 runs from 19 innings, including two half-centuries, she must provide the team with a solid start in this crucial league match. The bowlers too are yet to come into their own.India boast a dominant 19/5 record against Sri Lanka but one of those defeats came recently in the Asia Cup final in July. While the desire for revenge can be a powerful motivator, it's important to note that unlike Sri Lanka, the Indian team hasn't played a match since then.The World Cup is not a tournament that allows for dress rehearsals and a loss to Sri Lanka could potentially end India's campaign, especially considering their upcoming match against formidable Australia.Sri Lanka, having suffered losses against Pakistan and Australia, will be eager to secure their first points. The Chamari Athapaththu-led side will look to capitalize on India's vulnerabilities and make a strong comeback.","India's T20 World Cup campaign has not got off to an ideal start.

NEW DELHI: Veteran New Zealand batter Kane Williamson will miss the start of the three-Test series against India due to a groin strain suffered during the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle. The injury requires a period of rehabilitation, delaying Williamson's departure to India.New Zealand selector Sam Wells confirmed the news, stating that the decision to rest and rehabilitate Williamson was made to avoid further aggravating the injury.""The advice we've received is that the best course of action is for Kane to rest and rehabilitate now rather than risk worsening the injury,"" Wells explained. ""We remain hopeful that if his recovery goes to plan, Kane will be available for the latter part of the tour.""In Williamson's absence, uncapped batter Mark Chapman has been called up as cover. Chapman, who averages 41.9 in first-class cricket with six centuries to his name, has become a regular in New Zealand's white-ball teams.Wells expressed confidence in Chapman’s ability to handle the conditions in India. ""We believe Mark is one of our best players of spin and has a proven track record in the subcontinent,"" said Wells.

He also bowled his quota of four overs, returning figures of 1/26.Former India fast bowler RP Singh , however, advised not to judge Pandya’s form based solely on this match. ""Using a performance against Bangladesh to judge a player's form is not right,"" Singh said in his role as an expert for Jio Cinema and Sports 18.He pointed out that Bangladesh is not currently playing at their best.Singh acknowledged Pandya's capabilities but suggested that stronger opponents would be a better measure of his form. ""Hardik did well; he is capable of doing things like that. But using a performance against this team as a criterion, in my opinion, is not right. Do that maybe against a better team or in a better competition,"" he added.Pandya’s notable performance came in the 12th over when he hit a ramp shot for a boundary followed by another boundary and then a six off consecutive balls from Taskin Ahmed .

How the result helps Team India

The six-time Women's T20 World Cup champions Australia triumphed over their neighbours New Zealand in every aspect of the game on Tuesday, securing a dominant 60-run victory that solidified their position at the top of Group A.Australia 's top order laid the foundation for this win with an aggressive batting performance after winning the toss. Alyssa Healy (26 off 20), Beth Mooney (40 off 32), Ellyse Perry (30 off 24), and Phoebe Litchfield (18 off 18) all contributed significantly, setting New Zealand a target of 149 runs to chase in Sharjah.New Zealand struggled throughout their innings, ultimately succumbing to a stellar bowling display from the defending champions. Megan Schutt delivered exceptional figures of 3/3 from 3.2 overs, while Sophie Molineux (2/15) and Annabel Sutherland (3/21) also shone with the ball.The defeat could have been even more pronounced had it not been for Melie Kerr, who made a notable impact with her inspired fielding, taking 4/26 and executing an outstanding catch. She also top-scored for her team with 29 runs.During the contest, Schutt made history by bowling Georgia Plimmer for 4 in the third over, becoming the leading wicket-taker in Women’s T20 World Cup history.The nature of this result could significantly influence the final standings in Group A, as New Zealand faced a considerable setback in their net run rate (-0.050).Australia have two wins in two matches and could effectively seal their place in the semi-finals with victory over Pakistan next up.It is now up to three teams - Pakistan, New Zealand and India - to fill the other spot from the group. India had been in a poor place after their defeat to New Zealand and a laboured win over Pakistan. But with White Ferns not just dropping points but doing so in a one-sided affair, it opens the door for India and Pakistan.India’s loss to New Zealand had put them in a precarious position immediately, although they secured points with a victory over Pakistan.To enhance their chances, Harmanpreet Kaur-led India will likely need at least one more win, possibly two, and a favourable shift in net run rate.","Australia beat New Zealand by 60 runs in ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024 match in Sharjah.

Despite two and a half days being washed out due to persistent rain, the hosts still managed to secure a comfortable seven-wicket victory on the final day.Former England skipper Michael Vaughan sparked controversy when he commented on India's aggressive batting, noting, ""I see India are playing Bazball .""Vaughan's comment, posted on X (formerly Twitter), referenced England's ultra-aggressive approach under coach Brendon McCullum, dubbed ""Bazball.""In his latest column for The Hindu, Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar took a sharp dig at certain former experts, without naming anyone, suggesting that the old powers are eager to claim credit for India's current approach.""Sadly, while the batting was thrilling and refreshing, the names given to the approach were the same old, same old. Just as any scandal is now called this-gate or that-gate after the Watergate scandal over 50 years ago in the United States of America, this Indian batting approach was labelled this-ball and that-ball after the term ""Bazball"" was coined for the England team's batting attitude. It was called this because ""Baz"" is the nickname of their coach, Brendon McCullum from New Zealand, who batted exactly as his team is doing - throwing caution to the winds in an attempt to score runs.""Sunil Gavaskar praised the Indian captain Rohit Sharma for his transformative impact on the team's playing style.""While one paper called the Indian batting ""Bossball"" because the captain or ""boss"" of the team, Rohit, had shown the way, some from the old powers referred to it as ""Gamball"" after the Indian coach, Gautam Gambhir . While the England batting approach changed completely under the new regime of Ben Stokes and McCullum, we have seen over the last couple of years that Rohit has been batting like this and encouraging his team to do so as well,"" he said.""Gambhir has only been coaching for a couple of months, so attributing this approach to him is foot-licking of the highest quality. Gambhir himself hardly ever batted in this fashion like McCullum used to do. If any credit is due, it is solely to Rohit and nobody else,"" he added.""Instead of using the words this-ball or that-ball, I would suggest using the skipper's first name, Rohit, and term it the ""Gohit"" approach. Hopefully, brainier people will come up with a trendier name for this rather than the lazy option of calling it after ""Bazball,"" Gavaskar further added.","Former England skipper Michael Vaughan sparked controversy when he commented on India's aggressive batting.

Impressed with India's dominating T20I win on Sunday, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali also wondered what happened to the Bangladesh team that registered a historic Test series win in Pakistan before travelling to India.""Is this the same Bangladesh team that whitewashed Pakistan (2-0)? You saw in the Test matches (against India). They lost the first one and then were defeated in virtually two days, even the rain could not save them,"" said the 53-year-old Basit.India hammered Bangladesh by 280 runs in the Chennai Test and then won in Kanpur by seven wickets, despite two days getting washed out by rain, to sweep the series 2-0.Basit was particularly in awe of India's back-up strength, saying the team of young Indian Premier League (IPL) stars led by Suryakumar Yadav made Bangladesh look like an ""appetizer"".""India have changed cricket (with their dominance). Bangladesh is just an appetizer (for them),"" said Basit.The T20I retirement of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja has thrown open spots in the playing XI.""Yeh IPL eleven hai, India ki team nahi hai,"" said Basit, before pointing at the notable absentees from India's playing eleven in the match atGwalior . ""There was no (Yashasvi) Jaiswal, no (Shubman) Gill, no Axar Patel, no Rishabh Pant, no (Shreyas) Iyer; (Ravi) Bishnoi did not play. And still they hammered them in just 11-something overs, finishing with a six from (Hardik) Pandya.""India awarded two debut caps for the match, with fast bowler Mayank Yadav and all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy making their first international appearance.After bowling out Bangladesh for 127, India raced home in 11.5 overs for a seven-wicket win to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Arshdeep Singh (3 for 14) and Varun Chakravarthy (3 for 31) took three wickets each, while Hardik top-scored for the hosts with his stroke-filled 39 off 16 balls, including 5 fours and 2 sixes.""Why did Suryakumar Yadav opt to bowl after winning the toss?"" Basit wondered. ""They should have batted on that 200-run flat track. I don't think they will make that mistake in the second match.""Basit was happy to see Mayank sending the speed gun into an overdrive and hoped he remains fit for India's tour of Australia. The speedster began his stint in the international arena with a maiden over while bowling at top speed.""There were two debuts, but it was a dream debut for Mayank Yadav. The first over was a maiden, including a 149.8 kmph delivery. He could not bowl in the high 150kmph only because he has just recovered from an injury,"" said Basit""Darr baithaya usne aaj (he sent down a scare). Batsmen were always on the back foot. I pray that this kid remains fit and goes on the Australia tour.""Mayank, (Mohammed) Shami, (Jasprit) Bumrah, (Mohammed) Siraj -- four pacers.

""I don't think that kind of match happened again."" These were the words of Dhanraj Pillay when a chat in 2020 around the India-Pakistan rivalry took him back to Amstelveen in 2003. Maybe, if allowed to pick from among India's most famous wins since the turn of the century against any nation, the former captain will now surely go with the bronze medal win at Tokyo Olympics instead of that Champions trophy match 21 summers ago.Down 2-4 in the good old 70-minute match against a team that had Rehan Butt flying down the flanks and Sohail Abbas shooting rockets off his flicks, India staged a comeback for the ages in 23 minutes of magic.The backstory for Pillay personally had a narrative of revenge from a year ago, when the Pakistan players celebrated in India captain's face following their 4-3 win in the third-place match in the previous edition of the Champions Trophy.To see his team scoring five goals in 23 minutes a year later to come back from the dead and win made the revenge for Pillay a lot sweeter.The heroes of the day for India were Jugarj Singh, Gagan Ajit Singh and Deepak Thakur , who scored two goals each. But it was Pakistan who took a 2-0 lead in the first 20 minutes with Butt and Muhammad Nadeem scoring. Jugraj scored India's first goal through a penalty corner four minutes later, but Mudassar Ali restored the two-goal cushion for Pakistan by making it 3-1.(Screen Grab: FIH)India got another penalty corner just before half-time, and Jugraj once again cut Pakistan's lead to one goal with his second strike.The teams went in at half-time with Pakistan leading 3-2.Drag-flick legend Sohail Abbas got on the scoresheet in the 42nd minute by finding the net on a penalty corner to make it 4-2.With 28 minutes left on the clock, India needed a goal to stay in the match and put pressure back on Pakistan. They found not just one but five goals.Indian forwards, Gagan in the centre, Thakur on the left and Prabhjot on the right, attacked the Pakistan goal like birds swooping on its prey.In a passage of four minutes between the 50th and the 54th, Thakur and Prabhjot scored to make it 4-4. The comeback stunned Pakistan who had no answer to India's full-press.Six minutes later, between the 60th and 65th, the trio of Indian strikers took life out of Pakistan defence that had no answer to their speed and Pillay's brilliant feeding from the centre.The legend let the young Indian stars take centrestage, and they didn't disappoint.Gagan scored two goals in the 60th and 62nd minute to make it 6-4 and Thakur sealed it at 7-4 in the 65th, as all Pakistan efforts of a comeback in the last five minutes were thwarted by India.The match stands as one of the most epic comebacks ever scripted in India vs Pakistan hockey history.","India staged a comeback for the ages in 23 minutes of magic.

CHENNAI: In 2017, when Damandeep Singh decided to move to Canada to join his family, he gave his son Harvansh Singh a choice - relocate with him and build a career in Canadian cricket or stay back in India to chase his dream. Without hesitation, Harvansh chose to remain in India, driven by passion to represent the country at the highest level.Today, that bold decision seems rewarded a s Harvansh, representing the Indian U-19 side, scored a remarkable century (117, 143b; 7x4, 6x6) in the second Youth Test against Australia U-19 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Tuesday.His century powered India's innings to a strong 492 before Australia skipper Oliver Peake (62 batting, 113b; 8x4, 1x6) showed his skills to revive his team after an early jolt and finish the day at 142-3.Upon reaching the milestone, Harvansh couldn't hold back his excitement. He let out a huge roar, turned to his father in the stands and offered him a bow - a gesture to the sacrifices they had made together. Then the 17-year-old wicketkeeper-batter from Gandhidham went on to do a thigh-five.Damandeep, a truck driver in Canada, was beaming with joy and was holding the Indian flag throughout.Speaking to TOI, he said: ""It's our family's dream to play for the country, unfortunately, we (my brothers and I) couldn't do it. So, we are proud of him (Harvansh). Our neighbours, relatives, all of them tell him that 'you are fulfilling our dreams'. Even his younger sister is learning cricket; she is also a wicketkeeper.""Harvansh walked onto the field on Tuesday with an overnight score of seven alongside captain Soham Patwardhan (61, 124b; 6x4). While the skipper fell to an inswinger from Oliver Patterson in the third over of the day, Harvansh adopted a bold template and adeptly tackled both spinners and pacers, using a variety of shots to keep the visitors at bay.He was toying with the Australian bowlers, by smartly cutting, pulling and driving the ball with much élan. A huge fan of Yuvraj Singh , Harvansh hit six sixes, most of them over the mid-wicket and long-on region, reminiscent of his idol.Harvansh kept losing partners at the other end but quietly went about his business. He later shared a 90-run partnership with Anmoljeet Singh for the last wicket, before Riley Kingsell dismissed him.

I just try to enjoy and stay in the present, enjoy the highs and lows that is my focus,"" he said on Tuesday.Last month, he played the entire Duleep Trophy . It has been a while since he played these many first-class matches on the bounce. ""Playing in different formats teaches a player a lot. Red-ball cricket teaches you patience.

NEW DELHI: After Mayank Yadav took 1-21 on his T20I debut at Gwalior, former India left-arm pacer RP Singh believes the tearaway pacer fulfilled the criteria for which he was selected in the series against Bangladesh and hopes to witness more impactful performances from him.One of the main attractions in India’s ongoing T20I series against Bangladesh was how Mayank would fare.In IPL 2024, Mayank left a lasting impression on everyone by going for speeds above 150kmph, while showing flawless precision in his lines and lengths.He won the Player-of-the-Match award in his first two games for Lucknow Super Giants , but an abdominal strain soon sidelined him. Mayank then spent time at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru to recover and become match-fit by bowling eight to ten overs every day.During his debut against Bangladesh in Gwalior, he bowled a maiden over and claimed his first international wicket in Mahmudullah. Wednesday’s second T20I between India and Bangladesh at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi will mark the grand homecoming of Mayank, a product of the iconic Sonnet Club.“When Mayank bowled a maiden in his first over of international cricket, it showed he had an idea about his accuracy, which he monitored well, and how important it was along with pace. In the first match, there are a lot of butterflies, ifs, and buts, questions in the mind of a debutant.”“So, I didn’t expect that he would have a very high performance. The purpose for which he was picked for this series, he ticked off that criteria. He first bowled with pace and then showed some accuracy in the first match. But there is still a lot to be improved upon, in terms of performances and creating a lot of impact. Overall, his first match performance was decent, according to me,” said Singh, an expert with JioCinema & Sports18, to IANS in a virtual interaction.The availability of Mohammed Shami for the all-important Border-Gavaskar Trophy is still uncertain, and Singh is of the opinion that Akash Deep will be the next preferred fast-bowling option for India, while also citing Mayank’s need to gain more experience in playing red-ball cricket domestically.“Aakash Deep is a better choice for the Test series in Australia. His bowling style suits him better for the seam-up deliveries in Australia. Mayank has pace, and one aspect of pace bowling is that it should be fast. There are many variations and skills that he needs to develop slowly.”“Right now, Mayank is in the developing phase. There is a lot of bowling load in a Test match. Plus, there is a need for a lot of skills and patience in playing the longer format. But for that, there is still time. There is still time for him to play domestic cricket, which Aakash Deep and Mohammad Shami have played a lot.”Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh ’s performance, where he took 3-14 and struck twice in Power-play, helped India secure a seven-wicket victory in Gwalior. Singh believes it will take more time for Arshdeep to play Test cricket in the future, citing his skills being more proficient in white-ball games.“I still feel that there is not much difference in the areas of red-ball and white-ball bowling in the death overs. If the number of variations increases in white-ball cricket, then your patience increases in red-ball cricket. Arshdeep has the skill and can move the ball both ways. He has variations that are more suitable for a shorter white-ball format. I can see a little more time to be taken in him playing Test cricket.”“It is not that he has any shortcomings. His pace is good, he has variations, and his lengths are good. But despite that, the feeling that he gives is that he is an ideal bowler for white-ball games. He is a left-arm pacer and gets wickets all the time. So I feel that his focus should be on white-ball cricket for a year and a half, and after that, Arshdeep may play Test cricket.”The absence of Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, and Jasprit Bumrah from the T20I series means the Suryakumar Yadav-led side has a lot of fresh faces.Additionally, a significant number of these young players offer all-round skills, which Singh thinks is a conscious strategy by the Indian team to establish a larger pool of candidates for defending the T20 World Cup title on home turf in 2026.“The aspect of developing a pool of players with an eye for the 2026 T20 World Cup title defence is very much visible here. With head coach Gautam Gambhir and skipper Suryakumar Yadav at the helm, one can really see they are forming a bench of players, who did well in the IPL and had impactful performances in the domestic circuit.”“When you see players like Riyan Parag and Abhishek Sharma there, one gets to understand that they are creating players to fill the gaps and ensure a smooth transition in the shortest format after the senior players have left. I believe they are on the right track to achieve it.”“I really believe that the captain, coaches and selectors must have made a four-year plan of drafting more all-rounders into the Indian team in the shortest format. Like, impact player rule exists only in the IPL, while there is no such ruling in international cricket.”“Whereas in international cricket, the Indian team needs tons of all-round options. More all-rounders in the Indian set-up means the team balance becomes better and the effort for making that happen is going well at the moment,” signed off Singh.",Mayank Yadav took 1-21 on his T20I debut against Bangladesh. RP Singh believes the tearaway pacer fulfilled the criteria for which he was selected. Singh believes it will take more time for Arshdeep to play Test cricket in the future.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114052757,imgsize-26062,width-400,resizemode-4/114052757.jpg"

Naqvi also pointed out that the preparations for the tournament are going as planned.“The Indian team should come. I don’t see them cancel or postpone coming here and we are confident we will host all the teams in the Champions Trophy in Pakistan,” Naqvi had said.Last year, Pakistan was the official host of the Asia Cup but the continental tournament was eventually hosted jointly with India matches taking place in Sri Lanka.The BCCI had then cited a denial of permission by the Indian government as the reason not to tour Pakistan.India last played a bilateral series with Pakistan back in 2012-13 and since then the two countries have only met at global events.",The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy Final could be shifted from Lahore to Dubai if India qualify for the summit clash of the marquee event.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona legend Andrés Iniesta officially announced his retirement from professional football on October 7, 2024, marking the end of a truly remarkable career that spanned over two decades.The 40-year-old midfielder leaves behind a legacy filled with iconic moments, both at the club and international levels, cementing his status as one of the greatest footballers of all time.From leading Barcelona to domestic and European glory to inspiring Spain’s ""golden generation"", Iniesta’s career was defined by his elegance, creativity, and unshakable composure on the field.Here are the top five moments that define his extraordinary career:Iniesta’s crowning moment came on July 11, 2010, when he scored the winning goal in the FIFA World Cup final against the Netherlands. In the 116th minute of extra time, Iniesta latched onto a pass from Cesc Fàbregas, kept his calm, and fired the ball past Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg.This goal secured Spain’s first-ever World Cup trophy, etching Iniesta’s name in football history. His iconic celebration, removing his shirt to reveal a tribute to his late friend Dani Jarque, added an emotional depth to the unforgettable moment.Barcelona’s path to the 2009 UEFA Champions League final seemed all but over in the dying moments of the semi-final against Chelsea. Trailing 1-0 on the night, and with a mountain to climb, Iniesta delivered a stunning last-minute equalizer from outside the box, sending Barcelona through on away goals.That goal, a perfect example of his big-game mentality, paved the way for Barcelona’s treble-winning season and their eventual Champions League triumph against Manchester United Iniesta’s partnership with Lionel Messi was one of the most prolific and celebrated in football history, and their chemistry was on full display in the 2015 Champions League final.Iniesta orchestrated Barcelona's attack from midfield and delivered a pinpoint assist for Ivan Rakitić’s opening goal just minutes into the game against Juventus.Barcelona went on to win 3-1, securing their fifth Champions League title and Iniesta’s fourth.Iniesta was often at his best in the most intense matches, and none come bigger than El Clásico. In November 2015, Barcelona demolished Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabéu, and Iniesta was the heart of it all.He scored a thunderous goal and provided a masterclass in midfield control, with even Madrid fans giving him a standing ovation. His performance that night remains one of the finest displays ever seen in football's fiercest rivalry.In May 2018, Iniesta bid an emotional farewell to Barcelona after 22 years with the club. His final appearance at Camp Nou, a 1-0 victory over Real Sociedad, was a tearful moment for both the player and the fans.As he left the pitch, the entire stadium rose to applaud the departing legend, and his teammates formed a guard of honour. The image of Iniesta sitting alone on the field after the game, soaking in the atmosphere, is etched into the memories of Barcelona fans worldwide.Lionel Messi, one of Iniesta’s closest friends and long-time teammates, paid a heartfelt tribute to the retiring legend.Messi said, “One of the team-mates with the most magic and of the one's I enjoyed playing together the most. Andres Iniesta, the ball will miss you and so will we! I wish you the best, always. You are a phenomenon.”","Andrés Iniesta announced his retirement from professional football on October 7, 2024.

Messi pays tribute

Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta announced his retirement from professional football on Monday (7 October), putting an end to his more than two-decade-long career. The Spaniard confirmed the news on social media after hinting at the decision last week saying, ""COMING SOON 8/10/24"". He wore the numbers 8 and 24 during his 18-year tenure with the Spanish club.In an illustrious club career, Iniesta made 674 appearances for Barcelona, in which he scored 57 goals and provided 135 assists, during which he won four Champions Leagues, three FIFA Club World Cups, nine League tiles, three European Super Cups, six Copa del Reys and seven Spanish Super Cups.Iniesta was equal lethal for the Spanish national team as he was one of the pillars of a historic La Roja side that is dubbed as the country's golden generation.Iniesta scored a goal in extra-time of the 2010 World Cup Final against the Netherlands, which led Spain to their first and only FIFA World Cup trophy. He was also in the side that lifted the 2012 UEFA European Championships.The 40-year-old midfielder recently attended an event in Spain where he hinted that his future may lie in coaching as he hopes to return to the club where he became a legend.Since leaving Camp Nou in the summer of 2018, Iniesta embarked on spells withVissel Kobe and Emirates Club. Lionel Messi paid tribute to his former teammate Iniesta as his fellow World Cup winner heads into retirement at the age of 40.Eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi has responded to that news by saying in a post of his own: “One of the team-mates with the most magic and of the one's I enjoyed playing together the most. Andres Iniesta, the ball will miss you and so will we! I wish you the best, always. You are a phenomenon.”There had been talk of Iniesta and Messi teaming up once again at Inter Miami – as he joined the group of former Barcelona stars in Major League Soccer – but no deal came through.","Andres Iniesta retires from professional football after 18-year career with Barcelona. Iniesta won four Champions Leagues, three FIFA Club World Cups, nine League tiles, three European Super Cups, six Copa del Reys and seven Spanish Super Cups.

Manchester City and Premier League triumph in financial fairness rules dispute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/manchester-city-and-premier-league-triumph-in-financial-fairness-rules-dispute/articleshow/114029905.cms,"Manchester City (Reuters Photo)

Manchester City and the English Premier League both claimed victory on Monday after one of the league's key regulations relating to financial fairness was challenged. Four-time defending champion City and the league said they ""welcomed"" the findings of an arbitration panel . City said the regulations were found to be ""unlawful"" and the league ""abused its dominant position.""The league said the tribunal found its Associated Party Transaction ( APT ) rules to be ""necessary"" and ""rejected the majority of Manchester City's challenges.""APT rules are designed to ensure fair market value is applied to commercial deals with organizations closely aligned to club owners and safeguard the ""competitive balance"" of the world's most popular soccer league.They are intended to prevent deals such as sponsorships from being artificially inflated, which could undermine the league's Profitability and Sustainability Rules .City said in a statement, ""The club has succeeded with its claim: The Associated Party Transaction rules have been found to be unlawful and the Premier League's decisions on two specific MCFC sponsorship transactions have been set aside.""City added the tribunal found the rules to be ""structurally unfair"" and the league was ""specifically unfair"" in applying them to the Abu Dhabi-backed club.One key finding in City's favor was that shareholder loans - which could be offered at lower or no interest rates - should not be excluded from APT rules.Of the sponsorship deals that City said were set aside following the tribunal, the league said its assessment of whether they represented fair market value had not been found to be unreasonable.The league said a ""small number of discrete elements of the rules"" did not ""comply with competition and public law requirements,"" but added, ""The tribunal upheld the need for the APT system as a whole and rejected the majority of Manchester City's challenges. Moreover, the tribunal found that the rules are necessary in order for the league's financial controls to be effective.""In a separate case, City faces more than 100 charges of alleged financial breaches from the league.

KOLKATA: Beginning its journey with eight teams 11 summers ago, Indian Super League (ISL) has gradually expanded to 13 teams over these seasons.After being left out of the country's new top-tier ahead of the erstwhile premier division I-League, Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan and East Bengal were included into ISL at the start of the 2019-20 season. Then, honouring the AFC-AIFF envisaged future roadmap for Indian football, I-League champions Punjab FC were promoted to ISL last season.Keeping up with the promise, Kolkata giants Mohammedan Sporting Club - as the current I-League winners - were also added to the lot before the start of the ongoing 2024-25 season. However, despite being the country's highest level of competitive football, ISL is yet to achieve the desired level of fan following among the supporters of the participating clubs.However, Bhaichung Bhutia , the former India captain and one of the few legends to play the game in the country, believes that Mohammedan SC 's presence will add to the intensity of the Kolkata derbies , which in turn will make Indian football more exciting for the fans. The Sikkimese Sniper – as Bhutia was famously known in his playing days, also hopes that the huge fan-bases that come along with the teams like MSC will result in a wider popularity of ISL.""It's great for teams with a huge fan base such as Mohammedan SC to come into the ISL. I have always advocated for Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, and Mohammedan SC for coming into the ISL, because these are the teams that have huge passionate fans across India. To make the ISL competitive and interesting, you need those derbies and passionate fans to be there,"" Bhutia said in an exclusive interview shared with TOI.With talismanic India skipper and striker Sunil Chhetri hanging up his boots four months ago, Bhutia had a straightforward message for the youngsters who are shouldering the responsibilities of the Indian team under the stewardship of new head coach Manolo Marquez.""You need to be consistent with the national team. You need to start delivering, and it's teamwork. Obviously, you will have great coaches, but as a player there should be consistency in performances, and you need to keep working hard,"" Bhutia added.Asked to pick his favourite teams for the season, Bhutia said, ""It's difficult to predict the favourites for the title. Mohun Bagan (Super Giant) have put in a lot of budget to make a great team. Mumbai City FC, who didn't have a great Durand Cup, are a team that will always have a good side. FC Goa have been consistent throughout the years. I think these are the few teams that are going to be favourites for this season.""Over the years, ISL has moved on from its novelty factor as global stars - well past their prime - have stopped coming to India to join a developing league for a season or two. But Bhutia personally still loves to go down the lane when asked about his memorable moments from the league.""My best memory of the ISL will always be the first year, with some of the greatest footballers around the world coming and playing for us. In the first season, you had players like (Alessandro) Del Piero, Nicolas Anelka, Robert Pires, and a lot of big stars playing with our own local players!"" he said before signing off.",Bhaichung Bhutia believes Mohammedan SC will add to the intensity of the Kolkata derbies.

What is missing is trying to get a good win under my belt,"" said the Greek, acknowledging his uneven recent form.""In the past, I might have said some mean stuff about (Medvedev's) game, but... I think I was completely wrong in that. There's a lot of interesting things in his game that he brings that are very different from other players.""World number 10 Grigor Dimitrov is through after beating Australia's Alexei Popyrin 7-6 (7/5), 6-2.The Bulgarian will play Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, who already ended one top 10 player's hopes when he sent Russia's Andrey Rublev home last week.","Novak Djokovic beats Flavio Cobolli 6-1, 6-2 to reach last 16 of Shanghai Masters.

Tennis, a sport steeped in history and tradition, has produced some of the most remarkable athletes and extraordinary feats. While numerous records have been set and broken over the years, a few stand out as nearly unbeatable due to the sheer dominance and consistency required to achieve them.Here are the top five near-unbeatable records in tennis history that might never be surpassed.Rafael Nadal's dominance on the clay courts of Roland Garros is a story of unrivaled excellence. Nadal has clinched the French Open title an astounding 14 times, making it the most titles ever won by a single player at one Grand Slam tournament. Known as the ""King of Clay,"" Nadal's mastery of the surface is unmatched, as he has shown both skill and stamina year after year.Wimbledon, the oldest and most prestigious tennis tournament, has seen countless legends, but none quite like Martina Navratilova. Between 1978 and 1990, Navratilova secured nine singles titles at Wimbledon, the most by any player, male or female, in history. Her dominance on grass courts was unparalleled, and her ability to adapt and evolve her game over 12 years ensured her place as the queen of Wimbledon.In 1988, Steffi Graf accomplished a feat that no other player, male or female, has ever replicated: the Calendar Golden Slam. That year, she won all four Grand Slam titles (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) and capped it off with a gold medal at the Seoul Olympics. This achievement, known as the ""Calendar Golden Slam,"" remains a singular milestone in tennis history.Roger Federer's 237 consecutive weeks at world No. 1 is one of the most impressive records in tennis. From February 2004 to August 2008, Federer held onto the top spot for nearly five years, a period of unparalleled consistency and dominance. No other player, past or present, has managed to maintain such a stranglehold on the No. 1 ranking for such an extended time.Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles remains the highest tally in tennis history for 50 years, till Novak Djokovic matched it in 2023. Achieved between 1960 and 1973, Court dominated across all surfaces, winning multiple titles at each Grand Slam event. Her versatility and consistent excellence set a benchmark that has proven incredibly difficult for subsequent generations to match.Novak Djokovic’s achievement of winning 24 Grand Slam singles titles is a monumental feat in tennis history. Spanning from his first title at the Australian Open in 2008 to his most recent at the 2023 US Open, Djokovic has consistently dominated across all surfaces and venues. His record not only cements his status as one of the greatest players in tennis but also highlights his unmatched adaptability and resilience over nearly two decades.",Roger Federer's 237 consecutive weeks at world No. 1 is one of the most impressive records in tennis. Rafael Nadal has clinched the French Open title an astounding 14 times. Steffi Graf won all four Grand Slam titles in 1988. Margaret Court's 24 Grand Slam singles titles remains the highest tally in tennis history for 50 years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114039463,imgsize-57604,width-400,resizemode-4/114039463.jpg"

Show Glimpses Of Potential

Maaya steadily climbs ladder

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu has always been a powerhouse of Indian tennis , producing legendary players who have left a lasting impact. The father-son duo of Ramanathan and Ramesh Krishnan, along with the legendary Amritraj brothers led by Vijay, have produced some of India's greatest tennis moments.It's quite a legacy to live up to and now there are two more talented teenagers from the state who seem to have the promise to keep the flag flying.Rethin Pranav and Maaya Revathi have been the talk of the city tennis circuit over last week during the course of the Fenesta National Championships in New Delhi.While 17-year-old Rethin won the men's singles title, Maaya, all of 15, fell short in the title round after a brilliant run through the week.The National Championships title was not the only high for Rethin. The Chennai boy had a good start to the season, reaching the top-100 in the world junior rankings. He then went on to play in his maiden Grand Slam at the US Open juniors . Although he lost in the second qualifying round, it was a moment to cherish for him.""This was a good season as I got to compete in the US Open. The level of play was good and I had to adapt physically and mentally. I trained under Somdev Devvarman for two weeks in India and had learnt a lot from him. He helped me improve my stroke play and footwork and I could feel the changes in my game style. He is a good mentor on and off the court,"" Rethin told TOI.Apart from competing in the US Open juniors, Rethin spent time in New York watching top players in action. ""I got to watch the match between Taylor Fritz and Casper Ruud and it was an amazing experience. The speed of the match was very high and you do not get to see this everywhere. A few learnings were the body language that they maintained throughout the match and the way they both fought back after losing a point,"" Rethin said.With the new season is not far away, Rethin is slowly looking to transition to the senior level and compete in ITF tournaments .Like Rethin, Maaya had a memorable run this season as she competed in her first Grand Slam at the Australian Open juniors. She also went on to attain her career-best rank of 135 and was one of the two Indian players to receive Grand Slam Grants.""Participating in the Grand Slam was different as the level of competition was high and I got to know the level of tennis. This taught me where I have to work on to get better. I got a lot of exposure by playing against different players across all conditions in the ITF junior competitions. I got to know a lot of people on the tennis circuit and learnt something from each one of them,"" Maaya said.Maaya, who looks up to Serena Williams , has been training under coach Manoj Kumar for the past four years in Coimbatore. Her aim is to compete in all the Grand Slams next year. ""I will be participating in higher grade (J200 and higher) junior tournaments in the upcoming months and will slowly look to play in the senior category.""As they continue to climb the ladder, there is a sense of anticipation about their potential and it's on the duo to keep it going.","Rethin Pranav and Maaya Revathi have been the talk of the city tennis circuit. Rethin won the men's singles title at the Fenesta National Championships in New Delhi. Maaya, all of 15, fell short in the title round after a brilliant run through the week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114039684,imgsize-112150,width-400,resizemode-4/114039684.jpg"
India drawn against Togo in Davis Cup World Group I Play-offs next year; AITA says it's home tie,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/india-drawn-against-togo-in-davis-cup-world-group-i-play-offs-next-year-aita-says-its-home-tie/articleshow/114019157.cms,"(AP Photo)

LONDON: India will play against Togo in the Davis Cup World Group I Play-offs to be held between January 31 and February 2 next year, according to the draw conducted by the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) on Monday.The draw, which includes both World Group I and II play-offs, will see 52 nations compete in 26 home-and-away ties around the globe from either January 31-February 1 or February 1-2.World Group I play-offs will feature 26 countries while another 26 will compete in World Group II play-offs.India will feature in the World Group I Play-offs with the dates to be determined by the host nation.An official of the All India Tennis Association ( AITA ) told PTI that its team will play at home.""It will be a home tie for our team,"" the official said.India had beaten Pakistan 4-0 in the 2024 play-offs in February in Islamabad to qualify for the World Group I. However, the Indian team lost to Sweden in Stockholm in September to drop down to Group I play-offs again for the 2025 edition.According to the official Davis Cup website, the choice of ground for the tie between India and Togo will be decided by lot at a later stage.Under the competition format, if the nations competing against each other have never previously met, last time met before 1970, or if they last faced each other at a neutral venue, then the choice of ground is decided by lot.India is yet to win the Davis Cup, having finished runner-up three times -- 1966, 1974 and 1987.The revised Davis Cup structure for the 2025 season has required some nations to play at a higher level than would have been the case in the previous format.Two nations which lost World Group II ties in September -- and would have competed in the 2025 World Group II play-offs -- will compete in the World Group I play-offs, the ITF said.Four nations which did not win promotion from regional Group III events -- and would not have played again until the 2025 Group III events -- will now contest the World Group II pay-offs next year.Winning nations from the 2025 World Group I play-offs will compete in World Group I ties in September alongside the losing nations from the 2025 Qualifiers first round.Losing nations from the 2025 World Group I play-offs and winning nations from the World Group II play-offs will compete in World Group II ties in September, the ITF added.",India will play against Togo in the Davis Cup World Group I Play-offs next year.

AITA rot leaves Indian tennis on the brink in singles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/aita-rot-leaves-indian-tennis-on-the-brink-in-singles/articleshow/113978511.cms,"How did we get here?"" Vijay Amritraj wasn't looking at a map or eying a landmark. The tennis legend was merely marking the steps to oblivion. Amritraj was trying to wrap his head around the fact that India only had one player in the top-250 of the ATP and WTA rankings - Sumit Nagal at No. 83. This has been the case for over 12 months for the men.The 70-year-old pressed, ""How come this isn't spoken about enough?"" India has 10 doubles p layers in the top-150 of the individual doubles ranking, despite shrinking draw sizes.""No kid picks up a tennis racket to play doubles, you play for singles,"" Amritraj said.Amritraj, who was president of the ATP Player Council from 1989 through to 1992 and again in 1994, cautioned that this isn't singles versus doubles, a fight India can ill afford.Still, questions must be asked. Where are India's singles players? What are the programmes we have supporting them?The All India Tennis Association (AITA) claimed to have 'conducted' 829 tournaments in 2023 but the AITA had little to show by way of numbers, like players coming out of this ostensibly robust system.AITA's tournament calendar - across age-groups - is conducted by the 28 member state associations, some clubs and even by parents desperate for their children to get match practice. The tournament structure clearly doesn't come together as a platform to launch Indians on international Tours -juniors or pros. Just a bunch of well-meaning people trying to shore up the game. Rohan Bopanna 's 'Doubles Dream of India', a programme that supports doubles specialists, has kept Indian tennis on the world map. Hardly surprising, then, that India's non-playing Davis Cup captain Rohit Rajpal played an unranked doubles player in a live singles rubber in a World Group 1 tie in Stockholm last month. The visitors, without Nagal, who was injured, failed to win a set.Somdev Devvarman who topped at No. 62 in the rankings in 2011, and Purav Raja, a doubles specialist, weren't amused. The same could be said of a lot of players, but these two decided to take the bull by the horns, taking the AITA to court for violation of the Sports Code.The players, however, haven't always been united. Nobody knows this better than AITA, who have made good use of the situation in the past - Krishnans and Amritrajs; Paes and Bhupathi. Divide and rule. It will be interesting to see what the nomenclature would read like this time as another set of players have been in talks with AITA, educating themselves on opportunity in administration.",India only has one player in the top-250 of the ATP and WTA rankings.

Gutsy Vaidehi reclaims National tennis women’s crown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/gutsy-vaidehi-reclaims-national-tennis-womens-crown/articleshow/113970465.cms,"Gujarat's Vaidehi Chaudhari with the women's singles winner's trophy at the Fenesta Open National tennis championship in New Delhi on Saturday.

All the buzz through the week had been around her 15-year-old rival, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , but it made little difference to Vaidehi Chaudhari .The 24-year-old from Gujarat, who hadn’t dropped a set the whole week, maintained the clean slate by taming Maaya 6-3, 6-3 to reclaim the women’s singles title at the Fenesta Open National tennis championship in New Delhi on Saturday.“It was a really good match. I was playing a young girl. I had pressure as I was the top seed here, and had won the title before also. She (Maaya) had nothing to lose,” said Vaidehi, referring to her success in the tournament in 2022.She had also been runner-up to Shrivalli Rashmikaa last year, making it “three finals in a row”.Tamil Nadu’s 17-year-old Rethin Pranav claimed the men’s singles title, overcoming Nitin Kumar Sinha of Railways 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 for his maiden championship.Maharashtra’s Prisha Shinde clinched the Under-18 girls’ trophy, fighting back from 2-5 in the second set to beat Tamil Nadu’s Diya Ramesh 1-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in a two-hour long final.Aradhya Kshitij of Karnataka lifted the boys’ title with a 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 win over Manipur’s second seed Shanker Heisnam.The women’s final lasted an hour and 35 minutes, but it could have been even shorter. Vaidehi was up 5-0 in the second set when Maaya fought back to make it 3-5 before the Indian Billie Jean King Cup player nipped the late challenge from her rival.“I started cramping at 5-0. I was sick, was having cold and fever the last three days,” revealed Vaidehi.The title caps a fine run in the past few months for Vaidehi, starting with the $25,000 title in Chinese Taipei in June and followed by a semifinal in Kazakhstan and another final and a semifinal in Thailand.Despite the progress on court, it has been a struggle for Vaidehi to improve her tennis finances.“I was travelling alone in Taipei, and it was really hot out there. I played really well, I beat two players ranked higher than me. I was down 0-6, 0-3 in the second round, but came back strongly. In the final, I was again first set down. It’s the biggest title of my career so far,” she said.“The challenge for me is, being a woman, I cannot travel alone to some places (tournament venues) because they are not safe. If I take sponsorship, then I can have someone to travel with me,” said Vaidehi, who has her own travelling expenses covered by the Gujarat State sports authority.Yet, now that her goal for the year of winning a $25K title is achieved, Vaidehi is looking ahead with positivity.“I have slowly taken one step at a time. Now I am just more confident,” said Vaidehi, who will be travelling to Australia after a 10-day break.“There are a series of five big tournaments. I am looking forward to playing my first $75K event.”",Gujarat's Vaidehi Chaudhari won the women's singles title at the Fenesta Open National tennis championship in New Delhi on Saturday.
