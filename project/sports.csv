The long-standing alleged hostility between the two former teammates seemed to dissolve as they demonstrated mutual respect and camaraderie.In IPL 2023, Kohli and Gambhir, then the mentor for Lucknow Super Giants, had a fierce on-field altercation, but this season, it seemed they had left the past behind.Kohli, the face of RCB, and Gambhir, mentor of KKR, showed that their past differences were behind them.Now in a video shared by KKR Vibe, former Indian spinner Amit Mishra revealed how the feud ended.Amit Mishra says, ""It was Gautam Gambhir who ended the feud with Virat Kohli by walking up to him and hugged him thereby showing his large heartedness. Although it should've been done by Kohli as he made the issue bigger and dragged it.""Earlier, Kohli had also reflected on the moment with Gambhir during an event. ""People are very disappointed with my behaviour. I hugged Naveen, and then the other day, Gauti bhai (Gautam Gambhir) came and hugged me. Your masala is over so you're booing. We're not kids anymore,"" Kohli remarked.Gambhir had also provided perspectives on his relationship with Kohli and the nuances of on-field conduct, shedding light on the complexities inherent in their interactions both within and beyond the cricketing arena.Gambhir remarked on the media's role in shaping public perceptions, highlighting the tendency to sensationalize narratives for the sake of ratings.""It is all about TRPs. Media has got no clue what kind of a person I am, what kind of a person Virat is. All the media wants to do is create hype. But hype can also be created in a positive way,"" Gambhir observed, underscoring the impact of media coverage on public opinion. I absolutely second what Virat said. Logon ka masala nahi mila toh (The gossip bit is over for people). As I said, when two people are mature enough, I don't think so anyone has got any right to interfere between two people's life or their relationships because ultimately, it is between two of them,"" Gambhir added on the subject.With Gambhir now appointed as the head coach of the Indian national cricket team, succeeding Rahul Dravid , the dynamics between the former teammates are under scrutiny once again.","Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir had a fierce on-field altercation in IPL 2023.

There was hardly any talk between us.""On being asked if captaincy was the reason behind it, Mishra says, ""Yes of course.

Virat Kohli changed a lot after getting fame, power and captaincy.""Kohli hardly made any runs in the T20 World Cup, but his match-winning 76 earned him the player of the final award, and Rohit led the team from the front with three half-centuries in the tournament, in which India remained unbeaten.Kohli, 35, won his second World Cup crown after the 2011 ODI win under MS Dhoni, who also led India to title victory in T20's showpiece event in 2007 at the inaugural edition.A rookie Rohit, now 37, was part of the first T20 triumph when India beat arch-rivals Pakistan in the final in Johannesburg in 2007.The two stalwarts, who have 45,961 runs between them across three international formats, will stay on in Test and ODI cricket.The T20 triumph has been redemption for Rohit, who was stripped of his IPL captaincy from Mumbai Indians this year.Kohli proved his big-match credentials, with his 59-ball 76 in the final clash -- after he managed just 75 runs in seven innings during the competition until the finale.Rohit succeeded Kohli as white-ball skipper in 2021 and became all-format captain months later and broke India's global title drought since their Champions Trophy win in 2013.","Former Indian spinner Amit Mishra tells what separates Rohit from Virat.

I said sir my leadership role as a player will always be there, only the captain tag won't be there in front of me but whatever in my capacity till I hang up my boots, I will always give my 100% for the country.

NEW DELHI: Australian bowling legend Brett Lee praised Gautam Gambhir 's appointment as Team India's head coach, highlighting his on-field aggression and game awareness as beneficial for the Men in Blue.The BCCI recently announced Gambhir as the new head coach of the Indian team following Rahul Dravid's departure. Gambhir, who guided Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL title in 2024 as a mentor, took over after India's T20 World Cup victory ended an 11-year ICC trophy drought in Dravid's final assignment.Gambhir's coaching tenure will begin with an away white-ball series against Sri Lanka, featuring three T20Is and three ODIs, starting on July 27.In an interview with, Lee, who played 76 Tests, 221 ODIs, and 25 T20Is for Australia between 1999 and 2012, discussed Gambhir's new role, India's World Cup triumph, Surya's remarkable catch, and more. Lee recently represented Australia Legends in the World Championships of Legends.He's (Gautam Gambhir) done a terrific job every time he's had an opportunity. The Indian Premier League title with KKR is the best example. He's always been there, always at the top of his game. He finds a way to unite his players and graft his team together. He builds a solid structure. He has been a terrific player, and his aggression and winning attitude will help India. He has shone internationally as a player. India is in safe hands with Gautam Gambhir as coach. Congratulations to Rahul for finishing on a high.Big, big congratulations to India. Firstly, it was really good to see them and the emotion on the faces of those cricketers. Virat and Rohit have moved on from the game. There were players from the Australian cricket team who also hung up their boots. So, it was a swan song for a number of players from different countries around the world. One thing I will say is that India played the perfect style of cricket in the T20 World Cup. They looked like a strong side, to be very honest. Massive congratulations to Rohit Sharma and the Indian team. He led from the front in the tournament.Well, catches win you matches, don't they? I mean, Surya plucked the ball out of the sky. It was a brilliant, title-winning catch. It was a truly spectacular catch.Just moderation and eating well. I did a lot of training while I was in India for two and a half months. I trained every single day. I follow proper routines, focusing on exercise and diet plans. That's it. I'm having fun doing it. As a fast bowler, it's important to maintain your fitness. I'm probably fitter now than I was when I was playing, to be perfectly honest.Well, we'll wait and see. I'm not going to get all political.We're at a bit of a crossroads now with the Australian cricket team. We've seen some wonderful performances in the last 12-18 months and some incredible players over the last 10-15 years. Players stepping away from the Aussie cricket team creates holes and gaps but also opportunities. If I look at the top of the order, we have produced some brilliant players in the last 10-15 years.Now it's the next generation coming through, like Jake Fraser-McGurk. These players will have some big shoes to fill. David Warner and Aaron Finch are exceptional players who have been performing consistently for many years. It's time for the next generation of young cricketers to come through and flourish. So, I think it's positive for Australia. It's not great that they didn't win the World Cup, but you have to look ahead and seize those opportunities.It's not a matter of what went wrong; it's about Australia improving and continuing to improve. You can't win every single game of cricket. They tried their hardest and had a very good squad. They've played some really decent cricket in the past. Mitchell Marsh was given the opportunity, and he wanted to grab it with both hands. Pat Cummins has done a terrific job. It's hard being captain; it's not easy. The captain has a lot of pressure on them, so it's a massive job. It's a job you should take and treat with the utmost respect while enjoying the opportunity. Personally, I thought they would have gone with Pat Cummins, but they gave Mitchell Marsh the opportunity. I'm not part of that inner sanctum at the moment, so it's very hard to comment on how or why it happened. But they've chosen a captain, so back him.","Australian bowling legend Brett Lee praises Gautam Gambhir's appointment as Team India's head coach.

Shehan Jayasuriya launched an offensive against Pat Cummins and Haris Rauf, while Ryan Rickelton was a little inconsistent.The game changed when Liam Plunkett was brought on after the powerplay, as the Englishman claimed two wickets.In the middle overs, the Orcas went from 76/0 to 98/5 when Jayasuriya fell after reaching fifty and Klaasen fell cheaply.With five overs remaining and needing to score more than ten per over, the Orcas attempted to do so through Harmeet Singh and Hammad Azam, but they were unable to consistently reach the boundaries as the Unicorn bowlers deftly slowed the tempo and unleashed a barrage of cutters.In the end, the Corey Anderson-led side registered a comfortable win by 23 runs as the Orcas finished at 142/6 in their 20 overs.After the game, player of the match Liam Plunkett said, ""The way they batted in the powerplay, they got a decent start but it was always going to get tough when the ball got older. The plan was to try and maximise that phase.""Orcas captain Heinrich Klaasen said, ""We didn't bat well once again. The bowlers have been fantastic so far, the batters are letting the bowlers down.""On Jayasuriya, Klaasen said, ""That's the reason he's back in the team. He can be explosive up front. I'm so pleased it came off for him today and hopefully it can continue for the rest of the tournament. The pitch got a lot more difficult than expected. They bowled well, specially Plunkett but then also there was a bit of tactical fault from our side. We could have controlled things better.""Talking about the next game, Klaasen said, ""Yeah, it would seem like a must win. The group is staggered nicely, so a win here can bump you up a couple of places. We want to go to Dallas with a win, and win there and hopefully get into the playoffs.""Unicorns captain Corey Anderson said, ""Pretty good result. The boys did a great job in the back end of the batting innings and then came out strong with the ball.""On Sanjay Krishnamurthi, who scored a 21-ball 30, Anderson said, ""He's a young kid who's got so much talent. Huge pluses for him today. It was a pretty big innings in the context of the game. 20 odd in a game like this is huge.""Talking about Australia Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins, Anderson said, ""He is a world class player, just having him in the group speaking cricket calms the group. Great for the balance of the team as well.

Rohit Sharma 's brutal attack against Australia 's bowling spearhead Mitchell Starc during the recently concluded T20 World Cup has become part of cricketing folklore, as it not just helped India beat the Aussies but also put them on the brink of an early exit from the tournament. For some, it was also revenge for the defeat in the ODI World Cup final last year.The loos against India hit Australia's chances hard as the 2021 champions failed to enter the semis, while India went on to win the trophy defeating South Africa in the final.India's win followed euphoric celebrations on the field in Barbados, in the dressing room and later upon their arrival home. The T20 world champions were invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, followed by an open bus parade at the Marine Drive in Mumbai that saw lakhs of fans coming onto the streets to join their heroes in celebration.While the win has started sinking in, the Rohit mania fails to cease as the India captain visited the US for a promotional event after a small family vacation in the UK, and was greeted by fans with shouts of ""Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Starc"".It was the fans' way of telling the skipper that they enjoyed him taking the Australian apart and will never forget the entertainment.The shouts drew Rohit's attention instantaneously. He replied, ""calm down, guys"" and followed it up with a cheeky smile while on the stage.India met Australia during the 'Super 8s' stage of the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, and Rohit played probably the best innings of the tournament, scoring 92 runs off just 41 deliveries.Starc bore the maximum impact of Rohit's onslaught, conceding 29 runs in one over where he was smashed for four sixes and a four.Reflecting later on that during an episode of Willow Talk podcast, Starc had said: ""I have played a lot against him. He had a good tournament, especially at the back end. I think he targeted that wind in St Lucia as well. It was the one end that went for a lot more (runs) than the other.”""I think I had five bad balls and he hit them all for six.""","Rohit Sharma hit Mitchell Starc for four sixes and a four during T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: India Champions emerged victorious over Pakistan Champions by five wickets in the 2024 World Championship of Legends final held in Birmingham.Led by Yuvraj Singh , India successfully chased a target of 157 runs in 19.1 overs. Ambati Rayudu set the stage with a quick-fire fifty, followed by crucial contributions from Yusuf Pathan , Gurkeerat Singh Mann , and the captain himself.Pakistan, opting to bat first, posted a total of 156 for 6. Indian bowlers, spearheaded by Anureet Singh's three-wicket haul, effectively restricted Pakistan's run flow. As a result, India's target appeared manageable, although they faced initial setbacks.Openers Robin Uthappa and Ambati Rayudu got India off to a promising start with a 34-run partnership. However, pacer Aamer Yamin swung the momentum back in Pakistan's favor by dismissing Uthappa and Suresh Raina in the same over, leaving India at 38/2.Rayudu then partnered with Gurkeerat Singh Mann, adding a 60-run stand for the third wicket, with Rayudu smashing a quick 50 off 30 balls. His innings featured two sixes and five boundaries. However, Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal provided a crucial breakthrough by dismissing Rayudu in the 12th over.Shoaib Malik then removed Gurkeerat, 34 off 33, to further dent India's chase in the next over.The Indian score stood at 108/4 when Yusuf Pathan and Yuvraj Singh joined forces. Pathan played an aggressive 30 off 16 balls, hitting three towering sixes, while Yuvraj held his ground with an unbeaten 15 from 22 deliveries. Their partnership of 42 runs in just 5.4 overs was pivotal.With Yusuf going for big shots, captain Yuvraj played an uncharacteristically slow knock. But their stand for the fifth wicket turned out to be the deciding factor in the end.In the 19th over, Wahab Riaz dismissed Yusuf Pathan, leaving India needing just seven more runs from 10 balls. Yuvraj and Irfan Pathan then ensured India reached the target, with Irfan hitting the winning boundary off Sohail Tanvir on the first ball of the final over.Earlier, Pakistan's innings was primarily held together by Shoaib Malik, who top-scored with 41 runs off 36 balls, including three sixes. Contributions also came from Sohail Tanvir, who added an unbeaten 19 off 9 deliveries.For India, besides Anureet Singh's standout performance with figures of 3 for 43, Irfan Pathan (1 for 12), Pawan Negi (1 for 24), and Vinay Kumar (1 for 36) provided essential support by taking key wickets.While Malik and Tanvir's efforts pushed Pakistan past the 150-mark, it wasn't sufficient to defend against a disciplined Indian side.

Irfan Pathan first turned the clock back with his swing to send Younis Khan packing and then left his teammates in splits with a unique celebration following India's victory over Pakistan in the final of the World Championship of Legends (WCL) in Birmingham on Saturday.Irfan may have taken just a solitary wicket to contribute in India's title win, but the way he rattled the stumps behind Pakistan Champions' captain, it reminded of an almost similar delivery he produced in the 2006 Karachi Test to dismiss Younis as the second wicket of his famous hat-trick.Led by Yuvraj Singh, India successfully chased a target of 157 runs in 19.1 overs to clinch the WCL trophy with a five-wicket win.Ambati Rayudu (50 off 30 off balls) set up India's run-chase with a quick-fire fifty, followed by crucial contributions from Yusuf Pathan (30 off 16 balls) and Gurkeerat Singh Mann (34 off 33 balls).Yuvraj (15 not out) and Irfan (5 not out) completed the formalities to take India to victory.After the win, the India Champions squad got together to pose for a team photo and Irfan led the celebrations in a unique fashion, shouting names of each of his teammates in a funny way, which sent Suresh Raina tumbling over in uncontrollable laughter.The moment was captured on a video that made it to social media.Earlier in the game, Pakistan posted a total of 156 for 6 after winning the toss and opting to bat first.Indian bowlers, spearheaded by Anureet Singh's three-wicket haul, restricted Pakistan's run flow. As a result, India were able to limit their opponents to a par total.In run-chase, openers Robin Uthappa and Rayudu got India off to a promising start with a 34-run partnership. However, pacer Aamer Yamin swung the momentum back in Pakistan's favour by dismissing Uthappa (10) and Raina (4) in the same over, leaving India at 38 for 2.Rayudu then partnered with Mann, adding a 60-run stand for the third wicket, with Rayudu being the aggressive of the duo. His innings featured 2 sixes and 5 fours. However, off-spinner Saeed Ajmal provided a crucial breakthrough by dismissing Rayudu in the 12th over.Shoaib Malik then removed Mann to keep Pakistan in the game. India's total read 108 for 4 when Yusuf and Yuvraj joined forces.Yusuf didn't hold back in his knock and smashed three towering sixes, while Yuvraj kept the scoreboard moving with a steady innings at the other end. Their partnership of 42 runs in just 5.4 overs proved to be the deciding factor.",India beat Pakistan by five wickets in World Championship of Legends final.

First two days of England-West Indies game at Lord's summed up where Test cricket is: Nasser Hussain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/first-two-days-of-england-west-indies-game-at-lords-summed-up-where-test-cricket-is-nasser-hussain/articleshow/111762058.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former England captain Nasser Hussain expressed his concerns about the current state of Test cricket following England's swift victory against the West Indies in the opening match at Lord's.The hosts secured a commanding win by an innings and 114 runs within the first hour on day three, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.The contrasting preparation levels between the two teams were evident, as England had the benefit of playing County Championship matches, while the West Indies had only a single three-day red-ball game against First Class Counties XI.Furthermore, most of the West Indian players have not participated in red-ball cricket since their thrilling eight-run triumph over Australia in Brisbane back in January. Hussain's comments highlight the challenges faced by the longest format of the game in the modern era.""Those two days summed up for me where we are with Test cricket. You talk about all the batting they could have but they're off in a white-ball sunset, you've got bowlers who haven't bowled, you've got undercooked cricketers, and then you lose the toss and have the worst of conditions, and everyone goes 'Test cricket is dying'.""""But if you prepare for a Test match like that, you'll get exactly what England get when they go away. It frustrates me because you've got to give Test matches the preparation that they deserve, which is a very easy thing to say but a very difficult thing to do in modern times,"" said Hussain, as quoted by IANS, on the Sky Sports Cricket Podcast.The upcoming Test match between England and the West Indies at Trent Bridge has sparked interest among fans and experts alike. Many are wondering if this second encounter will offer a more closely contested battle compared to the previous match.""The other story is 'the West Indies are in terminal decline' -- England haven't won in the Caribbean for two decades and (the West Indies) hold the Richard-Botham Trophy.""""England travel to India or Australia and don't particularly do well, so it shouldn't just be a West Indies story. All it does is add to the fact that Test-match cricket is in a difficult place, and it is sort of self-perpetuating.""""If you don't look after it, then sides turn up and put in a performance like that, and everyone goes, 'Told you, Test-match cricket is dying'. Listening to you speaking to Jimmy Anderson after 188 Test matches on the podium, I would like to think we would try to look after Test-match cricket.""Following his retirement from international cricket at Lord's, James Anderson expressed his deep affection for Test cricket, as recounted by former England captain Michael Atherton . Anderson, who bid farewell to the international stage, spoke with great enthusiasm about his passion for the longest format of the game.""Anderson said, 'Test cricket has literally made me the person I am'. So, all the lessons he's drawn from Test cricket -- the ups, the downs, the highs, the lows, the coming back for that third spell at six o'clock in the evening and having to dig deep within yourself.""""All of the things which have made him the mature person he is, Test cricket has helped him along the way. I wanted to ask him about it because it's at a fragile time, he's going to move onto a mentoring role and you'd hope, because there are young players coming through now who will have career choices to make.""""You'd like to feel Jimmy would say to them 'sometimes the easiest choices are not always the most rewarding or most fulfilling'…although everybody needs to pay the bills, one understands that.""",Former England captain Nasser Hussain has expressed his concerns about the state of Test cricket.

There are lots of very talented and skilful players who are coming through the system. The only thing we need to make sure is the transition is done in a controlled manner. It needs to be gradual.He believes that by the time Rohit and Kohli hang up their boots, the emerging talents will have firmly established themselves, ready to carry the torch forward for the next decade.""I am hoping that by then, players like Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, Yashasavi Jaiswal, Dhruv Jurel to name a few, would establish themselves and will make the transition smooth.""In ODIs also, we have experienced players like Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya to take over,"" Rathour said in a confident analysis.Gill and Jaiswal have the potential to become the backbone of India's batting lineup in the coming years, much like how Kohli and Rohit shouldered the responsibility for over ten years.""There are many exciting players coming through but these two are equipped to play all three formats for a long time. They are going to be the backbone of Indian batting in years to come,"" the former Punjab skipper said.Rathour's opinion carries significance, especially considering his role as a valuable advisor to Dravid over the past three years. When he expresses his belief that Rinku Singh has the potential to excel as a Test batter, it is a statement that deserves attention and consideration.""When I see him (Rinku) bat in nets, I can't find any technical reasons why Rinku cannot be a successful Test batter. I understand he has made his name as a terrific finisher in T20 cricket but if you look at his first-class record, he is averaging in high 50s.""He (Rinku) is also blessed with a very calm temperament. So all these factors indicate that if given an opportunity, he can develop into a Test cricketer,"" Rathour said.Rathour consistently encountered inquiries about Kohli's prolonged slump following the 2019 World Cup at nearly every media interaction. His response remained steadfast, asserting that it was a ""phase that everyone has to go through"".""There were no technical issues that we worked on specifically during this phase. The constant messaging to him was to keep working hard and believe in his methods. Eventually he came back stronger and an even better player,"" he said.Rathour and Dravid first faced each other on the cricket pitch during a domestic match prior to their shared Test debut series in 1996 against England. This marked the beginning of a connection that would span thirty years.Their long-standing association proved beneficial when they eventually joined forces as part of the coaching team.""Rahul is the best coach that I have worked with, who gives you lots of space to work, is open to suggestions and will provide you an honest feedback.""One of the first discussions we had was about changing the batting template in T20 cricket. We agreed that we needed to bring in more intent and aggression in our batting approach,"" he revealed.Rathour highlighted Axar Patel as an example of a player who addressed the team's need for a reliable batting choice at the number eight position.""That made a massive difference and gave the batters in top order lot more freedom to bat.""Axar was always a good batter and all he needed was opportunity to express himself fearlessly with an ""uncomplicated technique"".","Vikram Rathour is the departing batting coach of the Indian cricket team. Rathour believes that the team possesses the necessary skills and adaptability to navigate through this transitional phase successfully. He believes that by the time Rohit and Kohli hang up their boots, the emerging talents will have firmly established themselves.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111757741,imgsize-40764,width-400,resizemode-4/111757741.jpg"

He emphasized the importance of recognizing and celebrating Warner's legacy as a crucial player across all formats of the game.""Our understanding is that David is retired, and (he) should be commended on what has been an incredible career across all three formats. You never know when Bull's joking…think he's just stirring the pot a bit.“He's had a wonderful career, can't celebrate it enough, and think as time goes by, his legacy of what he has done for Australia and we reflect back on that, the legend of a player is only going to continue to grow. But as far as this team goes and the journey to transition to some different players, in his case across all three formats, it's going to be exciting,"" IANS quoted Bailey as saying to reporters.Bailey also affirmed thatGlenn Maxwell and Mitchell Starc remain integral to the team's plans for the 2025 Champions Trophy and possibly the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup.

This is the way we are going with this squad. If opportunities arise or there are gaps at different points there's nothing to say that Wadey might not come back, but certainly, at this point, we are excited about giving Josh (Inglis) a run.""The next T20 World Cup is 2026, so I imagine there may be some more changes than what we are seeing in this squad but specifically to those guys (Starc and Maxwell), no we haven't had any conversations about where they think their T20 journey may finish. Certainly for Glenn and Mitch, the Champions Trophy is very much on the horizon, (and is a) very important tournament for those guys.""And Starcy in particular, I think he's going to have a huge summer. Clearly, some of the decisions made around this series are around prioritising and getting guys right for what will be a really big summer. As far as ending players, seeing where guys might finish up, we haven't had those conversations,"" he elaborated.Bailey commended Mitchell Marsh for his leadership of the Australian team during the T20 World Cup. Although Australia was eliminated in the Super Eights stage after losing to Afghanistan and India, Bailey recognized Marsh's captaincy skills.""I loved the way he captained through the T20 World Cup. He was really clear on how he wanted to lead that team. He was as disappointed as anyone that we didn't get to the end goal that everyone was hoping to achieve, but if you look at his early success rate as a captain across T20 he's done a really great job.""",David Warner will not be considered for selection in the Champions Trophy scheduled for 2025.

It's extremely painful and it'll hurt for a long time.""Harry Kane's pursuit of silverware continues to elude him, as England suffered a heartbreaking defeat in their second European Championship final in three years.Despite sharing the Golden Boot with his three goals, the 31-year-old striker is acutely aware that time is running out to end his trophy drought.Throughout the tournament, Kane faced criticism as England struggled to find their rhythm, relying on moments of individual brilliance and a favorable draw to progress.As the focal point of England's rise under Gareth Southgate, Kane has been instrumental in their journey from underachievers to contenders, leading them to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and the final of Euro 2020.However, his missed penalty in the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup against France was a bitter blow, and his decision to leave Tottenham for Bayern Munich in search of trophies has yet to yield the desired results. Despite his impressive goal tally, Bayern experienced a trophyless season for the first time since 2012, overshadowed by Bayer Leverkusen's domestic double.England entered the Euros as favorites, bolstered by the stunning performances of young stars like Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, and Cole Palmer.However, they failed to live up to the hype, with Kane appearing physically exhausted and hampered by a back injury that had ended his club season prematurely.""Physically it has been tough for him,"" said Southgate.""He came into the tournament short on games and has not quite reached the level we all would have hoped.""Southgate, for the fifth time in seven tournament games, decided to substitute his captain. The change proved effective in the semi-final, as Ollie Watkins scored a stunning winner in stoppage time against the Netherlands.In search of an equaliser after Nico Williams had given Spain the lead early in the second half, Southgate once again turned to Watkins. England responded, with Palmer finding the far corner from outside the box. Kane celebrated from the bench, but it was the best moment for Southgate's team, as Spain gradually regained control before Oyarzabal's decisive strike.The future of England's coach and captain now hangs in the balance. Southgate said he will take time to consider his position, while Kane will be approaching 33 by the time the next World Cup arrives.Given Bayern's financial dominance in German football , silverware seems inevitable at some point. However, Kane's best opportunity for international success may have passed.",England lost 2-1 to Spain in the Euro 2024 final in New Delhi on Sunday. Captain Harry Kane was substituted after 60 minutes of play. The Bayern Munich forward has yet to win a trophy with England.

She arrived for the late evening round tables wearing her match face.Not a line of complaint showing.""It's good to have all these obligations,"" she said of the post-championship commitments, which can be draining and often goes late into the night.Krejcikova, who on Saturday claimed her second major singles title, three years after her first at Roland Garros , which along with her seven women's doubles and three mixed-doubles crowns, makes for a crowded trophy cabinet, is fabulously grounded.At the end of the near two-hour final against Jasmine Paolini , who was close to tears and could only manage the briefest of handshakes, Krejcikova, 5 ft 10' to the Italian's 5 ft 4', grabbed Paolini and enveloped her in a hug.""I like Jasmine, she's always very polite, always smiling, always super happy,"" Krejcikova said.
