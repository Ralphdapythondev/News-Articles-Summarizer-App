Indian hockey team had the quality and calibre to play in final at Paris Olympics: Sreejesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/hockey-team-had-the-quality-calibre-to-play-in-final-at-paris-oly-sreejesh/articleshow/112749426.cms,"Excerpts:

Many great players, including Messi, have taken a U-turn after announcing

retirement

. HI president Dilip Tirkey himself has urged you to carry on...

Despite retaining Olympic bronze, are you disappointed that you couldn’t go on to win gold?

Of your two Olympic bronze medals, which is more special — Tokyo or Paris?

How do you deal with pressure?

How did you manage to remain largely injury-free in your career?

You have been put in charge of coaching the Indian junior team. How do you plan to go about it?

Will your retirement create a vacuum?

All these years, as a 'lone ranger' beneath the bar, P R Sreejesh has always had Team India 's back. Now, as he adjusts to a less frenetic life post-retirement, he focuses on how he can bring his trademark commitment and energy to his new job as the junior Indian team's coach .At an exclusive interaction at the TOI office in Kochi, the 36-year-old former India custodian was unequivocal: ""We have a tendency to pamper players.But I think you should always challenge them and give them more tasks. I will put pressure on the players"".Sreejesh said India had everything going for them in Paris and it was ""disappointing"" that we didn't get gold this time. ""India had the quality and calibre to play in the ( hockey ) final in Paris,"" he said emphatically, adding that ""one day, we will be the best team in the world"".He spoke at length on how a goalkeeper is set apart from the other 10 players in the team. ""Actually, he is not playing hockey on the turf. He is a lone ranger. Even if the goalkeeper saves or concedes, he stands alone"". Dismissing comparisons to Emiliano Martinez, the Argentine football goalie of 2022 World Cup fame, as farfetched, he, however, said chance as much as instincts mean life and death to the goalie, quoting the colloquial Malayalam proverb, ""a jackfruit might come crashing down but the rabbit scoots in time"".Finally, Sreejesh categorically refuted any second thoughts on his decision to call it a day. ""It's a happy ending for me. I retired after winning the Olympic bronze and had the honour of carrying the flag during the closing ceremony.""For 18 long years, PR Sreejesh exemplified commitment on the hockey turf. On Friday, TOI got a glimpse into his sense of commitment. After arriving in the city early on Friday morning from Delhi, Sreejesh agreed to visit TOI’s Kochi office in the morning. But soon he learnt his daughter Anusree was unwell and informed us that she had to be taken to a hospital. But he promised that he would be in our office as soon as the doctors finished his daughter’s medical examination. As promised, at 2 in the afternoon, the two-time Olympic bronze medallist walked in accompanied by wife Aneeshya and Anusree. In a long, freewheeling conversation with Team TOI, Sreejesh opened up on a variety of topics.In today’s world, such grand farewells are a rarity. Regardless of the sport or the level of competition, athletes seldom receive a send-off of this magnitude. It’s a happy ending for me. It’s a fitting conclusion to a remarkable career. What if I decide to return and that proves to be a mistake? The media and fans will be quick to criticise and question my comeback. I retired after winning the Olympic bronze and had the honour of carrying the flag during the closing ceremony. On returning home, Hockey India organised a magnificent reception, and my jersey number (16) is now retired. For a sportsperson, it’s difficult to imagine a greater tribute than this.Certainly. It is a fact that India had the quality and the calibre to play in the final. Perhaps that is why there wasn’t as much celebration as there was for the Tokyo Olympics bronze. The Tokyo Olympics medal brought immense joy and relief. Here, the joy of winning was limited. There was some disappointment as the team should have won the semifinal and played the final.Tokyo is special because it came without any expectations. Every time we went to the Olympics, people would say that India would win a medal in hockey. However, I got to lay my hand on a medal only in my third Olympics. Enjoying and celebrating that moment is a special memory. Tokyo bronze will have a pride of place in my heart.Pressure has become a habit now. What I tell our players is that an uncomfortable zone is our pressure zone. When I say my comfort zone, it will be an uncomfortable zone that you cannot even imagine. Just imagine the scenario during a shootout, the weight of a billion people is on you.It’s not that I was completely free from injuries. I was once sidelined for eight months. But the thing is that I ignored many injuries in my career. Both my toes are fractured, with bones displaced inside and I didn’t attempt surgery or proper treatment then. I played using painkillers. Only God knows how many disc bulges I have. About ten years ago, there were around six bulges.I will put pressure on the players. I will give each one in the coaching team specific jobs and they must do it in earnest and submit reports to me. We tend to pamper players. But as a coach, I feel you should always challenge the players and give them more tasks. Another thing is documentation, we should give them (the players) the correct reports.I think for the next two tournaments there will be comparisons with the next goalkeeper, (Krishan) Pathak or Suraj (Karkera), whoever steps into my shoes. After two months it will fade away. They will compare him with the next person. It won’t be a big issue as long as India wins because people won’t notice your mistakes. It is when you lose, you will face questions. If we hadn’t won this time, Harman (Harmanpreet) and I would have faced a lot of criticism because we committed a lot of mistakes.","Former India goalkeeper P R Sreejesh is now coaching the junior Indian team. The 36-year-old is a two-time Olympic bronze medallist. He says he will 'put pressure' on the players to perform well. ""It's a happy ending for me. I retired after winning the Olympic bronze""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112750367,imgsize-101322,width-400,resizemode-4/112750367.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Cricket is famously known as a game of uncertainties, where the outcome can change dramatically in a matter of moments. Unlike other sports, cricket is influenced by a multitude of factors—weather conditions, pitch behavior, and even the smallest of decisions can have a significant impact.A well-set batsman can be dismissed by an unexpected delivery, or a seemingly hopeless match can turn around with a brilliant catch or a sudden burst of wickets.This unpredictability keeps fans on the edge of their seats, making cricket thrilling and unpredictable, as no result is certain until the very last ball is bowled.Such instance was witnessed during the Maharaja Trophy tournament when three Super Overs were needed to get the result out of a match.The Bengaluru Blasters and Hubli Tigers' Maharaja Trophy match etched its name in the annals of cricket history when the game required three Super Overs to determine a winner, an unprecedented occurrence in the sport.Led by Manish Pandey, the Hubli Tigers emerged victorious against Mayank Agarwal 's Bengaluru Blasters after the standard 20 overs and two Super Overs failed to break the deadlock between the two teams.The Tigers, batting first, posted a total of 164, with the Blasters falling just short at 164 in their allotted 20 overs.

NEW DELHI: Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik shared his thoughts on the possibility of Jasprit Bumrah becoming the captain of the Indian national cricket team . There had been discussions about making Bumrah the captain following Rohit Sharma 's retirement from the T20 format after India's victorious T20 World Cup campaign. However, the T20I captaincy was ultimately handed to Suryakumar Yadav , a teammate of Bumrah from the Mumbai Indians .Speaking on Cricbuzz, Karthik responded to a fan's question about Bumrah's potential as India captain. He highlighted the importance of maintaining Bumrah's fitness for crucial matches and cautioned that taking on the additional responsibility of captaincy could increase the risk of injury for the pace spearhead.""Calm, cool, most importantly good maturity... but he's a fast bowler. So how can we play him in all three formats? That is the BIGGEST question the selectors could have had,"" Karthik explained, emphasizing the challenge of balancing Bumrah's workload across all formats.Karthik further elaborated on his stance, describing Bumrah as a ""Kohinoor diamond"" for Indian cricket, whose well-being must be carefully managed.""Being a fast bowler, especially at Bumrah's level, it is so important to protect him and play him in important matches. I keep saying this about Bumrah, he is like a Kohinoor diamond – we have to protect him, take care of him, and ensure that he lasts as long as possible. Because whenever Bumrah plays, in any format, he makes an impact. That's what we want. To burden him with captaincy and then see him end up playing a lot of series and injuring himself would be a huge problem,"" Karthik added.Bumrah has previously led India as a stand-in captain during the one-off Test against England at Edgbaston in 2022 and also captained India to a 2-0 series victory in a three-match T20I series against Ireland last year.Despite his success in these limited captaincy stints, Karthik's comments underline the importance of carefully managing Bumrah's workload to maximize his effectiveness and longevity in international cricket.",Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik shares his thoughts on Jasprit Bumrah's potential as India captain.

MUMBAI: When Rahul Dravid is in a good mood, he can leave you in splits. At an event here on Wednesday night, he responded hilariously when quizzed about which actor he would pick to play himself in a biopic. “If the money is good enough, I will play it myself,” the cricket legend quipped. Having stepped down as Team India head coach after guiding Rohit Sharma & Co to their T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies in June, Dravid humorously referred to himself as “jobless” multiple times and even urged the audience to “send him an email with suggestions on what job he can take up next”.“My wife (Vijeta) wants me to be at home and take care of my boys,” he added.Dravid acknowledged that winning tournaments requires not only skill but also a bit of luck, which can play a significant role in the outcome of big matches.To emphasise this point, Dravid recalled two finals during his nearly three-year tenure as Team India head coach—one in Ahmedabad and the other in Barbados. The first was the 2023 World Cup final on Nov 19, when Travis Head survived a probing spell from India’s newball pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami before his 137-run knock broke a billion Indian hearts.“I’ve had time to reflect on it... You realize sometimes you have to do everything right, but luck plays its part,” Dravid said.“On November 19th… we beat Travis Head’s bat 15 times — he didn’t touch a single ball. Sometimes things go your way, but you have to stick to the process,” Dravid, who received the Lifetime Achievement honour at the Ceat Cricket Rating Awards, remarked.Dravid also pointed to India’s thrilling comeback against South Africa in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados on June 29. Despite South Africa needing just 30 runs off the last five overs, India (176/7) defended their total, withSuryakumar Yadav ’s stunning boundary catch turning the game in India’s favour.“Sometimes at the end of the day, you need a little bit of luck. (Against South Africa in T20WC final)… 30 balls to go, 30 runs to go. (It was about) incredible execution, incredible calmness by Rohit. We didn’t focus on what we needed to do, but we needed a guy who could keep his foot within one inch of a line. Sometimes (it is) the skill,” he said, recalling Suryakumar Yadav’s fabulous catch on the long-off boundary to pull off David Miller’s dismissal. It was a catch that tilted a tight game in India’s favour.Reflecting on his time as head coach, Dravid expressed pride in India’s journey to the 2023 World Cup final, where they won nine consecutive matches before losing to Australia in the title clash. “To travel across the country and witness the passion of the fans... just the experience as a coach was phenomenal,” he said.Though they fell short in the 2023 World Cup, Dravid credited the team’s T20 World Cup success to sticking with the same processes and energy. “We needed to create the same vibe, the same team atmosphere... and hope for a little bit of luck on the day,” the 51-year-old explained. Dravid waxed eloquent on India’s ability to churn out top-quality cricketers.“I left in 2011-2012. These (new) players have been able to carry the legacy forward. If you just look at the success that we’ve had over the last 12 years in all the three formats of the game, the time that after we left, it’s been absolutely phenomenal. Very easily, clearly in a lot of the rankings, we’re always (No.) 1 or 2… we’re always up there with anyone,” he said.“I have no doubt that this generation of players, led by people like Rohit and Surya and the (other) guys coming forward in all formats of the game is only going to continue to do that in the future,” he added.","Rahul Dravid jokes about playing himself in a biopic: 'If the money is good enough, I will play it myself' The cricket legend stepped down as Team India head coach after guiding Rohit Sharma & Co to their T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies in June.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112724666,imgsize-50480,width-400,resizemode-4/112724666.jpg"

"1st Test, Day 3 Highlights: Shadman anchors Bangladesh's good show against Pakistan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/1st-test-day-3-highlights-shadman-anchors-bangladeshs-good-show-against-pakistan/articleshow/112744335.cms,"NEW DELHI: Shadman Islam , the Bangladeshi opener, fell just short of a valiant century by a mere seven runs, but his efforts propelled Bangladesh to a commendable 316/5 at stumps on the third day of the first Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi on Friday.Islam's patient knock of 93 off 183 balls kept Bangladesh's hopes alive of either securing a draw or achieving their maiden victory over Pakistan in their 14th Test encounter, AFP reported.As the day drew to a close, experienced batsman Mushfiqur Rahim remained unbeaten on 55, while Litton Das was not out on 52, further strengthening Bangladesh's position. The duo had forged a solid unbroken partnership of 98 runs for the sixth wicket.Bangladesh currently trail Pakistan's declared total of 448-6 by 132 runs, with five wickets remaining. The Rawalpindi stadium pitch has proven to be unresponsive to bowlers, nearly diminishing Pakistan's chances of securing a substantial lead.Rahim reached his 28th Test half-century by hitting Shaheen Shah Afridi for his seventh boundary. Das also brought up his fifty, smashing three boundaries and a six in one over from Naseem Shah after Pakistan took the second new ball.However, it was Shadman who anchored Bangladesh's resistance. The 29-year-old left-hander displayed resilience and was closing in on his second century before being bowled by a sharp delivery from Pakistan pacer Mohammad Ali in the final over before tea.Pakistan also dismissed Shakib Al Hasan for 15, as the ace all-rounder played a loose shot against part-time spinner Saim Ayub, who claimed his maiden wicket in his first-ever Test over.Pacer Khurram Shahzad was the standout bowler with figures of 2-47, while Naseem Shah, Mohammad Ali, and Ayub each took a wicket. Spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi went wicketless in his 18 overs.Earlier, Shadman anchored Bangladesh's innings, adding 52 runs for the fourth wicket with Rahim, following a stubborn 94-run stand with Mominul Haque (50). Shadman hit 12 boundaries during his fighting five-hour, 29-minute stay at the crease.Haque was the only batter dismissed in the post-lunch session, bowled by Shahzad after missing a delivery. He scored 28 runs, hitting five boundaries in his 76-ball innings.Shadman anchored Bangladesh's resistance as Pakistan's pace attack struggled on a Rawalpindi pitch that had significantly slowed down. The Shadman-Haque partnership led the recovery after Pakistan removed Zakir Hasan (12) and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (16) during the extended three-hour session due to Friday prayers.Pakistan utilized all four pacers but lacked a frontline spinner. Part-time slow bowler Agha Salman trapped Shadman leg-before wicket on 57, but the decision was overturned on review.Bangladesh, resuming at 27-0, lost Zakir early to a brilliant one-handed catch by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan off Naseem Shah’s bowling in the fifth over of the day. Shanto appeared in good touch but was bowled between bat and pad by Shahzad, leaving Bangladesh at 53-2.The second and final Test will also be held in Rawalpindi starting on August 30, as part of the nine-team World Test Championship's third cycle (2023-2025).","Bangladesh trail Pakistan by 132 runs at stumps on third day of first Test.

However, the absence of high-profile foreign broadcasters signals challenges for PCB in generating expected revenue.Even Pakistan Television (PTV), the state-owned network, bid PKR 1.6 billion and did not increase their offer, though the winning bid was only marginally higher.""It is far less than what the PCB had initially anticipated while keeping its reserve price of PKR 3.2 billion,"" according to a source close to the developments.PTV obtained the broadcasting rights through sub-licensing for PKR 500 million from the consortium, making for a profitable arrangement for both the consortium and PTV. Yet, PCB's overall financial benefits from a densely packed season appear limited.Looking ahead, PCB faces difficulties securing a broadcaster in the UK for the upcoming Pakistan and England Test series in October-November, with Sky Sports showing no interest in acquiring the UK territory rights. Nonetheless, PCB remains optimistic about finding a broadcaster for the series within the available time frame.These developments underline the contrasting results of PCB's recent broadcasting rights negotiations, reflecting both progress and ongoing challenges.","Pakistan Cricket Board has sold broadcasting rights for international home matches between August 2024 and December 2026.

Croatian midfielder Filip Mrzljak and Argentine forward Norberto Vidal restored Punjab's lead, but Australian Jason Cummings equalized again in the 79th minute, sending the match into a tie-breaker due to the absence of extra-time provisions.In the penalties, Cummings missed MBSG's first spot-kick, giving Punjab an early advantage. However, MBSG goalkeeper Vishal Kaith stopped Croatian defender Novoselec from converting the fifth kick, preventing a Punjab win.Greg Stewart then equalized for MBSG. As sudden death ensued, Melroy Assisi scored for Punjab FC. Subhashish Bose and Scottish defender Thomas Aldred , who scored the decisive penalty, converted for MBSG. Kaith's second save against Denechandram Meetei ultimately clinched the victory. Other MBSG scorers in the tiebreaker included Manvir Singh, Liston Colaco, and Dimi Petratos, while Vinit Rai, Norberto Vidal, Bakenga, and Filip Mrzljak scored for Punjab FC.A wonderful 1-2 between Luka and Vinit saw the latter in the clear inside the Mariners penalty area and as he was about to strike, Spanish central defender Alberto Martin was adjudged to have brought him down. The Shers’ talisman made no mistake with the spot-kick. The equaliser came at the stroke of half-time. Liston initiated it as he had been for the entire half with his forays down the left. On this occasion, he cut inside and laid it on for Greg Stewart whose first-time strike took a deflection off Suhail lurking just outside the six-yard box and wrongfooted Ravi to trickle in.Manvir was the first of the substitutes to make an immediate impact when Sahal set him up with a through ball on the right after having received a pass from the young and talented Abhishek. The lanky winger drew Ravi out of the Punjab goal and struck a right-footer past him into the right bottom corner.The goal forced Panagiotis to play his cards quickly and he brought on new Norwegian signing Bakenga ahead of the hour mark in place of skipper Luka Majcen. They got the equaliser minutes later when a Vinit Rai cross from the right was allowed to roll by hard-working Croatian midfielder Filip Mrzljak, foxing Aldred among others on the way. He then unleashed a thunderous left-footer from just outside the top of the box to bulge the Mariner’s net.Soon the Shers were back in the lead when Mrzljak again took control of a ball in midfield and made a dash forward. Bakenga produced the dummy run from the centre as the Croat found Vidal in the clear with his run from the left. The diminutive Argentine, who had come close just after coming on, this time beat Vishal Kaith with a clinical left-footer.It was then the turn of the Mariners to equalise as Liston’s cross was headed down by Manvir for Cummings to finish expertly with a left-footed volley which bulged the roof of the net. That led to the tie-breaker which resulted in heart-break for Punjab FC.",Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) overcame Punjab FC 6-5 in sudden-death penalties.

SLK will help in developing local talent: John Gregory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/slk-will-help-in-developing-local-talent-john-gregory/articleshow/112717856.cms,"KOCHI: Super League Kerala will mark the return of John Gregory to coaching as he will manage the fortunes of Malappuram FC in the inaugural edition of the league commencing on Sept 7.The Englishman, who had helped Chennaiyin FC clinch their second ISL title in 2017, left the club after two more years despite team owner Vita Dani’s desperate plea to carry on.But when the offer from Malappuram FC came knocking on his door after a five-year break, he didn’t think twice before taking the plunge.“After my time with Chennaiyin FC, I took a break to recharge and reflect on my coaching journey. During this period, I realised how much I missed the game and the excitement of working closely with players,” said Gregory. “India and Malappuram in particular, offers a unique and vibrant footballing environment that's full of potential and passion. The opportunity to return to a place where football is so deeply cherished and to contribute to its growth was something I couldn't pass up,” he added.Gregory feels that a local league like SLK will help in developing local talent. “Super League Kerala is an exciting development for the region’s football landscape. With my experience in the ISL, I believe a local league featuring foreign players can be incredibly beneficial. It not only raises the level of competition but also helps in developing local talent by providing them with valuable exposure and experience,” he said, adding that the presence of international players will bring diverse playing styles and a higher standard of play, which can be a tremendous learning opportunity for emerging players and coaches alike.With Malappuram having a huge legacy in sevens football and most of its players coming from a seven-a-side background, the transition from the shorter version to the eleven-a-side game will be one of the major challenges Gregory will face in his new job. “While Sevens football has its unique qualities, I see it as a valuable foundation rather than a limitation. Sevens players often possess excellent technical skills, quick decision-making, and agility, which are all crucial for success in the eleven-a-side game,” he said.“However, I acknowledge that endurance and fitness levels for a full 90-minute match are different. That’s why we focus on tailored conditioning programmes and gradually integrate them into the eleven-a-side style of play. It’s about leveraging their existing strengths while addressing any areas that need improvement. With the right support and training, I believe Sevens players can transition effectively and excel in the eleven-a-side format,” he added.",John Gregory will manage Malappuram FC in the inaugural edition of the league commencing on Sept 7. The Englishman had helped Chennaiyin FC clinch their second ISL title in 2017. Gregory feels that a local league like SLK will help in developing local talent.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112717905,imgsize-31610,width-400,resizemode-4/112717905.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic , energized by his triumphant performance at the Olympic Games, aims to break new Grand Slam records at the US Open starting Monday. Meanwhile, his main rival, Jannik Sinner , arrives in New York facing scrutiny over two positive drug tests.If Djokovic secures a fifth title, he can become the oldest Open era champion at the tournament, sharing the record with Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, and Roger Federer.A victory would also elevate him to 25 Grand Slam triumphs, surpassing the 24 he currently shares with Margaret Court.This year has been challenging for Djokovic, as Sinner succeeded him as the Australian Open champion and took over his world number one ranking. Additionally, Carlos Alcaraz claimed Djokovic's French Open title and dominated him in a one-sided Wimbledon final.However, Djokovic made a remarkable comeback on the clay courts of Roland Garros, stunning Alcaraz in the Olympic final. His emotional victory in Paris allowed him to join an elite group of only five players to complete a career Golden Slam, winning all four majors and an Olympic gold medal.The victory silenced the growing number of skeptics who had dismissed the Serb as a fading force in a new era dominated by the 23-year-old Sinner and 21-year-old Alcaraz.Djokovic, who underwent knee surgery in June, described his Olympic victory as his ""biggest sporting success"" and the 99th title of his professional career.""At the age of 37 and facing a 21-year-old who is probably the best player in the world right now, winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back, I can say that this is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had,"" insisted Djokovic.Sinner, the rising Italian tennis star, enters the US Open, the final Grand Slam event of the year, fresh off his victory at the Cincinnati Masters. The young player's impressive performance on the court, however, was quickly overshadowed by recent revelations regarding his drug tests.Earlier in the season, Sinner tested positive on two separate occasions for clostebol, ""an anabolic agent prohibited at all times by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)."" The news raised concerns about the athlete's integrity and the fairness of his competitions.Despite the positive tests, Sinner managed to avoid a prolonged suspension from the sport. Officials ultimately accepted his explanation that the banned substance had inadvertently entered his system due to contamination from a member of his support team.This decision allowed him to continue competing, but the incident has cast a shadow over his recent successes on the court.""I will now put this challenging and deeply unfortunate period behind me,"" said Sinner.","Novak Djokovic aims to break new Grand Slam records at the US Open starting Monday.

"Jannik Sinner escapes doping ban, players allege double standards",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-escapes-doping-ban-players-allege-double-standards/articleshow/112675882.cms,"Denis Shapovalov joined several other tennis professionals in criticizing the perceived inconsistencies within the sport following the International Tennis Integrity Agency 's (ITIA) decision to clear world number one Jannik Sinner of any wrongdoing, despite the Italian player failing two drug tests earlier this year.On Tuesday, the ITIA announced that an independent tribunal had determined Sinner was free to continue participating in tournaments.Shapovalov, a former top 10 player himself, wasted no time in expressing his belief that Sinner had been given favorable treatment due to his status in the tennis world.""Can't imagine what every other player that got banned for contaminated substances is feeling right now,"" the Canadian wrote on social media. ""Different rules for different players.""In a statement to ESPN, Sinner's coach, Darren Cahill, expressed their desire to put the incident behind them and focus on the future. ""We're not looking for any sorrow or anything because we are quite thankful there is no ban attached,"" he said.""He would never, ever intentionally do anything and he's in a situation which is incredibly unfortunate.""Sinner faced a challenging situation when he tested positive for clostebol during the Indian Wells tournament in March. The banned substance was detected in his system in low quantities, and a subsequent test days later also showed its presence. Despite this, the 23-year-old successfully challenged the automatic provisional suspensions that would have typically followed such findings.As a result of his successful appeal, Sinner is now eligible to participate in the upcoming US Open, which is set to take place from August 26 to September 8.Sinner lost in the semis at Indian Wells and was stripped of 400 ranking points and had to forfeit $325,000 in prize money that he had earned at the tournament.""Whether Sinner was doping or not, this is not right,"" British player Liam Broady wrote in a social media post. ""Plenty of players go through the same thing and have to wait months or years for their innocence to be declared. Not a good look.""The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), founded in 2021 by tennis governing bodies, has accepted Jannik Sinner's appeal to lift his provisional suspension.The agency sought expert opinions and found Sinner's explanation to be plausible, leading to their decision not to contest his appeal.Tara Moore, a former top-ranked British doubles player, highlighted the difference in the handling of her case compared to Sinner's. Moore was suspended for 19 months due to a failed drug test before being exonerated last year. She expressed her views on the matter through social media posts.""I guess only the top players' images matter,"" Moore wrote. ""I guess only the independent tribunal's opinion on the top players is taken as sound and right. Yet, they question them in my case. Just makes no sense.""Simona Halep, a former Wimbledon champion, faced a provisional suspension in October 2022 due to two distinct violations of anti-doping regulations. The initial suspension was followed by a four-year ban.In March, after an appeal was filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the ban was reduced to a period of nine months.The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), an organization founded by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in 2020, emphasized the need for a consistent approach within the anti-doping system.""Players winning anti-doping violation appeals is generally good,"" said Ahmad Nassar, an executive director of the player advocacy group.""But we have to have clear, consistent processes for all players. Whether ranked one, 100 or 1,000; whether man or woman. And no matter what region of the world they may call home.""The absence of a clear and consistent system creates obvious problems for players who are not the perceived ranking, gender and/or nationality of choice. The absence also undermines the tennis establishment's credibility with fans and media.""The ruling made on Tuesday may still face appeals from either the World Anti-Doping Agency or the Italian Anti-Doping Agency.Nick Kyrgios also expressed his disapproval of the decision.""Ridiculous - whether it was accidental or planned,"" the 2022 Wimbledon finalist wrote on social media. ""You get tested twice with a banned (steroid) substance... you should be gone for two years.""",The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) has accepted Jannik Sinner's appeal to lift his provisional suspension.

However, an independent tribunal has exonerated him of any wrongdoing, the International Tennis Integrity Agency announced on Tuesday, just days before the Italian is scheduled to compete in the US Open .The tribunal, organized by Sport Resolutions, accepted Sinner's explanation that the anabolic agent clostebol entered his system through massages and sports therapy administered by a member of his support team.According to the ITIA, Sinner stated that his physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi , used an over-the-counter spray containing clostebol to treat a minor finger injury. Naldi then performed massages on Sinner between March 5-13 without wearing gloves, inadvertently transferring the substance to the tennis star's body.Naldi had no knowledge that the substance he applied to his wound had clostebol in it, according to Sinner. Clostebol, a steroid, can be utilized to increase muscle mass.The initial positive sample from Sinner was collected on March 10, followed by another one eight days later. Although provisional suspensions were imposed after each positive result, his team's prompt appeals allowed him to continue participating in competitions.""Sinner's results, prize money and ranking points from the ATP Masters 1000 event at Indian Wells, where the player tested positive in competition for clostebol, are disqualified, "" ITIA said in a statement, citing World Anti-Doping Code and Tennis Anti-Doping Programme regulations.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has announced its intention to examine the ruling and has retained the option to challenge it. Sinner has consistently asserted his innocence throughout the process.According to Sinner, the quantity of clostebol detected in his system was minuscule, amounting to less than one billionth of a gram.""I will now put this challenging and deeply unfortunate period behind me,"" the 23-year-old said in a statement posted to social media.The ATP Tour emphasized that the incident ""underscores the need for players and their entourages to take utmost care in the use of products or treatments.""This incident follows another high-profile case involving Simona Halep, a two-time major champion. Halep's initial four-year doping suspension was reduced to nine months earlier this year after she tested positive for a banned substance at the 2022 U.S. Open. She maintained that she had inadvertently consumed the blood-booster roxadustat through tainted nutritional supplements.As the world's top-ranked player, Sinner was already anticipating increased attention upon his arrival in New York for the year's final major, which begins on Monday. However, this situation has added an extra layer of scrutiny, coming just a day after his victory in a significant U.S. Open preparatory tournament in Cincinnati.""It's certainly surprising and shocking, at this moment, especially to me when it happened apparently in March,"" seven-times major winner and ESPN analyst John McEnroe said.""I don't know how they differentiate between one person, you know, sort of saying he was unaware of it and the reasons behind it and then someone else who says the same thing, you know, gets suspended.""Nick Kyrgios disagreed with the ruling.""Ridiculous - whether it was accidental or planned. You get tested twice with a banned substance ... you should be gone for 2 years. Your performance was enhanced,"" Kyrgios said on X.",World's top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner tested positive for a banned substance in two separate drug tests conducted in March. An independent tribunal has exonerated him of any wrongdoing.

If I had a ban, why was I asked (to play)?”That was Mukund Sasikumar venting his frustration on social media after a news report said that he had been suspended for two Davis Cup ties over his non-availability for the World Group playoff against Pakistan earlier this year.Mukund has also opted out of the upcoming World Group I tie against Sweden in Stockholm but for reasons different from the one he had for skipping the visit to Islamabad in February. The 27-year-old had cited ""personal reasons"" then while his refusal to go to Sweden was down to a combination of factors.""I was asked to play (against Sweden) by captain ( Rohit Rajpal ) and coach, and I chose not to play because one, I don't have a visa and two, I just didn’t want to be there due to bad management,"" Mukund posted on Instagram to rebut the report of his ban.AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar said ""the decision (to sanction Mukund) was taken during the executive committee meeting soon after the Pakistan tie,"" but was evasive when asked for more details.""You should ask him (Mukund) why is he not playing for the country. Even when there is a ban, my captain had called him (urging him to play),"" Dhupar said.And that was even more odd: Why would the captain reach out to a player suspended by the association -- unless, of course, there was no ban to begin with?It maybe noted that Rajpal is also the treasurer of AITA, and as such is a member of the executive committee, which according to Dhupar handed out the two-tie suspension.As it turns out, the only information on record is that the chairman of the selection committee, former Davis Cup player and coach Nandan Bal, had recommended that Mukund be not considered for selection since he had made himself unavailable for national duty for a third time.There is neither a reference to Mukund being show-caused nor a discussion of his case by the ethics committee before the executive committee made its decision.The Chennai lad, who had reached a career-high ranking of 229 in 2019 before the pandemic threw a spanner in his works, regretted his emotional outburst on Instagram but reiterated his frustrations.""The medium, what I wrote, the choice of words were not right. I do not want a younger player to express himself in the way I had done, I regret that,"" he told The Times of India.""But the emotions were bottling up. My name had been in the papers for the wrong reasons, it has been there for many months and it got to me.""Mukund was referring to the tie against Morocco in Lucknow last September where he conceded the opening singles rubber due to cramps and was also pulled up by the association for wearing a jersey which had India's name on his back wrongly spelt.""What happened was not fair. You cannot ban a player just like that without informing the player. I would have understood if there was a breach of code (of conduct) or my actions had been harmful to my team.""There cannot be a ban only because I was not available to play. I should not have worn (that shirt), but to be treated like a criminal when it was not intended, how could I have known what's written in the back?""It should have been sorted out in the locker room or through a personal call ... We players are a bit thick-skinned but it is not easy for parents and friends to read about this in the media.""Mukund is not the first player, nor will he be the last, to make himself unavailable for a Davis Cup tie. Sumit Nagal opted out of the Pakistan tie saying his game was not suited for grass while Yuki Bhambri has skipped the Sweden match for reasons unknown.So, why single out Mukund?And the right-hander, who has been going through a challenging phase over the past two years, both on the court since the pandemic as well as off the court, posed some important questions.""It is a misconception that you represent your country only when you play the Davis Cup. It is wrong,"" Mukund had told TOI earlier this year while discussing his decision to not go to Pakistan.""Even when you play a Grand Slam, an ATP or WTA event, or any event, you are representing your country. The top players don't play the Davis Cup, but nobody makes an issue out of it.""There are 100 ways to show your love for your country. Even a simple act of following rules and being a good citizen means a lot.""Or you can help groom the next generation, like Rohan (Bopanna) and Somdev (Devvarman) are doing.""Now, that is something alien to the higher echelons of AITA!","Mukund Sasikumar has been suspended for two Davis Cup ties by All India Tennis Association. The 27-year-old has also opted out of the upcoming World Group I tie against Sweden in Stockholm. AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar said ""the decision (to sanction Mukund) was taken during the executive committee meeting""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112661274,imgsize-32160,width-400,resizemode-4/112661274.jpg"

This decision follows a hearing held on August 15th, where evidence and testimonies were presented.Sinner, who achieved a career-high ranking of world No. 1 in June 2023, provided an explanation for the positive tests.He claimed that a member of his support team unknowingly used an over-the-counter spray containing Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, to treat a minor wound on Sinner. The same team member subsequently administered massages to Sinner, inadvertently leading to the contamination.The ITIA, after reviewing the evidence and accepting Sinner's explanation, concluded that the violation lacked intent.This determination, supported by the independent tribunal's findings, resulted in a ""No Fault or Negligence"" ruling, effectively clearing Sinner of intentional doping charges.The incident occurred during the Indian Wells tournament, where Sinner initially tested positive for low levels of Clostebol metabolites.A second positive test from an out-of-competition sample collected eight days later led to a provisional suspension, which was later lifted following Sinner's successful appeal.Despite the investigation and its impact on his Indian Wells results, Sinner has continued to excel on the court.
