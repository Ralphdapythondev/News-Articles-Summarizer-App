NEW DELHI: Jos Buttler sat out Rajasthan Royals' match against Punjab Kings due to injury, but upon his return, the Englishman orchestrated a remarkable performance, single-handedly leading his team to IPL's record chase against Kolkata Knight Riders at the packed Eden Gardens on Wednesday.Facing a daunting task after Sunil Narine 's explosive 109 off 56 deliveries propelled KKR to a commanding total of 223/6, Buttler showcased immense grit and determination.Despite evident signs of discomfort towards the end, Buttler spearheaded Rajasthan Royals' charge, smashing an unbeaten 107 off just 60 balls.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh showered praise on Buttler for his heroic display, labeling him a 'special player'.However, Harbhajan also slammed Riyan Parag , who impressed with a brisk 34 off 14 deliveries but then carelessly surrendered his wicket to Harshit Rana.""He (Buttler) is a special player. He is a different-level player. He is calm and composed. Whenever he got the chance, he hit sixes, fours and grabbed singles and doubles. When the other players are getting out, it is important to hold your batting and play your own game. A lot of youngsters need to learn from Buttler's innings. Riyan is a talented player. He scored 34 runs but this is how matches are won. You need to be there, you need to hold the fort,"" Harbhajan told Star Sports.""You have that clear mindset to play which shot to play against which bowler. This is not the first time Jos Buttler has done it. He has done this several times and I am sure we will see him do this a lot more time in the future as well. He is one of the legends of the game,"" the former spinner said.Rajasthan Royals, who are on top of the points tally with 6 wins and 1 loss in 7 matches, will face Lucknow Super Giants at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow on April 27.",Jos Buttler leads Rajasthan Royals to record chase against Kolkata Knight Riders.

"Candidates Chess: Gukesh joins Nepo, Nakamura at the top",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/candidates-chess-gukesh-joins-nepo-nakamura-at-the-top/articleshow/109453313.cms,"Hikaru Nakamura is hoping that either he or his American compatriot Fabiano Caruana will end Ian Nepomniachtchi’s run of 40 unbeaten games in the last three Candidates tournament. Even if that doesn’t happen over the course of next two days (Saturday and Sunday) in Toronto, India’s 17-year-old D Gukesh is well placed to get a shot at the title. For, his own compatriot R Praggnanandhaa held Nepo to a draw in the 12th round on Thursday before Friday’s rest day.That meant Gukesh’s win over Nijat Abasov with black pieces took him to pole position with 33-year-old Nepo on 7.5 points and two rounds to go.Nakamura, 36, joined them by beating Frenchman Alireza Firouzja for a three-way tie.As Gukesh’s another countrymate Vidit Gujrathi lost to Fabiano Caruana (7 points), it gave a fresh lease of life to the latter’s campaign. Caruana is just half a point behind the three leaders in this eight-player field.With no place for numeric tiebreak and the provision for rapid tiebreaks (on Monday night) if the players on top tally same number points after 14 rounds, things are set for exciting climax.The pairings of the Candidates are made in such a way that players of same nationality won’t play against each other in the last rounds, thanks to Bobby Fischer’s allegations of fixed draws by the Soviet players in the Candidates cycle of 1962-63. But Pragg can help Gukesh’s cause by getting half a point or full point against Caruana on Saturday.Now, it’s a case of four players — three veteran elite GMs and one fearless youngster — in the reckoning to challenge world champion Ding Liren of China for the World crown later this year.Nakamura, the oldest player in the meet, has won four of the last five games, underlining his jaw-dropping fighting spirit. In the same phase, Nepo and Gukesh have won one and two games respectively.The FIDE presenter asked three leaders about the factors that would play decisive role in the remaining two rounds.Nakamura said, “Probably experience.” Caruana said, “Nerves. And you will need some luck too since you can’t win games if your opponent plays perfectly.”Gukesh said, “A bit of everything, including luck. The person who plays well and manages to remain focused, will have a pretty good chance.”",Hikaru Nakamura is hoping that either he or Fabiano Caruana will end Ian Nepomniachtchi's run of 40 unbeaten games in the last three Candidates tournament.

Odisha FC come from behind to reach ISL semis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/odisha-fc-come-from-behind-to-reach-isl-semis/articleshow/109453026.cms,"KOLKATA: The first knockout of Indian Super League Playoffs lived up to its billing as an extra-time winner from Isak Vanlalruatfela on Friday earned Odisha FC a place in the two-legged semifinal against Mohun Bagan Super Giants .In a show of grit in Bhubaneswar, Sergio Lobera’s hosts held on against a more impressive Kerala Blasters to claim the playoff clash 2-1 to the joy of the home crowd at Kalinga Stadium after the tie ended 1-1 in regulation time.Both teams began with earnestness for the spot in the semifinal against the Shield champions. But the defenders, on both sides, looked to have brought a little more of it on the pitch as they denied attacks to be reflected on the scoreline.While Odisha ended up with better possession in the first half, the only shot on goal came from Blasters’ Hormipam Ruivah in the 22nd minute when he headed a superb cross from Freddy Lallawmawma straight into the hands of Amrinder Singh in Odisha goal.Odisha once again relied on their talisman Ahmed Jahouh to keep creating moves from deep but all those attacks were foiled by the Marko Leskovic and Milos Drincic-led Kerala defence inside the D. The story was being played in the same vein at the other end too, with both teams missing that final touch or shot in the final third in search of a breakthrough.The highlight of the opening 45 minutes was the drama that followed Mourtada Fall sending in the ball with a casual back heel on connecting with a Jahouh cross from the left of the box. While it was first given a goal by the referee, after consultation with the linesman and vehement protests from Blasters, the decision was overturned with Jahouh and Fall both found to be offside.Despite some desperate attempts from both teams to change the scoreline, they left the field for the break with the first knockout of the playoff stage goalless.Jahouh kept sending in measured crosses into the centre and the flank after the change of ends as Amey Ranawade and Jerry Mawihmingthanga kept attempting to make a goal out of them. But Blasters soon took charge of the game with a barrage of attacks near the Odisha goal.Mohammed Aimen and Saurav Mandal displayed the youthful vigour that Ivan Vukomanovic’s team rode this season but it was Fedor Cernych who broke the deadlock in the 67th minute. Aimen sent a pass to the Lithuanian after a delicate first touch as Cernych made no mistake in finding the corner of the net to the right of Amrinder.It was a well-deserved goal for the visitors but they could only maintain the lead for 20 minutes.With Blasters’ injured custodian Lara Sharma taken off field in a stretcher and replaced by Karanjit Sharma, Odisha took advantage of the lapse in focus of the opposition defence as Diego Mauricio scored his 11th goal of the season. He turned in a delectable cross from the right from current top scorer Roy Krishna and brought the home team back in the game and took it into extra time.And it was a replay of the equaliser in the seventh minute of extra time with Jahouh, once again, the conductor of the move. The Moroccan sent an inch-perfect long ball to Krishna on the right of the box and Isak only had to tap it in past Karanjit to break Blasters’ hearts.",Isak Vanlalruatfela's extra-time winner earns Odisha FC a place in the two- legged semifinal against Mohun Bagan Super Giants.

Soto's three-run homer in the seventh inning capped off a five-run rally for the Yankees, who took advantage of defensive miscues by the Rays.The game-changing sequence started with errors by Tampa Bay's Curtis Mead and Yandy Diaz in the seventh inning.Mead's botched grounder allowed Alex Verdugo to reach base, while Diaz's error allowed Jose Trevino to reach safely and set the stage for the Yankees' comeback.After Anthony Volpe's RBI single broke the tie, Soto delivered the decisive blow with a towering home run into the second deck in right field off Rays pitcher Chris Devenski.Soto, who also made a spectacular leaping catch at the right-field fence earlier in the game, showcased his all-around talent and played a pivotal role in the Yankees' victory.Despite a strong start by Tampa Bay's Tyler Alexander , who limited the Yankees to just two hits over 5 1/3 innings, the Rays couldn't hold off the Yankees' late surge.Clarke Schmidt started for the Yankees and delivered a solid performance, allowing just one run on seven hits over 5 1/3 innings.Dennis Santana picked up the win in relief, while Clay Holmes sealed the victory with a game-ending double play to secure his eighth save of the season.The Rays' offense was led by Richie Palacios , who homered in the sixth inning, and Issac Paredes, who drove in two runs with a single in the eighth inning.

What is Apple Watch Noise alert

As MS Dhoni , the revered Chennai Super Kings (CSK) icon, marched onto the pitch, a wave of electric anticipation swept through the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow. The legendary cricketer’s arrival was met with a thunderous ovation that resonated beyond the confines of the arena, stirring the souls of cricket enthusiasts.On this particular Friday, the atmosphere was charged with an intense emotion as Dhoni faced the Lucknow SuperGiants (LSG).The stadium, awash in a sea of CSK’s signature yellow, buzzed with the possibility that this might be ‘Thala’ Dhoni’s final IPL appearance in the City of Nawabs.Capturing the moment’s intensity, Sasha, the wife of cricketer Quinton de Kock , shared an Instagram story that spoke volumes. Her post featured a snapshot of her smartwatch alerting to “Loud Environment: Sound levels hit 95 decibels,” a testament to the roaring support for Dhoni that could potentially lead to temporary hearing loss after mere minutes of exposure.The crescendo of cheers set the stage for Dhoni’s masterclass in batting. The 42-year-old maestro unleashed a spectacular onslaught, hammering the LSG bowlers for an unbeaten 28 runs off just nine deliveries. His powerful performance, punctuated by three boundaries and two majestic sixes, captivated the audience and showcased his enduring prowess.This remarkable cameo not only electrified the spectators but also etched Dhoni’s name deeper into IPL history, as he crossed the milestone of 5,000 runs as a wicketkeeper-batsman in the league.Throughout the current IPL season, Dhoni has been in formidable form, maintaining an undefeated streak and amassing 87 runs with an extraordinary strike rate exceeding 255. His sustained excellence and ability to control the game’s rhythm affirm his status as one of cricket’s all-time greats.The Noise app on Apple Watch measures the ambient sound levels in your environment using the microphone and duration of exposure.

Why is MS Dhoni not batting up the order for CSK? Coach Stephen Fleming reveals the reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/why-is-ms-dhoni-not-batting-up-the-order-for-csk-coach-stephen-fleming-reveals-the-reason/articleshow/109450757.cms,"NEW DELHI: Whenever Mahendra Singh Dhoni steps onto the field, fans anticipate thrilling performances from the legendary cricketer, whether he stands behind the stumps to keep wickets or in front to smash the bowlers. And the former India and Chennai Super Kings ' ( CSK ) skipper hasn't disappointed this Indian Premier League (IPL) seaaon on any count.Dhoni has been in outstanding form during IPL 2024 , sending bowlers on a leather hunt while scoring at a strike rate of 255.88.In the match against the Delhi Capitals in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni came in to bat at number 8 and scored an unbeaten 37 off 16 balls, including four boundaries and three sixes.The Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, where India famously clinched the 2011 ODI World Cup title with Dhoni hitting the winning six, was once again awaiting 'Mahi Magic', and he did not disappoint the fans.Dhoni blasted three consecutive sixes off Hardik Pandya, scoring an impressive 20* runs from just four deliveries.In CSK's last match against the Lucknow Super Giants, Dhoni delivered another powerful performance, scoring 28 runs off just nine balls. His unbeaten innings included three fours and two sixes.Despite his excellent form and ability to rapidly increase the run-rate, it remains unclear why Dhoni is not batting up the order for CSK this season.While explaining the reason, CSK head coach Stephen Fleming said: ""It is inspirational, his batting this season, even in the nets, has been very crisp and the team is not surprised to see what he is doing. His skill level during the pre-season was very high. Other years he had a problem with his knee and he is still recovering, which is why there are only a certain amount of balls he can function well.

‘Fans’ reaction will decide fate of Impact Player’

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant looked at home at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday evening. In between wearing giggle during warmups and sitting down with the Delhi and District Cricket Association staff for long chats, he batted for over an hour in the nights sharpening his power game through the off-side.The square looks fresh and so does Pant. Delhi Capitals are banking on both to consolidate their position in the points table. For, they know ‘power game’ will be the operative phrase when they turn up against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Saturday evening.The pitch here has produced a deluge of runs since the ODI World Cup last October-November. It was a sight to watch SRH’s Travis Head and Pant bat in adjacent nets for a while.“We don’t mind having a shootout tomorrow if it’s a high-scoring game against Sunrisers,” Capitals coach Ricky Ponting wasn’t going to beat around the bush.The SRH batters have wielded their bats to kill games so far in this tournament. One may expect the same on Saturday as well with the pitch expected to play true for the batters.It looks like Capitals have to do all the work.One of the bigger talking points this season has been the effect the ‘Impact Player’ has had on the soaring totals. Ponting weighed in too on it.“This impact player is taking the all-rounders out of the game a little bit. You know you can play your specialist batsman down to (number) 8 pretty much and then you can ring a bell in the second innings. For a coach and for the players, it’s probably not ideal. But I think a lot of what this game tries to do is it tries to entertain people,"" said Ponting.""The T20 game is an entertainment package. It’s probably better asking the spectator what they think about the impact player. If everyone is loving the fact that teams are making you know 220 up to 250 in a lot of the games, then it should stay,” he said.",Delhi Capitals take on Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi Capitals (DC) will face off against the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Match 35 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 on Saturday. DC is currently in sixth place in the IPL 2024 points table with six points, while SRH is tied with Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings, and Lucknow Super Giants with eight points.In their previous encounters, DC has won 11 matches against SRH, while SRH has emerged victorious 12 times in the 23 matches they have played against each other.The upcoming match between Delhi Capitals (DC) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) marks the debut game of IPL 2024 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium . Historically, the pitch at this stadium has been slow and sluggish. However, with a fresh wicket expected for this match, we anticipate improved batting conditions initially. Nonetheless, as the game progresses, the spinners are likely to play a significant role due to the traditionally spin-friendly nature of the pitch.In the 84 matches played at the venue, teams batting first have clinched victory 37 times, while those batting second have emerged victorious in 46 matches.The average first innings total stands at 165 runs, whereas teams chasing have often faced an average target of 149 runs. The highest total ever recorded at this venue was 231/4 by Punjab Kings against Delhi Capitals, while the lowest total stands at 83/10 by Delhi Capitals against Chennai Super Kings.1. Batters can expect favourable conditions initially, but as the match progresses, the pitch will slow down, favouring spinners. Thus, batsmen adept at playing spin will be valuable assets.2. Bowlers will find assistance with the new ball, but as the game unfolds, spinners will come into play.IPL 2024 Stats: 253 Runs in 6 MatchesHeinrich Klaasen, the South African middle-order batsman, has been in exceptional form over the past 10-12 months. This impressive form has seamlessly transitioned into the IPL, where he has emerged as the linchpin of the Sunrisers Hyderabad batting line up. (Here's a list of updated Orange Cap list) IPL 2024 Stats: 9 Wickets in 6 MatchesThe SRH captain had a modest beginning with the ball. However, in the last match, Pat Cummins showcased his prowess by claiming three crucial wickets in a high-scoring encounter against RCB where nearly 550 runs were amassed in just 40 overs. (Here's a list of updated Purple Cap list) 235 runs in 5 inningsTravis Head is currently in outstanding form, providing strong starts to the Sunrisers Hyderabad's innings.

MUMBAI: The ‘ Impact Player ’ rule, which has been under-fire from some quarters, including Indian captain Rohit Sharma and India pace stalwart Zaheer Khan, in IPL-2024 as it makes things difficult for the bowlers and isn’t in operation in international cricket , should be scrapped from the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy onwards from the next season, as it is hampering the growth of domestic allrounders, feels former Mumbai wicketkeeper Sulakshan Kulkarni , who was the head coach of Tamil Nadu last season.“Recently, I was asked for a few suggestions to improve domestic cricket by the BCCI, and I’ve recommended that the ‘Impact Player’ rule should be scrapped from the Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy from next season onwards,” Kulkarni told TOI.“If this rule isn’t in place in international cricket, which means that it wont be there in the T20 World Cup, why is it being used in IPL?,” he added.Explaining why he doesn’t approve of the rule, which allows for a player to be substituted at any stage of the match, Kulkarni said: “It’s a rule which will ensure that we won’t develop all-rounders in domestic cricket. Look at Shivam Dube’s example. He bowled a fair bit in the Ranji Trophy this season (he took 12 wickets for Mumbai in five matches at an average of 12.08), but has not bowled a single ball in the IPL this time (even in the last IPL, when the Impact Player rule came into effect, Dube didn’t bowls a single over). If he doesn’t bowl in the IPL, how does he make a case to be picked for Team India in the T20 World Cup as an allrounder.""Even the likes of Venkatesh Iyer, who has played as an allrounder for the Indian team, has picked wickets for Madhya Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy this season (eight wickets in eight matches at an average of 19.50) and Riyan Parag are not getting to bowl in the IPL. The only Indian allrounder who is bowling is Hardik Pandya, and he too is in poor bowling form.”In blazing form in the IPL season with the bat, Parag took 11 wickets each in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy and in the Deodhar Trophy (both white-ball tournaments) for Assam and East Zone, besides performing well as a batsman.The Mumbaikar pointed out that the plethora of 200-plus scores being made and chased in this IPL was directly due to this rule, introduced by the BCCI last season.“It has made the contest between the bat and ball lop-sided and boring. Now, you suddenly have a big-hitter walking in the death overs, which makes things uphill for the bowlers,” Kulkarni said.During this batsman-dominated IPL, voices against the Impact Player rule have grown louder.“The ‘impact sub’ has been a worthwhile trial but I feel it’s time to revert to just playing XI’s. The sub has created an imbalance between bat and ball, it also covers up for poor selection and auction strategy ,” former Australian allrounder and Sunrisers Hyderabad coach Tom Moody posted on ‘X’.“Ppl what are your thoughts on the impact player?? I for one think it has to go...too much depth in the batting which gives teams the security and the freedom to go hard and hence these crazy scores. Why would I want to be a bowler in the future if this is where the game is heading,” former India batsman Hemang Badani had posted on ‘X’.","Sulakshan Kulkarni feels Impact Player rule is hampering growth of domestic allrounders. Former Mumbai wicketkeeper says it has made the contest between the bat and ball lop-sided and boring. “Impact Player’ rule should be scrapped from the Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy from next season onwards,” he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109452406,imgsize-16884,width-400,resizemode-4/109452406.jpg"

's opening partnership, stating it ""changed the game"" against

(IPL) at the Ekana Cricket Stadium.

Henry heaped praise on the opening duo for their remarkable effort and 'world-class' performance in the chase.

""It was a bit on the slower side and the way the guys adapted to it, we did a really good job.

The amazing opening partnership between Quinton and KL changed the game for us. When you can bat the way they did and the intent they showed but I suppose the batsmanship overall was world class and I think that was the difference at the end of the day,"" Henry said in the post-match press conference.

Henry's compatriot, Marcus Stoinis, echoed his sentiments, highlighting the significance of the opening pair's contribution in chasing down 177.

""Quinny (de Kock) and KL batted beautifully to pretty much seal it and then Nicky (Pooran) came in and iced the cake. That's an important partnership for us at the top. Having that continuity, having them get us off to a start allows us to play the rest of the innings and to build an order around it as well.

We've got that confidence with our team and the nice thing about this season so far is there's been different boys stepping up and chipping in to win these games at different stages,"" Stoinis said after the game.

Ravindra Jadeja

However, his persistent reactions towards the French fans led to a bizarre incident where he was initially shown a second yellow card, seemingly resulting in a red card and subsequent dismissal.Remarkably, Martinez was reprieved due to a rule that states yellow cards awarded during regular time are not carried forward to penalty shootouts.

NEW DELHI: Bundesliga , Germany's top-flight football league, has found itself in a complex situation for determining the teams that qualify for European competitions, particularly the prestigious Champions League . The number of qualifying spots can vary depending on the performance of German teams in the current season's European competitions.Traditionally, the top four teams in the Bundesliga qualify for the Champions League.However, due to the revamped format of the Champions League, which will expand from 32 to 36 teams starting next season, Germany could potentially have five or even six teams in the competition.Two additional Champions League spots will be awarded to the leagues whose teams perform best in European competitions this season. Based on current standings, these spots are likely to go to Italy and Germany, whose teams have performed well in the Champions League and Europa League .The situation becomes even more complex when considering the potential scenarios involving teams like Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, who have reached the Champions League semifinals. If Dortmund were to win the Champions League but finish fifth in the Bundesliga, they would automatically qualify as the defending champions, and Germany would receive a sixth Champions League spot.The battle for European qualification in the Bundesliga is a moving target, with teams like RB Leipzig, Eintracht Frankfurt, and SC Freiburg vying for positions that could secure them a place in the Champions League, Europa League, or Europa Conference League. Even teams like Augsburg, currently seventh, could potentially qualify for the Champions League, depending on the outcomes of various matches and competitions.The Europa League and Europa Conference League qualifications are equally uncertain, as they depend on the results of the German Cup final and the final positions in the Bundesliga table. Remarkably, even second-division club Kaiserslautern could qualify for the Europa League if they manage to win the German Cup against Bayer Leverkusen While the top and bottom of the Bundesliga table provide some clarity, with Leverkusen already crowned champions and Darmstadt facing relegation, the battle for European qualification remains a complex and ever-changing scenario that will likely continue until the final weeks of the season and even after the Bundesliga campaign concludes on May 18.The uncertainty surrounding European qualification in the Bundesliga highlights the competitiveness and unpredictability of the league, as well as the impact of the revamped Champions League format on the qualification process.

Ankita had just won a tournament (in doubles) in Japan just the week before.""Dhupar, however, brushed aside the questionable team combinations fielded by the captain and the coach.After entering Sahaja Yamalapalli in singles and pairing Rutuja Bhosale with Prarthana Thombare against the strong Chinese team, the team's think-tank opted to put Rutuja in singles and hand Ankita the additional duty of doubles for the remaining three ties.It proved to be disastrous as it left Ankita with little time to recover with only a 30-minute gap between second singles and the decisive doubles matches. Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective. ""If I were the coach or the captain, and if I find my No. 1 player not performing, I would put my No. 3 or any other player in,"" Bal, a former Davis Cup player, said.""Try something different, think out of the box. It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players. The captain, the coach and the support staff are appointed by the executive committee of the AITA,"" he said.Both captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule did not respond to request for a comment.",India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week. The All India Tennis Association believes the players have to step up.

Chinese Taipei and Pacific Oceania were relegated to Group 2.Rutuja won all her four matches in singles and her only loss of the week came in the one doubles match she was paired with Prarthana Thombare against the all-conquering Chinese.""For me, it was a very positive week, especially after the ankle injury I had in Mumbai (during the WTA 125K Series event),"" Rutuja said from Shenzhen, where she continued her exploits to win her first-round match in the $40K ITF event.""I didn't think I would be playing singles, but Sahaja had blisters and the captain ( Shalini Thakur ) and the coach (Radhika Tulpule Kanitkar) thought I had the experience, they trusted me.""In contrast to Rutuja's 100 percent record in the week, India No. 1 Ankita Raina had a below-par outing by her standards, winning just one of her five singles matches, although the World No. 255 had to double up for doubles duty as well.Two of Ankita's singles losses came against players whom Rutuja had beaten -- South Korea's Sujeong Jang (World No. 267) and New Zealand's Lulu Sun (167).""We could have qualified. The last day was very stressful. Ankita was a little bit tired, and it rained, so matches were moved indoors,"" Rutuja said.""It was clay but not the best like the one we played outdoors. The clay was coming off and you could see the (hard) surface beneath. We had to stay focussed.""And New Zealand (doubles team of World No. 5 and US Open winner Erin Routliffe and Paige Hourigan) played their best match of the week.""We had seen them play in the previous matches, and we were wondering if they were really World No. 5.""But against Ankita and Prarthana, they took the first set 6-1 in no time and went up 5-1 in the second. We made it 5-5 but they didn't really allow us to get back into the game.""It was a tough week but everyone gave their best.""Rutuja praised Ankita for showing courage to play back to back matches each day, but felt resting her a day could have helped the player's as well as the team's fortunes.""It was stressful for her. But credit to her, she stepped up to play both singles and doubles. Against Chinese Taipei, she had a long singles match (nearly two and a half hours) and then played doubles (after a 30-minute gap),"" Rutuja said.""Shalini ma'am and Radhika ma'am asked her if she could play, and she said she was ready.""She could have been rested one day, maybe against Korea (the day after playing Chinese Taipei). There were a lot of options.""","Rutuja Bhosale says Indian team ""could have qualified"" for the Playoffs of the Billie Jean King Cup.

NEW DELHI: Making a triumphant return from injury, Rafael Nadal demonstrated his dominance at the Barcelona Open on Tuesday by swiftly dispatching Flavio Cobolli .The 22-time Grand Slam champion, who hadn't competed in an ATP Tour match since January, secured a convincing 6-2, 6-3 victory over the Italian in just one hour and 25 minutes, advancing to the second round.Nadal, aged 37, relished the opportunity to compete on clay for the first time since his triumphant French Open win in 2022. Despite the hiatus, he showcased glimpses of his customary brilliance, delivering a solid performance that hinted at his enduring prowess on the court.""It was a good start -- when you return you can't get rid of the doubts in one day, above all, on a physical level,"" Nadal told TVE.""Within what it could be, it was a good first round. He made mistakes and I think I played the game that I had to play.""Nadal, the unparalleled champion with a record 14 triumphs at Roland Garros, is eagerly anticipating his potential participation in May's event, which he anticipates will mark the concluding chapter of his illustrious professional career.The clay court maestro, who endured a significant portion of 2023 sidelined due to injury, is set to take onAlex de Minaur on Wednesday following his effortless victory over Cobolli.""It will be at a speed that I don't know if I will be able to keep up with, but I'll try,"" Nadal said of facing the 11th-ranked De Minaur.After initially facing a 30-0 deficit due to a double fault, Nadal swiftly regained his composure and found his rhythm on the court, capitalising on the fervent support from the crowd in the stadium named in his honor, which seemed to unsettle Cobolli.Nadal seized control of the match by converting his third break point in the fourth game, securing a 3-1 lead. Despite Cobolli's resilience, holding serve at 4-2 down, Nadal's relentless pressure eventually paid off as he broke once again to claim the set in just 43 minutes, punctuating the victory with a triumphant fist pump.Entering the second set, Cobolli's game faltered, conceding a break for a 2-0 lead to Nadal, courtesy of two unforced errors. Though Cobolli managed to break back in the third game, Nadal quickly regained the advantage with another break for a 3-1 lead, aided by Cobolli's third double fault. Nadal efficiently served out the set to secure the triumph.Despite his victory, Nadal's performance on serve was solid yet subdued, lacking in aces and explosive power, yet effective enough to outmaneuver his opponent and claim the win.""I've gone months without being able to serve, (and) although I've got a lot of excitement to play here and do the best I can, I'm not going to go crazy with the serve,"" added Nadal.""I have to serve with caution that the moment I'm in dictates... there are moments in which I feel more liberated and others in which I'm more careful.""","Rafael Nadal beats Flavio Cobolli 6-2, 6-3 in first round of Barcelona Open.
