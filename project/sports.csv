'Tumhein aata hi nahi hai': Ex-Pakistan batsman flays team after defeat against Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/tumhein-aata-hi-nahi-hai-ex-pakistan-batsman-flays-team-after-defeat-against-bangladesh/articleshow/113046485.cms,"Bangladesh 's victory in the second Test at Rawalpindi earned them a historic first ever Test series win over Pakistan , and the way they dominated a team they had never beaten before in red-ball cricket led to a lot of disappointment for the Pakistani experts and fans.The six-wicket win meant Bangladesh whitewashed Pakistan 2-0, after their maiden victory in the first Test of the series that they had won by 10 wickets.""Bhai tumhein aata hi nahi hai, tumse hota hi nahi hai (you don't know how to do it, you are not able to do it). What should I say?,"" said former Pakistan batsman Ahmed Shehzad in a video he posted on X (formerly Twitter).The victory for Bangladesh was significant for the fact that they came back from being 26 for 6 in their first innings, which cut Pakistan's first-innings lead to mere 12 runs.It inspired their rookie pacers Hasan Mahmud and Nahid Rana, who combined to take nine wickets between them and bowl out the hosts for 172, which set the visitors a target of 185 to win. They achieved it with ease on the final day of the match to bring cheer to fans back while the country is going through a political turmoil.""The political condition of their country is not so good. They came, practised in your backyard, and said 'ami tomake bhalobasi ('I love you' in Bengali language), and whitewashed you with that love,"" said Shehzad, flaying Pakistan's lackluster show.""What (brilliant) cricket they have played, how well they have dominated, the way they have batted, bowled...The grit that is required in Test cricket, their batters showed and taught you that. Their bowlers have taught you what disciplined bowling is,"" said Shehzad.After losing the first Test at the same venue, Pakistan rolled out a green-top wicket to help their pacers, which Khurram Shehzad exploited well to take six wickets in Bangladesh's first innings. But Litton Das's century and his partnership with Mehidy Hasan Miraz led Pakistan's fightback thereafter.""You just kept complaining about the pitch. The very same pitch appeared like a flat track when Bangladesh were batting. But when you were batting, your batsmen were on the backfoot, especially against their fast bowler Rana,"" said Shehzad.""This win will be very motivating for Bangladesh fans at a time when their country is going through a tough phase. This will bring happiness for them"".",Bangladesh beat Pakistan by six wickets in the second Test at Rawalpindi. It was Bangladesh's first ever Test series win over Pakistan. Former Pakistan batsman Ahmed Shehzad posted a video on X (formerly Twitter) He said the win will bring happiness to Bangladesh fans in a tough time.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113046495,imgsize-59606,width-400,resizemode-4/113046495.jpg"

Jadhav ends 5th in shot put

Archer Pooja's campaign ends in quarters

NEW DELHI: India achieved its best ever medal haul in the Paralympics , surpassing the previous edition's tally, thanks to an outstanding performance by its track and field athletes in Paris on Tuesday.India's medal count rose to 20, including 3 golds, 7 silvers, and 10 bronzes, breaking the previous record of 19 medals set at the Tokyo Paralympic Games three years ago.On a remarkable day for Indian para sports, the country secured five medals, bringing the total to 20 and placing India at the 17th spot by the end of day six of the quadrennial event. The impressive performance included two silver medals and three bronze medals in track and field events.India had achieved five golds, eight silvers, and six bronzes at the Tokyo Paralympics. This year, the javelin throwers stood out, with Ajeet Singh and world record holder Sundar Singh Gurjar winning silver and bronze, respectively, in the F46 category with throws of 65.62m and 64.96m. The F46 category is designated for field athletes with moderately affected movement in one or both arms or the absence of limbs.High jumpers Sharad Kumar and Tokyo Paralympics gold medallist Mariyappan Thangavelu each gave commendable performances, earning silver and bronze in the T63 finals with jumps of 1.88m and 1.85m. The T63 category is for high jumpers with moderately affected movement in one leg or the absence of limbs above the knee.World champion sprinter Deepthi Jeevanji added to India's medal tally with a bronze in the women's 400m (T20) event. The 20-year-old clocked 55.82 seconds, finishing behind Yuliia Shuliar (55.16 seconds) of Ukraine and world record holder Aysel Onder (55.23 seconds) of Turkey. It was Jeevanji’s debut at the Paralympic Games.Daughter of farm laborers from Kalleda Village in Telangana's Warangal district, Jeevanji was identified with intellectual impairment by a teacher at a school athletics meet. Despite facing societal challenges due to her disability, she achieved significant milestones, including a gold medal at last year's Asian Para Games and setting a world record at the Para World Championships in May.The T20 category is intended for athletes with intellectual impairments. Jeevanji benefited from the guidance of national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand after starting her training with her initial coach, Nagpuri Ramesh.Shooter Avani Lekhara missed out on another medal at the Games, finishing fifth in the women's 50m rifle 3 positions SH1 competition in Chateauroux. The 22-year-old, who has been paralysed waist-down since age 11 due to a car accident, shot a total of 420.6 across the three stages of kneeling, prone, and standing in a highly competitive eight-woman field.Despite not securing another medal, Lekhara has reason to celebrate. She recently made history as the first Indian woman to win consecutive gold medals at the Paralympics, following her top finish in the 10m air rifle competition last week.In the women's 50m rifle 3 positions SH1 competition, Germany's Natascha Hiltrop won the gold with a total score of 456.5. Slovakian shooter Veronika Vadovicova claimed the silver with 456.1 while China's Zhang secured bronze with a score of 446.0.The SH1 class is designated for athletes with lower-limb impairments competing in rifle shooting events. These athletes are able to hold their guns without difficulty and can shoot from either a standing or sitting position, including those using a wheelchair or chair.Bhagyashri Jadhav finished fifth in the women's shot put (F34) at the Paralympics. Competing in her second Paralympic Games, Jadhav recorded a throw of 7.28m.Despite her effort, it was not enough for a podium finish.China's Lijuan Zou took the gold with a season's best of 9.14m, while Poland's Lucyna Kornobys secured the silver with a throw of 8.33m.Jadhav, who is 39 years old and hails from Nanded district in Maharashtra, has an inspiring story. She lost the use of her legs following an accident in 2006, which led her into depression. Supported by friends and family, she made a remarkable turnaround to become a para-athlete.Archer Pooja Jatyan slipped from a two-set lead to go down to heavyweight Wu Chunyan of China 4-6 in the women's recurve open quarterfinals.A winner of four Paralympics medals, including a team gold in 2016 Rio Games, the 34-year-old Chinese archer was nowhere in the picture after a disastrous opening set where she shot twice in the 7-point red ring to aggregate 23 points.Pooja, a former World Para Championship silver medallist, had a superb start as she dropped just two points to take the first set with a five-point margin.The Gurugram-born 27-year-old archer raced to a 4-0 lead, winning a tight second set 25-24 by nailing a perfect 10 in her final arrow.Needing just one set to make her maiden semifinals, Pooja faltered with a 7 in her final arrow of the third set as the Chinese reduced the margin to 2-4 taking the third set 28-27.Pooja slowly started to crumble under pressure as she managed just 24 points in the fourth set.Wu levelled it 4-4 before delivering a knockout punch when she won the decider 27-24, with a perfect 10 in her final arrow.","India's medal count rose to 20, including 3 golds, 7 silvers, and 10 bronzes.

Pakistan lost both Tests, with a 10-wicket defeat in the first match and a six-wicket loss in the second, marking their first-ever Test defeats to this opposition.Masood has faced criticism for both his leadership and scoring only 105 runs in four innings, extending his losing streak to five Tests as skipper.At a post-match press conference, Gillespie asserted that the team's performance, rather than Masood's leadership, was the issue. ""Shan, I feel, has led the side very well. We just haven't played well as a team and that's the reality. We need to sharpen up on certain areas and we will sharpen up. I want to back and believe in these players, they are good enough,"" he stated.Masood responded to the criticism, emphasizing his commitment to long-term improvement. ""I am not worried for my job security. I took this job to make the changes we believe will help this team. If I believe this team can go in a certain direction, even if my personal failure takes Pakistan to that direction, I will be content. However much time I get, I'll be grateful for and do my best,"" Masood remarked during the briefing.The captain highlighted the need for more experience and exposure in red-ball cricket for his team, drawing comparisons to Bangladesh's seasoned players.""Bangladesh have two players who have played 70-90 Tests ( Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahman ), and Litton [Das] and Mehidy [Hasan Miraz] have played close to 40. We need the same level of red-ball exposure. Test cricket is the ultimate format of the game. You need experience. It's obvious we need more Test and red-ball cricket,"" Masood explained.Both players and management appear focused on addressing these issues to improve future performances. The emphasis seems to be on gaining experience and refining skills to better compete in the red-ball format.","Pakistan's red-ball head coach Jason Gillespie has expressed support for captain Shan Masood. Gillespie said the team's performance, rather than Masood's leadership, was the issue.

"US Open: Aryna Sabalenka, Emma Navarro win to set up semifinal date; Taylor Fritz also enters last four",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-aryna-sabalenka-emma-navarro-win-to-set-up-semifinal-date-taylor-fritz-also-enters-last-four/articleshow/113046941.cms,"Emma Navarro , the 13th seed from the United States, has reached her maiden Grand Slam semifinal at the US Open and will face Aryna Sabalenka , who is aiming to capture her third major title overall and second of the season.In the quarterfinals on Tuesday at Flushing Meadows, Navarro staged a remarkable comeback against Paula Badosa. After trailing in the second set, she reeled off six consecutive games to secure a 6-2, 7-5 victory.This impressive win followed her earlier upset of the defending champion, Coco Gauff.“Sometimes you’re out in the court, and you can kind of picture yourself playing a third set. When I was out there, I didn’t picture myself playing a third set,” Navarro said, as quoted by AP. “I felt like ... I could come back and do it in two.”Sabalenka, the No. 2 seed, secured a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory against No. 7 Zheng Qinwen, who recently claimed the gold medal at the Paris Olympics. The match was a repeat of the Australian Open final earlier this year, where Sabalenka triumphed over Zheng to clinch her second straight title in Melbourne.With tennis legend Roger Federer watching from the stands, making his first appearance at the US Open since retiring, Sabalenka showcased her signature powerful game to reach the semifinals in New York for the fourth consecutive year. Last year, she finished as the runner-up to Gauff.When asked how she plans to win over some of the thousands of fans to support her against the American Navarro, the 26-year-old Belarusian playfully remarked, ""Drinks on me!""Sabalenka is aiming to become the first woman since Angelique Kerber in 2016 to capture both the Australian Open and US Open hard-court major titles in the same year.The remaining semifinal matchups will be determined on Wednesday, with No. 1 Iga Swiatek facing No. 6 Jessica Pegula, and No. 22 Beatriz Haddad Maia taking on unseeded Karolina Muchova.Taylor Fritz , the 12th-seeded American, achieved a significant milestone on Tuesday by securing his maiden semifinal appearance at a Grand Slam tournament. In the men's quarterfinals, Fritz overcame Alexander Zverev, the 2020 US Open runner-up and fourth seed, with a hard-fought 7-6 (2), 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3) victory.Prior to this breakthrough, Fritz had struggled in Grand Slam quarterfinals, having lost all four of his previous encounters at this stage. However, he managed to turn the tables on Zverev, whom he had also defeated in the fourth round of Wimbledon earlier this year.“I’ve had a lot of looks at quarterfinals over the last couple of years and today just felt different,” Fritz said. “I really felt like it was my time to take it a step further.”Frances Tiafoe faced a crucial match against No. 9 Grigor Dimitrov on Tuesday night, with the chance to secure a third semifinal spot for the United States. A victory for the No. 20 seed would set up an all-American clash with the 12th-seeded Taylor Fritz in the semifinals on Friday.“That could be crazy, so I guess we’ll see what happens,” Fritz said, “but either way I’ll be ready to go.”Navarro found herself in a precarious position, just three points away from being forced into a decisive third set against Badosa. However, she showcased her resilience and determination by winning the next four points, effectively keeping her hopes alive in the match.This marked the beginning of a remarkable turnaround, as Navarro went on to dominate the remainder of the contest, securing an impressive 24 out of the last 28 points played.“Things weren’t looking great there in the second set, but just tried to be really tough, stick in there, make her hit one more ball,” Navarro said. “I felt like if I could scrap out a few longer points, maybe put some pressure on her, I felt like I could come back and maybe close it out in two sets. Happy with how I was able to do that.”Navarro's performance at her home major this year was unprecedented, as she had never previously secured a victory in the main draw.Badosa openly admitted to struggling with the immense pressure that accompanied her pursuit of reaching the semifinal stage of a Grand Slam for the first time, candidly referring to herself as a ""disaster"" during this challenging period.“I never had the momentum in this match. I played four or five games OK. It was 5-1, but I never felt myself on the court,” Badosa said. “I lost, I don’t know, 20 points almost in a row. It’s very weird for me because I’m quite a consistent player, so I wasn’t expecting that either.”Navarro, who previously defeated Gauff in the fourth round at Wimbledon, suffered a swift 6-2, 6-1 loss to eventual runner-up Jasmine Paolini in the following round, with the match concluding in under 60 minutes.However, the Virginia alumna, who clinched the 2021 NCAA singles title, came prepared for this encounter between two New Yorkers. She quickly gained the upper hand, securing the first three games and capitalizing on an opportunity presented by Badosa in the latter stages of the match.With this victory, Navarro joined an exclusive group of five other players in the past four decades who have reached the US Open semifinals without a prior main-draw win in the tournament. This list features recent champions such as Bianca Andreescu, who achieved the feat in 2019, and Emma Raducanu, who accomplished the same in 2021.","Emma Navarro, the 13th seed from the United States, has reached her maiden Grand Slam semifinal at the US Open.

It is not a fluke. When you lose to Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Ireland, these things are not fluke. It is the reality of Pakistan, you have brought it to this stage.""Shahzad went on to add that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) should be held equally responsible for this nosedive in the performance of the team and needs to stop its distracting tactics.""I don't hold only the players responsible. The PCB is as much responsible for this (downfall) because some things were right before us. Some decisions we had to take, but we did the same old thing of saying things on TV and tried to distract the people,"" the former batsman said.""Uske baad hum soch rahe the ke Bangladesh team aayegi, unko toh hum hara hi lenge (Then we were thinking we will be able to beat Bangladesh easily).

Virat Kohli: 'If you don't score 10000 Test runs...': Harbhajan Singh recalls how he motivated a 'self doubting' young Virat Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/if-you-dont-score-10000-test-runs-harbhajan-singh-recalls-how-he-motivated-a-self-doubting-young-virat-kohli/articleshow/113008916.cms,"NEW DELHI: Harbhajan Singh recently reflected on the early career of Virat Kohli , offering insights into the determination that has driven Kohli to become one of the greatest in Indian cricket . With anecdotes from Kohli’s debut series in 2008 and his early Test struggles in 2011, Harbhajan discussed Kohli’s relentless desire to excel and the subsequent transformation that turned him into a cricketing legend.Harbhajan remembered a memorable incident during an ODI against Sri Lanka in Kohli's debut series in 2008.Kohli scored a half-century opening the innings but felt unsatisfied.""I remember this one incident. Viru [Virender Sehwag] had gotten injured, I suppose. [Ajantha] Mendis was getting everyone out. He comes in; young guy, free energy. He batted and scored a fifty. He asked me, 'Paaji, how did I play?' I said, 'Very well.' He then said, 'Paaji, I shouldn't have gotten out; should have smacked him more.' Loved the attitude,"" Harbhajan recalled while speaking on Taruwar Kohli's podcast.This hunger for more, even at an early stage, hinted at Kohli's future. Harbhajan also highlighted Kohli's difficulties during his debut Test series in 2011 against the West Indies, where Kohli struggled with self-doubt.""If I tell you something about his Test cricket , at the very beginning. We were in the West Indies. On that tour, Fidel Edwards (former West Indies quick) had troubled him a lot, getting him out either LBW or against the short ball. He was getting out time and again, so obviously he was very disappointed. He had self-doubt, questioned 'If I am good enough?' I told him 'You will shame yourself if you don't score 10,000 runs. You have the capability of scoring 10,000 runs in Test cricket. And if you don't, it'll be because of your own fault.' After that, what Kohli has done is a once-in-a-lifetime exception,” Harbhajan shared.These words proved prophetic as Kohli transformed into one of cricket's giants over the next 13 years. During this period, he elevated his batting to unprecedented levels, broke numerous records, and became the face of Indian cricket.""I have seen him change. His diet, his mindset – 'That I don't want to be just an ordinary player. I want to be someone who people will know for a long time.' The stubbornness I saw in myself, Kohli has a lot more of it. I want to be that guy winning games and scoring hundreds for India. He was scoring hundreds back-to-back in Australia. It was the first time India chasing 400 runs… and they are going after it. We may lose but we'll fight. That attitude of keep going, that's what makes you a player. Kohli has left an everlasting impact on Indian cricket,"" Harbhajan added.Currently, Kohli stands at 8,848 Test runs from 113 matches. His journey from a young batsman to a cricketing legend serves as a source of inspiration. With a long cricketing season ahead, Kohli is expected to surpass the milestone of 10,000 Test runs, further solidifying his legacy as one of India's all-time greats.","Harbhajan Singh reflects on early career of Virat Kohli.

Litton Das and Mehidy Hasan Miraz emerged as the architects of Bangladesh's victory, stitching together a match-defining 165-run partnership.This dramatic shift in momentum has drawn sharp criticism, particularly aimed at captain Shan Masood Former cricketer Basit Ali attributed the loss directly to Masood's captaincy, arguing that his tactical decisions allowed Litton and Mehidy to flourish.Basit criticized the team's overall performance as ""third-class"" and urged Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi to address the team's shortcomings.""It was a third-class performance. Pakistan lost the Test match due to captaincy. Captaincy played a key role in the way Litton Das and Mehidy performed after 26/6. There is no need for surgery.

Ripples Ace Royals with Pace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ripples-ace-royals-with-pace/articleshow/113037361.cms,"Kollam crush Calicut

A brilliant exhibition of pace bowling from the Alleppey Ripples ’ seamers, Anand Joseph and Fazil Fanoos , rocked Trivandrum Royals as the hosts slumped to a 33-run defeat in the second match of the Kerala Cricket League (KCL) at the Greenfield Stadium on Tuesday.The bowling effort also helped Alappuzha buck the trend of target setters losing the games in KCL.Chasing 146 for victory, Trivandrum lost two wickets before they opened their account as Fanoos removed both Vishnu Raj and Rohan Prem for ducks.Not to be left behind, his new-ball partner, Anand, claimed a wicket each in his first three overs to leave Trivandrum tottering at 19 for five in the first powerplay.Undeterred by the flurry of wickets, Trivandrum skipper Abdul Basith launched a blistering counter-attack by hitting a sizzling 31-ball 45 (4x4, 3x6). He was associated in a 70-run stand for the sixth wicket with MS Akhil, who made an equally effective 36-ball 38 (3x4, 1x6). But both got out in quick succession, giving Fanoos and Anand the opportunity to return to the attack and clean up the Trivandrum tail as they folded up for 112. While Anand finished with terrific figures of 4/7 from 3.1 overs, Fanoos had an equally impressive bowling spell of 4/16 from four overs.Earlier, Alleppey relied on useful little contributions from their batting unit to post a competitive total of 145/8 in 20 overs on a two-paced pitch. Their top-scorer was Mohammed Azharuddeen (28) while Krishna Prasad (23) and Neel Sunny (21) also chipped in with the bat.In a one-sided contest, Kollam Sailors crushed Calicut Globstars by eight wickets. A three-wicket haul from pacer KM Asif helped Kollam restrict Calicut to 104 for nine in 20 overs. A quickfire unbeaten half-century from Abhishek Nair (61 off 47) helped Kollam overhaul the Calicut target in 16.4 overs.Calicut lost wickets at regular intervals after being asked to take first strike by Kollam skipper Sachin Baby. Captain Rohan Kunnummal (6) was the first to go as he was castled by Asif. M Ajinas (1) followed his skipper soon to the pavilion as he could only spoon a catch to S Midhun at mid-on off Basil NP.Part-time spinner Baby's two wickets hastened Calicut's slide. The only batter to show a semblance of resistance was opener Arun KA, who hit a 37-ball 38 (3x4, 2x6). Asif finished with figures of 3/31 while Basil and Baby claimed two wickets each.It was only due to a late-order contribution from Abhijith Praveen (20 off 16 balls) that Calicut managed to post a score in excess of 100. But with Abhishek smashing three fours and four sixes in his power-packed half-century, the result was never in doubt as they coasted home losing just two wickets.Brief scores: Calicut Globstars 104/9 in 20 overs (Arun KA 38, Abhijith Praveen 20, KM Asif 3/31) lost to Kollam Sailors 106/2 in 16.4 overs (Abhishek Nair 61*, Sachin Baby 19, Ibnul Afthab 1/14); Alleppey Ripples 145/8 in 20 overs (Mohammed Azharuddeen 28, Krishna Prasad 23, Akhin Sathar 2/22) beat Trivandrum Royals 112 all out in 18.1 overs (Abdul Basith 45, MS Akhil 38, Fazil Fanoos 4/16, Anand Joseph 4/7).",Kollam crush Calicut Globstars by eight wickets.

When the hosts offered him options, Raina shut down the suggestion with a mic-drop response: ""I don’t want options!""Watch:This exchange perfectly encapsulates the unwavering trust and camaraderie that Raina shares with Dhoni, his former captain and longtime Chennai Super Kings (CSK) teammate.While doubts swirl around whether Dhoni will play another season of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ), Raina remains firm in his belief that Dhoni has more to offer, especially in mentoring the next generation.Dhoni had passed on the CSK captaincy to Ruturaj Gaikwad ahead of IPL 2024, signalling a transition.However, Raina, who retired from international cricket alongside Dhoni on August 15, 2020, believes the legendary captain should continue for one more season.Raina, speaking to Sports Tak, expressed his desire for Dhoni to guide Gaikwad through another year, helping the young cricketer hone his leadership skills.Raina’s faith in Dhoni isn’t unfounded. Despite battling a knee injury during the last IPL season, Dhoni adapted to a finisher's role, contributing crucial runs lower down the order. His 161 runs in 14 matches came at an astonishing strike rate of 220.25, proving that the ""Thala"" still has fire left in him.As the IPL approaches its mega players' auction for the 2025 season, Dhoni’s future remains uncertain.Dhoni, however, has stated that he will wait to see the auction rules, particularly concerning player retention, before making a decision. “It needs to be in the best interest of the team (CSK),” Dhoni remarked.","Suresh Raina believes MS Dhoni has more to offer.

Skipper Shanto expressed his elation following this landmark victory.""We can't express feelings with words, we are really happy,"" news agency AFP quoted Najmul as saying.""I think before we came here we're looking to win, and the way everyone did their job made me really happy.""Najmul gave his bowlers special praise, saying their recent work had paid off.""Our bowlers were very impressive,"" he said.The spinner Mehidy was player of the series while Hasan and Nahid also played starring roles.Bangladesh next face India in an away two-match Test series starting from September 18.""I hope they will do the same against India as well, which will be a very challenging series,"" said Najmul, whose team has never won a Test against India in 13 attempts.Under-pressure Pakistan captain Shan Masood said his team needed to improve, and fast.Masood has now lost all five Tests since being appointed skipper last year.""We haven't learnt our lessons,"" he said.""We could have bowled them, especially after 26-6 down here, but we let them back in the game.""Pakistan next month face a formidable England, who inflicted Pakistan's first-ever 3-0 whitewash in 2022.",Bangladesh secure landmark first-ever Test series win over Pakistan.

Despite the disappointing outcome, Masood seemed unconcerned about his personal future as the captain. However, he acknowledged that the team was not adequately prepared for the challenges of Test cricket.In a historic first, Bangladesh secured a 2-0 series win by defeating Pakistan by six wickets in the second Test held in Rawalpindi on Tuesday.Masood emphasized the importance of moving forward swiftly from this setback, recognizing the need for the team to regroup and improve their performance in the longer format of the game.""I take responsibility for the defeats and I apologise to the nation. But I think we need to focus on how we can improve and take our Test side forward,"" Masood said in the post-match press meet, as quoted by PTI.Masood acknowledged the challenge of returning to Test cricket after an extended absence of almost 10 months.""There is no excuse for losing this series and we accept that. But it is also a fact that the players also wanted to do well.""But we were just not prepared for red ball cricket. We have to tolerate some failures if we are to move forward,"" he added.Masood emphasized that the first step forward for the team should be to focus on developing a strong pool of fast bowlers.""The main thing is that we need to build our stocks in fast bowling and need to encourage and give consistent chances to those bowlers who regularly play red ball cricket,"" he said.Pakistan's bowling attack faced challenges in maintaining consistency during the second Test match, following the absence of Shaheen Shah Afridi due to being dropped and the decision to rest Naseem Shah, another key pacer in the team.When asked about the notion that the previous two Test matches represented the bleakest period for Pakistan cricket in the past thirty years, Masood expressed his disagreement with this viewpoint.""That is not a fair assessment because we can never underestimate any opposition and I think Bangladesh played more disciplined cricket over us in both Tests.""I think Bangladesh need to be respected for their performances in contrast we made too many mistakes,"" he added.Masood noted that the turning point in the Test came when Pakistan allowed Bangladesh to recover from 26 for 6 in their first innings, eventually reaching 262.The Pakistan captain also emphasized the need for the team to work towards improving their fitness standards.""In Test cricket you need to have the fitness to last five days and also have the intensity for five days and I think that is one area in which we really need to work a lot more.""I think because of this we couldn't capitalise on the opportunities to push Bangladesh out of the game,"" he added.The 34-year-old also rejected suggestions that the management made mistakes in selecting the playing XI.""Sometimes we can make mistakes in selection but it is not intentional and we picked the best eleven we could given the conditions in both Tests,"" he insisted.""Thing is we need to play more red ball cricket. That is the bottom line,"" he added.Masood defended Babar Azam after the senior batter struggled in the series, scoring only 64 runs across two matches with an average of 16.The captain pointed out that the scarcity of red-ball cricket at the domestic level makes it challenging to find suitable replacements.""We are not playing red ball cricket even at domestic level, so how do we replace out-of-form players. But Babar has made runs in the past and he will do it again,"" he said.Pakistan red ball head coach Jason Gillespie offered his support to Masood. ""Shan, I feel, has led the side very well. We just haven't played well as a team and that's the reality,"" Gillespie said.""We need to sharpen up on certain areas. I really want to back and believe in these players. They are good enough and have shown glimpses of how good we are. We just need to do it more often and consistently,"" he added.",Pakistan's Test captain Shan Masood expressed his thoughts following the team's series loss against Bangladesh.

It's always been like this. Is it going to change now? It won't. So I try to follow my path, be as professional as possible, help in the best way possible with my professionalism and not just with goals, assists, discipline, and example, because football is much more than just playing well or scoring a goal.

With two training sessions it's true that it's difficult to change a lot of things. Every coach when arrives at a new club, he wants to improve everything. It's about all aspects of the game.

NEUFC hungry for more after Durand win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/neufc-hungry-for-more-after-durand-win/articleshow/112974236.cms,"“We are still in the cloud. We don’t believe it yet,” were Juan Pedro Benali ’s words at the post-match press conference in Kolkata.But just as he followed it up by reiterating as an afterthought, NorthEast United are Durand Cup champions and had a rousing welcome upon their return to Guwahati with the first trophy to add to their cabinet.“We are really hungry, you know.We are a young team. And till today (Saturday), we didn’t win absolutely anything,” he explained of their undying determination in etching a shoot-out win against a fancied Mohun Bagan Super Giant playing at home.Their failure to have qualified for the playoffs of Indian Super League last season seemed to have added to their resolve in ushering in the new season with a bang.“When you underestimate a team like us, you fail. And the players worked very, very hard. They beat themselves and the result came. I think everyone thought it was finished after Mohun Bagan took a 2-0 lead in the first half. But we are the wolves of the Northeast. We always go hunting. We are hungry. Till the last minute,” added Benali.Their consistent performance – both as a team and in individual brilliance – is vindicated by the fact that along with the champions trophy, the Highlanders have brought home the Golden Ball and Golden Glove for Jithin MS and Gurmeet Singh, respectively.It was also a reward for the belief shown in NEUFC by its sole owner, actor John Abraham, who is the only private owner in an ISL environment of large franchise owners.“The feeling of winning Durand Cup has not yet sunk in. This is just a lesson for all to never give up, to hold on to the team and support the team, not just in winning times but even when we are losing,” Abraham, who was at the Salt Lake stadium to savour every moment of the final, said in a video message on the club’s social media handle.“There’s light at the end of the tunnel and we proved it! Congratulations to the entire team and the staff… I am just a representation standing here talking on their behalf. The real heroes are the staff, the coach, players, and everyone involved in making this team.”The club also posted a video of the frenzied celebration at the team hotel shared by one of Saturday’s regulation-time goal-scorers along with Guillermo Fernandez, Alaeddine Ajaraie, as well as another of their jubilant reserve team players, away for the Climate Cup, watching the match in Leh.While the supporters rushed to the airport in volume to welcome the NEUFC heroes, social media was also flooded with posts acknowledging the historic feat of winning the oldest existing football tournament in Asia.Others hoped this was the beginning of brighter things for the northeast club. And the Spaniard at the helm of guiding them suggested it could be the path they take.“We are a club that develops, we are a club that who we are. We have our feet on the ground. This win will not make us crazy. We’re still fighting game by game,” Benali concluded with hopes of converting their Durand Cup show when the new ISL season starts in two weeks’ time.",NorthEast United beat Mohun Bagan in the Durand Cup final in Kolkata. Juan Pedro Benali's side won on penalties after the match ended 2-2 after 90 minutes. It is the first trophy of the season for the northeast club.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112974276,imgsize-118914,width-400,resizemode-4/112974276.jpg"
US Open: Feel of a final as Daniil Medvedev and Jannik Sinner set up another showdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-feel-of-a-final-as-daniil-medvedev-and-jannik-sinner-set-up-another-showdown/articleshow/113048192.cms,"Top seed

takes on former champ

Medvedev

in QF blockbuster

The Jannik Sinner-Daniil Medvedev US Open lasteight clash has Grand Slam final vibes. The sizzle and storyline of a heavyweight title bout. Mental muscle versus cerebral heft, power versus persistence, speed versus staying might. Reined in rockstar against a mercurial chess master. A box office draw.The world No.1 takes on the fifth seed in the match of the tournament.Sinner and Medvedev - among the top players in the men's draw on this surface, where speed is true and the bounce assured -have history, having already played 12 times.Medvedev leads the head-to-head 7-5, but that is because Sinner only managed to crack the 2021 US Open champion's dominance for the first time in their seventh meeting. The 23-year-old won five successive matches, topping the charge in the semifinals in Miami, where Sinner dropped just three games to the 28-year-old. Medvedev broke that run in July at Wimbledon , where he got the better of the Italian in five sets.Sinner, who has lost just five matches this year, has reached at least the quarterfinals at all four majors this season, becoming just the eighth men's singles player since 2000 to accomplish the feat. ""I will try to think more about Wimbledon than the Australian Open,"" Medvedev said, smiling. ""Against Jannik, we had some tough matches, we know each other's game, maybe I will try and surprise him.""Their play is not hugely different, given that they both like to dictate action from the baseline. The Italian is emphatic in his ball striking while Medvedev, lanky build and laconic style, looks at a strike here and a slap there, outthinking the opponent rather than outhitting him.Medvedev stands so far behind the baseline when returning serve, he might as well be positioned in Times Square, whereas Sinner is always looking to step in and take charge.The only two Grand Slam winners left in the draw, Sinner, winning in Melbourne Park in January, and Medvedev emerging triumphant at Arthur Ashe three years ago, are looking to add to their tally.Medvedev, who is 1-5 in Grand Slam finals, enjoys playing in New York, where he has wooed spectators after a salty exchange early in his run in 2019 when he made the final. Medvedev said, ""In tennis it's important to know that there is always a second chance."" The next week and the week after. ""It's important to continue pushing. Every week we practice, we push forward,"" he said. ""For me sometimes it's not easy. The tougher it becomes in your mind, usually the more matches you lose, the more tournaments you lose in a row. Like we saw some players after the Olympics, it's tough to push nonstop.""Medvedev, who has struggled with his shoulder early in the season, which resulted in a slower serve, has improved with every outing in New York. Sinner, who has looked set from the word go, scored a straight set 7-6, 7-6, 6-1 win over American Tommy Paul to make the last-eight stage.""I had those periods where I lost more tiebreaks. I mean, it's normal, but you try to learn from that,"" Sinner said. ""I come from skiing, where when you make one mistake the race is over. In tennis, it's a bit of a different mentality."" Paul, who got a taste of Sinner's steel, applauded the world No.1. ""He plays a super fast-paced tennis game. Today he clutched up on serves on the big points,"" Paul said of Sinner. ""He does what all the best players in the world do, step it up.""He's unreal out of the corners. Hits a quality ball every time the ball is on his racquet. Sinner is probably the best ball striker on tour. That's kind of what separates him."" Tennis awaits the Medvedev counter.",Daniil Medvedev takes on Jannik Sinner in the US Open quarterfinals. World No.1 has won the head-to-head match 7-5. Sinner beat Tommy Paul in straight sets to reach the last eight.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113048136,imgsize-52244,width-400,resizemode-4/113048136.jpg"

However, he avoided any sanctions after a tribunal discovered that his physiotherapist had inadvertently contaminated Sinner while treating him, having previously applied a spray containing the substance to a cut on his own hand.Despite some players suggesting that Sinner received preferential treatment due to his ranking, Rafael Nadal has come to his defence.Nadal firmly believes that Sinner would never consider using performance-enhancing drugs and that the decision to clear him of wrongdoing was not influenced by his status as the world number one.As Sinner competes at the US Open , Nadal has expressed his confidence in the anti-doping organizations, emphasizing that their judgments should be trusted. He maintains that Sinner's case was evaluated fairly and that the Italian's integrity remains intact.""I have a virtue or a deficit, which is that in the end I usually believe in people's good faith. I know Sinner; I don't believe that Sinner has ever wanted to dope,"" Nadal was quoted by Reuters from the Spanish television show El Hormiguero.""I don't think we have to like it only when it is resolved in the way we think. In the end, justice is justice and I believe in justice. I believe in the bodies that have to make decisions and that really make them based on what they believe is right,"" Nadal reckoned.Sinner was exonerated by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) following two failed drug tests in March. Sinner consistently asserted his innocence, stating that the quantity of clostebol detected in his system was less than one billionth of a gram.Established in 2021 by the sport's governing bodies, the ITIA operates as an autonomous entity.In response to the situation, Novak Djokovic advocated for the implementation of ""clear protocols"" and ""standardised"" procedures when dealing with doping cases. Meanwhile, Nick Kyrgios expressed his belief that Sinner should have faced a ban, regardless of whether the doping was ""accidental or planned"".Despite these opinions, Nadal asserted that the authorities did not grant Sinner any special treatment during the investigation and subsequent decision.""I'm totally confident that if he has not been sanctioned it is because those who have had to judge this case have seen very clearly that there were no sanctions to be imposed,"" added Nadal, who skipped the US Open due to fitness concerns.""I do not believe that because he is Sinner he will not be sanctioned and because he is someone else he will be sanctioned.
