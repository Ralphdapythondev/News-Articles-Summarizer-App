NEW DELHI: Sitting comfortably at the third spot in the IPL 2024 standings with six points, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) have clinched three victories, two of which were secured on their home ground.Their next challenge lies in defeating a struggling Delhi Capitals , currently at the bottom of the table with just one win out of five matches. Despite their solid performance, LSG face concerns in their pace department, with young sensation Mayank Yadav possibly sidelined due to an abdominal issue for the upcoming match.However, even in the absence of key players like Mayank and Mohsin Khan, LSG displayed resilience in their recent encounter against Gujarat Titans, with Yash Thakur's superb bowling securing victory. In the spin department, Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi have been standout performers. Although skipper KL Rahul's batting form has been inconsistent, his leadership remains crucial. Star batters Quinton de Kock and Nicholas Pooran have been in fine touch, while Ayush Badoni and Devdutt Padikkal are yet to shine.Meanwhile, Delhi Capitals are grappling with injuries to key players like Mitchell Marsh and Kuldeep Yadav, further complicating their campaign. Despite relying on pacers Khaleel Ahmed and Ishant Sharma, DC's bowling lineup has struggled for consistency, compounded by Anrich Nortje's ongoing rustiness post-injury.Over the last two seasons, Lucknow Super Giants and Delhi Capitals clashed three times, with LSG boasting an unblemished record against DC, winning all three encounters. The head-to-head tally stands at 3-0 in favor of LSG, showcasing their dominance over DC in recent matchups.Last season, LSG secured a significant victory against Delhi Capitals, largely credited to Mark Wood's pivotal performance for Rahul's squad. Despite Warner and Shaw's explosive start, reaching 40/0 in just four overs, Wood's consecutive breakthroughs disrupted Delhi's momentum.With efforts from Warner to stabilize going in vain, Lucknow's imposing target of 193 remained insurmountable. Kyle Mayers and Nicholas Pooran's contributions were instrumental in propelling Lucknow to a formidable total in the first innings.In the last five matches at Lucknow's Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, the chasing team has emerged victorious each time. This trend indicates that the toss-winning captain in the upcoming match will likely opt to field first. In IPL 2024, the stadium has hosted only two matches, both won by LSG with a margin of over 20 runs.The Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow boasts two distinct types of pitches: red soil and black soil pitches. These varying soil compositions offer diverse playing conditions, influencing the behavior of the ball and the strategies employed by players. Teams need to adapt their game plans accordingly, making the stadium a unique and challenging venue for cricket matches.In Lucknow's Ekana Cricket Stadium, slow bowlers often find favour due to the pitches' tendency to offer low and slow deliveries. Players like Ravi Bishnoi and Kuldeep Yadav are expected to thrive in such conditions. However, teams batting first typically hold the advantage, suggesting that setting a target may be key to securing victory at the venue.Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul (c) (wk), Deepak Hooda/Devdutt Padikkal, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Krunal Pandya, Ayush Badoni, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur, Yudhvir Singh.Prithvi Shaw, David Warner , Rishabh Pant (c) (wk), Abishek Porel, Tristan Stubbs, Axar Patel, Kumar Kushagra, Kuldeep Yadav, Khaleel Ahmed, Mukesh Kumar, Anrich Nortje.Wicketkeepers: Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh PantBatters: Prithvi Shaw, David WarnerAll-rounders: Axar Patel, Marcus StoinisBowlers: Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Anrich NortjeCaptain: David WarnerVice-captain: Axar PatelAs the captain of the team, Rahul's leadership and batting prowess will be instrumental in guiding LSG to victory against DC. Known for his consistency and ability to anchor the innings, Rahul's performance will play a crucial role in setting up a competitive total or chasing down the opposition's score. The Indian international has scored 126 runs in four matches.Having amassed 126 runs in four matches, Nicholas Pooran emerges as a pivotal player for LSG. Pooran's explosive batting style and ability to score quick runs make him a formidable force in the middle order. With his capability to change the course of the game with aggressive strokes, Pooran's performance will be crucial in setting up a challenging total or accelerating the run rate during crucial phases of the match.Warner's vast experience, formidable batting technique, and knack for scoring big runs make him a vital asset at the top of the order. Partnering with Prithvi Shaw, he could anchor the innings while also accelerating the scoring rate when needed. Moreover, Warner's leadership qualities and strategic insights on the field add depth to DC's gameplay, making him a pivotal figure in their quest for victory against LSG.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) are currently third in the IPL 2024 standings. Delhi Capitals (DC) are bottom of the table with just one win out of five matches. LSG face concerns in their pace department, with young sensation Mayank Yadav possibly sidelined.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109236785,imgsize-81952,width-400,resizemode-4/109236785.jpg"

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) head coach Daniel Vettori played down the struggles of Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), emphasizing that defeating the hosts would demand an ""exceptional"" performance from them.The RCB are currently 10th on the IPL table with two points after winning just one out of six matches.""I don't think anyone in any team underestimates the quality of RCB.They're a very good team. So, it's going to take an exceptional performance from us to try and beat them. Every (IPL) game is hard and particularly when you're playing away from home,"" said Vettori during his pre-match press conference in Bengaluru on Sunday.Vettori suggested that RCB may have gleaned valuable lessons from their previous losses in this IPL season. He further implied that the home team could potentially exert significant pressure on SRH on Monday.""RCB will obviously keep learning from what's happened in the previous games and they're going to come out pretty aggressive. We're going to be under a lot of pressure as a bowling unit for how aggressive they are going to be.""So, we need to find ways to counter that and then keep up with our batting form which has been really good,"" said Vettori.The former New Zealand captain cautioned against assuming that a big score is guaranteed at the Chinnaswamy Stadium , emphasising the need for careful consideration and strategic planning.""“I think most teams come here thinking that it's going to be a high-scoring fixture. I've probably seen a couple of surfaces this year that have been slightly slower,"" he said.The former left-arm spinner, who boasts a long-standing association with RCB both as a player and a coach, noted that teams tend to favour chasing at the Chinnaswamy Stadium due to the perceived advantage of controlling the latter stages of the innings.""We understand the ball travels here and the boundary sizes are small. So, I think you have to keep challenging yourself to try and take wickets because any team can score that 60-70 at the backend.""I know no score is safe (here) and I always feel like you're in the game, particularly when you are chasing. Most teams will come here and try to chase because they feel that it's easier to navigate the endings,"" he explained.Vettori commended SRH middle-order batsman Heinrich Klaasen , acknowledging his impressive form in this IPL season.The South African has amassed 186 runs in five matches at a remarkable strike-rate of 193, earning praise for his dynamic batting performances.""He's been exceptional for a long period of time and he's in that category of the likes of (Andre) Russell where teams really fear him in that backend and they set up their bowling plans to try and negate him.""But he's been so good for such a long period of time that he has allowed us to either win the games or always be in the game,"" he added.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) are currently 10th on the IPL table with two points after winning just one out of six matches. Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) head coach Daniel Vettori played down the struggles of RCB, emphasizing that defeating the hosts would demand an ""exceptional"" performance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109290104,imgsize-68886,width-400,resizemode-4/109290104.jpg"

Heiskanen sealed the win with a goal in the third period, extending the Stars' lead to 3-0.Although the Kraken managed to spoil Oettinger's shutout bid with a goal from Kailer Yamamoto in the third period, it wasn't enough to mount a comeback against the Stars' strong performance.In other news, the Kraken made roster moves by reassigning Shane Wright, Ryan Winterton, and Logan Morrison to Coachella Valley of the AHL to prepare for the Calder Cup playoffs.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders think-tank finally heaved a big sigh of relief after star pacer Mitchell Starc returned to form, picking up three wickets against Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ) in their IPL match in Kolkata on Sunday.Prior to this match, the Australian left-arm fast bowler, acquired by the franchise for a staggering sum of Rs 24.75 crore, managed only two wickets in four matches, with an average of 77 runs per wicket and conceding 11 runs per over.Riding on Nicholas Pooran 's (45) late fireworks, LSG posted a respectable 161/7 at the Eden Gardens .Starc, who was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 3/28, claimed Deepak Hooda's wicket before dismissing Pooran and Arshad Khan in the last over of the innings.""Always nice to contribute. We were pretty good throughout the innings. Day game so it was warmer than the last time we played here. Took some time getting used to. Wicket was probably a little two-paced. Not the biggest ground in the world but we were pretty good with the ball. Sunil was fantastic through the middle,"" Starc said at the mid-innings interaction.""All our bowlers chipped in with the ball. Part of my role is to swing that ball, and I look to pitch it up and swing it.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Royal Challengers Bengaluru are synonymous to each other in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Virat has played for RCB since IPL 's inaugural season in 2008 and stuck to it.Virat has been the captain of RCB for several seasons, bringing his aggressive and passionate style of leadership to the team. Under his captaincy, RCB has seen both highs and lows, including reaching the IPL finals in 2016.But Kohli has stuck with the team even though RCB still haven't won the IPL trophy.In a viral video, Kohli explains in a podcast what RCB means to him and why he has not joined any other team.The host asks, ""Virat I know you love RCB just as much as RCB loves you. Even for a moment, for a second, while playing this IPL, have you ever wondered is the grass greener on the other side?""Virat answers, ""To be very honest I have thought about it, yes I won't shy away from it and I've been approached many times as well to come into the auction somehow, put my name in there and stuff. And then I thought about it I was like at the end of the day everyone has X number of years they live right and then you die and then life moves on. And there would have been many great people who want trophies and this that blah blah blah but no one addresses you in the room like ""Oh he's an IPL champion"" or ""he's a World Cup champion"".""And it's like if you're a good person, people like you and if you're a bad guy, they stay away from you and eventually that's what life is all about so for me the understanding that the loyalty with RCB is like how I follow my life is far greater for me than the fact that yes five people in the room would say, ""Oh finally you've won the IPL with whoever XYZ and yeah you feel good for five minutes but then the sixth minute you could be miserable with some other issue in life, so it is not the end of the world for me,"" Kohli adds.Kohli goes on to say, ""What this franchise (RCB) has given me in terms of opportunity in the first three years and believed in me, that is the most special thing because as I said there were many teams who had the opportunity but they didn't back me, they didn't believe in me so now when I'm successful and I should fall to the opinion of people saying ""but the IPL"". This was the case with me till 2018 England tour happened. For four years of my life I was doing well everywhere in the world, the only thing was but ""England"". So there's always going to be buts, you literally can't live your life like that and I just carry on my own thing and I actually honestly don't even bother about a third person beyond myself, Anushka discussing things and just being true to ourselves. And that's it for me, nothing else and no one else's opinion matters at all.""Overall, Virat Kohli's journey with RCB has been marked by exceptional batting displays, leadership challenges, and a strong connection with the team's fan base, making him a central figure in the franchise's history.Despite Kohli's individual brilliance, RCB has often struggled to clinch the IPL title. They have reached the playoffs on multiple occasions but have faced challenges in converting those opportunities into championships.Unlike many other players who have switched teams over the years, Kohli has remained loyal to RCB throughout his IPL career. His commitment to the franchise has made him a beloved figure among RCB fans.Kohli's personal achievements, including multiple centuries and accolades like the Orange Cap , highlight his impact on the team.","Virat Kohli has played for Royal Challengers Bengaluru since IPL's inaugural season in 2008.

I kind of got it in the first game in Gujarat, because he played for them for two years and did not do well as a captain. But then when he went to Hyderabad, I was like, 'What's going on.' Then when he came back to Wankhede, his own home support was booing him. I did not understand that,"" Vaughan remarked.Acknowledging initial booing in Gujarat attributed to Pandya's stint with the Gujarat Titans, Vaughan expressed shock at the treatment Pandya received in subsequent matches, particularly at his home ground.In light of the upcoming T20 World Cup , Vaughan stressed the pivotal role Pandya plays in India's quest for success in the tournament scheduled to begin in June.""What Indian cricket fans need to understand is that Mumbai Indians are Indian fans and for India to win the T20 World Cup, they need Hardik Pandya. They need him to play well. So somehow, over the next few weeks, they need him to get that confidence level right up to the top level, because with India having Hardik flying, they have a great chance in lifting that trophy,” Vaughan asserted.Vaughan's statement serves as a call to action for Indian cricket fans, urging them to support and uplift Pandya's spirit and confidence in the coming weeks of the competition.

NEW DELHI: Sunil Narine 's economical spell during the middle overs and Mitchell Starc 's exceptional final over, which yielded two wickets for just six runs, played a crucial role in Kolkata Knight Riders limiting Lucknow Super Giants to 161 for 7 in their Indian Premier League encounter in Kolkata on Sunday.Despite a shaky start, with Lucknow at 111 for 5 inside 15 overs, they managed a recovery towards the end, largely thanks to Nicholas Pooran 's aggressive innings.Pooran's onslaught included four sixes and two fours. However, just as he was nearing his fifty, Starc (3/28) made a decisive breakthrough in the final over.The Australian speedster, who had faced criticism for his performance in previous matches, especially with only two wickets from four games and conceding 11 runs per over, dismissed the dangerous Pooran (45 off 32 balls). Pooran's attempt to attack a delivery outside off resulted in a nick to the wicketkeeper, Phil Salt.Starc then sealed the over by removing Arshad Khan off the final delivery, restricting Lucknow Super Giants to just six runs in the last over.Playing his 14th successive season for KKR, Narine yet again showed his craft at Eden Gardens when he stifled LSG in the middle overs in his boundary-less show of 1/17 that could prove to be decisive in the end.The Trinidadian came right after the power play just when Rahul and Badoni were looking to capitalise with 49/2 on the board.With the wicket gripping, he varied his pace and deceived the batters with his clever variations and the duo chose to see through his overs.Narine gave away just nine runs in his first two overs, and completed his quota in the 15th over, dismissing Badoni (29) with Angrkrish Raghuvanshi taking a well-judged catch at deep square leg.Under the searing sun and on a two-paced wicket, LSG struggled to hold on to the momentum after the power-play with Narine and Rana bowling with precision.Promoted to No. 4 after his 35-ball 55 not out, Badoni struggled to rotate strike as the KKR bowler duo did well to bring the run-rate down to 7.2 at the halfway mark.Rahul, who looked at ease against the pacers, also began to choke under pressure but he took on Andre Russell in the 11th over for an upper-cut six over deep backward point.In the next ball, he attempted a swivel shot but mistimed it straight to Ramandeep Singh at deep midwicket.Under-fire Starc bore the brunt of Quinton De Kock's fury early on when the South African smashed him for successive fours to start with after KKR opted to bowl.At the other end, Arora was wayward and Rahul tookon the inexperienced seamer, hitting him over extra cover.Against the run of play, Arora drew first blood in the second over, dismissing de Kock for 10 in a rather sloppy display by the South African veteran who took a thickish outside edge to hole out to Narine at short third man.Hooda's promotion to No. 3 also failed to yield desired result as he ate up a lot of deliveries, leaving Rahul stranded at the other end.Hooda finally perished for eight in the fifth over thanks to Ramandeep's flying catch at deep backward point as KKR's fielding looked vastly improved.",Kolkata Knight Riders limit Lucknow Super Giants to 161 for 7 in their Indian Premier League encounter in Kolkata on Sunday.

Despite this, Shimron Hetmyer 's cool-headed innings, backed by Rovman Powell 's timely contributions, guided RR to victory and maintained their top spot on the points table.""I thought that Rajasthan had left a little bit too much to do towards the back end. They just couldn't get any duality through the middle part of that inning,"" commented Finch on ‘ Cricket Live’ show on Star Sports.However, Finch praised Hetmyer's composure under pressure, especially considering his limited playing time in the tournament.

NEW DELHI: West Indies batting legend Brian Lara praised Mumbai Indians (MI) batsman Suryakumar Yadav for his outstanding batting after returning from an injury layoff as they square off against Chennai Super Kings in the IPL 2024 'El Clasico' on Sunday night.While offering his thoughts on the upcoming match between CSK spinner Ravindra Jadeja and Yadav, Lara began by praising the Chennai spinner for his extraordinary abilities, pointing out that in most games, he would depend on slower balls.Speaking on Star Sports Cricket Live, the former West Indies cricketer said, ""Yeah, it's a battle, but you know, okay, those are some stats that you pull out. I mean, those are the times when he may have failed, but this guy is in superb form. And I mean, if he wants to succumb to that and say, okay, I'm going to rematch against you later. I've got other guys I can take on. He can do that as well.""""But I believe that the confidence that he's in, whether it's left arm spin or left arm pace, whatever you call it, I think he's going to drop the slower balls for most battles. And when you have to actually put pace on the ball, it's always dicey. You like pace on the ball where you can carve it in different directions,"" he said.The West Indian also highlighted the expectation of an interesting fight from Suryakumar, suggesting that it would be one to keep an eye on.After a protracted absence due to an ankle injury and sports hernia surgery, Suryakumar rejoined the Mumbai team for the game against Delhi Capitals but was out for a duck. Suryakumar had missed the first three games for MI.However, the batsman was back to his best in the subsequent match against the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), smashing a 19-ball 52 to tie the MI record for the second-fastest fifty.After the 33-year-old hitter returned from a long injury layoff, Lara was amazed by his performance and said he had never seen shots like that from someone who was just returning from injury.""But what I saw a couple of days ago from Suryakumar Yadav is just genius. I think, I've not seen shots like that from a guy who's just coming off an injury, coming off a first-half attack, or at least a zero in the last game. Tremendous. And I think whatever battle will come from Suryakumar Yadav,"" added Lara.","Brian Lara praised Mumbai Indians batsman Suryakumar Yadav for his outstanding batting after returning from an injury layoff.

MUMBAI: Claudio Pizarro may have played alongside Xabi Alonso at Bayern Munich for just one season, but it was enough for the former Peru striker to be certain of what Alonso was planning to do once his playing days were over.""I know him really well,"" Pizarro, who is visiting India for the first time as a Bayern ambassador, told TOI on Saturday. ""We played together at Bayern (2014-15 season).You could see at that time when we were playing that he was going to be a coach.""The way he was analysing the games and talking about what we have done in a game, things like that. He always said that he wanted to do it, and I'm really happy for him that he's doing so well in the Bundesliga .""Not just the Bundesliga, mind you! While Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen would be crowned German champions for the very first time with a win at home against Werder Bremen on Sunday, they are on course to script something even more historic.Having gone 42 matches (37 wins, 5 draws) without tasting defeat once across the three competitions they are competing in this season, Leverkusen are on track to become the first side to complete a record unbeaten season for a top-five European league team.""When you achieve something like that in one season, to play so many games and not lose any, it is something special. I hope that he will continue growing in his coaching career, maybe at Bayern Munich at some point,"" Pizarro added with a laugh.For a while, there was strong speculation that Alonso, one of the most sought-after football coaches in Europe, would indeed succeed Thomas Tuchel at Bayern. Was that laugh then a hint that Pizarro possibly tried swaying his old teammate? ""No I didn't,"" the 45-year-old Bayern great smiled. ""I just congratulated him for all that he is doing.""Everybody thought he was going to come. But he talked to the people at Leverkusen and decided to stay. It's his decision and we have to respect it.""For a player who scored over 100 goals for both Bayern and Werder Bremen, Pizarro also waxed lyrical about current Bayern striker Harry Kane , even if he had sympathy for the England captain who left Tottenham last season seeking to win major trophies, only to see Bayern's 11-year reign as German champions set to end.""I think it is not that easy for him at this point. He came here of course to win titles, but on the other hand, what he has done this year, scoring so many goals, it is something special,"" said Pizarro, underlining Kane's work-rate. ""He's not just standing in the box and scoring goals. He's working on the whole pitch.""I hope of course the next season, he could win some titles with Bayern. We are still in one (competition), could be possible we could get the Champions League at the end.""There's still a long way from that happening. But as Premier League leaders Arsenal discovered during the first leg of their Uefa Champions League quarterfinal in London, which ended in a 2-2 draw, for all Bayern's domestic struggles, the six-time European champions remain a genuine threat on the continental front.""Before the game against Arsenal, everybody was a bit worried and skeptical about what Bayern could do, because the games that they played in the Bundesliga before that were not that good,"" Pizarro, the sixth highest scorer in Bundesliga history (197 goals in 490 matches), said. ""But you can see when it's a Champions League game, in these moments, you can see what Bayern Munich are. They played a very good game and have now got in a good situation to qualify for the next round.""Pizarro knows the feeling of being a Champions League winner, having won the competition in 2013 during his second spell at Bayern which saw the Bavarian giants clinch the treble. The following season, Pep Guardiola would arrive at the Allianz Arena, allowing the Peruvian the distinction of being among the few footballers to have played under both Jose Mourinho and Guardiola, something else he shares in common with Alonso.Which of the two iconic managers left a bigger impression on him then?""Both left a good impression on me. I worked just three months with Jose Mourinho because he then got sacked,"" Pizarro said of the unexpected twist to the start of his spell at Chelsea in 2007. ""At the beginning I was playing a lot and I could talk to him a lot. He was a great coach. He would talk very well with the players.""With Pep, I had the chance to work two years, to know him very well, to know what he's capable of doing in a team, his tactics. I always say that Pep could be five years in front of the other coaches. He analysed the games very intensely. And he knew exactly what player to use for what game and in every situation. He is a very special coach.""Ask Bayern and Werder Bremen fans and they'll tell you - Pizarro was a very special player!",Claudio Pizarro played alongside Xabi Alonso at Bayern Munich for just one season.

But in search of gaining some lost momentum going into the all-important playoffs, the Juggernauts suffered another rude jolt while hosts NorthEast United restored their pride in the last outing of the season with a clinical 3-0 win at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium .Parthib Gogoi, Nestor Albiach and Phalguni Singh scored one apiece inside the first 45 minutes to make it a memorable night for the Highlanders, who finished best among the ones finishing outside the top-six with playoff spots.Odisha, fighting for the League Shield only a couple of weeks ago, looked a shadow of their dominant self at the Highlanders’ home. Sergio Lobera , suspended for the match, could do nothing but look at his wards’ performance from the stands in disbelief. Resting some of their first-team players in the starting XI and taking the overseas trio of Roy Krishna , Ahmed Jahouh and Mortada Fall off at the half-time, the Kalinga Warriors were lacklustre throughout the 90 minutes to say the least.It looks like the long break due to the FIFA international window could not soothe their nerves following their AFC Cup Inter-zonal two-leg semifinal defeat to Central Coast Mariners about a month ago.In the 12th minute, Gogoi brought up a poacher’s goal from a fast counter-attack to give the hosts a deserving lead. The young Assamese striker placed his left-footed shot from centre of the box at bottom left corner following an assist by winger Jithin MS from left.Before the Kalinga Warriors could regroup, NorthEast doubled the lead four minutes later through Albiach’s clinical finish. Upon receiving a through from Gogoi outside the area, the Spanish attacking midfielder first forced centre-back Thoiba Moirangthem to be wrong footed near the centre of the box and then rounded off an onrushing Odisha goalkeeper Lalthuammawia Ralte before placing home a slow right-footed grounder near right post.Odisha, despite enjoying a larger share of possession, failed to convert that into meaningful forays into the opponents’ area. Their first real chance of reducing the margin went begging in the 25th minute when Krishna failed to convert from the spot. It was Krishna’s first penalty miss in ISL. The Fijian striker has converted from all his previous 10 spot kicks in the country’s top-tier league.Odisha winger Pranjal Bhumij had earned the penalty when he was brought down inside the box. But the former Bengaluru FC forward’s weak, low kick didn’t have enough power to beat NEUFC goalkeeper Mirshad Michu to his right.With nothing going in their favour on the night, the Juggernauts suffered another setback on the cusp of half-time when Phalguni wrote his name on the scoresheet three minutes into the first-half stoppage time.Phalguni was at the right place at the right time when Gogoi’s cross from right found him running at the centre of the box.
