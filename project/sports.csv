NEW DELHI: India's wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson is again aiming for a permanent spot in the Indian cricket team , despite making his international debut nine years ago in 2015. With the retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma from the shortest-format of the game, the new leadership - head coach Gautam Gambhir and T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav- has decided to experiment with Samson as an opener in the T20I series against Bangladesh.In the first match of the series at the New Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium in Gwalior, Samson opened the innings with Abhishek Sharma . Samson, displaying his timing and technique, scored 29 runs off 19 balls but did not make a large impact as he was dismissed early.Former Indian opener Aakash Chopra emphasized the need for consistency in upcoming matches, warning that Samson could be dropped if he does not perform well.""He is good. He scored 29 runs. My only thing was that since he had reached here, he should go slightly further ahead. He should score a few more runs because, otherwise, they would drop him. He keeps moving in and out (of the side), and up and down (the batting order),"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.Chopra praised Samson’s elegance in his shot-making during the match in Gwalior. He stated, ""You need to talk about Sanju Samson. Abhishek Sharma was playing amazingly well until he got run out, but how well did Sanju play? Gautam Gambhir said long back that if Sanju Samson doesn't play for India, it's India's loss. He was made to open. The silken touch was seen. He wasn't hitting the ball hard; it seemed like he didn't want to hurt the ball, and he was hitting one four after another.""The 29-year-old Samson's performance in the remaining matches of the series will be crucial for his future with the Indian T20I team .","India's wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson is again aiming for a permanent spot in the Indian cricket team.

Bangladesh's cricket star Shakib Al Hasan might be able to play his farewell Test match at home as he desired, with growing support from top officials on the issue. According to a Cricbuzz report, Youth and Sports Advisor Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain expressed his personal wish for Shakib to end his Test career in Bangladesh.""He (Shakib) is a player who has contributed a lot to the country.Since he wishes to play his final Test match in Bangladesh, I personally hope he gets that opportunity,"" Bhuyain said during the Women's T20 World Cup match between Bangladesh and Scotland on October 3.Bhuyain assured that the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) would ensure Shakib gets top-level security. But he clarified that any allegations against the all-rounder would be handled by the Ministry of Law.""We will absolutely provide the highest level of security for our players...we have already committed to ensuring Shakib Al Hasan's security, and we will honour that commitment,"" he added.Previously, Bhuyain had insisted that Shakib clarify his political stance before receiving security. The shift in Bhuyain's stance has increased the optimism that Shakib might play his final Test at Mirpur, despite challenges from his brief political involvement.Shakib, a former lawmaker, faced allegations related to a murder case last month. He expressed concerns about his safety during a press conference in Kanpur, while playing in the second Test against India.A senior BCB official stated that they are trying to bring Shakib back for the upcoming Test series against South Africa. The official indicated that Shakib's brief political career might work in his favor.""You cannot point fingers at Shakib as a politician since he won the election, but it didn't last long—less than six months—so, how could he be punished for corruption? It's true that he is facing challenges due to his association with a certain political party, but at the same time, he didn't have much involvement as a politician,"" the BCB official said.Shakib is expected to inform the BCB soon about his availability for the South Africa series, moving closer to a possible farewell Test in front of his home crowd.",Bangladesh's cricket star Shakib Al Hasan might be able to play his farewell Test match at home as he desired.

'Special package' yet to be announced

PUNE/KOLHAPUR: It's been over two months since Swapnil Kusale won a bronze medal at Paris Olympics , but the shooting champion says he is yet to hear officially about any reward from state govt.Swapnil had clinched bronze in the men's 50m rifle 3 Position event at the Paris Games on Aug 1. With this bronze, Swapnil became the only second athlete from Maharashtra to win an individual medal at the Olympics.The first athlete to win an individual medal, also a bronze, was wrestler Khashaba Jadhav at the 1952 Helsinki Games. Swapnil's medal came after 72 years.State govt had announced a Rs 1cr award a day after Swapnil won the bronze, but it hasn't been communicated to him officially.The Pune-based shooter Swapnil said he got to know about the prize money from newspapers.While there was no official felicitation programme organized by govt, state minister Chandrakant Patil said govt was planning to offer a big govt post to Swapnil and that they were readying a ""special package"" for him. He said this at a function hosted by Gagan Narang 's Gun For Glory academy in Balewadi. However, Patil was unavailable when TOI tried to contact him for his response to Kusale's comment.While there's no sign of the 'special package', the shooter, who is a Railways employee, said he was told to apply for a regular state govt job. ""I was told to fill in a form, but I decided not to pursue that because of the clauses. It says that the athlete would have to work from the office regularly after 5 years or once he/she turns 30, whichever is earlier. I am already 29 and shooting is my priority, hence I decided to give it a pass,"" Swapnil said.In Kolhapur, Swapnil's father Suresh said the govt was prompt in announcing the big cash rewards for the T20 World Cup winning cricketers from the state. He also said states like Haryana have already honoured their athletes, while Maha govt was still not thinking about Swapnil.Suresh Kusale said, ""Two days ago, state govt declared that a gold medallist in the Olympics will receive Rs 5 crore, a silver medallist will receive Rs 3 crore, and a bronze medallist will receive Rs 2 crore. My question is, how many Olympic medals does Maharashtra have? If there are only two medals in the last 72 years, then what's the point in setting criteria for medal amounts?""Suresh Kusale added that in the 2024 Olympics, India received five individual medals, of which four were from Haryana and one from Maharashtra. ""If Haryana govt, which is smaller in size and has less revenue than Maharashtra, is giving crores to Manu Bhaker Neeraj Chopra , and Vinesh Phogat , then why can't Maharashtra do the same? During the Ganesh festival, Swapnil and his friend met CM Eknath Shinde , requesting an increase in the amount declared by the state govt, but nothing has happened yet,"" he said.Haryana has already transferred the award money to the athletes accounts. With two bronze, Manu got Rs 2.5 crore for each medal, while Neeraj Chopra, who won silver, got Rs 4 crore. Shooter Sarabjot, who won mixed bronze with Manu, got Rs 2.5 crore. Wrestler Vinesh, who was disqualified from the final and lost her silver, was treated as a silver medallist and also got Rs 4 crore.","Swapnil Kusale won bronze in the men's 50m rifle 3 Position event at the Paris Games on Aug 1.

Pacer romancing toil of domestic cricket, says setting short-term goals helps

MUMBAI: Mukesh Kumar 's life has seen so many twists and turns that he doesn't think too far ahead.When asked if he had his eye on selection for the Australian tour during the Irani Cup , he said his ""focus was on the game.""""Right now, the important thing is to justify the faith that the captain has shown in me.Selection and all will keep happening. If I have done well and if I'm deserving, I will be selected. There will be many more opportunities to perform in other matches as well,"" said Mukesh, who, on a placid wicket, was the best Rest of India pacer on display during last week's match in Lucknow, ending with figures of 5/110 in the first innings against Mumbai.His performance overshadowed the others -Yash Dayal and Prasidh Krishna-both auditioning for a spot in the Indian team for the tour Down Under. The right-arm pacer had a decent outing for India B in the Duleep Trophy and, with 15 wickets, was the second-highest wicket-taker in the competition.Born in Gopalganj, Bihar, cricket was never his first choice. He only made the switch after failing to get into the CRPF and Bihar police. He started playing tennis ball cricket, which allowed him to make a living.Later, at his father's urging, he moved to Bengal, where his cricket career blossomed. The beginning wasn't easy. He made his Bengal debut in 2015, but injuries, loss of form, and a lack of opportunities meant he only started playing regularly by the 201819 season.His career skyrocketed after the 2019-20 Ranji season, in which he took 32 wickets, including 6/61 against Karnataka in the second innings of the semifinal, bringing him to the national selectors' attention.Post-Covid, his life has changed for the better. Delhi Capitals bought him for Rs 5.5 crore during the 2023 IPL auction in Kochi, and last year he made his debut for India in all formats.While he doesn't have the same pace as his Bengal teammate Akash Deep, Mukesh bowls that nagging length around off stump which troubles batters. He moves the ball both ways and, most importantly, can bowl long spells.So, what has he learned from his time with the Indian team? ""Being with seniors, you learn the importance of being disciplined. Rahul sir (former coach Rahul Dravid ) and the (former) bowling coach ( Paras Mhambrey ) gave me valuable tips but also made me realise that there's not much difference in terms of skills at the domestic and international level. It's more about mental games at the highest level-being able to deliver in conditions that may be tailor-made or completely alien for you,"" said 30-year-old Mukesh.While he lost his father two years ago, his family's support keeps him grounded.""The support of family matters the most in such situations. Mummy, bhai, they have always stood behind me. They keep telling me that all these (selection) are byproducts, but I should keep doing what I can and what I am good at.""Ever since I started bowling, if you give me a ball, I'm ready to bowl in any match. I grew up playing in the farms, so for me, respecting every jersey I wear and every ground or stadium where I play is extremely important. I'm still eager to play a match, anytime, anywhere,"" said Mukesh.Setting short-term goals is how Mukesh's career has progressed. Initially, his only target was to ""play for India,"" and now that he has achieved that, he wants to test his skills in different countries and conditions. During the Zimbabwe T20I series, he bowled well and showed the selectors what he can do in unfamiliar conditions. Mukesh has been thinking about bowling in Australia, and if that opportunity arises, he will be ""ready"" for sure.",Mukesh Kumar was the best Rest of India pacer on display during last week's match in Lucknow.

ABU DHABI: Ireland captain Paul Stirling led from the front with a dashing 88 as his side completed their ODI series against South Africa with a convincing 69-run win in the final match in Abu Dhabi on Monday.Chasing 285 to win, South Africa slipped to 126/6 with only a fine 91 from Jason Smith keeping them in the game.But Smith was unable to prevent the Irish from claiming only their second ODI win over the Proteas.""It's a relief to get past it,"" said Stirling.""We talked about just winning the game and getting the job done. We let ourselves down in the first two games. We knew if we applied ourselves and kept our wickets in hand we'll get the runs.""Graham Hume, who was born in Johannesburg and played for South Africa Under 19s, was the pick of the Irish bowlers with 3-29 while Ulster-born Craig Young finished with 3-40.South Africa took the ODI series 2-1 with the two sides sharing the preceding T20 series 1-1.Stirling set the tone for Ireland's 284/9 after he won the toss and decided to bat.That was in contrast to the first two matches when Ireland chased, failing to survive past 32 overs as they made 132 and 169 in reply to big South African scores.On Monday, Stirling and Andy Balbirnie put on 101 for the first wicket before Balbirnie fell to Lizaad Williams for a steady 45 from 73 balls.Curtis Campher accelerated with 34 off 36 balls before he fell to Ottneil Baartman who then bowled Stirling in his next over. The captain had hit three sixes and eight fours in his innings.Harry Tector kept Ireland moving with a 48-ball 60 while Williams, the only South African bowler to get through his full 10 overs, finished with 4-56.South Africa's reply was soon in disarray at 10/3 as Mark Adair removed Ryan Rickelton and Rassie van der Dussen, standing in for injured captain Temba Bavuma. Reeza Hendricks edged Graham Hume to Balbirnie at second slip.Kyle Verreynne (38) and Tristan Stubbs (20) steadied the innings with a 49-run partnership but once Verreynne was leg before to Young the wheels came off again.At 126/6 South Africa looked out of it but Smith made sure the Irish would have to wait.The 29-year-old from Western Province, who made nought in his only other ODI against Afghanistan last month, made the most of his chance after being drafted in following Wiaan Mulder returned home for personal reasons.Smith hammered his 91 from 93 balls with nine fours and four sixes before slicing Hume to Adair at third man.",Ireland beat South Africa by 69 runs to win ODI series 2-1 in Abu Dhabi.

The San Francisco 49ers are set to face the Arizona Cardinals in Week 5, and they have opted to change uniforms on short notice to the duller color as it may be the only way to dictate the proceedings against the scorching sun of the Santa Clara area.

The team will only be allowed to wear white pants with their throwback uniforms.""We asked on Monday, and we weren't allowed to do it,"" Shanahan said, via 49ers Webzone. ""You had to [request] it before the season started. So in order for us to do it, we've kind of got to make like a conscious decision or a commitment before the year that we wear all whites until like the middle of October or whatever, and then go to normal. But it's not usually this hot, so we'll probably do that now just in case.”The 49ers may opt to wear white jerseys for the start of the year to avoid future issues. The league vetoed their request, but they can switch to throwback uniforms featuring red jerseys and white pants instead of gold. ""Yeah, they'll let us do our throwbacks, just alternate it with other ones, so we'll get as much white on as possible,"" Shanahan said. ""And the most we possibly can do is white pants, so hopefully, it helps a little.”An excessive heat warning is in effect around Levi's Stadium until Saturday at 11 p.m. PT, with 88 degrees as the highest previous temperature for a game.

Impressed with India's dominating T20I win on Sunday, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali also wondered what happened to the Bangladesh team that registered a historic Test series win in Pakistan before travelling to India.""Is this the same Bangladesh team that whitewashed Pakistan (2-0)? You saw in the Test matches (against India). They lost the first one and then were defeated in virtually two days, even the rain could not save them,"" said the 53-year-old Basit.India hammered Bangladesh by 280 runs in the Chennai Test and then won in Kanpur by seven wickets, despite two days getting washed out by rain, to sweep the series 2-0.Basit was particularly in awe of India's back-up strength, saying the team of young Indian Premier League (IPL) stars led by Suryakumar Yadav made Bangladesh look like an ""appetizer"".""India have changed cricket (with their dominance). Bangladesh is just an appetizer (for them),"" said Basit.The T20I retirement of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja has thrown open spots in the playing XI.""Yeh IPL eleven hai, India ki team nahi hai,"" said Basit, before pointing at the notable absentees from India's playing eleven in the match atGwalior . ""There was no (Yashasvi) Jaiswal, no (Shubman) Gill, no Axar Patel, no Rishabh Pant, no (Shreyas) Iyer; (Ravi) Bishnoi did not play. And still they hammered them in just 11-something overs, finishing with a six from (Hardik) Pandya.""India awarded two debut caps for the match, with fast bowler Mayank Yadav and all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy making their first international appearance.After bowling out Bangladesh for 127, India raced home in 11.5 overs for a seven-wicket win to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Arshdeep Singh (3 for 14) and Varun Chakravarthy (3 for 31) took three wickets each, while Hardik top-scored for the hosts with his stroke-filled 39 off 16 balls, including 5 fours and 2 sixes.""Why did Suryakumar Yadav opt to bowl after winning the toss?"" Basit wondered. ""They should have batted on that 200-run flat track. I don't think they will make that mistake in the second match.""Basit was happy to see Mayank sending the speed gun into an overdrive and hoped he remains fit for India's tour of Australia. The speedster began his stint in the international arena with a maiden over while bowling at top speed.""There were two debuts, but it was a dream debut for Mayank Yadav. The first over was a maiden, including a 149.8 kmph delivery. He could not bowl in the high 150kmph only because he has just recovered from an injury,"" said Basit""Darr baithaya usne aaj (he sent down a scare). Batsmen were always on the back foot.

He took three wickets. Gautam could have seen a lot of him at KKR as well. He's probably just telling him about either the pace at which he was bowling, or the fields which he should bowl. Morne Morkel, the bowling coach, is also there and he will tactically add a lot to Varun's game.""Varun has had a memorable year, emerging as the highest wicket-taker for IPL champions KKR with 21 wickets from 14 matches.He later played for the R Ashwin-led Dindigul Dragons, who won the Tamil Nadu Premier League, finishing with 12 wickets, joint-most for the team and fifth overall.

NEW DELHI: India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya surpassed legendary batter Virat Kohli to set a new record for finishing the most T20I matches with a six. Hardik achieved this milestone during the first T20I against Bangladesh in Gwalior.In the match, Hardik showcased his all-round brilliance. With the ball, he claimed one wicket for 26 runs in his four overs, maintaining an economy rate of 6.50.While chasing a target of 128, Hardik provided the perfect finishing touch, smashing an unbeaten 39 off just 16 balls, which included five fours and two sixes. His blistering knock came at a strike rate of 243.75.One of the highlights of his innings was a no-look ramp shot over the wicketkeeper’s head, a stroke that exemplified his confidence and trademark swagger. Trusting his power, Hardik effortlessly sent the ball to the boundary.By finishing the match with a six for the fifth time, Hardik moved past Virat, who had achieved the feat four times.Additionally, with his solitary wicket, Hardik (87 wickets) overtook pacer Arshdeep Singh (86 wickets) to become India’s fourth-highest wicket-taker in T20Is.Yuzvendra Chahal remains India's top wicket-taker in the format with 96 wickets.As for the match, India opted to bowl after winning the toss. Bangladesh struggled throughout their innings, with skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (27 off 25, 1 four, 1 six) and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (35* off 32, 3 fours) offering the only notable contributions. Bangladesh was bowled out for 127 in 19.5 overs.Arshdeep was India's standout bowler, taking 3/14. Varun Chakravarthy, making his return to the side after a two-year gap, claimed 3/31. Mayank Yadav, Washington Sundar, and Hardik Pandya each took a wicket as well.India's chase started with an unfortunate run-out of Abhishek Sharma (16 off 7). However, Sanju Samson (29 off 19, 6 fours) and captain Suryakumar Yadav (29 off 14, 2 fours, 3 sixes) put together a crucial 40-run stand for the second wicket. Hardik then combined with debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy (16* off 15, 1 six) to secure a comfortable victory with a 52-run partnership for the fourth wicket.Bangladesh’s bowling attack failed to make much impact, with Mustafizur Rahman and Mehidy Hasan taking a wicket each.Arshdeep was named 'Player of the Match' for his superb spell, which included the key wicket of Litton Das. India now leads the three-match series 1-0.","India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya surpassed legendary batter Virat Kohli to set a new record.

NEW DELHI: India's defeat to New Zealand in the Women's T20 World Cup, followed by an ultra-defensive batting approach in their chase of 106 runs against Pakistan, has dealt a significant blow to their chances of reaching the semi-finals.India managed to chase down the modest target against Pakistan on Sunday with some struggle, losing four wickets but with only seven balls remaining.Currently fourth in the group standings with one win and one defeat in two matches and a poor net run rate of -1.217, India face a critical path ahead.Former India fielding coach Biju George expressed disappointment with India’s approach during the crucial clash against Pakistan.""India should have come out all guns blazing,"" George said in an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com.India’s bowlers, led by Arundhati Reddy (3/19) and Shreyanka Patil (2/12), restricted Pakistan to 105/8 in 20 overs. However, the Indian batters failed to accelerate and took 18.5 overs to reach the target.""India bowled well, and their fielding was decent, though there were some fumbles and missed catches. But it was the batting that disappointed. With only 106 to chase, it was a great opportunity to boost the net run rate. India should have chased the target within 14 overs, which would have helped them tremendously,"" George said.They will next take on Sri Lanka and then the formidable three-time defending champions Australia. To stay in contention for the semi-finals, India must defeat Sri Lanka by a substantial margin and edge Australia.George is concerned that India’s negative net run rate will hinder their chances of advancing to the semi-finals. While he believes India can beat Sri Lanka, the match against Australia, on a tricky Sharjah pitch, will be much tougher.""Yes, India won against Pakistan, but the performance must have hurt them. They now face a huge task. If they don’t secure a big win against Sri Lanka, the match against Australia might turn into a virtual knockout,"" George added.""Playing Australia in Sharjah won’t be easy, especially defending totals on that ground. India will need to go hard against Sri Lanka and then find a way to beat Australia. That’s the only path to the semifinals now,"" he said.When asked whether India were underprepared for the tournament, George disagreed.""I wouldn’t say they were underprepared. They had a long camp before the tournament and entered as one of the title contenders. However, several players are carrying injuries,"" he said.""Pooja Vastrakar is injured, and based on Yastika Bhatia’s movement on the field, I believe she’s carrying an injury as well. Fitness is a major concern. In a big tournament like this, you can’t afford to have players with injuries or niggles. They need to be fully fit,"" he noted.However, George concluded with a message to the Indian team and fans: ""Believe. We can still do it.""","Former India fielding coach Biju George expressed disappointment with India’s approach during the crucial clash against Pakistan.

""I don't think that kind of match happened again."" These were the words of Dhanraj Pillay when a chat in 2020 around the India-Pakistan rivalry took him back to Amstelveen in 2003. Maybe, if allowed to pick from among India's most famous wins since the turn of the century against any nation, the former captain will now surely go with the bronze medal win at Tokyo Olympics instead of that Champions trophy match 21 summers ago.Down 2-4 in the good old 70-minute match against a team that had Rehan Butt flying down the flanks and Sohail Abbas shooting rockets off his flicks, India staged a comeback for the ages in 23 minutes of magic.The backstory for Pillay personally had a narrative of revenge from a year ago, when the Pakistan players celebrated in India captain's face following their 4-3 win in the third-place match in the previous edition of the Champions Trophy.To see his team scoring five goals in 23 minutes a year later to come back from the dead and win made the revenge for Pillay a lot sweeter.The heroes of the day for India were Jugarj Singh, Gagan Ajit Singh and Deepak Thakur , who scored two goals each. But it was Pakistan who took a 2-0 lead in the first 20 minutes with Butt and Muhammad Nadeem scoring. Jugraj scored India's first goal through a penalty corner four minutes later, but Mudassar Ali restored the two-goal cushion for Pakistan by making it 3-1.(Screen Grab: FIH)India got another penalty corner just before half-time, and Jugraj once again cut Pakistan's lead to one goal with his second strike.The teams went in at half-time with Pakistan leading 3-2.Drag-flick legend Sohail Abbas got on the scoresheet in the 42nd minute by finding the net on a penalty corner to make it 4-2.With 28 minutes left on the clock, India needed a goal to stay in the match and put pressure back on Pakistan. They found not just one but five goals.Indian forwards, Gagan in the centre, Thakur on the left and Prabhjot on the right, attacked the Pakistan goal like birds swooping on its prey.In a passage of four minutes between the 50th and the 54th, Thakur and Prabhjot scored to make it 4-4. The comeback stunned Pakistan who had no answer to India's full-press.Six minutes later, between the 60th and 65th, the trio of Indian strikers took life out of Pakistan defence that had no answer to their speed and Pillay's brilliant feeding from the centre.The legend let the young Indian stars take centrestage, and they didn't disappoint.Gagan scored two goals in the 60th and 62nd minute to make it 6-4 and Thakur sealed it at 7-4 in the 65th, as all Pakistan efforts of a comeback in the last five minutes were thwarted by India.The match stands as one of the most epic comebacks ever scripted in India vs Pakistan hockey history.","India staged a comeback for the ages in 23 minutes of magic.

NEW DELHI: The return of the uncapped player rule, which had been there since the inaugural edition and only went away in 2021, is a shot in the arm for the Chennai Super Kings CSK ) as it allows them to retain one of most sought-after players in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) for just Rs 12 crores spread over three seasons.That's a short-change for a player like MS Dhoni and the value he brings to the CSK brand and team alike.The IPL Media Advisory on September 28 read, ""A capped Indian player will become uncapped, if the player has in the last five calendar years preceding the year in which the relevant Season is held, not played in the starting XI in International Cricket (Test match, ODI, Twenty20 International) or does not have a Central Contract with BCCI . This will be applicable for Indian Players only.""Talking on the ESPNCricinfo show, former Australia all-rounder and ex-Sunrisers Hyderabad head coach Tom Moody said, ""I think it's a great rule. I think it allows, if you are good enough and you have got longevity, it allows a player to continue to play on the big stage and perform and have some sort of role; without them, I suppose, you are making it difficult, from a price perspective, to retain those players because they might be the identity, or in Dhoni's case, certainly he is the identity of CSK. So, I don't think that's an issue at all. I think the longer the likes of iconic players like Dhoni can play in the IPL and can physically deliver like he has been, it's good for the tournament.""Moody added that the five-year rule can be further cut down to three years.""I personally think five years is a long time; I would like to see it as a three-year window. Once a player has played his last international game, I think if you are out of international cricket or you haven't been considered to play for India over that three-year window, you should be given the right of passage to be able to come in at that four-crow level,"" he added.Dhoni and the CSK top brass are yet to have discussions regarding his future after the retention rules were announced.The former CSK captain had said at an event that he would take a call on his future after the retention rules are announced. The rules are now in and CSK have a chance to retain their former skipper for just Rs 4 crores a season.It not only allows them to retain Dhoni but also reserve the top three retention spots for the likes of Ravindra Jadeja Ruturaj Gaikwad and Matheesha Pathirana .",The return of the uncapped player rule is a shot in the arm for the Chennai Super Kings CSK.

Why Gautam Gambhir era may herald a new legacy in Indian cricket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/why-the-gautam-gambhir-era-may-herald-a-new-legacy-in-indian-cricket/articleshow/114008856.cms,"BCCI Photo

Bouncy, red-soil pitch in Chennai

pushed to No. 5

There is just one cult in that dressing room…

NEW DELHI: The template has been set. The character has been written. Now it is a question of head coach Gautam Gambhir 's consistent approach. If that happens, the legacies of Indian cricket will be written and rewritten.Sunday's T20 game in Gwalior was another mini-step towards establishing the Gambhir era. Picking youngsters, bringing them in at the right moment, packing the team with all-rounders, and going hard in the T20 format are all traits of Gambhir's mindset.You just need to cast your mind back to his Kolkata Knight Riders days as captain and later as mentor or with LSG as their mentor and you will understand. KKR won IPL titles in 2012 and 2014. Those teams were full of all-rounders and multi-utility cricketers. Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hassan, Yusuf Pathan, and Lakshmi Ratan Shukla were all part of KKR. Around them, other players like Rajat Bhatia, Piyush Chawla, and Vinay Kumar could add value in more than one department.Cut to the current T20 setup - Hardik Pandya , Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, currently-injured Shivam Dube, and new-kid-on-the-block Nitish Reddy all tick the box. Others who add value are Rinku Singh and Riyan Prag. The brand of cricket is fearless, something that three times IPL-winning captain and coach Gambhir has always professed.Another aspect that Gambhir swears by is the role of bowlers. ""Batters setup games, bowlers win you titles,"" he would say and ardently maintain. He'd always advocate for playing Test matches with 5 bowlers. Even in white ball format he will make sure that there is a large and rich pool of bowlers.Getting Mayank Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, Harshit Rana and Yash Dayal in the squad is part of that initiative. While the Gwalior T20I provided a small sample the real deal was on show during the recently concluded Test series against Bangladesh.Leading 1-0 in the Test series, India could have easily played for a dull draw in the rain-affected Kanpur Test. But we saw a new India come out all guns blazing on Day 4, shattering records and reputations.At the very bottom of this approach was Gambhir - an aggressive, in-your-face brand of cricket. He has always maintained that for winning in sport you should be prepared to lose, a mindset India happily embraced in Kanpur. The team could have easily been bundled out for a low score while trying to make a match of it but they were willing to risk it.It seemed that Kanpur was witnessing T20 carnage in whites. The fastest 50, fastest 100, 200 and then 250 in Test cricket kept coming. But the real story lies beyond numbers and records.India opted to play on a bouncy, red-soil pitch in the first Test match in Chennai. They wanted to beat Bangladesh and test their own batters keeping the Australia tour in mind. They could have easily opted for under-prepared, rank turners as has been the case in the past while playing at home. Rohit and Co. need to be credited for that because from the England Test series at home earlier this year, the side has adapted to sporting tracks.There is nothing more important than winning for Gambhir. Even when he was Delhi captain more than a decade back, the left-hander opted to play on the spicier surface of Roshanara Club instead of placid tracks at the then Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium. He could have beefed up his numbers by playing at Kotla but he took the tougher route to help the team pocket crucial home points.The 'team first' approach was again on show in another move. Virat Kohli, the most celebrated batter of the team, was asked to bat at number 5 instead of his usual number 4 in Test matches. Rishabh Pant was sent ahead of him to press on the accelerator.Anyone who has followed Indian cricket closely will tell you that it is hard to get a celebrated batter to change his batting slot. Credit to Kohli as well that he happily moved down the order for a bigger cause. It is indeed a very relaxed and happy dressing room.This is not the first time that Gambhir has ignored the stature of a player and based his selection calls on the team's benefit. In 2012 before the IPL final against Chennai Super Kings , he dropped one of the top KKR batters Brendon McCullum. The move was forced due to injury to regular pacer Balaji and Gambhir had to play Brett Lee instead. He recently revealed in an interview that he apologised to McCullum in front of the whole KKR team for that call but he doesn't regret it as it was for the team's cause. That final was won by KKR.Gambhir has always preached and practised that Indian cricket should stop hero-worshipping. From his playing days to his time as a commentator he has been extremely vocal about this facet. One of his first speeches delivered during the KKR training camp earlier this year had this message too.""So people who played with me will know one thing about me, that everyone in this group will be treated equally. There's no senior or junior. There is no domestic or international,"" he said at Eden Gardens before IPL 2024 started. KKR went on to win the title this year with Gambhir as its mentor. He is following that in the Indian team too. There seems to be no preferential treatment to seniors as everyone plays for the team's cause.Gambhir is here to win, to recreate legacies, to play the team sport the way it is meant to be played. All he needs is consistency, courage and of course support of his players to walk this path.","Head coach Gautam Gambhir's consistent approach will be written and rewritten. Picking youngsters, bringing them in at the right moment, packing the team with all-rounders, and going hard in the T20 format are all traits of his mindset. He has always maintained that for winning in sport you should be prepared to lose.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114008783,imgsize-88932,width-400,resizemode-4/114008783.jpg"

Nitya shows shades of famous brothers with 94 vs Oz Colts

Brief scores:

CHENNAI: 'Pandya' rings a bell on the Indian cricket circuit and there's a new Vadodara boy with the surname who is following the footsteps of the more famous ones - Hardik and Krunal.Nitya J Pandya took inspiration from the famous Pandya brothers when he moved to Vadodara chasing his cricketing dreams.On Monday at the MA Chidambaram Stadium , the 18-year-old turned heads not because of the familiar surname, but for his valiant 94 (135b, 12x4) in the second Youth Test against Australia U-19 .The left-handed batter hails from a small village called Anjana in Rajasthan. ""I had to travel a lot to reach my coaching centre in Jaipur, which was far from my village. So my father and I decided to move to Vadodara. At that point in time, the Pandya brothers became famous, and we took inspiration from that and shifted. For the past six years, we have been living in Vadodara. I train at the Motibaug Cricket Club ,"" said Nitya.Apart from Nitya's promising knock, half-centuries from KP Karthikeya (71, 99b; 9x4, 1x6), skipper Soham Patwardhan (61*, 120b, 6x4) and Nikhil Kumar (61, 93b, 7x4) powered India U-19 to a solid 316-5 on the opening day.After electing to bat, India faced an early setback when opener Vaibhav Suryavanshi was dismissed in the seventh ball of the day, caught behind by keeper Alex Lee Young off a short ball from Harry Hoekstra (2-29).Nitya, who usually opens the innings, walked in at No. 3 and quickly set the tone by punishing left-arm pacer Harry for three boundaries - one driven through covers, another past mid-on, and the final one deftly placed to third man. However, Nitya soon lost his partner Vihaan Malhotra, who missed a sweep shot and was bowled by leg-spinner Vishwa Ramkumar.Nitya found an able ally in Karthikeya and the duo formed a strong partnership, adding 112 runs in 27.1 overs for the third wicket. Nitya carefully picked his shots to find the gaps and rotated the strike. This strategic approach not only helped him build his innings but also maintained the momentum for India.Nitya said the target for him was to play throughout the day. ""We lost an early wicket, so the focus was to not lose wickets. We were just focusing on building a partnership. We were not always eager to go for boundaries. Even if we were unable to hit boundaries, we kept rotating the strike. If the strike rotation is good, the opposition will automatically feel low,"" explained Nitya.Nitya eventually gave in to a short ball from Harry, who was making the most of the pitch, which offered low and inconsistent bounce. He mistimed a pull and was caught at deep square leg by Lachlan Ranaldo. A few overs later, Karthikeya followed him after giving a catch to mid-on fielder Aidan O Connor off Christian Howe.Following the sturdy groundwork done by Nitya and Karthikeya, the two new batters at the crease - Soham and Nikhil - kept the scoreboard ticking. The pair stitched a 105-run stand in 31.1 overs for the fifth wicket to further consolidate India's innings. As stumps approached, Soham closed the day on a high by striking Vishwa for two consecutive boundaries.India U-19 316-5 in 90 overs (Nitya J Pandya 94, KP Karthikeya 71, Soham Patwardhan 61 batting, Nikhil Kumar 61; Harry Hoekstra 2-29) Vs Australia U-19",Nitya J Pandya scores 94 in second Youth Test against Australia U-19.

SHARJAH: England put up an all-round show to outplay South Africa by seven wickets for their second successive win in the Women's T20 World Cup here on Monday.

NEW DELHI: South Africa's batting coach JP Duminy made an unexpected return to the field during the third and final ODI against Ireland in Abu Dhabi on Monday.Known for his distinguished international career before retiring from all formats of cricket in July 2019, Duminy was called upon to fill in as a substitute fielder due to fatigue and heat exhaustion affecting some of South Africa's players.The intense desert heat left several of the team's regular fielders struggling, prompting the team to look for immediate reinforcements.While it's unusual for a coach to step onto the field in an active game, Duminy’s experience and fitness made him an ideal candidate to temporarily fill the gap.Watch:His presence on the field added an interesting piece to the game, showing his willingness to step up for his team even in a non-playing capacity.Having lost their previous two games, Ireland, meanwhile, put up a strong fight in their final ODI of the series, with Paul Stirling leading the charge by smashing 88 runs.His partnership with captain Andy Balbirnie (45) helped Ireland to a much-improved total of 284/9, their highest of the series. Harry Tector also contributed a valuable 60, while Curtis Campher's quickfire 34 off 36 balls provided a boost in the middle order.Despite Ireland’s improved batting display, South Africa’s bowlers, especially Lizaad Williams, made crucial breakthroughs.Williams was the pick of the bowlers, taking four wickets for 56 runs in his 10 overs.Ottneil Baartman and Andile Phehlukwayo supported well, with two wickets each, ensuring South Africa remained competitive in the match.Duminy’s impromptu stint as a fielder, however, was the highlight as his enduring connection with the game and the lengths to which the team was willing to go to adapt to challenging conditions were on full display.",South Africa's batting coach JP Duminy made an unexpected return to the field during the third and final ODI against Ireland in Abu Dhabi on Monday.

India set to participate in Hong Kong Sixes as the tournament returns after seven-year hiatus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/india-set-to-participate-in-hong-kong-sixes-as-the-tournament-returns-after-seven-year-hiatus/articleshow/114019040.cms,"Team India (PTI Photo)

Each match consists of five six-ball overs per side, with all players except the wicket-keeper required to bowl one over.



The batter must retire not out upon reaching 31 runs but can return to bat once lower-order players have finished their innings.



If five wickets fall before the completion of five overs, the last remaining batsman continues to bat while the fifth batsman acts as a runner, always taking strike until the sixth wicket falls, ending the innings.



This rule encourages aggressive batting and plenty of sixes, which is the hallmark of the tournament.



Wides and no-balls count as two runs.



Two points are awarded for match victories, making every game in the round-robin stage critical for progression.

MULTAN: Pakistan opener Abdullah Shafique is happy to contribute to the team's total after smashing his fifth Test century in the first Test against England in Multan on Monday. He termed it as a 'next level feeling' after ending his century drought in 2024.Pakistan captain Shan Masood won the toss and opted to bat first on the flat pitch and the decision paid well for the team.Apart from Shafique, Masood also reached the three-figure mark with his solid 151-run knock including 13 fours and two sixes. Pakistan are in a solid position with a total of 328/4 at stumps on the opening day of the match.Despite losing Saim Ayub for only four runs in the fourth over, Shafique and Masood stitched a massive 253-run partnership for the second wicket. Shafique was dismissed by Gus Atkinson for 102 post Tea. His innings included 10 fours and two sixes.""Feeling happy because performing for the team is a next level feeling. It happens (his low scores in three consecutive Tests). It's not an easy game. I was focusing on the process.

The dismissal extended his poor run in Test cricket, leaving fans disappointed once again.What added salt to the wound was the reaction of fans in the stadium.Several spectators were caught on camera sleeping during Babar’s innings, a moment that quickly went viral on social media.Fans expressed their frustration online, trolling the Pakistan skipper for his continued lacklustre performances.Despite Babar forging a 61-run partnership with Saud Shakeel , his inability to convert starts into big scores is becoming a pattern that has fueled criticism, especially given Pakistan's dominance earlier in the day.Pakistan still ended Day 1 in a commanding position at 328/4, thanks to Masood and Shafique’s heroics.

KOLKATA: Beginning its journey with eight teams 11 summers ago, Indian Super League (ISL) has gradually expanded to 13 teams over these seasons.After being left out of the country's new top-tier ahead of the erstwhile premier division I-League, Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan and East Bengal were included into ISL at the start of the 2019-20 season. Then, honouring the AFC-AIFF envisaged future roadmap for Indian football, I-League champions Punjab FC were promoted to ISL last season.Keeping up with the promise, Kolkata giants Mohammedan Sporting Club - as the current I-League winners - were also added to the lot before the start of the ongoing 2024-25 season. However, despite being the country's highest level of competitive football, ISL is yet to achieve the desired level of fan following among the supporters of the participating clubs.However, Bhaichung Bhutia , the former India captain and one of the few legends to play the game in the country, believes that Mohammedan SC 's presence will add to the intensity of the Kolkata derbies , which in turn will make Indian football more exciting for the fans. The Sikkimese Sniper – as Bhutia was famously known in his playing days, also hopes that the huge fan-bases that come along with the teams like MSC will result in a wider popularity of ISL.""It's great for teams with a huge fan base such as Mohammedan SC to come into the ISL. I have always advocated for Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, and Mohammedan SC for coming into the ISL, because these are the teams that have huge passionate fans across India. To make the ISL competitive and interesting, you need those derbies and passionate fans to be there,"" Bhutia said in an exclusive interview shared with TOI.With talismanic India skipper and striker Sunil Chhetri hanging up his boots four months ago, Bhutia had a straightforward message for the youngsters who are shouldering the responsibilities of the Indian team under the stewardship of new head coach Manolo Marquez.""You need to be consistent with the national team. You need to start delivering, and it's teamwork. Obviously, you will have great coaches, but as a player there should be consistency in performances, and you need to keep working hard,"" Bhutia added.Asked to pick his favourite teams for the season, Bhutia said, ""It's difficult to predict the favourites for the title. Mohun Bagan (Super Giant) have put in a lot of budget to make a great team. Mumbai City FC, who didn't have a great Durand Cup, are a team that will always have a good side. FC Goa have been consistent throughout the years. I think these are the few teams that are going to be favourites for this season.""Over the years, ISL has moved on from its novelty factor as global stars - well past their prime - have stopped coming to India to join a developing league for a season or two. But Bhutia personally still loves to go down the lane when asked about his memorable moments from the league.""My best memory of the ISL will always be the first year, with some of the greatest footballers around the world coming and playing for us. In the first season, you had players like (Alessandro) Del Piero, Nicolas Anelka, Robert Pires, and a lot of big stars playing with our own local players!"" he said before signing off.",Bhaichung Bhutia believes Mohammedan SC will add to the intensity of the Kolkata derbies. The Sikkimese Sniper also hopes that the huge fan-bases that come along with the teams like MSC will result in a wider popularity of ISL. The former India captain also has a straightforward message for the youngsters.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114019332,imgsize-766534,width-400,resizemode-4/114019332.jpg"

The visitors capitalised on the hosts' defensive frailties, with goals from Muhammed Riyas (12), skipper Abdul Hakku (20), Barfo Ernest (45+2), and Kervens Belfort (58).Davi Kuhn scored the lone goal for the hosts.From the start, Calicut displayed a strong attacking intent. Kervens Belfort had a good opportunity to score in the fourth minute when he received the ball inside the box, but his shot went over the crossbar. Calicut's efforts paid off in the 12th minute when Muhammed Riyas headed the ball into the net. Khangenbam Thoi Singh received the ball inside the box from a long pass and cut it back from the right edge to find an unmarked Riyas.

After winning a corner kick, Calicut skipper Abdul Hakku ran unnoticed into the Kombans box. With the ball perfectly positioned for a header, Hakku was in the right place to head it past Thiruvananthapuram goalkeeper Pawan Kumar to double Calicut's lead. Gani Muhammed nearly scored Calicut's third goal in the 28th minute, but his direct free kick hit the crossbar.Thiruvananthapuram coach Sergio Alexandre switched the positions of wingers Ganesan and Muhammed Ashar, hoping Ashar's speed would pressure Hakku and create space for other forwards in the Calicut box.

LONDON: India will play against Togo in the Davis Cup World Group I Play-offs to be held between January 31 and February 2 next year, according to the draw conducted by the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) on Monday.The draw, which includes both World Group I and II play-offs, will see 52 nations compete in 26 home-and-away ties around the globe from either January 31-February 1 or February 1-2.World Group I play-offs will feature 26 countries while another 26 will compete in World Group II play-offs.India will feature in the World Group I Play-offs with the dates to be determined by the host nation.An official of the All India Tennis Association ( AITA ) told PTI that its team will play at home.""It will be a home tie for our team,"" the official said.India had beaten Pakistan 4-0 in the 2024 play-offs in February in Islamabad to qualify for the World Group I. However, the Indian team lost to Sweden in Stockholm in September to drop down to Group I play-offs again for the 2025 edition.According to the official Davis Cup website, the choice of ground for the tie between India and Togo will be decided by lot at a later stage.Under the competition format, if the nations competing against each other have never previously met, last time met before 1970, or if they last faced each other at a neutral venue, then the choice of ground is decided by lot.India is yet to win the Davis Cup, having finished runner-up three times -- 1966, 1974 and 1987.The revised Davis Cup structure for the 2025 season has required some nations to play at a higher level than would have been the case in the previous format.Two nations which lost World Group II ties in September -- and would have competed in the 2025 World Group II play-offs -- will compete in the World Group I play-offs, the ITF said.Four nations which did not win promotion from regional Group III events -- and would not have played again until the 2025 Group III events -- will now contest the World Group II pay-offs next year.Winning nations from the 2025 World Group I play-offs will compete in World Group I ties in September alongside the losing nations from the 2025 Qualifiers first round.Losing nations from the 2025 World Group I play-offs and winning nations from the World Group II play-offs will compete in World Group II ties in September, the ITF added.",India will play against Togo in the Davis Cup World Group I Play-offs next year.

Vijay Amritraj wasn't looking at a map or eying a landmark. The tennis legend was merely marking the steps to oblivion. Amritraj was trying to wrap his head around the fact that India only had one player in the top-250 of the ATP and WTA rankings - Sumit Nagal at No. 83. This has been the case for over 12 months for the men.The 70-year-old pressed, ""How come this isn't spoken about enough?"" India has 10 doubles p layers in the top-150 of the individual doubles ranking, despite shrinking draw sizes.""No kid picks up a tennis racket to play doubles, you play for singles,"" Amritraj said.Amritraj, who was president of the ATP Player Council from 1989 through to 1992 and again in 1994, cautioned that this isn't singles versus doubles, a fight India can ill afford.Still, questions must be asked. Where are India's singles players? What are the programmes we have supporting them?The All India Tennis Association (AITA) claimed to have 'conducted' 829 tournaments in 2023 but the AITA had little to show by way of numbers, like players coming out of this ostensibly robust system.AITA's tournament calendar - across age-groups - is conducted by the 28 member state associations, some clubs and even by parents desperate for their children to get match practice. The tournament structure clearly doesn't come together as a platform to launch Indians on international Tours -juniors or pros. Just a bunch of well-meaning people trying to shore up the game. Rohan Bopanna 's 'Doubles Dream of India', a programme that supports doubles specialists, has kept Indian tennis on the world map. Hardly surprising, then, that India's non-playing Davis Cup captain Rohit Rajpal played an unranked doubles player in a live singles rubber in a World Group 1 tie in Stockholm last month. The visitors, without Nagal, who was injured, failed to win a set.Somdev Devvarman who topped at No. 62 in the rankings in 2011, and Purav Raja, a doubles specialist, weren't amused. The same could be said of a lot of players, but these two decided to take the bull by the horns, taking the AITA to court for violation of the Sports Code.The players, however, haven't always been united. Nobody knows this better than AITA, who have made good use of the situation in the past - Krishnans and Amritrajs; Paes and Bhupathi. Divide and rule. It will be interesting to see what the nomenclature would read like this time as another set of players have been in talks with AITA, educating themselves on opportunity in administration.",India only has one player in the top-250 of the ATP and WTA rankings.

All the buzz through the week had been around her 15-year-old rival, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , but it made little difference to Vaidehi Chaudhari .The 24-year-old from Gujarat, who hadn’t dropped a set the whole week, maintained the clean slate by taming Maaya 6-3, 6-3 to reclaim the women’s singles title at the Fenesta Open National tennis championship in New Delhi on Saturday.“It was a really good match. I was playing a young girl. I had pressure as I was the top seed here, and had won the title before also. She (Maaya) had nothing to lose,” said Vaidehi, referring to her success in the tournament in 2022.She had also been runner-up to Shrivalli Rashmikaa last year, making it “three finals in a row”.Tamil Nadu’s 17-year-old Rethin Pranav claimed the men’s singles title, overcoming Nitin Kumar Sinha of Railways 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 for his maiden championship.Maharashtra’s Prisha Shinde clinched the Under-18 girls’ trophy, fighting back from 2-5 in the second set to beat Tamil Nadu’s Diya Ramesh 1-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in a two-hour long final.Aradhya Kshitij of Karnataka lifted the boys’ title with a 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 win over Manipur’s second seed Shanker Heisnam.The women’s final lasted an hour and 35 minutes, but it could have been even shorter. Vaidehi was up 5-0 in the second set when Maaya fought back to make it 3-5 before the Indian Billie Jean King Cup player nipped the late challenge from her rival.“I started cramping at 5-0. I was sick, was having cold and fever the last three days,” revealed Vaidehi.The title caps a fine run in the past few months for Vaidehi, starting with the $25,000 title in Chinese Taipei in June and followed by a semifinal in Kazakhstan and another final and a semifinal in Thailand.Despite the progress on court, it has been a struggle for Vaidehi to improve her tennis finances.“I was travelling alone in Taipei, and it was really hot out there. I played really well, I beat two players ranked higher than me. I was down 0-6, 0-3 in the second round, but came back strongly. In the final, I was again first set down. It’s the biggest title of my career so far,” she said.“The challenge for me is, being a woman, I cannot travel alone to some places (tournament venues) because they are not safe. If I take sponsorship, then I can have someone to travel with me,” said Vaidehi, who has her own travelling expenses covered by the Gujarat State sports authority.Yet, now that her goal for the year of winning a $25K title is achieved, Vaidehi is looking ahead with positivity.“I have slowly taken one step at a time. Now I am just more confident,” said Vaidehi, who will be travelling to Australia after a 10-day break.“There are a series of five big tournaments. I am looking forward to playing my first $75K event.”",Gujarat's Vaidehi Chaudhari won the women's singles title at the Fenesta Open National tennis championship in New Delhi on Saturday.
