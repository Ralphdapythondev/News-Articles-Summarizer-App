However, skipper Ben Stokes encouraged his team to strive for a higher purpose -- to become the side that will forever be etched in people's memories.The England and Wales Cricket Board recently released a three-part documentary series titled 'Ashes 2023 | Our Take,' which sheds light on Stokes' thought process during pivotal moments of the closely contested 2023 Ashes.Following the drawn fourth Test in Manchester last July, which was marred by rain and resulted in Australia retaining the urn, Stokes delivered an impassioned speech to his crestfallen teammates.""Everything we've done up until now isn't going to stop because we haven't managed to win the urn back. The reward for our work isn't what we get but what we become,"" said Stokes who, with head coach Brendon McCullum , has pioneered the 'Bazball' philosophy.""And what we have managed to do is we've managed to become a sports team that will live forever in the memory of people who were lucky enough to witness us play cricket,"" said Stokes, according to cricket.com.au.""I know it's going to be a bit flat, it's going to hurt that we go into the next game (at The Oval) not being able to get the urn back. But what we have done is something a lot bigger than any Ashes trophy could ever signify for this team – be the team that everybody will always remember.""Under the guidance of McCullum and Stokes over the past two years, the England cricket team has achieved an impressive record. They have secured victories in 14 Test matches, while suffering defeats in eight and settling for a draw in one.""Any decision I make will never be based on 'well, we're definitely not going to lose if we make this one, so I'll go with it',"" Stokes said, as quoted by PTI, in the documentary.""It will always be about what's going to give us the best opportunity to win a game.""Stokes' predecessor Joe Root expressed a more balanced perspective regarding the national cricket team. Root's assessment of England's performance and potential differed from Stokes' view.""I don't think anyone thinks we're something we're not. We're not trying to say that we're the best team in the world,"" Root said in the final episode of the documentary.""One of the sayings that comes out of the dressing room ... is teams might be better than us, but they won't be braver than us.""And it's a great way to play the game,"" said Root.",England captain Ben Stokes urges his team to strive for a higher purpose.

His assessment aims to provide further context as the governing board and chairman Naqvi deliberate on the next steps.Pakistan's upcoming cricket commitments include a two-Test series against Bangladesh followed by three Tests against England.It is expected that senior players like Babar Azam and Muhammad Rizwan will not opt for breaks during these important fixtures.The PCB governing board meeting is expected to result in minor adjustments and a renewed focus on the overall structure of domestic cricket.

He admitted that his initial intention was to prevent a boundary, and he acknowledged the role of fielding coach T Dilip in that pivotal moment which ultimately led to India's World Cup victory.Throughout the tournament, Suryakumar made significant contributions with the bat, amassing 199 runs in eight matches at an average of 28.42.His performances included two half-centuries and other valuable innings in challenging situations. Additionally, he showcased his exceptional fielding skills by taking several remarkable catches during the World Cup.In the final over of the match, with South Africa requiring 16 runs from the last six deliveries, Miller, renowned for his ability to deliver match-winning performances under pressure, attempted a powerful shot.Suryakumar showcased his exceptional fielding skills near the boundary line. He managed to grab the ball, but his momentum carried him over the boundary. With great presence of mind, he tossed the ball up in the air, crossed the boundary, and swiftly returned to the field of play. He then calmly completed the catch, displaying his agility and quick thinking.This extraordinary feat by Suryakumar proved to be a game-changer, swinging the momentum in India's favor. The dismissal of the South African batter for 21 runs dealt a significant blow to their chances of victory. Ultimately, the Indian team emerged triumphant, securing their second ICC T20 World Cup title by a narrow margin of seven runs.Speaking to Revsportz, as quoted by ANI, Suryakumar said, ""When I started running I was not thinking of the catch. I was running with every iota of strength in my legs to make sure I somehow saved the boundary. I wanted to throw the ball back in and save two or three runs at least for the team. And honestly, I was not thinking of the catch. When I reached the ball and it came into my hands I realised there was an opportunity for me to take the catch and toss the ball up. I felt I could go out and come back in to complete that catch. I had 5-7 seconds to make that call and let me say to you I will forever remember these 5-7 seconds in my life. I made the call and it worked out for us.""Suryakumar admitted that he felt the pressure to successfully execute the catch, stating, it would be a lie to say that he was not. However, he emphasized that the team had put in significant effort to improve their fielding skills under the guidance of T Dilip, the fielding coach.During their training sessions, the players had diligently practiced taking at least 150 catches similar to the one Suryakumar encountered in the match. This extensive preparation aimed to enhance their ability to handle high-pressure situations on the field.""He has worked very hard with us and each one of us have taken out 15 mins during practice to train with him. As batters, we can contribute only in one department and often fielding goes unnoticed. But here each one of us have trained separately and the results are showing. The catch, I will say, is a product of the work we have put in,"" he concluded.","Suryakumar Yadav discussed his crucial catch that dismissed David Miller in the T20 World Cup final against South Africa.

Turkey adopted a 5-4-1 system and were content to let Austria control possession, looking to catch their opponents on the break. This strategy disrupted Austria's usual straightforward playing style.Despite missing their suspended captain Hakan Calhanoglou, Turkey's defensive strategy paid off as Austria failed to register any shots on target in the first half.

The US squad struggled to create significant chances and never seemed capable of seriously challenging the well-organized Uruguayans.""It's difficult to say right now, obviously the emotions are running high,"" a disappointed US captain Christian Pulisic was quoted as saying by AFP after the game. ""We had a good start and brought a lot of energy, but just didn't have enough quality. We just couldn't find a solution.""Hopes for the US dimmed early as news arrived that Panama had taken a 1-0 lead against Bolivia in Orlando within the first 30 minutes. The Americans' prospects brightened briefly in the second half when Bolivia equalized, making the score 1-1 and giving the US a potential path to qualification if they could hold Uruguay.However, those hopes were short-lived. Uruguay took the lead through Mathias Olivera in controversial circumstances in the 66th minute. Ronald Araujo’s powerful header from a Nicolas de la Cruz free-kick was parried by US goalkeeper Matt Turner, only for Olivera to score on the rebound.

In their first tour-level meeting, Muller, ranked 102nd, took the first set in a tiebreak.

LONDON: If there was a question surrounding Novak Djokovic ’s right knee – which went under the knife in Paris less than a month ago – the seven-time champion’s sparkling performance under dull skies at Wimbledon was an adequate response.The 37-year-old, playing with a knee brace, was all over Centre Court -- sliding, stretching, reaching and charging - playing without a care in the world.The Serb's play sparked the missing sun in his near two-hours in the middle.Djokovic’s record-extending 371st Grand Slam match win 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 came at the expense of the 27-year- old Vit Kopriva, a qualifier, who was making his main draw debut at SW19.“Coming into Wimbledon this year was very different because of the knee, I didn’t know how everything was going to unfold, practice sessions are very different from actual match play,” Djokovic said as the sun finally made an appearance at this leafy London suburb, where light rain had interrupted the schedule on the outside courts.Djokovic, making his 19th consecutive Wimbledon appearance, said, “I tried to really focus on the game and not think about the knee too much. Everything I could’ve done, I have done over the last three weeks to be able to play here today. If it was any other tournament, I probably would not have risked it, would not have rushed it as much, but I just love Wimbledon.”Djokovic, who has had one other surgery in his career, on the elbow six years ago, sent out love to fellow athletes battling injuries.“I’ve been fortunate, comparing myself to other 37-year-olds. I had injuries like anybody else, but they come and go. It’s part of what you do. You just have to accept it and embrace it,” he said. “Andy Murray withdrawing is a great blow to the tournament. Great respect to him. All he’s done in this tournament… In this sport. I hope he’ll be able to finish his career on his terms. I heard he’s going to play doubles. Hopefully he’ll give it another shot next year in singles. I just send him my best… It’s worth acknowledging all these athletes that are struggling.”A combination of nerves and physical struggles coupled with an inspired performance from the world No.83 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, put out defending champion Marketa Vondrousova in the first round.Bouzas Maneiro, the 21-year-old from Spain, looking for a maiden tour-level win on grass, scored a 6-4, 6-2 win on Centre Court, which was also her first match win in a Grand Slam.The 25-year-old world No.6 seemed to be bothered by her right hip which she hurt after a nasty fall on court in Berlin last month, the Czech was clutching her leg in the second set.“Today I was a bit scared because of my leg,” an emotional Vondrousova said. “But I don't think that was the reason. I felt nervous from the start. She was playing a good match. That was kind of tough too. I feel like everybody just expects you to win maybe. That's tough, too.”",Novak Djokovic beats Vit Kopriva in straight sets at Wimbledon. Defending champion Marketa Vondrousova crashes out in first round.

Sumit Nagal shows heart and fight at Wimbledon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/sumit-nagal-shows-heart-and-fight-at-wimbledon/articleshow/111439309.cms,"LONDON: The sun had faded, the sky was grey, and the westerly was gentle. It was just past 8 pm on Church Road.Sumit Nagal was on his courtside seat, shaking his head. He used his towel as an afterthought. The Indian had his higher-ranked opponent Miomir Kecmanovic on the ropes in the ninth game of the third set at 15-40. The 24-year-old’s second serve was met by a stinging Nagal forehand that pulled the world No.52 wide.The Serbian responded with a deep ball which Nagal hesitated in dispatching into an open court and instead came up with a weak response.Nagal, who made his Wimbledon main draw debut on Monday, finally fell 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6 after a 2-hour 39-minute battle.“Had I won that 3-5 game (in the third set), it could’ve been a different story,” said Nagal. “The match momentum was shifting and obviously when he holds (ninth game) that changes again. It put him ahead two-sets-to-one.”The residue effect was obvious early in the fourth set.“The serving was especially poor,” Nagal said of his play, “if you are missing a lot of first serves, you are always behind, more so when you’re playing on grass.”It was a little past 10 pm, about an hour after the conclusion of the match, and the 26-year-old’s expression still mirrored the lost opportunity.“It was an amazing experience to play my first main draw here at Wimbledon,” he said. “This surface is tricky, you need to have a bit of experience, very tough to go out there and be able to perform the way you want to.”Former world No.1 (doubles) Mahesh Bhupathi, who mentors Nagal, and Rohan Bopanna cheered at courtside.Nagal’s head is constantly ticking, often between points he stretches out his right and uses his index finger as if he were giving directions to a pedestrian. For someone who is quick when chasing a tennis ball across the rectangle, Nagal takes his time getting around otherwise. There’s a swag to his step.Nagal, who peppered the court with winners, 47 in all, delighted with his single-handed backhand slice, which troubled Kecmanovic, especially early in the match.“It’s effective on this surface, especially when you’re running to your backhand side,” said Nagal, who played with a single hander for a good part of his junior years, only switching to a two-hander at 14.“I used to slice a lot when in the juniors,” he said. “But I wanted to really improve my backhand and so changed to a double-hander, which I have improved on a lot in the past few years.""","Sumit Nagal loses to Miomir Kecmanovic in four sets at Wimbledon. Indian loses 2-6, 6-3, 3- 6, 4-6 after a 2-hour 39-minute battle. Nagal made his Wimbledon main draw debut on Monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111439219,imgsize-47482,width-400,resizemode-4/111439219.jpg"
