NEW DELHI: Indian hockey has been on an upswing, especially after the men’s team’s back-to-back medal-winning campaigns in the Olympics and the recent title triumph in the Asian Champions trophy.Given hockey’s growing popularity, Hockey India (HI), the sports national federation , has revived its Hockey India League (HIL) after a hiatus of seven years.HIL promises to break new grounds in a country where cricket calls the shots.HI on Friday announced the return of HIL with the introduction of eight men’s and six women’s teams after working on the idea for six months. HIL is returning in a bigger and better avatar — as a money-spinning vehicle to lure top hockey players from across the world worldwide through big paycheques.A total of 10 franchise owners have come on board. The players’ auction is scheduled between Oct 13-15 here. HI has entered into an agreement with team owners for the next 10 years to run the league, and it’s the huge investment both by HI and the franchises which has set the tongues wagging.TOI has learnt that Rs 3,640 crore will be spent on the league over the next 10 years, with HI chipping in with an investment of Rs 112 crore each year, largely banking on HIL’s title sponsor(s), other promoters and broadcast deal.According to sources, HI has pledged a total investment of Rs 1,120 crore for 10 years to sustain the league. There are a total of 14 teams with some among the 10 owners buying multiple city-based franchises. It’s been learnt that franchises will spend around Rs 18 crore on each team (men and women) every year which translates into Rs 252 crore for 14 teams. So, for the next 10 years, franchises will shelve out Rs 2,520 crore – largely on players and coaching support staff’s salaries and grassroot development of the sport through their hockey academies. So, considering HI’s contribution of Rs 1,120 crore and franchises’ spending of Rs 2,520 crore, HIL will boast of a total investment purse of Rs 3,640 crore.It’s been learnt that out of Rs 18 crore to be spent by rach team, the players’ purse for every franchise has been fixed at Rs seven crore for men and Rs four crore for women each year. Each franchise will build a 24-player (men and women each) squad, consisting of 16 Indian players with a mandatory inclusion of four junior players and a maximum of eight international players.Players will be auctioned in three categories with their base price being Rs 2 lakh (for juniors), Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. For example, if the Indian men’s team captain Harmanpreet Singh reserves his base price at Rs 10 lakh, he could be bought for a much higher amount. The team owners have to ensure that they adhere to the cap of Rs seven crore for building their men’s squad.The return of HIL will mark the first time a standalone women’s league will run concurrently with the men’s competition. “The introduction of an exclusive women’s league within the HIL framework will provide a powerful platform for female athletes to demonstrate their prowess, paving the way for a more inclusive and competitive future for Indian hockey,” HI president Dilip Tirkey said.FIH , the sport’s world governing body, has given sanction of 10 years for HIL. A dedicated window between the last week of December and first week of February has been created for the league. No other competition will take place during that window to ensure the top foreign players remain available for selection.Tirkey added it was his dream to revive the league since taking over the charge of the federation. ""Premier Hockey League started the culture of league in the world. Since the day we were elected it was our dream to revive the league and today the dream has been fulfilled. HIL has been and will be a supply chain for the national teams. HIL is going to create a history for the sport. HIL is very important for world hockey. We are thankful to the FIH for giving us a 35-day window.""",HIL promises to break new grounds in a country where cricket calls the shots. HI has entered into an agreement with team owners for the next 10 years to run the league. There are a total of 14 teams with some among the 10 owners buying multiple city-based franchises.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113954469,imgsize-60886,width-400,resizemode-4/113954469.jpg"

BRIEF SCORES:

It's a tough group and this wasn't the start the Indian girls were looking for. Everything went wrong for them at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday evening as the Women In Blue crashed to a 58-run loss.While fielding wasn't up to the mark when New Zealand batted, the famed Indian top-order struggled miserably on a sluggish pitch, losing early wickets in a chase of 161.It was crucial for India to have a good start, but opener Shafali Verma gave a tame return catch to offie Eden Carson in the second over.The likes of Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues knew that it was mandatory to have a good Powerplay to stay in the hunt. But Smriti and Harmanpreet were dismissed within the first six overs — it seemed they were struggling to read the pace of the pitch.Jemimah departed soon after and the rest was just a walk in the park for the New Zealanders. It was only the third time that India were all out in a T20 game, their innings coming to a close in the 19th over for 102. In the lead-up to the World Cup, head coach Amol Muzumdar has repeatedly emphasised the importance of fielding and fitness.Despite all the hard work that had been put in, the girls struggled in these two departments as New Zealand put up a fighting 160-4. Openers Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer steadily built their partnership as Indians kept misfielding and even dropped a crucial catch early on.In the final over of the Powerplay, two glaring mistakes displayed India's early struggles in the field in hot conditions. First, Renuka Singh , stationed at deep square leg, misjudged a regulation stop to allow a boundary to Plimmer. Then, Bates enjoyed a huge slice of luck on 18. A top-edged sweep went high into the air, but wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh, attempting a reverse-cup, failed to hold onto the catch.There were errors at the backend of the innings as well that helped New Zealand give India a tough target on a sluggish pitch.After Plimmer and Bates were dismissed, the class of NZ captain Sophie Devine (57*, 36b; 7x4) took over. She brought all her experience into play and used her feet well in dealing with the Indian slow bowlers. She waited for the loose balls and played some strong shots which allowed New Zealand to push their run-rate up. Devine was rebuilding the New Zealand innings with Amelia Kerr, who came in at No. 3, when the latter was handed a lifeline on 13.Kerr and Devine were going for a second run when Harmanpreet, at long-off, fired a throw to the keeper's end. Kerr was run out by Richa, while at the same time, the umpire handed back Deepti's hat at the other end. The umpire deemed the action to be over before the attempted run-out happened, leaving Harmanpreet and the support staff unhappy.Kerr did not last long after the reprieve as she was caught by Pooja Vastrakar at mid-off off Renuka Singh. However, after Kerr's departure, Devine took charge and powered NZ to a strong finish along with Brooke Halliday. The duo plundered 46 runs off 4.2 overs on a pitch where stroke-making was far from easy, and it took the game completely away from India.New Zealand 160/4 (Sophie Devine 57 not out, Georgia Plimmer 34; Renuka Singh 2/27) bt India 102 in 19 overs (Harmanpreet Kaur 15; Rosemary Mair 4/19) by 58 runs.",India were all out for 102 in the 19th over against New Zealand. Sophie Devine (57) and Brooke Halliday (46) powered New Zealand to victory. It was only the third time that India have been all out in a T20 game.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113954064,imgsize-182388,width-400,resizemode-4/113954064.jpg"

LAW 20 FOR DEAD BALL:

20.1.2 - The ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler’s end umpire that the fielding side and both batters at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play.

20.2 - Ball finally settled: Whether the ball is finally settled or not is a matter for the umpire alone to decide.

20.3 - Neither the call of Over, nor the call of Time is to be made until the ball is dead, either under 20.1 or under 20.4.

20.4.1 - When the ball has become dead under 20.1, the bowler’s end umpire may call and signal Dead ball if it is necessary to inform the players.

NEW DELHI: In an unusual turn of events at the T20 World Cup 2024 match between India and New Zealand in Dubai on Friday, Amelia Kerr was declared not out by the on-field umpires despite being short of her crease, as they had already signalled the end of the over.The incident unfolded when Kerr hit the ball towards long-off for a single on the last ball of the 14th over.India's captain, Harmanpreet Kaur , picked up the ball and took a few steps into the circle without throwing it.Seeing this, New Zealand skipper Sophie Devine called for a second run. However, the umpire had already handed the cap to bowler Deepti Sharma , indicating the end of the over.Realising the situation, Harmanpreet quickly threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end, where Richa Ghosh swiftly removed the bails, catching Kerr well short of the crease.As Kerr began walking back to the dressing room, the umpires - Anna Harris and Jacqueline Williams -intervened, stating that it was a dead ball and the review was not applicable.This led to an animated discussion between Harmanpreet and the on-field umpires, with the Indian captain arguing that she only threw the ball because the New Zealand batters had taken the run. However, her arguments did not sway the umpires' decision.Team India's head coach, Amol Muzumdar , also expressed his dissatisfaction with the decision and engaged in a lengthy and animated conversation with the fourth umpire.Despite the protests, the on-field umpires remained firm in their stance that the over had been called, and Kerr was allowed to continue batting.","Amelia Kerr was declared not out by the on-field umpires despite being short of her crease, as they had already signalled the end of the over.

LUCKNOW: Shams Mulani was a bit disappointed when he missed out on the first round of the Duleep Trophy . But once he got an opportunity, he made sure he left an impression. In his first match representing India A , he top-scored for them with 89 and took four wickets in the match to set up their win over India D. In the next match against India C, he scored a crucial 44 and took three wickets.Speaking after Day Four of the Irani Cup , Mulani said selection was ""not in his hands.""""I know that at the right time, I'll get my opportunity, which I did (in the last two Duleep matches).I try to score as many runs as possible and take wickets whenever I get those opportunities. We Mumbaikars know the importance of grabbing those opportunities. And that's what is in our blood. That's how we've played. So, I'm a bit disappointed, but that's totally fine. It's part and parcel of the game. Sometimes you get picked, sometimes you don't,"" said Mulani, who took two crucial wickets of Abhimanyu Easwaran and Dhruv Jurel on Friday.Mulani has been among the most consistent performers on the domestic circuit, taking 35-plus wickets and scoring 300-plus runs in the last three Ranji Trophy seasons. Last season, he picked 35 wickets and scored 353 runs. In 2022-23 his numbers were 46 wickets and 406 runs and in 2021-22, he had 45 scalps and 321 runs to his credit.While he knows that he is inching closer towards the national cap, the 27-year-old is focused on his performance. ""My target always is to help the team win. Personal milestones will come and go, but the more important thing is the team's win. Personally, I would like to do what I am continuing to do for the past three seasons where I've been picking up wickets and scoring runs. I must be ready for whatever opportunity I get.

BRIEF SCORES:

Mumbai:

Rest of India:

LUCKNOW: Rest of India 's Abhimanyu Easwaran and Dhruv Jurel seemed to be coasting towards their respective landmarks. Abhimanyu was eyeing a double century while Jurel was inching closer to his own ton. But a couple of not-so-perfect sweep shots led to their downfall and soon after, RoI's innings spiralled out of control as they lost six wickets for 23 runs in just 10 overs to be bowled out for 416 in their first innings, handing Mumbai a 121-run lead.At stumps on Day 4, riding on Prithvi Shaw 's gutsy 76 on a track that had started wearing and spinning sharply, Mumbai reached 153/6 to extend their lead to 274 in the Irani Cup at the Ekana Stadium here on Friday.Easwaran and Jurel continued from where they had left off on Day Three and went about hunting down the Mumbai total of 537 at a decent pace. Their fifth-wicket alliance had reached 165 and was threatening to chip away at the remaining deficit quickly.But against the run of play, with just 5.3 overs to go before lunch, Mumbai decided to try something different with left-arm spinner Shams Mulani (3/122) coming over the wicket from the pavilion end. Next over, offie Tanush Kotian (3/101) conceded just one run. The RoI batters fell into the trap and in their endeavour to unsettle the spin duo, decided to go after Mulani. On the first ball of the next Mulani over, Jurel employed the sweep, but the ball kissed his gloves enroute to lodging into 'keeper Hardik Tamore's gloves. Jurel scored 93 off 121 balls, with the help of 13 fours and one six. Then 12 balls later, Easwaran too tried to sweep Mulani but could only top-edge one to Kotian, who took a diving catch coming in from short fine-leg. The Bengal opener's marathon innings of 191 from 292 balls was laced with 16 fours and one six.Once Mumbai sniffed an opportunity, they went for the kill and the RoI innings was wrapped up in six overs after lunch with three wickets falling in the 110th over bowled by Kotian. He played a role in Yash Dayal's run out, had Prasidh Krishna caught at short-leg and then took Mukesh Kumar's catch to end the RoI innings. While Mulani and Kotian helped Mumbai take the first-innings lead, it was Shaw's 105-ball innings which included eight fours and one six that helped the Ranji champions maintain their advantage.Knowing that scoring will be difficult once the spinners start operating, Mumbai raced to 50 in just 6.2 overs. But then Saransh Jain (4/67) and Manav Suthar (2/40) ran through the top-order to spice up the encounter. Just 14 wickets fell on the first three days but Friday saw 12 scalps and most of them to the spinners.Shaw stood tall among the ruins and made sure Mumbai stretched their lead. He may have dropped down the pecking order for a role as India opener, but a good season could well turn the tide in his favour. Left-arm spinner Mulani called Shaw's innings a “crucial knock” as Mumbai look to lift their first Irani Cup since 1997-98. Sarfaraz Khan (9 batting) and Kotian (20 batting) played out a tense half-an-hour towards stumps to calm the nerves in the Mumbai dressing room.537 and 153/6 (P Shaw 76, T Kotian 20 not out; S Jain 4-67, M Suthar 2-40) lead416 (A Easwaran 191, D Jurel 93; T Kotian 3-101, S Mulani 3-122) by 274 runs.","Rest of India were bowled out for 416 in their first innings, handing Mumbai a 121-run lead.

Want to discuss Indian boxing with sports minister

MUMBAI: No stranger to the physical toll of weight management during a competition, six-time world champion boxer M C Mary Kom Thursday waded into the debate surrounding wrestler Vinesh Phogat 's Olympic heartbreak for being 100gm over, saying that to be within the prescribed limit is an individual responsibility.The 42-year-old mother of four, who is India's only woman boxer with an Olympic medal (a bronze in London, 2012), was in the city to promote Utkarsh Small Finance Bank, which named her as its brand ambassador.Speaking for the first time on Phogat, who was disqualified on the day of her 50kg finals in the Paris Games for being marginally over the prescribed limit, Mary Kom said weight management is an athlete's responsibility.""I felt so disappointed in the sense that I have also done the same (weight management) for the last so many years. Weight is important, that is my responsibility. I cannot blame anyone,"" she said.""I do not want to say this in her case. I am saying this in my case only. If I do not cut the weight properly then how will I play? I am there to win a medal and that is what I think,"" she continued.Mary Kom, in the past, has spoken about her weight cut routines and how difficult the process can be. The Manipuri started out as a pin-weight (46kg) category boxer before settling for the flyweight (51kg) division in her amateur career.Phogat, who was being seen as gold medal contender in Paris, skipped meals and fluids, worked out an entire night and also cut her hair to be within the requisite category but the effort fell short eventually.She challenged her disqualification, calling the rules inhumane, but her appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The wrestler retired to join politics after the heartbreak and is contesting the Haryana assembly elections on a Congress ticket.Mary Kom was also quizzed about India's boxing campaign in Paris and she was still perplexed by how poor the performance was. She said she wants to have a meeting with the national federation and sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya to understand ""what is lacking"" and clear her ""doubts"".The Indian boxing contingent, which included two reigning world champions in Nikhat Zareen and Lovlina Borgohain, cut a sorry figure in the Games and failed to win even one medal.""We know what the result was, it was so, so bad. I want to know what is lacking,"" said the Manipuri, who became the first Indian woman boxer with an Olympic medal when she bronze in the 2012 London Games.One of the most successful athletes in the history of Indian sports, Mary Kom felt the boxers got all the logistical support they needed but she does have some ""doubts"" regarding how their training was managed by the Boxing Federation of India.""I will meet the boxers too if the situation demands. If the sports minister has the knowledge (about the issues) I want to discuss that also,"" she said.Refusing to share her exact concerns, Mary Kom said she would rather discuss them in the meeting with Mandaviya and BFI brass.""The federation has provided all the coaches. But I have a few doubts as well. But what is the point in saying them now, the Olympics are done. Now there is no point in saying all that, but I want to discuss it with them in the meeting,"" said the former Rajya Sabha MP.""(The) sports minister is doing whatever he can do from his side, infrastructure, facilities or whatever (other) needs are there. But how did the federation handle the training? Was it done systematically or not? What happened exactly, I do not know,"" she wondered.""If I do not meet them and not discuss, how will I know about them?""Mary reiterated that she wants to participate in professional boxing""I have not retired yet but I want to compete. I am trying to get opportunities, waiting for my chance to fight pro. I just want to come back.""""I can continue for another three-four years, that is my will. I have the passion and hunger. I want to continue,"" she added.",Six-time world champion boxer M C Mary Kom says weight management is an athlete's responsibility.

DUBAI: A completely out of sorts India were trumped by opposition skipper Sophie Devine 's flamboyant batting and tactical astuteness as New Zealand powered to 58-run win in a lopsided Women's T20 World Cup game here on Friday.The 'White Ferns' also put an end to their 10-match losing streak with their biggest win against India in T20Is.On a pitch which was extremely difficult for batting, Devine's power-packed unbeaten 57 off 36 balls took New Zealand to an above-par 160 for 4 in 20 overs.The 35-year-old Kiwi legend then used her slow bowlers to first choke the 'Women in Blue' and then asked her seamers to take pace off deliveries blowing the opposition for a meagre 102 in 19 overs.The difference between two sides was brute power, a mandatory requirement on such surfaces, which Devine and her two openers Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer possessed. For India, most of their batters didn't have enough muscle to even clear the 30-yard circle.The game for all practical reasons was won and lost in the Powerplay. While Bates (27 off 24 balls) and young Plimmer (34 off 23 balls) added 55 in the first six overs, India lost their three potential game-changers, Shafali Verma (2), Smriti Mandhana (12) and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (15) in the Powerplay for only 43 runs.The best part about Devine was that the batter in her understood what the skipper required to do. She started with left-arm spinner Eden Carson (2/34 in 4 overs) from one end and Shafali, who is never comfortable if pace is taken off deliveries, closed her bat face and a simple return catch lobbed to the bowler.Mandhana, India's best and most consistent batter over the past few years, also tried to get going and was holed out in the deep while seamer Rosemary Mair (4/19 in 4 overs) bowled one that swung in to hit Harmanpreet on the pads.Such was the slowness that even Lea Tahuhu (3/15 in 4 overs) had Jemimah Rodrigues trying to chip it over mid-on but the stroke lacked power and Richa Ghosh chipped one to mid-off as the Indian challenge fizzled out in a jiffy.Earlier, on a sticky track where stroke-making was difficult, Devine muscled her way with seven boundaries as most Indian bowlers sans Deepti Sharma (0/45 in 4 overs) used the tackiness of the track to good effect for the better part of the innings.Devine, who dropped herself in the batting order, displayed excellent footwork to dismantle the length bowled by Indian bowlers with the standout shot being a bent on knee cover-drive off Shreyanka Patil to complete her fifty.One thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was poor ground fielding from India save Rodrigues, who was brilliant as usual in the deep.Veteran Bates and young Plimmer rode their luck and some shoddy fielding from India to race to 55 at the end of the Powerplay.However once leg-spinner Asha Sobhana (1/22 in 4 overs) started operating just after Powerplay, she immediately put brakes but once Devine started chancing her arms at the death, Indian bowlers were left with little option.",New Zealand beat India by 58 runs to win Women's T20 World Cup game. Sophie Devine top scored with 57 off 36 balls for New Zealand. India bowled out for 102 in 19 overs on a difficult pitch in Dubai. New Zealand end their 10-match losing streak against India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113947975,imgsize-74530,width-400,resizemode-4/113947975.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Social media has erupted with heated reactions following a controversial runout decision in India's opening Women's T20 World Cup match against New Zealand.The incident took centre stage on the last ball of the 14th over of the encounter on Friday.New Zealand’s Amelia Kerr pushed the ball to long-off and began running for a second run at the call of her skipper, Sophie Devine .Harmanpreet collected the ball and took a few steps forward in the lackluster manner but did not immediately throw it, leading Devine to believe that there was a narrow room to steal a sharp second.On the other hand, the umpire had already handed the cap to Indian bowler Deepti Sharma , which traditionally signals the end of the over.However, Harmanpreet, seeing Devine's intentions, threw the ball to wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh , who knocked off the bails in a flash, catching Kerr short of her crease and sparking a debate over the legality of the runout.In the end, nevertheless, Devine survived as the umpire had already called the over. Harmanpreet and multiple staff from the coaching team, including head coach Amol Muzumdar , were seen holding discussions over the controversial decision with the match officials.The incident has quickly become a hot topic of debate, with various theories circulating across social media platforms.Following the incident, Indian cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin fueled the discussion on social media, tweeting, ""The over was called before the start of the second run. Whose fault is this really?""However, his post was later deleted.A fan also took to X to show his discontent over the call.",Social media erupts with heated reactions following a controversial runout decision in India's opening Women's T20 World Cup match against New Zealand.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer and selector Jatin Paranjape lauded skipper Rohit Sharma for his attacking brand of cricket during the home Test series against Bangladesh, particularly the Kanpur Test .The 52-year-old, who has represented Mumbai at domestic level, said that the second Test of the series will be seen as an ""inflection point"" in Indian team's rich Test cricket history.India recently completed their 2-0 series win against Bangladesh at home. In the Kanpur Test, Team India missed two days of action due to rain and wet outfield after Bangladesh ended the first day at 107/3 in the first innings.When Bangladesh started day four with the same score, the match looked heading towards a draw with two days left and only the first innings being played. But Bangladesh was first skittled out for 233 and then India got some quickfire runs, posting 285/9 and taking two Bangladesh wickets at the end of day four. On the next day, India bundled out Bangladesh for 146 and were leading by 94 runs. They got a target of 95 runs and chased it down easily.Speaking to at the sidelines of the Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) season two Delhi trials, the head of selection in the competition said, ""Since Rohit has become the captain, the intent and DNA of the team have become attack-orientated. The captain himself is leading from the front. Since the 2023 World Cup, we have seen our players go out and attack the bowlers from the start. Rohit has done it himself. We saw that in the T20 World Cup and the Kanpur Test as well. They have decided that their DNA is to attack, their natural instinct has become attacking, and they would not abandon it. I think this is just a trailer of what we will see in Australia (during theBorder-Gavaskar Trophy ) later this year.""""You will look at it (the Kanpur Test) as an inflection point of the Indian team in Test cricket. We were always an attacking side. If you see our batting, right from Rohit to Ashwin, everyone has attack that comes first to them. They will play as per their natural instinct. It depends how the Border Gavaskar Trophy goes. But I think in such situations in the future, they will play such a way, irrespective of the opposition,"" he added.""Yes. You will look at it as an inflection point of the Indian team in Test cricket. We were always an attacking side. If you see our batting, right from Rohit to Ashwin, everyone has an attack which comes first to them. They will play as per their natural instinct. BGT depends how it goes. But I think in such situations in the future, they will play such way, irrespective of the opposition.""Speaking about the Mumbai cricket scene, Paranjape said that Prithvi Shaw is the most talented batter in India.Shaw last played for India in July 2021, has played five Tests, six T20Is, and an ODI for India. Though he had a lot of hype around him because of him being the youngest Test centurion on debut for India and the winning captain 2018 ICC U19 World Cup, Shaw lost his place in the side to the likes of Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Ruturaj Gaikwad due to injuries, poor run of form, technical weaknesses, etc.""I feel Prithvi Shaw is the most talented player in India. He will also be looking forward to the FC season with a lot of expectations, because it is going to be a big one for him. Shaw, Sarfaraz (Khan), Jaiswal and Iyer are Mumbai players whose DNA is to attack. That is how they will continue playing,"" he added.Notably, Paranjape himself played for Mumbai, scoring 3,964 runs in 62 first-class matches at an average of 46.09, with 13 centuries and 15 fifties in 95 innings. His best score was 218.Even though Sarfaraz became the first Mumbai player to smash a double ton in Irani Cup, Paranjape feels that Rohit will continue with the ongoing combination during the upcoming three-match home Test series against New Zealand from October 16 and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia from November 22 onwards.""Rohit's captaincy hallmark is he keeps formation consistent,"" he added.Sarfaraz made his much-anticipated international debut this year during Tests against England after years of fine performances on the domestic circuit. He scored 200 runs in his first three Tests with three fifties. He was not a part of playing eleven during Bangladesh Tests despite being a part of the squad.On spin all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin , who won the 'Player of the Series' award against Bangladesh, Paranjape said that his best years are ahead of him.""Nothing short of fantastic (his performances against Bangladesh). He is a legend. He writes his name into the list of legends of Indian cricket . I think his best five years are ahead of us. He is really fit,"" he concluded.He was given the 'Player of the Series' award for scoring 114 runs, including a counter-attacking century in the first Test at his home in Chennai and taking 11 wickets.The Indian all-rounder broke a lot of records and unlocked a lot of milestones in the series, both with the bat and the ball. He levelled with Sri Lankan great Mutthiah Muralitharan to become player with joint-most 'Player of the Series' records, with a total of 11.In the Chennai Test, Ashwin scored a counter-attacking 113 in the first innings and took a six-wicket haul in the final innings to help his team win the game.This was the fourth instance of Ashwin securing a century and five-wicket haul in a Test. Only England legend Ian Botham is ahead of Ashwin in this aspect, having managed to do this feat five times.Also, this was Ashwin's 37th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. Now, he has tied with legendary Australian spinner Shane Warne for joint second-most fifers in the longest format of the game. The only one ahead of Ashwin is Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan, who has 67 five-wicket hauls.Ashwin also went past 750 international wickets, becoming the 12th player in the world and second Indian to do so.The veteran is considered as one of the finest Test all-rounders of the generation, with 3,423 runs in 102 Tests and 123 innings at an average of 26.74, with six centuries and 14 fifties. His best score is 124. He has also taken 527 wickets at an average of 23.65, with 37 five-wicket hauls and eight ten-fers. His best bowling figures in an innings are 7/59.","India recently completed their 2-0 series win against Bangladesh at home.

MARGAO: During the pre-match media interaction, FC Goa coach Manolo Marquez spoke fondly of Borja Herrera ’s left foot. The praise came after the hat-trick against East Bengal for Goa’s first win in the Indian Super League ( ISL ) this season.On Friday, Borja’s left foot came to Manolo’s rescue again as the hosts secured a last-gasp equaliser against NorthEast United FC for a 3-3 draw at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda.The end may have been entertaining for the hosts after Borja struck in the fourth minute of added time.They almost secured a win, forcing NorthEast goalkeeper Gurmeet into two good saves deep into stoppage time. But after a cold shower, there would be a reality check as Goa have remained winless in two home games, surrendering the lead in successive games at home. It all started with Nestor Albiach handing NorthEast the lead in the sixth minute. Armando Sadiku then scored in the first half and added time and again just two minutes after the restart to swing the momentum in Goa’s favour.The visitors, though, were not to be left behind as Nestor scored his second and Alaeddine Ajaraie added another one to make it 3-2 with two goals in the 51st and 56th minutes. There was still plenty of time left on the clock. Goa pressed, tried, and only succeeded in the fourth minute of stoppage time with Borja scoring the equaliser with his appreciable left foot.The draw left Goa with just a win from four matches before the international break. “We are not happy despite equalising in the last minute,” Manolo said after the game.","FC Goa draw 3-3 with NorthEast United FC in Indian Super League (ISL) Goa have remained winless in two home games, surrendering the lead in successive games at home.

But they have a chance now to get back to winning ways as they host East Bengal at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur on Saturday.The Kolkata giants have once again made a terrible start to the league having lost all their three opening games and are placed bottom of the table with no point. To make matters worse, their coach Carles Cuadrat resigned earlier this week and Bino George has been brought in as the interim coach.It will naturally be a big challenge for George, who, despite the current situation, sounded quite confident. ""We have a good team and we will stick to our plan. In the last three games we played well but lost because we made small mistakes. So we worked on those mistakes in our training session and I believe the boys will take the responsibility so that we have a good game here,"" said George during the press conference on Friday.Red and Gold captain Cleiton Silva, too, acknowledged the difficulty of the situation but is hopeful of a positive result which he believes will turn everything around.It's not going to be easy though.Playing against Jamshedpur at the Furnace is not an easy task especially when it's packed to the brim which is expected to be the case on Saturday evening. And Khalid Jamil, who had coached East Bengal in the I-League earlier, will be eager to get the better of his previous team and three crucial points.For now his primary focus is on making a good start which hasn't been the case in the last three games. Against all their three opponents — Goa, Mumbai and Odisha — Jamshedpur conceded early and then made a comeback.While they were able to win it on the first two occasions, they fell short against Odisha FC. ""We weren't up to the mark in the last match. But this is a different game and we have to bounce back and get a positive result,"" said Khalid.For that to be realised, a lot will depend on whether the team is able to make the moves down the wings with Imran Khan leading the charge on the right and Seiminlen Doungel or Mohammed Sanan on the left. As far as scoring goals is concerned, the trio of Jordan Murray, Javi Hernandez and Javier Siverio will again be in focus. Most importantly, their defence will have to do a better job along with goalkeeper Albino Gomes if the hosts are to grab some points.But whatever the result, an interesting thing about the fixture is that it will be the first time this season that the two teams facing off will be coached by Indians.

NEW DELHI: Football can be sometimes extremely weird. With the growing influence of social media and access to clips of youngsters dribbling past the bulkiest of defenders, many young footballers have been compared to Lionel Messi over the years, often dubbed as the "" Next Messi "" due to early career promise.The title of the ""Next Messi"" has been a double-edged sword for many young footballers.While these players possessed immense talent and potential, the pressure of living up to Messi's extraordinary standards proved too much for most.Whether due to injuries, inconsistency, or failure to adapt to the professional game, these players faded away from the global spotlight, reminding us how rare Messi’s level of greatness truly is.Here are ten such players who were once touted to be the next Lionel Messi but faded away from the spotlight:Bojan was perhaps one of the most hyped ""Next Messi"" prospects, having emerged from Barcelona's famed La Masia academy.He made his debut for Barcelona at 17 and scored regularly. However, the immense pressure of the Messi comparison seemed to weigh on him.After a series of loans to clubs like AC Milan, AS Roma, and Stoke City, Bojan's career gradually faded. Despite showing flashes of brilliance, injuries and inconsistency derailed his progress, and he could never fulfill the lofty expectations.Another La Masia graduate, Dos Santos was once seen as a potential Messi successor.His flair, dribbling skills, and creativity drew comparisons, but his career never quite took off at Barcelona.After moving to Tottenham Hotspur, he failed to establish himself and spent time at clubs like Villarreal and LA Galaxy. Injuries, inconsistency, and an inability to handle the pressure hampered his progress.Dubbed as the ""Israeli Messi,"" Gai Assulin was a La Masia product with similar playing attributes to Messi.However, despite high expectations, he failed to break into Barcelona’s senior squad.After leaving the club, Assulin's career took a steep decline, with brief spells at Manchester City, Brighton, and various lower-tier clubs. The weight of the Messi comparison was too heavy for him to carry.Marko Marin was nicknamed the ""German Messi"" due to his dribbling ability, speed, and vision. After impressing in the Bundesliga with Werder Bremen, he earned a move to Chelsea in 2012.However, Marin never found his footing at Stamford Bridge, and after a series of loan moves to clubs like Sevilla, Fiorentina, and Anderlecht, his career fizzled out.His inability to adapt to different playing styles and injuries limited his potential.A product of Barcelona’s La Masia academy, Deulofeu was often seen as Messi’s heir at the Catalan club. He was a highly talented winger with immense technical skills and pace.However, despite showing promise at Everton and AC Milan during loan spells, Deulofeu struggled with consistency and decision-making.He returned to Barcelona but failed to establish himself and was sold to Watford. While still playing at a good level, he never reached the heights expected of him.Often referred to as the ""Croatian Messi,"" Alen Halilović was one of the most highly-rated talents in European football as a teenager. His dribbling ability and vision earned him a move to Barcelona in 2014.However, like many before him, Halilović failed to break into the first team. Loan spells at Sporting Gijón, Las Palmas, and Milan followed, but he couldn’t live up to his potential.He now plays in the Croatian league after failing to fulfill his early promise.As a 15-year-old, Martin Ødegaard was labelled as the ""Norwegian Messi"" and signed by Real Madrid amid much fanfare in 2015.His technical skills, passing range, and dribbling ability sparked comparisons to Messi. However, Ødegaard struggled to make an impact at Madrid and was loaned out to several clubs, including Heerenveen, Vitesse, and Real Sociedad.Though his career has revived in recent years, particularly at Arsenal, the expectations of him becoming the next Messi have long been set aside.Dubbed as the ""Belgian Messi"" after becoming the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Eredivisie with PSV Eindhoven, Zakaria Bakkali’s early promise had football fans excited.However, despite his early breakthrough, Bakkali's career stagnated. A move to Valencia didn’t go as planned, and he struggled for playing time.Eventually, he faded into obscurity after unremarkable spells with clubs like Deportivo La Coruña and Anderlecht.Ryan Gauld, the ""Scottish Messi,"" emerged as a highly talented playmaker at Dundee United, catching the attention of Europe’s top clubs.His dribbling, vision, and low center of gravity earned him the comparison to Messi. In 2014, he moved to Sporting CP, but his development stalled.A series of loan spells followed, and Gauld never quite reached the level that many had hoped. He now plays for Vancouver Whitecaps FC in the MLS, but the Messi comparisons have long faded.Hachim Mastour was once considered one of the brightest talents in world football and was labeled as the ""Moroccan Messi."" At just 14 years old, he was signed by AC Milan, and his YouTube videos showcasing his skills went viral.However, Mastour's career never progressed beyond the hype. After failing to make an impact at Milan, he had unsuccessful loan spells at Málaga and PEC Zwolle, and eventually left Milan.He now plays in the Moroccan league, far from the global stardom that many predicted for him.","Many young footballers have been compared to Lionel Messi over the years.

ISL: Odisha spurred on but settle for 2-2 draw vs Kerala Blasters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/isl-odisha-spurred-on-but-settle-for-2-2-draw-vs-kerala-blasters/articleshow/113926651.cms,"Image credit: Odisha FC

Odisha FC needed back-to-back goals by Kerala Blasters FC early in the first half to stoke the fire within and come out of the initial slumber with a burst of energy to draw level before the break in Bhubaneswar on Thursday. However, despite some quality moves and chances to break the deadlock on both ends in the second half, the scoreline stayed 2-2 as the sides shared spoils in their fourth game of Indian Super League at Kalinga Stadium.Man-in-form and Player-of-the-Match for the second game running, Noah Sadaoui, opened the scoring in the 18th minute before Blasters doubled the lead through Jesus Jimenez in the 21st. Odisha reduced the margin through an own goal by Alexandre Coeff (29’) as Diego Mauricio netted the equaliser for the hosts in the 36th minute.Starting the game with a shot on target by Mauricio in the opening minute, Odisha paid the price of a sloppy defensive display to concede two goals in a span of three minutes. Both the Blasters scorers were given ample space around the box and were allowed to run unchecked before scoring.First, it was Sadaoui who scored his fifth goal against the Kalinga Warriors in the 18th minute to open the scoring following an assist by Jimenez. The Moroccan winger continued his rich form this season to score with a right-footed shot from left of the box to right corner.Three minutes later, both combined again to double the lead but this time the roles were reversed as Sadaoui turned provider for the Spanish centre forward, whose right-footed shot from the right went to the top right corner. Sadaoui, with his electrifying presence on the wings, cut into the area from the left before passing it to Jimenez across the box.During the final move, the entire Odisha defence was standing in a line while centre-back Mourtada Fall stood still barely a few feet away from the scorer, unable to pose any challenge for Jimenez, whose shot was good enough to give Amrinder Singh absolutely no chance.The early setbacks made Odisha regroup and come back stronger thereafter. As their midfield play improved, Odisha got hold of the possession and Blasters goalkeeper Sachin Suresh’s sloppy work, again, helped them to reduce the lead with an own goal just before the drinks break.Ahmed Jahouh’s quick and short corner from left was sent back to him by Isak Ralte (Vanlalruatfela), and the Moroccan playmaker’s shot from left was saved by Suresh in front of the goalline with a volleyball-like technique. As Suresh failed to collect the ball it ricocheted off his teammate Alexandre Coeff’s legs from close range before crossing the goal-line despite the French midfielder’s attempt for a goal-line save.Six minutes after the drinks break, Mauricio played a 1-2 with Jerry Mawihmingthanga inside the box after receiving a through from Jahouh and scored from centre of box with a right-footed shot through the legs of Blasters centre-back Pritam Kotal and Suresh.With the draw Blasters, with five points, moved up a spot to fifth on the table while Odisha rose a rung above Mohun Bagan SG to ninth with four points.",Noah Sadaoui opened the scoring in the 18th minute before Blasters doubled the lead through Jesus Jimenez in the 21st. Odisha reduced the margin through an own goal by Alexandre Coeff (29’) as Diego Mauricio netted the equaliser for the hosts in the 36th minute.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113926735,imgsize-52272,width-400,resizemode-4/113926735.jpg"

PANAJI: India have been left with just Vietnam as their opponents for this month’s Fifa international match window after crisis-hit Lebanon pulled out of the tri-nation friendly tournament in Vietnam.India were drawn to play hosts Vietnam (Oct 9) and Lebanon (Oct 12) at the Thien Truong Stadium in Nam Dinh.Lebanon, however, have informed the Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) that they are unable to travel due to the Israeli airstrikes that has left the country in crisis.In the wake of Israel’s attacks, the Lebanese Football Association (LFA) has also postponed all football matches in the domestic leagues indefinitely.According to sources, Vietnam have now offered India an option of going ahead with the international friendly on Oct 9 and then playing an unofficial game on Oct 12, which will not be counted for ranking points.“The second game, if it goes ahead, is expected to be played behind closed doors with no restrictions on substitutions,” a senior official told TOI on Thursday.“It will be like a practice game with nothing at stake.” According to reports in Vietnam, VFF is finding it challenging to find a replacement for Lebanon at short notice.For the second successive tournament, coach Manolo Marquez will have little time to prepare the team for the international assignments.The team is expected to arrive in Vietnam on Oct 7 and have two training sessions before the opener against the hosts, ranked at 116, if it goes ahead as scheduled.“Manolo wants more time to prepare the team and would ideally prefer the first game to be played on Oct 12,” said a source.",India were drawn to play hosts Vietnam (Oct 9) and Lebanon (Oct 12) at the Thien Truong Stadium in Nam Dinh.

SHANGHAI: World number one Jannik Sinner said Friday he was not in a ""comfortable"" situation as his doping case dragged on, but insisted he felt ready for his first match at the Shanghai Masters .Last week the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said it would appeal a decision by tennis authorities to clear the Italian of wrongdoing after he twice tested positive for a steroid in March.The 23-year-old fought through the controversy to reach the finals of the China Open in Beijing on Wednesday, where he lost to arch-rival Carlos Alcaraz .""It's not in a situation where I feel comfortable in it, that's for sure, because I thought it was over... so it's not easy,"" said Sinner when asked at a press conference if the pressure of the appeal was affecting him.In August, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted Sinner's explanation that the drug entered his system unintentionally when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy to the player.But WADA said last Saturday it had appealed and was seeking a ban of up to two years.""I had three hearings, which went my way, which was good, but now let's see. But I'm very confident that it comes out very positively,"" Sinner said Friday.He now has to turn his attention to the Shanghai Masters, where he could end up facing Alcaraz again.""We are quite similar as human beings off the court,"" said Sinner.""Obviously on the court we try to meet, we try to put on a big fight... he pushes me to do better, which is something good.""Sinner will face Japan's 93rd-ranked Taro Daniel in his first match of the tournament this weekend.""I had my first practice session just now, I just finished, so I feel good.

TIEBREAK UPSET

BEIJING: Carlos Alcaraz rallied from a set down and held his nerve in a deciding tiebreak to beat defending champion Jannik Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) in the China Open final on Wednesday and win his fourth title of the season.French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz, who won both of his previous meetings with Sinner this year, recovered from a slow start to wrap up victory in three hours, 21 minutes and improve his head-to-head record with the Italian to 6-4.While the stage might not have been as grand as it was in some of their recent encounters, Sinner and Alcaraz pushed each other to the limit in the latest chapter of the burgeoning rivalry that has taken the ATP Tour by storm.""He could have won in two, I could have won in two, it was a really close match. Jannik once again showed that he's the best player in the world, with the level that he's playing,"" Alcaraz, 21, said.""It is unbelievable, it's a really high quality of tennis , physically, mentally, he's a beast.""I had my chances in the first set but didn't make it, but in general I'm proud of myself. The way that I dealt with the match, the way that I managed everything. For me, it was a really good match.""After both players defended break points in a cagey start, Alcaraz seized the early break for a 3-1 lead when Sinner's backhand went wide, before consolidating the advantage in the next as his Italian opponent netted a shot.World number one Sinner, whose last win over Alcaraz came in the semi-finals of this tournament last year, gradually found his range to level at 5-5 and save two set points in the tiebreak to clinch the first set.Alcaraz was on the ropes early in the second set and Sinner pushed him hard in a 15-minute game, but the second seed successfully held serve for 4-4.Sinner's failure to break in the lengthy game appeared to take the wind out of his sails, as Alcaraz sped through the next two games to level the match at a set apiece.The Spaniard cranked up the intensity on his forehand and broke for a 2-1 lead in the third set, but with victory seemingly in sight, he suffered a lapse in concentration and allowed Sinner to level at 4-4.In the deciding tiebreak, Sinner snatched control to take a 3-0 lead, but some excellent work at the net helped Alcaraz edge a couple of rallies and go ahead 4-3, before finally clinching the title with an emphatic cross-court forehand winner.The tiebreak defeat was uncharacteristic for Sinner, who had won 18 out of his past 19 tiebreaks.Asked if Sinner's record had caused him any doubt, Alcaraz said: ""I never lost hope, but honestly, I know that stat. Every time that Jannik plays (a tiebreak), it goes to his side.""I'm not going to lie, at 3-0 down and with two mini breaks for him, I thought, 'Okay, I have to give everything that I have just to try to give myself the opportunity to be close'.""I played great points just to make it 3-3 and after that, I just thought 'go for it'. If I lost it, at least I went for it.""The result denied Australian Open and U.S. Open champion Sinner becoming the first man to retain the crown at the China National Tennis Centre since Novak Djokovic won four straight titles between 2012-15.",Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) in the China Open final.

Shades of Kylian Mbappe

BEIJING: Jannik Sinner ignored the bubbling controversy over his steroid case and a roaring home crowd to set up a China Open final against Carlos Alcaraz on Tuesday.The world number one and defending champion defeated the 96th-ranked Chinese wildcard Bu Yunchaokete 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to avoid a major upset.The Italian faces Spanish second seed Alcaraz, who was in fine form in a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev in the other semi-final.In front of a packed house on China's national day, US Open champion Sinner was facing a player he had never met before and who was competing in the biggest match of his life.China's 22-year-old Bu was also in the form of his life, having similarly reached the semi-finals last week in Hangzhou.Bu had Sinner under pressure on the Italian's serve early in the first set, but Sinner staved off the threat and the storm gradually blew itself out as the set wore on.They went to the tie break in the second set, with Sinner serving an ace to convert his third match point after just over two hours.Nobody has won more matches on tour this season than Sinner, 23, who failed two doping tests in March but was cleared of wrongdoing and allowed to keep playing.Tennis authorities accepted Sinner's explanation that trace amounts of a banned steroid unintentionally entered his system from a physiotherapist who used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy.The World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) reignited the case on Saturday, saying it had appealed the decision and is seeking a ban of up to two years.Sinner has admitted to having sleepless nights over the issue.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz reached his first final in the Chinese capital and is in ominous form, yet to drop a set.""I think I played really well. Obviously if I want to beat Daniil, I have to play really good tennis, high-quality tennis,"" said Alcaraz, who is chasing a 16th ATP Tour title -- which would equal Sinner.""I felt great on the court once again, so I'm really happy about it. I think I couldn't ask for a better semi-final.""The final is on Wednesday.In the women's draw, 595th-ranked home hope Zhang Shuai -- one of the storylines of the tournament -- rolled into the quarter-finals to make more history.Her 6-4, 6-2 victory over Magdalena Frech was her fourth win in Beijing and all in straight sets -- having come into the event after losing 24 singles matches in a row.The barren run lasting more than 600 days was the second-longest on the WTA Tour in the Open Era, which began in 1968.The 35-year-old Zhang, a former two-time Grand Slam quarter-finalist who has been plagued by injury, said she had come close to quitting singles tennis before coming to Beijing.""I had no idea how to win and I didn't want to lose another, especially with all the Chinese fans,"" she said.""Walking back to the locker room, I didn't know if I should continue or not before this tournament.""The former top-25 player will face Spain's 19th-ranked Paula Badosa in the last eight.Zhang is the lowest-ranked player to reach this stage of the China Open and struck a defiant pose -- a tribute to Kylian Mbappe -- after beating 31st-ranked Frech.Former world number two Badosa dumped out US Open finalist Jessica Pegula 6-4, 6-0 to make the second-seeded American the biggest casualty so far.","Jannik Sinner beats 96th-ranked Chinese wildcard Bu Yunchaokete 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) Italian faces Spanish second seed Carlos Alcaraz in the other semi-final.
