'That to me is the real game...': Virat Kohli on overcoming tough times in life - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/that-to-me-is-the-real-game-virat-kohli-on-overcoming-tough-times-in-life-watch/articleshow/112554355.cms,"NEW DELHI: One of the most prominent and successful cricketers in the world, Virat Kohli is known for his aggressive batting style, leadership qualities, and consistency across all formats of the game with an indelible mark on cricket.Virat's passion for the game and relentless pursuit of excellence have made him one of the most respected figures in cricket.Kohli served as the captain of the Indian cricket team in all formats from 2013 to 2022. Under his leadership, India reached the finals of several major tournaments and became a dominant force in Test cricket.Kohli is among the top run-scorers in international cricket, with over 70 centuries across formats. He has broken numerous records, including being the fastest to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, and 11,000 ODI runs.Despite being one of the most prolific cricketers, Kohli has faced periods of poor form throughout his career, as is common with many top athletes. One of the most notable slumps in his career occurred between 2020 and 2022.Now a video is going viral on the internet where Kohli is talking about overcoming tough times in life.Kohli says in the video which is filmed during a podcast, ""How you react to the times when you are not feeling great and how you ride that wave and accept things the way they are. It's a very delicate thing to do when you know you're not doing well and you feel like you don't want to work, you don't want to go to practice, you don't want to work hard in the gym. But you feel like as an individual, you're respecting all phases of life, and even in your worst times, you are committed to do the hard work, and it's not based on success. That, to me, is the real game here, because that is eventually God's test. This is how I look at it and if you're not up to the test then you are basically not being grateful and not being loyal to the opportunity that's been given to you.""Between November 2019 and September 2022, Kohli went through a century drought in international cricket, which was highly unusual for a player of his caliber. This period was marked by frequent starts but few conversions into big scores.The pressures of captaincy during this phase were significant, and Kohli eventually stepped down from captaincy in all formats for India by the end of 2021, and later from RCB 's captaincy. The added responsibilities were believed by some to have affected his batting performance.India broke their 11-year drought for a global title by clinching the T20 World Cup against South Africa in a thrilling final on June 29.The match culminated in a nail-biting seven-run victory for India, propelled by Virat Kohli's commanding 76 runs, who had failed to fire throughout the tournament but saved his best for the last and then announced his retirement from T20I cricket.","Virat Kohli is known for his aggressive batting style, leadership qualities, and consistency.

2nd Test: Bowlers shine as West Indies and South Africa share honours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/2nd-test-bowlers-shine-as-west-indies-and-south-africa-share-honours/articleshow/112554041.cms,"NEW DELHI: Shamar Joseph took five wickets in his maiden Test match played at home, but South Africa responded with 17 wickets lost on Thursday's thrilling first day of the second and final Test at Providence, Guyana.The Proteas elected to bat first, and fast bowler Joseph's five for thirty-three spearheaded the destruction of the opposition for 160, as per AFP.However, the Caribbean side faltered to 97 for seven in reply at the end, and seamer Wiaan Mulder reacted in kind with the superb figures of four for 18.Joseph, who was left out of the rain-affected, drawn first Test in Trinidad a week earlier, regained his form and intensity from his January debut series in Australia.On the last day of the second Test in Brisbane, he bowled the West Indies to their first Test victory Down Under in 27 years with an incredible seven-wicket haul.Following two lackluster Tests in England last month, where he appeared short of work and match fitness, the Guyanese pacer immediately made up for it when he entered the game as the first change bowler on a sweltering morning at the South American site.With fellow pacer Jayden Seales(3 for 45) providing good support, he removed opener Adrian Markram almost immediately. His constant pace and full length proved to be more than a handful for the South Africans in conditions that were pleasantly favorable to the fast bowlers.""It's a great feeling to have done this at home,"" said 24-year-old Joseph in reflecting on his third five-wicket Test innings haul.""I haven't really played much here at Providence but I always go in with a clear plan to do what the team needed, and I am glad I was able to deliver today.""To get the visitors over the hundred-run threshold, Dane Piedt (38 not out) and Nandre Burger (23) had to put together a last-wicket partnership of 63.Strangely enough, bowling was the main reason both players were chosen for this particular match-fast bowler Lungi Ngidi and batter Ryan Rickelton were left out of the first Test squad.The South African bowlers destroyed the West Indies top-order batting, spurred on by their last-ditch resistance.The South Africans made a comeback when Mulder replaced the unfortunate Kagiso Rabada , but Burger was the first to strike when he scattered Mikyle Louis' stumps.The medium-pacer, following Joseph's lead earlier in the day, provided the perfect blend of movement through the air and off the seam to have the hosts reeling at 56 for six. This knocked out his previous best of three for one, which he had also achieved against the West Indies in St Lucia three years prior.""I didn't bowl at my best but I had a lot going for me today,"" Mulder admitted in reflecting on his career-best Test bowling performance.""I just tried to replicate what Shamar did earlier in the day by bowling a length which made it difficult for the batters to score. He's obviously quicker than I am but the pitch also helped by style of bowling so I was able to capitalise.""Gudakesh Motie (33 not out) and Jason Holder (33 not out) prevented a total collapse, but Motie's dismissal in the final over of the day against Keshav Maharaj puts even more pressure on former captain Holder to do whatever he can with the tail on the second morning to reduce the first innings deficit.",Shamar Joseph takes five wickets in his maiden Test match played at home.

VVS Laxman likely to extend his term as head of National Cricket Academy: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/vvs-laxman-likely-to-extend-his-term-as-head-of-national-cricket-academy-report/articleshow/112548566.cms,"NEW DELHI: VVS Laxman , the former Indian batting maestro, is poised to extend his tenure as the head of the National Cricket Academy ( NCA ) in Bengaluru for at least another year, according to a report from ESPNcricinfo. This decision ensures continuity at the helm of India's premier cricket development institution.Laxman's initial three-year contract, which began in December 2021, was slated to conclude in September 2023.However, his commitment to nurturing young talent and shaping the future of Indian cricket has led to this extension. Despite reported interest from an Indian Premier League ( IPL ) franchise, Laxman has prioritized his role at the NCA.His leadership will be instrumental in overseeing the transition to the new NCA facility in Bengaluru. The foundation stone for this state-of-the-art complex was laid in February 2022 by former BCCI president Saurav Ganguly , secretary Jay Shah , and Laxman himself. The new facility signifies a significant investment in the future of Indian cricket and will provide world-class training and rehabilitation facilities for players.Laxman's tenure has been marked by a focus on building upon the processes established by his predecessor, Rahul Dravid . He has maintained a strong coaching team, including notable figures like Shitanshu Kotak, Sairaj Bahutule , and Hrishikesh Kanitkar, all with extensive experience in domestic cricket.One of the key challenges for Laxman will be revitalizing the India A tour program, which has seen a decline in frequency over the past two years. Under Dravid, these tours, both home and away, played a crucial role in providing aspiring cricketers with valuable exposure and experience against quality opposition.Laxman's own illustrious playing career, which saw him amass 8,781 runs in 134 Tests and 2,338 runs in 86 ODIs for India, makes him an ideal mentor for the next generation. His technical expertise, coupled with his understanding of the demands of international cricket, will be invaluable to the young players under his guidance.The extension of Laxman's tenure reflects the BCCI's confidence in his leadership and vision for the NCA. As India continues to assert its dominance in world cricket, the role of the NCA in identifying and nurturing talent becomes increasingly crucial.

Sources indicate that Abdullah Shafiq's position as opener remains secure, while captain Shan Masood will take on the crucial number three role. This new batting order aims to solidify the top order and provide stability to the middle order with Azam's presence.Azam's experimentation with the number four position in Test cricket is not entirely unprecedented. During Pakistan's tour of Sri Lanka in 2022, he was tried at number three, a position he retained for the second Test against England later that year. However, his move to number four for the upcoming Bangladesh series suggests a more permanent shift in the team's long-term strategy.The series against Bangladesh also presents an opportunity for new talent to emerge. Sources have revealed that batsman Muhammad Huraira is a strong contender for a debut appearance, signalling the team management's intent to introduce fresh faces into the Test arena.On the bowling front, Pakistan are expected to capitalize on the anticipated bowler-friendly conditions at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. A three-pronged pace attack comprisingShaheen Afridi , Naseem Shah, and Mir Hamza is likely to be deployed, with one spinner completing the bowling lineup.The two-match Test series, commencing on August 21st in Rawalpindi, holds added significance as it marks the first assignment for newly appointed Test coach, Jason Gillespie . Gillespie's arrival signals a new chapter for Pakistan's Test cricket, and his guidance will be crucial in shaping the team's approach against Bangladesh and beyond.The second Test, scheduled from August 30th to September 3rd in Karachi, will unfortunately be played without spectators due to ongoing renovations at the National Stadium.

Despite the hurdles, Smith is amenable to shifting roles for the team.""I’m comfortable batting wherever,"" Smith told Fox Cricket.""We’ll see what that looks like, I suppose, whether they want me to continue (opening the batting) or go back to three or four. We’ll wait and see. I’m pretty easy batting anywhere. We’ll just see what stacks up and what the brain trust wants.""I like to stand up in the big series and do well and help the team. Hopefully, there’s much of the same this summer.”Smith mentioned that the rapid turnaround between innings was the only notable challenge he found while opening.“It’s a little bit of a quicker turnaround when you only have ten minutes, running off the field and you have to get back out there quickly,” Smith explained.“Outside of that, I don’t think there’s much change.”Australian selector George Bailey recently hinted at keeping the team’s top six unchanged for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against India starting in November.Smith’s flexibility with his batting position fits into the approach.Usman Khawaja, another opener for Australia, prefers to see Smith batting at No.4, appreciating his notable performance in the middle order.Smith has averaged 61.50 in 111 Test innings at No. 4, including 19 centuries.Khawaja believes the strategy would benefit the team.“When you put him up to open, I feel like you’re kind of giving them a chance to get at him early.”Smith acknowledges the adjustments needed when opening the batting but stays focused on contributing positively to the series ahead.“I like to stand up in the big series and do well and help the team.

Spencer Johnson , the Australian fast bowler, has been sidelined from the forthcoming T20I matches against Scotland and England in the UK due to a side injury sustained while representing The Oval Invincibles in 'The Hundred' tournament.As a replacement for the injured Johnson, Cricket Australia has called up Sean Abbott to join the squad. Abbott was originally chosen to be part of the five-match ODI series against England.During his recent stint in 'The Hundred', Johnson managed to secure only two wickets in six appearances.However, he delivered an impressive spell of 1/10 in his 20 deliveries against Northern Superchargers.Since making his debut against South Africa last year, Johnson has represented Australia in five T20Is and one ODI. The young pacer, who quickly gained recognition in the BBL with Brisbane Heat, is regarded as a strong contender to replace Mitchell Starc in the T20I squad.While Starc has been given a break from the T20Is against Scotland and England, he will be available for the ODIs. Pat Cummins, on the other hand, will not be participating in the entire tour. Josh Hazlewood has been included in both the T20I and ODI squads.Sean Abbott, who has played 15 T20Is for Australia, has been somewhat unfortunate not to have represented his country more often in the format.Abbott's impressive record in the Big Bash League is unmatched, with a staggering 165 wickets to his name, making him the leading wicket-taker in the tournament's history. Additionally, he has showcased his skills in 'The Hundred', claiming nine wickets in seven appearances for Birmingham Phoenix.The T20I squad also includes promising young seamer Xavier Bartlett, who made a significant impact in international cricket last season, and the talented Nathan Ellis. The team's fast-bowling department is further bolstered by the presence of allrounders Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie and Marcus Stoinis.While the selectors are looking ahead to the next T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to take place in 18 months, they have not completely ruled out the possibility of Starc or Cummins participating in the format.Johnson's primary focus is on regaining full fitness in time for the commencement of the Australian domestic season, where he represents South Australia.Following the UK tour, Australia's next T20I assignment is a three-match series against Pakistan in mid-November. This series could provide Johnson with another opportunity to showcase his skills, as the Test players will be unavailable due to their commitments in the upcoming first Test in Perth.After the Pakistan series, Australia's T20I schedule is expected to resume in July of the following year, with a tour to the West Indies.Mitchell Marsh (c), Sean Abbott, Xavier Bartlett, Cooper Connolly, Tim David, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis (wk), Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa.",Spencer Johnson has been ruled out of the T20I series against Scotland and England.

His ability to just be with the youngster and encourage him, no matter what the situation of the game is, no matter what the performance of a player is, he just tries to make sure that there is enough composure around that player, the player doesn't feel insecure, and that I think is a very very important thing when the player just comes into the team. And even for a player who has played a lot of games, for him also, he might go through a bad patch, you need someone to just come around you and just pat your back and say 'hey nothing to worry about, you've got all the ability, talent and everything, just need to go out there and enjoy.' You need that kind of backing and support from your captain and that is what we all got when he was captain.""Dhoni's deep understanding of the game and his ability to read match situations made him a master strategist. His field placements, bowling changes, and match tactics often caught the opposition off guard.

Lifeline for Hyderabad as Jindal Group steps forward to acquire club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/lifeline-for-hyderabad-as-jindal-group-steps-forward-to-acquire-club/articleshow/112554962.cms,"Hyderabad FC have been troubled with players complaining of unpaid dues

PANAJI: After months of uncertainty over their future due to rising debts and multiple transfer bans, Hyderabad FC have been thrown a lifeline by the BC Jindal Group , one of India’s leading business conglomerates.Hyderabad have been troubled for more than a year now with players complaining of unpaid dues. Since January this year, at least eight players have terminated their contracts on just clauses after complaining on non-payment of salaries for multiple months.Notices to the club have not helped, leading to the departure of key players.Now, just before the August 15 deadline provided by the organisers of Indian Super League (ISL) to sort out the mess, Hyderabad have informed the All India Football Federation (AIFF) that they have executed a term sheet with the BC Jindal Group. The term sheet, a non-binding agreement that sets out the basic conditions for making an investment, was signed last week.“A term sheet has been executed for acquiring the club, but a lot of loose ends are still to be tied before the company completes the takeover,” a senior official told TOI. “The company has sought time till the end of the month to complete the deal. There will be legal and financial due diligence, and only if the diligence is completed satisfactorily, the deal will go through.”As part of the due diligence, the company will have a look at unpaid dues, besides, crucially, try and sort out the taxation issues that have dogged the club.The BC Jindal Group is one of India’s leading business conglomerates and engaged in a diverse portfolio of businesses as a manufacturer of packaging films, steel pipes, pipe fittings, power generation, cold rolled steel strips, galvanized sheets etc.Last year, Concatenate Advest, for and on behalf of BC Jindal Group with GWC Asset Holding -- an entity promoted by one of the promoters of TVS group -- as the consortium partner, had made a bid to launch a new I-League team from Delhi but backed out due to the financial terms. “Instead of a participation fee, the group wanted an equivalent amount be considered as compulsory investment into the club and football in Delhi,” said another source.Should the Jindal Group complete the takeover of Hyderabad, they will have to first clear all pending dues of players and ensure that the club can start signing players. For now, the club is “banned from registering any new players for two entire and consecutive registration periods”, which effectively means the former ISL champions cannot register players for the entire 2024-25 season.Hyderabad also do not have enough players on their roll. The club has not started pre-season training, and with the ISL set to kick off on Sept 13, less than a month away, it will be a race against time to complete the formalities and feature in this edition of ISL.","Hyderabad have been troubled for more than a year now with players complaining of unpaid dues.

""We are looking forward, of course, for Luke Shaw. A very important player for our team so we want to get him back as soon as possible but we can't force this process.""Ten Hag said Mazraoui, Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot can all fill in at left back.While there was plenty of speculation about Ten Hag's job last season as United finished eighth in the Premier League, the 54-year-old signed a new contract to stay at the club until 2026 after they upset Manchester City to win the FA Cup.Ten Hag has high hopes for the team this season.""We know our targets, we know our direction,"" he said.

Visit of Manchester City may provide early clues to Chelsea puzzle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/visit-of-manchester-city-may-provide-early-clues-to-chelsea-puzzle/articleshow/112548868.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the new Premier League season kicks off, predicting Manchester City 's performance is straightforward, but the real intrigue lies with their opening opponents, Chelsea, whose unpredictable squad under new manager Enzo Maresca is leaving fans and pundits puzzled.On Sunday, Maresca will pick his first competitive line-up following another summer of hefty spending.Chelsea has spent around 160 million pounds ($205.10 million) on new players like winger Pedro Neto from Wolverhampton Wanderers, midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Leicester City, and goalkeeper Filip Jorgenson from Villarreal.Since owners Behdad Eghbali and Todd Boehly took charge in mid-2022, the club has acquired around 40 players with a total spend of approximately 1.3 billion euros ($1.43 billion).Managing such a large squad proved difficult for Mauricio Pochettino for most of last season, though a strong end to the campaign hinted at the identity he was trying to build. However, Pochettino was replaced by Italian manager Maresca, and Chelsea fans are hopeful things will come together more quickly this time around.""It is a complete guess but I am going to be wild and say Chelsea will sneak in, in fourth place,"" former Chelsea player and now BBC pundit Pat Nevin told the BBC. ""If you take last season as a whole, it could be anything again this time.""The visit from City, who are starting their quest for an unprecedented fifth successive English title, will certainly keep the focus sharp at Stamford Bridge.City has been quiet in the transfer window, maintaining a relatively small but experienced first-team squad of 27 players, expected once again to set a high benchmark.The corresponding fixture last season ended in a dramatic 4-4 draw in November, but Chelsea's subsequent 4-1 loss at Newcastle United demonstrated their inconsistency.While City waits until Sunday for their opener, Manchester United kicks off the season on Friday when they host Fulham.United's unexpected FA Cup final victory over City helped keep Erik Ten Hag in his job. However, the Dutchman knows he needs a strong start to the season to avoid the persistent speculation about his future that troubled him last season.While aiming for the top four, Arsenal is expected to be City's main challenger again, after coming close in the 2022-23 season and even closer last season.Arsenal begins at home against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, with main summer signing Ricardo Calafiori likely making his first defensive start. In addition to Maresca, several other managers will be making their competitive debut on the opening weekend.Liverpool's Arne Slot takes on the challenge of leading the club into the post-Juergen Klopp era, starting away at promoted Ipswich Town. Brighton & Hove Albion's Fabian Huerzeler kicks off his tenure against Everton, while all eyes will be on West Ham United's new manager Julen Lopetegui as his side hosts Aston Villa, who finished fourth last season.Tottenham Hotspur, who ended fifth last season, will begin their second season under Ange Postecoglou on Monday, playing away at promoted Leicester City.",Premier League season kicks off on Sunday with Manchester City taking on Chelsea.

Eder Militao nearly gave them the lead by heading Marten de Roon's cross over his own bar.Bellingham took a hard touch to control a deft pass from Vinicius and was booked for a late push on Atalanta goalkeeper Juan Musso during a raid forward from midfield.Vinicius set Rodrygo up, and he clipped the top of Atalanta's crossbar right before halftime.At the beginning of the second half, Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was injured for the majority of the previous season, made an incredible one-handed save to deflect a header by Mario Pasalic.At the beginning of the second half, Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was injured for the majority of the previous season, made an incredible one-handed save to deflect a header by Mario Pasalic.Before the hour, Valverde of Real Madrid broke the tie with a close-range tap-in as Atalanta's defense fretted over Mbappe's increased freedom of movement.Vinicius, who was becoming more and more important, feed Bellingham, who then sliced the ball across the goal for the Uruguayan midfielder to score.When Vinicius was let through on goal, Musso knocked over his attempt, which would have doubled Madrid's lead.As Madrid attempted a second, Swedish defender Hien stopped Bellingham, and Musso then stopped the former Borussia Dortmund player.Eventually, Mbappe finished it with a deadly flourish after Bellingham stalled an attempt and saw the Frenchman's deft move.The Madrid supporters applauded the striker as Ancelotti took him off the field in the 83rd minute, probably the first of many that to come.Mbappe stated that he anticipated getting better in the upcoming weeks.

'Underdogs' East Bengal look to defy odds against Turkmenistan challengers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/underdogs-east-bengal-look-to-defy-odds-against-turkmenistan-challengers/articleshow/112511817.cms,"KOLKATA: Carles Cuadrat the realist is saying that East Bengal FC will not start favourites against Turkmenistan 's Altyn Asyr FC in the AFC Champions League preliminary play-off.Cuadrat the believer, however, is ready to embrace this challenge as a new beginning for his team.The match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday will mark East Bengal's return to Asian football since their AFC Cup group stage exit in 2015.A win in this one-off fixture will fetch them a place in the first-ever ACL 2 edition while a defeat will take them to the Challenge Cup, the lowest in the AFC club tournament system.Aware of the stakes, Cuadrat described it as a ""difficult test"" for his players. ""We'll play against a team that is showing why they deserve to be in an AFC competition year after year as they've qualified for top 9AFC) competitions every season. It'll be a good test for us to prove that we are also at that kind of level and can represent the country in a top competition like the ACL-2,"" the Spanish coach told reporters on Tuesday.""We are not favourites for this game. We are playing in Asia after 9 years and have a lot of inexperienced players. It will be the first game (in an Asian tournament) for some of our players.

We reached two finals last season and were not so good in the ISL. We want to be the protagonist in all the competitions we want to play this season,"" the East Bengal coach remarked.For a team founded only in 2008, winning Turkmenistan's top domestic league (Yokary Liga) 8 times and being a regular in Asian football speaks volumes of Altyn Asyr's emergence as a force to reckon with.The visitors from Turkmenistan have the form and history on their side. But the red-and-gold's history is replete with many odds-defying tales. It remains to be seen if Nandhakumar Sekar & Co., starting as underdogs, can rise to the occasion and alter the script.","East Bengal face Turkmenistan's Altyn Asyr FC in AFC Champions League preliminary play-off.
