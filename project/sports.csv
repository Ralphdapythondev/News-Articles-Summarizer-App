And Rohit Sharma ne as a captain jitaya bhi nahi 2-3 saal se (even Rohit Sharma did not win it as a captain in last 2-3 years). Mumbai Indians know that they have been in this situation before.

If you look at players, who have had most of the success in T20 cricket, Lasith Malinga, Bumrah or Pathirana, myself when I played, we had a similar plan, try to bowl as many yorkers as possible, with our variations,"" said Pathirana.Bravo highlighted how bowlers' failure to rely on their yorker often undermines their performance during matches. As the leading wicket-taker in T20 cricket with 625 scalps, the veteran ensures that bowlers consistently practice delivering yorkers in the nets to ensure they are prepared for match situations.""One of the main reasons why bowlers struggle in this format is because bowlers don't trust their ability to bowl yorkers. So what I tried to implement in the coaching sessions is each and every bowler has to bowl 12-14 yorkers in a session. Only if you put in the work, in the game time, it will be easier,"" said Bravo.Opening up on some of his favourite pacers from CSK camp, Bravo praised the young Pathirana, who shot to fame with his slingy, Malinga-like action. During the last season, he took 19 wickets in 12 matches for CSK. Currently, he has nine wickets in four games of IPL 2024 .""Pathirana is very special. I call him Baby Malinga. I also call him Baby GOAT (Greatest of All Time). He is not someone you try to coach because he has a natural ability and skill,"" Bravo said.Bravo also pointed out that Bangladesh veteran Mustafizur Rahman is also very special to him. He has taken 11 wickets in six games in the ongoing season.""He has the reputation of having one of the best slower balls in the world. You don't try to over-coach these players. You just empower them with knowledge, and information and try to keep it simple,"" he added.The West Indies legend is also impressed with pacer Tushar Deshpade, who made a name for himself with a breakthrough IPL 2023. He took 21 wickets in 16 games to guide CSK to their fifth title win.Bravo said that during the team meetings, CSK asserts its resolve to be the "" smartest bowling team in the competition"" and prepares for all possible scenarios and does not look to repeat its mistakes.""We do drills, especially by keeping in mind the ground dimension. We practice with vision, with a purpose. When people look at us, they should see a plan, sometimes it does not work, but most times, it will,"" Bravo added.","Dwayne Bravo is the bowling coach for the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL.

NEW DELHI: Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru director of cricket, Mike Hesson , shed light on the decision not to retain Indian spinner Yuzvendra Chahal ahead of the IPL 2022 season auction, as Chahal achieved a historic milestone of 200 wickets in the IPL during the ongoing season.Hesson, who helmed the franchise's cricketing affairs from 2019 to 2023, disclosed the rationale behind Chahal's departure during an interview on JioCinema.He explained that not retaining Chahal allowed RCB additional financial flexibility, aiming to secure both Chahal and pacer Harshal Patel in the auction.IPL 2024: POINTS TABLE ""We didn't retain Chahal because retaining just three players gave the team an extra four crore rupees to spend, through which we aimed to buy back both Chahal and Harshal Patel,"" Hesson revealed.However, RCB's plans encountered a twist during the auction when Chahal's name emerged late, coinciding with their pursuit of Sri Lankan spin all-rounder Wanindu Hasaranga to bolster their squad.RCB prioritized Hasaranga when his name appeared earlier in the auction, inadvertently missing out on Chahal, whose name surfaced later.""Yuzi (Chahal) is one I will be frustrated with until I have finished my career and probably beyond. He is an outstanding bowler,"" expressed Hesson.In 153 IPL matches, Chahal has scalped 200 wickets at an impressive average of 21.60, including six four-wicket hauls and a five-wicket haul. His historic milestone came during the IPL clash against the Mumbai Indians at Sawai Man Singh Stadium when he dismissed Afghanistan all-rounder Mohammed Nabi to claim his 200th wicket, the first bowler to achieve the milestone.Chahal's journey in the IPL saw stints with the Mumbai Indians (2011-13) and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (2014-2021) before joining the Rajasthan Royals in 2022. While he had a brief stint with MI and a prolific spell with RCB, Chahal continues to excel in his new role with the Rajasthan Royals, having claimed 61 wickets in 39 matches for the franchise.","Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru director of cricket, Mike Hesson, shed light on the decision not to retain Indian spinner Yuzvendra Chahal ahead of the IPL 2022 season auction.

We know he's always had the talent. Abishek Porel has been outstanding as well. Abishek wasn't even going to play in the first game, but we'd lost early wickets and then came in as an impact player. I think he had nine balls or something and he got 30-odd runs. That changed the game and then the other day as well, he played very well.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant 's captaincy will be under the microscope as Delhi Capitals , struggling with their bowling performance, face off against the inconsistent Gujarat Titans in the IPL on Wednesday.DC's homecoming was marred by a 67-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad , causing them to slip to the eighth position with a 3-5 record. They understand the importance of avoiding further setbacks to keep their play-off hopes alive.Pant's decision-making came under question during the SRH match, starting with his choice to bowl first after misjudging the dew factor.His decision to give Lalit Yadav the second over was even more controversial, as SRH scored a record 125 runs in the powerplay without losing a wicket.Pant's personal performance was also lackluster, as he struggled to find his timing during the chase, scoring 44 off 35 balls.DC's openers, Prithvi Shaw and David Warner, have not been consistently successful, putting pressure on the middle order. Despite valiant efforts from Jake Fraser-McGurk (65 off 18) and Abhishek Porel (42 off 22), DC fell short of the massive target.DC's bowlers were taken to task by SRH, and they need to improve their performance. Khaleel Ahmed's decision to use short-pitched deliveries in the opening over backfired, and with the Kotla's short boundaries, DC bowlers need to focus on pitching the ball up.Anrich Nortje has been off-color this season, and DC will be hoping for Ishant Sharma's return from a back spasm. Kuldeep Yadav, despite being DC's best bowler with 10 wickets from five games, had a mixed outing against SRH, conceding the most sixes (7) while also having the highest number of dot balls (8).GT, under new skipper Shubman Gill, have also been inconsistent but moved up to sixth place after a three-wicket win over Punjab Kings. They will be looking to maintain their winning momentum and stay in contention for a play-off spot.Gill will be expected to lead from the front, while Sai Sudharsan, David Miller, and Azmatullah Omarzai need to contribute with the bat. Rahul Tewatia will be relied upon to provide fireworks in the later stages of the innings.On the bowling front, Mohit Sharma, Noor Ahmad, and Rashid Khan will be tasked with delivering crucial performances.Rishabh Pant (c&wk), David Warner, Abishek Porel, Ricky Bhui, Yash Dhull, Shai Hope, Prithvi Shaw, Tristan Stubbs, Kumar Kushagra (wk), Swastik Chikara, Ishant Sharma, Jhye Richardson, Rasikh Dar, Vicky Ostwal, Anrich Nortje, Mukesh Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav, Praveen Dubey, Khaleel Ahmed, Sumit Kumar, Axar Patel, Lalit Yadav, Jake Fraser-McGurk.Shubman Gill (c), David Miller, Wriddhiman Saha, Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Matthew Wade, Kane Williamson, Azmatullah Omarzai, Abhinav Manohar, Rashid Khan, Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia, Spencer Johnson, Kartik Tyagi, Joshua Little, Darshan Nalkande, Noor Ahmad, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohit Sharma, Jayant Yadav, Umesh Yadav, Sushant Mishra, Sandeep Warrier, Sharath BR, Manav Suthar.",Delhi Capitals face Gujarat Titans in IPL on Wednesday.

In Lucknow, he smashed 28 off just 9 deliveries and earlier against Mumbai his four-ball 20 was the talk of the town. He has an astonishing strike rate of 255.88.His former colleague and current CSK batting coach Michael Hussey said MS Dhoni has practised and prepared well coming into the tournament.“He is at a wonderful place in his career. He is comfortable, he is happy, he is enjoying his cricket. Bowlers are coming up with different plans against him because he has probably been the greatest finisher of all time. So, then he comes up with different ideas. And that’s one of the wonderful things about MS, who continues to evolve and continue even at this stage of his career to make him so better and make it harder for bowlers to bowl at him,” said Hussey.On the other hand, CSK’s opening batter Rachin Ravindra , who got off to a good start to the tournament, has been struggling and straddling the fence off late. Hussey is not too worried about Rachin’s form and is positive that the New Zealand southpaw will soon come good with a big score.“Batting can be very fickle, especially at the top of the order. If you get onto a bit of a roll, you can keep it rolling. But unfortunately, he’s missed out a couple of times, but he’s still in a good place mentally. His game looks in good working order, and I guess my message to him has been he’s just one inning closer to that big score that’s coming. He’s still in a positive frame of mind, he’s batting well in the nets, so we’re hopeful,” said Hussey.","Dhoni has been CSK’s go-to man in the end overs and the veteran has been duly playing his role to perfection.

MADRID: The city is still reeling under the Clasico hangover and everyone is praising Jude Bellingham . Marcel Desailly , the former captain of France and a World Cup-winner, did not miss out on joining the chorus on England’s new-found ace who decided the Clasico at the Bernabeu on a raucous Sunday night.What makes Desailly stand out, apart from his outstanding physical appearance, is his composed articulation on matters others are apprehensive talking about.TOI asked about Vinicius ' offfield challenges with racism while playing for Real Madrid and Desailly spoke his mind.""He's ambitious and he's a bit too touchy. But he's right at the same time. I experienced this at the time when I was playing for Milan. He doesn't understand. I understand the situation because I'm originally from Africa. You see where he's coming from, Brazil, where it's completely different, the approach. So it's not surprising that he has made the noise. Because it's not about him, it's about the La Liga .""We have the power to change things, but we are not doing enough. Samuel Eto'o had the same issue at his time. So Vinicius is also part of these players who will suffer because the administrative people are not willing to hit harder. Otherwise, we are happy about his growth,"" he said.""Vinicius is 24. I think he has improved. Remember when he came? Four years ago. He didn't have the ability to finish. You see now his clinical assist and finishing."" Immediately his French soul took over and he referred to Dembele. ""The stats are very poor. Two goals or three goals, but he has great potential.""The one player who is living up to potential is Bellingham . With Euro 2024 round the corner, Desailly feels the Real Madrid star will influence Gareth Southgate's forever underachieving bunch rather positively.""I don't think that he was outstanding last night, but he's been key for his team. (Carlo) Ancelotti could have substituted him. But he took Vinicius out because he knew Bellingham had the legs to defend and to position himself and identify the correct moment to find the killer goal. He is just a good player for now. You try to compare him with Zidane. It's difficult for us to accept that. The use of the ball is different with Zidane and Bellingham. Jude is a bit more straightforward on acceleration. Zizou was more pattern-weaving, ballet-like. But the potential of the talent is quite similar.""With his experience of English football while playing for Chelsea, Desailly is cheekily penetrative in his assessment.""Quality kills the quality. That is England's problem. The Dutch were having this kind of problem too. They all have a high expertise, they all have their own belief every time. It was difficult for them to unite all together at the same moment to perform. So England might have to improve on this aspect because the talent is there. So let's see how the coach is going to be able to adjust and make the choice.""Desailly was born in Accra, Ghana but moved to France with his mother when he was just four.","Marcel Desailly believes Jude Bellingham is living up to his potential.

Odisha have never beaten MBSG in their past nine ISL encounters, having gone down on four occasions out of those.Sergio Lobera ’s boys will certainly leave no stone unturned to break that winless streak against their much-fancied, confident opponents at home before travelling to the Mariners’ Kolkata citadel for the second leg. Though the Purple brigade can take heart from their 5-2 away win over the green and marrons to knock them out of the AFC Cup group stage.In ISL, Bagan are in the midst of a terrific run, winning four of their last five league games, including the last-day victory over 2022-23 Shield Winners Mumbai City to pip the Islanders to the Shield, the only missing silverware in their cherished trophy cabinet until then.Odisha, on the other hand, had a great start and steady momentum midway through the campaign, only to see it lose steam towards the end which saw them finish the league in fourth place. They secured their historic semis berth with a thrilling 2-1 comeback win against Kerala Blasters in the playoffs at home.Ahead of taking on the Shield Winners, Odisha FC head coach Sergio Lobera banked on their record at home this season. “Tomorrow’s game will be a difficult game. We are going to play against the current shield winners’ team. They have a very good team, but we also have a very good team and we are unbeaten in Kalinga. We want to keep the momentum in terms of our results at home. Our target is to finish the season unbeaten (at home),” Lobera said ahead of the game on Monday.Asked how special it will be to reach the ISL final, the Spanish coach said, “It will be very special for us to reach the semifinals. We are creating a lot of pages in terms of creating a story in the club. We want to do one step more. It will be amazing to reach the final.”Praising their opponents, Mohun Bagan coach Antonio Lopez Habas said ahead of the game, “For me, the past is not one to think about. I have to live in the present. Odisha are a very difficult opponent because they have a good coach, they have players with experience, and it will be a difficult match for us.”About their preparations for the semis clash, the Spanish gaffer said, “We need to prepare for this match as any league match, we need to win this match in the 90 minutes. We can’t think about the second leg, that is how we think about it. This semifinal is very difficult to win in the first leg, but we should not lose it in the first match.”With great tacticians at the helm of two talented bunch of players fighting for supremacy, Tuesday’s clash at Kalinga calls for an exciting first part of the two-legged battle for a berth in the final.","Odisha FC host Mohun Bagan Super Giant in the first leg of the high-octane last- four clash in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Jude Bellingham 's dramatic late winner in the El Clasico clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona on Sunday has virtually sealed the La Liga title for Los Blancos. The 19-year-old English midfielder's stoppage-time strike secured a 3-2 victory for Real Madrid, extending their lead at the top of the table to a commanding 11 points with just six matches remaining.The match was a thrilling encounter, with both teams displaying resilience and determination.Barcelona took the lead twice, through Andreas Christensen and Fermin Lopez, but Real Madrid fought back on both occasions, equalizing through Vinicius Junior and Lucas Vazquez . It was Bellingham's decisive goal in the dying moments that ultimately settled the contest in Real Madrid's favour.Bellingham's performance in his debut season in Spain has been nothing short of remarkable. With 21 goals across all competitions, he has emerged as Real Madrid's top scorer, showcasing his prowess and maturity beyond his years. His brace in the reverse Clasico fixture against Barcelona in October further underscored his ability to rise to the occasion in high-stakes matches.The victory at the Santiago Bernabeu was a testament to Real Madrid's grit and determination, qualities they have consistently displayed throughout the season. Their ability to bounce back from setbacks, as they did against Manchester City in the Champions League, has been a hallmark of their campaign.Lucas Vazquez, who played a pivotal role in all three of Real Madrid's goals, praised the team's resilience and acknowledged the significance of the win in their pursuit of the La Liga title. ""We've had a very good season, we're on a very good path, now we just have to polish it off and we'll go for everything,"" he told Real Madrid TV.For Barcelona, the defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, especially after their impressive performance following their Champions League exit at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain. Head coach Xavi expressed his frustration with the lack of goal-line technology in La Liga, which denied them a potential goal when Lamine Yamal's flick appeared to have crossed the line.Despite the setback, Barcelona showcased their fighting spirit and determination, with youngsters like Yamal and Pau Cubarsi impressing against the seasoned Real Madrid side. The future looks promising for the Catalan club, but for now, they must focus on securing their position in the league and preparing for the next campaign.Real Madrid find themselves in a commanding position, thanks in no small part to the exploits of Jude Bellingham.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United survived a breathtaking collapse to secure a thrilling victory over Coventry in an FA Cup classic on Sunday, setting the stage for a second consecutive final against arch-rivals Manchester City .Erik ten Hag 's side triumphed in a tense penalty shootout at Wembley , prevailing 4-2 after the teams were deadlocked at 3-3 following extra time.The match epitomised the tumultuous season for Ten Hag's men, who have struggled in the Premier League. Despite initially cruising to a commanding 3-0 lead against their second-tier opponents, with goals from Scott McTominay , Harry Maguire , and Bruno Fernandes , United's vulnerability in recent weeks was evident as Coventry mounted a stunning comeback.Second-half strikes from Ellis Simms and Callum O'Hare injected new life into the contest, before Haji Wright's 95th-minute penalty leveled the scores, completing a remarkable turnaround.Coventry supporters, buoyed by their team's resurgence, taunted Ten Hag with chants of ""you're getting sacked in the morning,"" adding to the drama of the occasion.In an enthralling period of extra time, both teams struck the woodwork, but it was United who ultimately held their nerve, prevailing in the penalty shootout.Rasmus Hojlund 's decisive spot-kick sealed a dramatic victory for Manchester United, ensuring their progression to yet anotherFA Cup final amidst a season filled with twists and turns.""We put ourselves in a difficult position and should have killed it earlier but we didn't,"" said United captain Fernandes. ""We have to do so much better.""Coventry manager Mark Robins famously played a key part in United's FA Cup final win in 1990, a victory that launched two decades of success under Alex Ferguson.But his team's push to reach the Championship play-offs has faded in recent weeks and they travelled to Wembley as underdogs despite United's stuttering season.United, 12-time winners of the competition, settled early and took the lead in the 23rd minute after a fine move down the right.Alejandro Garnacho fed the overlapping Diogo Dalot, whose cross went under the hands of the diving Bradley Collins and was tapped in by McTominay from close range.Manchester United, 12-time winners of the competition, asserted their dominance early on, taking the lead in the 23rd minute through a fine move down the right flank. Alejandro Garnacho's pass found Diogo Dalot, whose cross eluded the diving Bradley Collins, allowing Scott McTominay to tap in from close range.United extended their lead just before halftime as Harry Maguire rose highest to head home from Bruno Fernandes's corner. Despite Coventry's spirited display, Fernandes added a third goal for United in the 58th minute, his shot deflecting off defender Bobby Thomas and finding the net.Coventry, however, refused to back down, pulling a goal back through Ellis Simms in the 71st minute and reducing the deficit further when Callum O'Hare's shot deflected off Aaron Wan-Bissaka and past Andre Onana in the 79th minute.As the match intensified, Coventry was awarded a penalty for a handball by Wan-Bissaka, which Haji Wright converted to level the scores and force extra time.In the additional periods, both teams came close to clinching victory, with Fernandes hitting the crossbar for United and Simms striking the woodwork for Coventry. The Championship side thought they had secured a late winner, but VAR ruled out the goal for offside.The match ultimately went to a penalty shootout, where Manchester United prevailed 4-2, with Rasmus Hojlund scoring the decisive spot-kick to send them through to the final against Manchester City.","Manchester United beat Coventry City 4-2 in FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool reignited their Premier League title pursuit with a commanding 3-1 victory over Fulham on Sunday, drawing level on points with table-toppers Arsenal .While Manchester City still hold the fate of the title in their grasp, trailing the top two by just one point with a game in hand, both Liverpool and Arsenal have intensified the pressure on Pep Guardiola's side.This resurgence comes after both teams bounced back from unexpected defeats in the previous weekend.Jurgen Klopp expressed before the match at Craven Cottage that the comeback of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota from injury provided his team with ""a chance"" to reinvigorate their pursuit in the title race.Both were on target, either side of Ryan Gravenberch's first Premier League goal.Klopp took the brave decision to rest a series of first-team regulars among five changes to the side that won 1-0, but failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit against Atalanta in the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday.Mohamed Salah, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and Ibrahima Konate dropped the bench.Alexander-Arnold was one of the few shining lights in Bergamo and was restored for his first Premier League start in over two months.The England international showed the quality the Reds have been missing when he curled in a stunning free-kick to open the scoring on 32 minutes.Liverpool failed to hold onto the lead until half-time as the defensive lapses that have cost them in recent weeks reappeared.Timothy Castagne swept home a loose ball into the far corner after Rodrigo Muniz's header was blocked.Klopp had his stellar cast of substitutes warming up after a sluggish start to the second period.But one wayward pass from Alex Iwobi cost Fulham.Harvey Elliott intercepted on his return to Craven Cottage and teed up Gravenberch to curl in from the edge of the area.Jota then made the points safe with his 100th goal in English football when his low effort had too much power for Bernd Leno 18 minutes from time.Two more away trips at local rivals Everton and West Ham await Liverpool in the next six days.But with just five more games of the Klopp era to come, they remain at least in the hunt to give the German a glorious goodbye to his transformative time at Anfield.","Liverpool beat Fulham 3-1 to draw level on points with table-toppers Arsenal.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi showcased his brilliance by scoring twice and setting up another goal for Sergio Busquets , leading Inter Miami to a 3-1 victory over Nashville on Saturday in a captivating Major League Soccer encounter and maintaining their top spot in the Eastern Conference .Miami faced an early setback when defender Franco Negri inadvertently deflected a corner into his own net in the second minute, giving Nashville an early lead.However, Messi quickly turned the tide in Miami's favor, equalizing in the 11th minute after Luis Suarez directed a loose ball back to him following a parried shot.Despite hitting the post shortly afterward, Messi continued to orchestrate Miami's attacks, providing opportunities for his teammates and creating chances with his exceptional playmaking skills. In the 39th minute, his former Barcelona teammate Busquets nodded in a fine glancing header from Messi's corner to put Miami ahead just before halftime.The home side suffered a setback as Paraguay international Diego Gomez was stretchered off with an ankle injury just before the break, adding to Miami's injury woes.Nashville pushed for an equalizer in the second half but failed to capitalize on their dominance in possession. Miami sealed the victory in the 81st minute when Leonardo Afonso was brought down inside the box, allowing Messi to convert the penalty and secure his ninth goal in as many games for Miami in all competitions this season.Despite the win, Inter Miami head coach Gerardo Martino expressed dissatisfaction with his team's slow start, highlighting the need for improvement despite their depleted squad due to injuries.Inter Miami currently sits atop the Eastern Conference with 18 points from their opening 10 games, a commendable achievement considering the challenges they have faced. Martino emphasized the importance of accumulating points early in the season to avoid a repeat of last year's dramatic playoff chase.In other MLS fixtures on Saturday, reigning champions Columbus Crew salvaged a 2-2 draw against Portland Timbers, while Cincinnati secured a remarkable 2-1 comeback victory against Atlanta United, with Luciano Acosta playing a pivotal role in the win.",Lionel Messi scores twice as Inter Miami beat Nashville 3-1 in Major League Soccer.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal bounced back from their Champions League disappointment to reclaim the top spot in the Premier League with a convincing 2-0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.Leandro Trossard and Martin Odegaard were the heroes for the Gunners, striking at the end of each half to secure the crucial victory, taking them one point clear of Manchester City , who have a game in hand.The victory comes after a turbulent period for Arsenal, with a three-game winless run that included a Premier League defeat to Aston Villa and a Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Bayern Munich.Manager Mikel Arteta made just three changes from the side that suffered defeat in Munich, and although Arsenal took some time to find their rhythm, they capitalized on a stroke of luck just before halftime when Trossard's mishit shot found the back of the net.Despite dominating possession, Arsenal struggled to create clear-cut chances in the second half, but Wolves failed to capitalize on their injury-depleted squad's lack of attacking inspiration.Odegaard sealed the victory deep into stoppage time, compounding Wolves' misery and securing three vital points for Arsenal in their quest for a first league title in 20 years.Elsewhere in the Premier League, Liverpool have the opportunity to level points with Arsenal when they take on Fulham on Sunday, while at the bottom of the table, Luton Town suffered a crushing blow to their survival hopes with a 5-1 defeat to Brentford.Despite missing key striker Ivan Toney, Brentford's dominant display all but secured their top-flight status, leaving Luton still one point adrift of safety.Meanwhile, Burnley's 4-1 victory over Sheffield United leaves the Blades on the brink of relegation, with manager Chris Wilder lamenting his side's woeful defending.",Arsenal beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 to reclaim top spot in the Premier League.

That's obviously what I work towards, to try and get better and to win tournaments. So, nice to win my second Tour title, almost 10 or 11 months from now (after the first), and to do it on different surfaces, very very happy with that,"" Bhambri said following his victory in the company of French Albano Olivetti on Sunday.The pair defeated the German wildcard combination of Andreas Mies, a two-time doubles Grand Slam winner, and Jan-Lennard Struff, a four-time titleist, 7-6, 7-6.""I hope me and Albano can continue improving and continue getting better with more clay court events and the French Open coming up.""Coach Balachandran Manikkath, who has been working with Bhambri as part of the ""Doubles Dream of India"" programme, provided some insights on the adjustments the Delhi lad has made in his game for the slowest of the three surfaces.""Yuki has been working on playing on clay since Marrakech (ATP 250 event in Morocco). It is obviously different from hard and certain adjustments have to be made with serves, returns, volleys, smash, etc,"" Balachandran said.""He has done a tremendous job as the results show this week. On slow, wet clay courts he is able to hold serve comfortably and his returns are good, volleying is solid.""This win with Olivetti will help confidence on both sides. They are already fixed to play the clay season all the way up to French (Open). So nothing changes there except that both are moving up the rankings.""Bhambri's ranking rose a career-high 54 on Monday while Olivetti moved up to a personal best 45.The rankings at the end of the French Open will determine the entries for the tennis competition at the Olympics , which will be held at the Roland Garros as well.Doubles star Rohan Bopanna is sitting pretty well at World No. 2 at the moment, which gives him a direct entry and a partner of his choice subject to the latter's ranking being in the top-300 – in either singles or doubles.""Olympics is not in my control. The selection committee or the AITA decides the team, so I'm focused on trying to improve my ranking, improve my game and just continue on the Tour,"" Bhambri said.""Whether I like to play the Olympics, I absolutely would. It's every Indian's dream to represent the country and I'm no different. The Olympics is the biggest stage but, again, this is not in my hands.""Returning to what is in his control, Bhambri said the Munich triumph would not change his preference for hard.""Hardcourt is always going to be my preference. Just for the sole purpose that it requires less adjustment for me because I've played on it all my life,"" he said.""So, no matter how many titles I am gonna win on clay or grass, hardcourt is going to be the preference.""It (doubles) is a bit different compared to singles. Doubles is less movement, which makes it a bit easier but there's still technical aspects of doubles, which in general doesn't involve so much side to side movement.""There is a lot of serving and volleying, and returning fast points. So you have to be good at that, regardless of any surface if you want to succeed in doubles.""Given the necessities of the modern game where entries into big tournaments breaks and makes partnerships, Bhambri, who decided to focus on doubles only two seasons back, has become adept at playing on both sides of the court.""Yuki plays ad court with Olivetti. He played deuce with Robin Hasse in Dubai and reached semis. In Madrid last week he played deuce with Arel Behar too,"" Balachandran said.""Now he is comfortable playing on either side. Just that he has played more on ad court, and people recognise him as an ad court player. That will change soon as he plays on either side with different partners.""Known for avoiding late hours, playing on the Tour has also brought a bit of change to Bhambri's personal side.""Well, I've been part of the Tour for a long time now. So I know most of them. Of course, I miss partying with with Roger (Federer) and Rafa (Nadal), enjoying nights out with them. Since they are not much around on the Tour, it's not the same,"" he said.""Maybe the next generation I can hang out with more, stay out late and socialize with them more – the Alcaraz's and the Kyrgios's of the tour.""",Yuki Bhambri won his second Tour title with a win at the BMW Open in Munich.

Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective.

It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players. The captain, the coach and the support staff are appointed by the executive committee of the AITA,"" he said.Both captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule did not respond to request for a comment.",India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week. The All India Tennis Association believes the players have to step up.

Chinese Taipei and Pacific Oceania were relegated to Group 2.Rutuja won all her four matches in singles and her only loss of the week came in the one doubles match she was paired with Prarthana Thombare against the all-conquering Chinese.""For me, it was a very positive week, especially after the ankle injury I had in Mumbai (during the WTA 125K Series event),"" Rutuja said from Shenzhen, where she continued her exploits to win her first-round match in the $40K ITF event.""I didn't think I would be playing singles, but Sahaja had blisters and the captain ( Shalini Thakur ) and the coach (Radhika Tulpule Kanitkar) thought I had the experience, they trusted me.""In contrast to Rutuja's 100 percent record in the week, India No. 1 Ankita Raina had a below-par outing by her standards, winning just one of her five singles matches, although the World No. 255 had to double up for doubles duty as well.Two of Ankita's singles losses came against players whom Rutuja had beaten -- South Korea's Sujeong Jang (World No. 267) and New Zealand's Lulu Sun (167).""We could have qualified. The last day was very stressful. Ankita was a little bit tired, and it rained, so matches were moved indoors,"" Rutuja said.""It was clay but not the best like the one we played outdoors. The clay was coming off and you could see the (hard) surface beneath. We had to stay focussed.""And New Zealand (doubles team of World No. 5 and US Open winner Erin Routliffe and Paige Hourigan) played their best match of the week.""We had seen them play in the previous matches, and we were wondering if they were really World No. 5.""But against Ankita and Prarthana, they took the first set 6-1 in no time and went up 5-1 in the second. We made it 5-5 but they didn't really allow us to get back into the game.""It was a tough week but everyone gave their best.""Rutuja praised Ankita for showing courage to play back to back matches each day, but felt resting her a day could have helped the player's as well as the team's fortunes.""It was stressful for her. But credit to her, she stepped up to play both singles and doubles. Against Chinese Taipei, she had a long singles match (nearly two and a half hours) and then played doubles (after a 30-minute gap),"" Rutuja said.""Shalini ma'am and Radhika ma'am asked her if she could play, and she said she was ready.""She could have been rested one day, maybe against Korea (the day after playing Chinese Taipei). There were a lot of options.""","Rutuja Bhosale says Indian team ""could have qualified"" for the Playoffs of the Billie Jean King Cup.

NEW DELHI: Making a triumphant return from injury, Rafael Nadal demonstrated his dominance at the Barcelona Open on Tuesday by swiftly dispatching Flavio Cobolli .The 22-time Grand Slam champion, who hadn't competed in an ATP Tour match since January, secured a convincing 6-2, 6-3 victory over the Italian in just one hour and 25 minutes, advancing to the second round.Nadal, aged 37, relished the opportunity to compete on clay for the first time since his triumphant French Open win in 2022. Despite the hiatus, he showcased glimpses of his customary brilliance, delivering a solid performance that hinted at his enduring prowess on the court.""It was a good start -- when you return you can't get rid of the doubts in one day, above all, on a physical level,"" Nadal told TVE.""Within what it could be, it was a good first round.

Though Cobolli managed to break back in the third game, Nadal quickly regained the advantage with another break for a 3-1 lead, aided by Cobolli's third double fault. Nadal efficiently served out the set to secure the triumph.Despite his victory, Nadal's performance on serve was solid yet subdued, lacking in aces and explosive power, yet effective enough to outmaneuver his opponent and claim the win.""I've gone months without being able to serve, (and) although I've got a lot of excitement to play here and do the best I can, I'm not going to go crazy with the serve,"" added Nadal.""I have to serve with caution that the moment I'm in dictates... there are moments in which I feel more liberated and others in which I'm more careful.""","Rafael Nadal beats Flavio Cobolli 6-2, 6-3 in first round of Barcelona Open.
