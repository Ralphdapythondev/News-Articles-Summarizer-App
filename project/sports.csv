WATCH:

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's newly appointed limited-overs captain Mohammad Rizwan shared that he never actively sought the role. Following the Pakistan Cricket Board ’s (PCB) latest leadership announcement, Rizwan has officially taken over from Babar Azam as Pakistan's white-ball captain and will lead the team in the upcoming three-match ODI and T20I series against Australia.""I never desired or asked for captaincy. If it's granted by Allah, one shouldn't refuse. I never sought captaincy,"" Rizwan said.""Regarding the past, everyone had their opinions on this. Even when Saifee was captain, I offered him suggestions, and he did the same for me. Now that I've become captain, all the players will be captains for the team. My focus will be that when I leave cricket, there will be more captain material ready for the team,"" he added.Pakistan are coming off a 2-1 Test series win at home against England and is set to face Australia in an ODI series starting on November 4, followed by three T20Is. The ODIs will take place in Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, while the T20Is will be hosted in Brisbane, Sydney, and Hobart.Reflecting on his new role, Rizwan said, “One of my wishes is to see the Pakistan team in the same kind of atmosphere that we had a couple of years ago. We were all with each other at any stage, whether things were working for us or not. Because of that, a lot of things worked in our favor back then.”“The same things are present now also. But the difference is that we have more young talent along with seniors, and we wish that we all as a team gel together. It’s a bit difficult when the seniors are playing and when the young lot comes and takes time to understand things. I guess during the Australia series, we will regain the same momentum that we had earlier,” he added.",Mohammad Rizwan says he never actively sought the role of Pakistan's limited- overs captain. He will lead the team in the upcoming three-match ODI and T20I series against Australia. Pakistan are coming off a 2-1 Test series win at home against England.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114754695,imgsize-58176,width-400,resizemode-4/114754695.jpg"

I am very hungry to get an international match: Ishan Kishan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ishan-kishan-exclusive-interview-india-cricket-team/articleshow/114722758.cms,"File image of wicketkeeper-batsman Ishan Kishan (Photo Source: X)

exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com

Excerpts:

What were your first thoughts when you saw your name in that

. You have gotten used to seeing your names in India squads but this would have felt different?

Exactly a year back, everything which could have gone right did go right for you. You were part of almost every Indian side. What kind of headspace were you in back then?

For a young boy, playing a 50-over World Cup would have been special. Everyone wants that but very few get to experience. You played two games when Shubman Gill was sick, made a useful contribution in the game vs Afghanistan. How was the World Cup experience?

To be ready to bat anywhere for the team, you need to be mentally ready for the challenge. How much work has gone into keeping yourself in the right mental headspace?

WATCH:

There has been a lot of chatter on social media, and a lot of negative chatter too. Does it affect a youngster like you? How do you deal with it?

So have you switched the notifications off to be away from all this?

You can't control social media. Jo bhi chalega... it's okay Ishan Kishan

You spoke about the advice you got from Hardik. If you could talk in detail about the time you spent with the Pandya brothers in Baroda, away from everything. How important was that and how much did benefit you?

From the corporate DY Patil tournament to India A, you took all the steps needed to get to the Indian team. Did it feel like pressing the reset button or looking to make your debut for the country again?

A lot happened in your journey in the last six-eight months. Has the boy grown up into a man during this period?

Will the banter, fun and games continue?

Hasi mazaak to chalta rahega

Did the family also feel that their little boy has grown up. Your father is very passionate about your cricket, did he feel that too?

hota hi hoga

raat bhar dad ke saath baith kar kisi story par maza kar sakte hai

It has been eleven months since Ishan Kishan played for India. A T20I in Guwahati, versus Australia, was the 26-year-old's last outing for the national side. He has been away from the set-up and undergoing the grind in the domestic circuit to impress the men who matter. Again. Since taking a break for personal reasons during the South Africa tour last year, the wicketkeeper-batter recharged his batteries during a long camp in Baroda alongside Hardik Pandya earlier this year and hasn't missed a game since.Starting with the DY Patil T20 tournament, he started taking those baby steps and has been a regular fixture in the domestic team. Indian Premier League, Buchi Babu multi-day tournament for Jharkhand, Duleep Trophy, Irani Cup and now the Ranji Trophy , the left-hander has played every competition on offer. Hundreds in the Duleep Trophy and Ranji Trophy helped him force his way back into the scheme of things as he was named in India A squad for the tour of Australia.For a 26-year-old who was accustomed to seeing his name on India squad sheets, the A call has been special and he is very hungry to play to return to the senior side.In an, the wicketkeeper-batter talks about his time away from the game, the practical advice he got from Hardik and how he rediscovered his hunger in Baroda.Obviously very special for me. I am very happy about it as it's another opportunity for me to go there and perform with a bunch of great players coming on the tour. Very happy about getting my name back and getting everything back on track.I am someone who loves to perform for the team, loves to stay happy and loves to help people around. Looking back, when I used to see my name in every squad I was very happy but I felt I needed to do more for the team. I was never satisfied with the performances... I always used to think about doing better. I was always in that frame of mind. I was happy back then, and right now also.I feel hunger is very important. It comes when you take rest also, when you don't get to play so many matches. That is the time when that hunger kicks in and you would have also seen batters going in and just going bang, bang. That's the thing I felt was missing sometimes but I am really happy about whatever is happening right now.The World Cup was the greatest tournament I have been part of. I feel this is what dreams are made of. I wish we won the final too because we had been so meticulous throughout the tournament. From my junior days, I have never been fussed about my batting position. You have to play for the team and do whatever is required at that given point. Even if they ask you to play at a certain number, you have to be open about it. I feel that is the level where you are ready to perform and just looking to perform whenever you wear that blue jersey. You don't think whether you are batting at No. 3 or No. 4. You just think about scoring runs and focus on doing that.At that point, I just thought of doing my best no matter where I played. I was looking to adapt as per the situation and used to talk to senior players in the team who have performed well in that particular position. You get that experience from other players and just go out there and play your game. When you are playing for your country, you can't ask for a particular number. Whatever place or position you get, you have to be ready to take that.Every individual is different. I feel not everyone would think like that. I feel I am lucky enough that my thinking pattern is very practical. I am a very practical guy. I have spent a lot of time with Hardik (Pandya) and you also know that he is a very practical guy. What's needed, is needed. You don't have to cry about everything... So I have also started thinking like that.At a very young age, I was picked by Mumbai Indians and I have been friends with Hardik for a long time now. So I know how he thinks and I know he also wants me to be a great player so he keeps sharing ideas with me. I am in a very practical zone right now. Even if you get out, it's not like I start thinking 'ye kya ho gaya (what just happened), how will I now perform in the next game'.You need to find that neutral point where even when you score a hundred, you have to be very calm. Even if you get out early, you have to stay grounded. You have to find that right balance. I am very lucky to have guys like Hardik around me who have spoken to me about it. There are moments in cricket where you feel really down. And it's not just for me, it's for every cricketer. But if you find that neutral point, you will get over it. Skills are always there, it's just your mental thing. How you are dealing with things at that point of time. I have been very lucky to be in a very healthy zone throughout my career.I feel negativity will be there on social media. People will troll you if you don't do well and that is very normal. I feel every sportsperson should accept that this is going to happen and you shouldn't make a huge fuss about it. I feel you should enjoy that also because at the end of the day, you know what when you perform then the same set of people will praise you also.That happened with Hardik also. People were trolling him also but he just did his work, performed well in the World Cup and now you can see the result. So this is how it should be... negativity will be there but you have to find that neutral point so that you take everything in a very sporting way.You can't control social media. Jo bhi chalega... it's okay. I feel you don't have to get too much into this social media also. When I speak to younger guys who are getting into big teams, I tell them the same thing to please try and be away from social media.I am very well aware of everything, I haven't switched the notifications off. There will be times when people will go harsh on me... I feel at the end of the day when I perform it's good for my movie (laughs).I had a reality check in Baroda about my hunger towards the game and the process was just too good. When I was there in Baroda, it was not like I was just batting. It was like starting your life again, your cricket again. The same hunger which I used to have when I used to play Sunday-to-Sunday as a kid. We used to crave for matches then and used to wait for a Sunday.In Baroda, we had a plan and a routine. I used to do a lot of yoga and do a lot of meditation. It was not like I was staying only at their place. There was a time when my parents were there and I was spending a lot of time with them and feeling very grounded. I was not in a negative zone because I wasn't in the team. I was in a very healthy space training twice a day for one month. I got to batting only after a month and before that I used to wake up early to meditate and used to see the rising sun. It was so much fun.I used to crave for my batting in Baroda also during training because batting happened only after a month of training. It was the best time of my life. IPL didn't go that well but it was a very big learning for me that no matter what you do, everything will not go your way. There will be times when god will check you and that's the time you have to be very stable in life. Very practical and very grounded.You have to keep playing your game because at the end of the day, there is so much competition. Everyone wants to play for India and I am very happy for everyone who is playing for the country. There is so much healthy competition that you start enjoying it and don't take it as additional pressure.I am not thinking on those lines (pressing the reset button). I feel very hungry right now and I know I will just smack the bowlers whenever I get the opportunity again. I am going to go all in. I am very hungry to get an international match. I know what happens in team meetings when someone makes a comeback to the team. How light banter happens and I am very excited about those things also. Whenever I get that opportunity, I am going to go all-in for sure.Yes, I have grown up a lot in last few months. The way that I now look at this game... my perception about this game is very different from what I had before. The banter would continue... but now I know where to stop so that it doesn't disturb my game. I am in a more mature headspace now and the break taught me a lot about it. I was spending the most quality time of my life.(banter will always happen) but I feel you need to have that line where you understand now it's done and you have to get back to your focus zone and just think about your game.I think feel to. My dad is someone who doesn't share a lot of things about what he is feeling. I know he is happy now. There was a time when he was very worried. As a sportsperson, I know when you take some decisions then people around you, who love you, will get hurt. Primarily because they wouldn't know the reason behind it and your plan behind it.And I think this is what helps you become a man from a boy...when you start taking your calls and you know what's important for you at a particular point. Everything is good now, dad is also happy about the calls I am taking because he also knows it's not going to be easy for me. The comeback is not going to be easy, my dad knows that. They are very happy right now, very cheerful and very excited about the future. I am also excited about the future because now you know",Ishan Kishan was named in India A squad for tour of Australia.

Former Pakistan captain Babar Azam has been recalled for the white-ball tour of Australia after being dropped for the last two Tests of the series at home against England due to his inconsistent form; but experts believe that one big knock in a big game will help him get his mojo back.Ramiz Raja, who served as chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and also led Pakistan during his playing days, believes it's only a matter of time before Babar rediscovers himself and shows the world that he is Vivian Richards ""I feel Babar has to achieve a lot more in Test cricket,"" said Ramiz, while replying to a viewer's question on his YouTube channel.""He plays the white-ball format really well, has an average of 50-plus in both the formats (T20I and ODI)...There is so much potential in Babar Azam. Ab unko apne temperament se batana hai duniya mei ke woh ek Viv Richards hain (now he has to prove to the world with his temperament that he is Viv Richards). Bigger the contest, bigger the innings Richards used to play,"" Ramiz added, while comparing Babar to the West Indies legend.Pakistan will play three ODIs and three T20Is against Australia from November 4 to 18 before embarking on the tour of Zimbabwe that will also feature three ODIs and three T20Is.Babar, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah have all been recalled for the Australia tour after being left out of the Test squad.The white-ball teams will be led by newly-appointed skipper Mohammad Rizwan, except in the T20I series in Zimbabwe where the team will be captaine by Salman Agha.""I am just hoping that he (Babar) rediscovers himself after returning from rest because there are important series coming up,"" Ramiz concluded.",Babar Azam has been recalled for the white-ball tour of Australia.

MUMBAI: India skipper Rohit Sharma said after the series defeat against New Zealand in Pune that the team isn't thinking about the WTC final yet.But with their lead over second placed Australia trimmed to decimals and other teams closing in, they will have a lot to play for - read 12 WTC points for a win - when they square off against the Black Caps in the third Test from Friday at the Wankhede Stadium .They also need a minimum of three wins in the five-Test series against Australia Down Under.With plenty of Tests to be played across the world in the next couple of months, here's a look at how top five teams are placed in the WTC standings and the road ahead in their quest to reach the final at Lord's in June 2025.India were expected to win all five home Tests this season, which would have made their task of qualifying for the final a bit easier. They started with two convincing wins over Bangladesh but two defeats against New Zealand have upset their plans.Now, they must win the third Test against the visitors and then face a tough task of toppling the Aussies on their home turf.A 3-2 result in their favour will be an ideal scenario but say if they end up winning just two Tests of the five then they will have to depend on other teams' results to help them qualify for the final.Australia will play the most Tests among the teams that have a chance of qualifying for the final. Up first is the five-game series against India. They lost the last two series (four-game) against them but with a full squad at their disposal, they will be eager to avenge those defeats.The two-Test series against Sri Lanka may be a potential banana skin for them as they have lost four of the last five Tests in the Island nation.It remains to be seen which Sri Lanka turns up during the two-Test away series against South Africa-one that upset the odds to win the series 2-0 in 2018-19 or the one which lost by the same margin in 2020-21 the last time they visited.One suspects, the Islanders will be more comfortable when they will be back on home turf against the Australians, who they have dominated in the past.The two wins against India have put them in the fray for the final and they will look to carry on that good work in the Mumbai Test . How they perform in the three-Test home series against England will determine how their challenge develops.England's last three series in New Zealand have resulted in two 1-0 wins for the hosts and the last one ended in a thrilling 1-1 draw.Bangladesh are expected to dish out a rank turner in the second Test against South Africa at Chattogram, so how the latter fares on it remains to be seen.If the Proteas end up losing that Test, they will look to win their remaining four home games to put themselves in the top two spots. The last time they hosted Sri Lanka and Pakistan, they won 2-0 and 3-0.","India need to win a minimum of four of their next six Tests to have a realistic chance of qualifying for the final of the World Test Championships in June 2025.

NEW DELHI: Top order batter Prithvi Shaw , who was excluded from the Mumbai squad for the ongoing Ranji Trophy match against Tripura owing to fitness and disciplinary issues, found some words of solace from none other than the legendary Sunil Gavaskar The right-handed opening batter, who has represented India in five Tests, six ODIs, and one T20I, appears to have encountered some difficulties. Sources indicate that the 24-year-old has been irregular in attending the team's training sessions and has also been observed as being ""a little overweight.""""Speaking of domestic matches, defending Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai have dropped Prithvi Shaw from their team that is currently in Tripura. There have been mixed reports about his omission from the Ranji team. If it's about his attitude, approach and discipline, then it's understandable, but hopefully, it has nothing to do with his weight, as one report seems to have suggested. That report suggested that he had 35 per cent more body fat,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Mid-Day.Gavaskar also emphasized that physical appearance, such as weight or body shape, should not be the primary measure of a player's fitness in cricket. He cites examples of Sarfaraz Khan , who, despite public scrutiny over his physique, scored a brilliant 150 against New Zealand.""We have seen in the previous Test in Bengaluru how another player Sarfaraz Khan, whose weight and shape have also been discussed in the public domain, played a scintillating innings of 150, showing that it is not the shape or the size of your waist that determines cricket fitness.It's whether you can score 150-plus runs and that too bat for a whole day or bowl 20-plus overs in a day. That should be the only criteria of a player's fitness. By the way, how many players with zero per cent or minimal body fat have scored 379 like Prithvi Shaw? I rest my case about fitness,"" added Gavaskar.","Prithvi Shaw dropped from Mumbai squad for Ranji Trophy match against Tripura.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) chairman Ramiz Raja has addressed the controversy surrounding his post-match comments to Test team captain Shan Masood after Pakistan’s 2-1 Test series win over England.Raja’s remarks, particularly his question about Pakistan’s six consecutive losses, sparked criticism from fans and former players, including pacer Mohammad Amir , who called for more respect and professionalism in his behaviour.The 62-year-old sparked controversy by taunting skipper Shan Masood after Pakistan's series win, asking, ""Aapne 6 losses in a row kaise achieve kiya?"" (How did you achieve six losses in a row?) instead of celebrating the victory.Raja, speaking on his YouTube channel, defended his line of questioning, stating that his intention was not to undermine the team’s achievement but to explore how they overcame recent struggles.""I asked a couple of questions, and my goal wasn’t to belittle anyone or cast Pakistan's victory in a negative light. As a commentator, the more Pakistan wins, the more opportunities open up for all of us in the cricketing ecosystem,” Raja said.He dismissed the backlash as part of the social media landscape, saying, ""Pakistan zinda hi social media pe hai"" (Pakistan lives on social media).He expressed frustration with how people misinterpret his comments, adding, “If I lived my life based on social media narratives, I wouldn’t be in this field. There are many uninformed opinions from people who haven’t played cricket but act like experts.”Raja also underlined that he did not intend to question Shan Masood’s captaincy and expressed disbelief at how quickly the conversation spiralled into controversy. ""When Bangladesh won 2-0, I didn’t ask for anyone to be removed. Why would I question Shan's captaincy after a series win?"" Raja argued.Earlier, Mohammad Amir had publicly criticized Raja for his remarks, suggesting that the former chairman should have focused on celebrating the series win rather than bringing up past failures.In a viral video, Amir remarked, “You should celebrate the series win. There is a series-winning captain sitting next to you. You should have asked him about the win, next plans. But you are making fun of him. Have some respect. You are literate people and you should behave like one as well. Where the credit is due, you should give it. I was feeling so bad for Shan. Ramiz has been doing on-air duties for so long now and he has no idea what to ask a winning captain.""","Former Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) chairman Ramiz Raja has addressed the controversy surrounding his post-match comments to Test team captain Shan Masood after Pakistan’s 2-1 Test series win over England.

NEW DELHI: Matthew Wade , one of Australia’s most successful and revered players, is set to embark on a coaching career following his retirement from international cricket.Wade played 36 Test matches, 97 One-Day Internationals, and 92 T20 Internationals for Australia, with his last appearance at this year’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the West Indies.The Tasmanian played pivotal roles in numerous Australian victories over his 13-year career, most notably in the 2021 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, where his performance was integral to the team's success.He will join Australia’s coaching staff for the upcoming T20 series against Pakistan under Andre Borovec, staying on for the ODI series that begins in Melbourne next week.While Wade starts his coaching journey, he will continue playing domestic cricket for Tasmania and in the Big Bash League with the Hobart Hurricanes for at least the next two summers.Wade has been coaching Tasmanian youth and second XI sides during the winter, roles he hopes to expand within the Australian system while playing through the summer.Matthew Wade said: “I was fully aware my international days were most likely over at the end of the last T20 World Cup. My international retirement and coaching has been a constant conversation with George (Bailey) and Andrew (McDonald) over the past six months.“Coaching has been on my radar over the last few years and thankfully some great opportunities have come my way, for which I am very grateful and excited.“I will continue to play BBL and the odd franchise league over the summer months, but around those commitments as a player I am investing heavily in my coaching.“As my international career closes, I want to thank all of my Australian teammates, staff, and coaches. I enjoyed the ride, as challenging as it can be at the international level. Without good people around me, I would have never got as much out of myself as I did.“I also thank my family, mum, dad, and sisters, for the countless hours they put in over the years getting me to games and training.“Lastly to Julia and the kids. I can’t thank them enough for the sacrifices they have made for me to continue to pursue my dreams. No words can explain how grateful I am to them; none of this would have happened without their support.”Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley said: “Congratulations to Matthew on what has been a wonderful international career during which his skill and versatility has made him an outstanding performer across all formats.“I’m delighted he will add to his massive contribution by coaching the next generation of stars and also continuing to light up the Big Bash with the Hobart Hurricanes.”Executive General Manager, High Performance & National Teams, Ben Oliver said: “We extend our thanks and congratulations to Matthew on an outstanding international career.“Matthew was a much-loved teammate in Australian teams across all formats over the past 13 years. His resilience and adaptability were a feature throughout his career, and he should be incredibly proud of the impact that he had at international level.“We look forward to Matthew drawing on his wealth of experience as he transitions into coaching, and we wish he and his family the very best for the future.”","Matthew Wade has announced his retirement from international cricket.

List of Ballon d'Or winners

since the award's inception in 1956 after Rodri was named 2024 winner on Monday.

* From 2010-2015 the Ballon d'Or was merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year to create the FIFA Ballon d'Or award.

NEW DELHI: Spain and Manchester City midfielder Rodri was awarded the prestigious Ballon d'Or on Monday, recognizing him as the world's best player. He triumphed over Real Madrid's Brazilian star Vinicius Jr and English prodigy Jude Bellingham to secure the coveted prize.Rodri's exceptional performances were crucial in Manchester City's historic achievement of winning the Premier League title for an unprecedented fourth consecutive season. Additionally, he was named the best player at the European Championship this year, where Spain clinched their record-extending fourth title.At 28 years old, the Madrid-born player becomes the first defensive midfielder to receive the Ballon d'Or since Lothar Matthaus in 1990. He is also only the third Spaniard to win the award, following in the footsteps of Alfredo Di Stefano (1957 and 1959) and Luis Suarez (1960).Despite the dominance of Spanish league players in the Ballon d'Or's history, no Spaniard had claimed the prize since Barcelona legend Luis Suarez more than six decades ago.This is a remarkable feat, considering Spain's ""golden generation"" that won the World Cup in 2010 and the European Championships in 2008 and 2012.""Today is not a victory for me, it is for Spanish football, for so many players who have not won it and have deserved it, like (Andres) Iniesta, Xavi (Hernandez), Iker (Casillas), Sergio Busquets, so many others. It is for Spanishfootball and for the figure of the midfielder,"" Rodri said on stage at the ceremony.""Today many friends have written to me and have told me that football has won, for giving visibility to so many midfielders who have a job in the shadows and today it is coming to light.""I'm a regular guy with values, who studies, who tries to do things right and doesn't try to follow the stereotypes and even so I have been able to get to the top, and it is thanks to all of you.""1956 - Stanley Matthews (England)1957 - Alfredo Di Stefano (Spain)1958 - Raymond Kopa (France)1959 - Alfredo Di Stefano (Spain)1960 - Luis Suarez (Spain)1961 - Omar Sivori (Italy)1962 - Josef Masopust (Czechoslovakia)1963 - Lev Yashin (Soviet Union)1964 - Denis Law (Scotland)1965 - Eusebio (Portugal)1966 - Bobby Charlton (England)1967 - Florian Albert (Hungary)1968 - George Best (Northern Ireland)1969 - Gianni Rivera (Italy)1970 - Gerd Mueller (West Germany)1971 - Johan Cruyff (Netherlands)1972 - Johan Cruyff (Netherlands)1973 - Johan Cruyff (Netherlands)1974 - Johan Cruyff (Netherlands)1975 - Oleg Blokhin (Soviet Union)1976 - Franz Beckenbauer (West Germany)1977 - Allan Simonsen (Denmark)1978 - Kevin Keegan (England)1979 - Kevin Keegan (England)1980 - Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (West Germany)1981 - Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (West Germany)1982 - Paolo Rossi (Italy)1983 - Michel Platini (France)1984 - Michel Platini (France)1985 - Michel Platini (France)1986 - Igor Belanov (Soviet Union)1987 - Ruud Gullit (Netherlands)1988 - Marco van Basten (Netherlands)1989 - Marco van Basten (Netherlands)1990 - Lothar Matthaus (Germany)1991 - Jean-Pierre Papin (France)1992 - Marco van Basten (Netherlands)1993 - Roberto Baggio (Italy)1994 - Hristo Stoichkov (Bulgaria)1995 - George Weah (Liberia)1996 - Matthias Sammer (Germany)1997 - Ronaldo (Brazil)1998 - Zinedine Zidane (France)1999 - Rivaldo (Brazil)2000 - Luis Figo (Portugal)2001 - Michael Owen (England)2002 - Ronaldo (Brazil)2003 - Pavel Nedved (Czech Republic)2004 - Andriy Shevchenko (Ukraine)2005 - Ronaldinho (Brazil)2006 - Fabio Cannavaro (Italy)2007 - Kaka (Brazil)2008 - Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)2009 - Lionel Messi (Argentina)2010 - Lionel Messi (Argentina) *2011 - Lionel Messi (Argentina) *2012 - Lionel Messi (Argentina) *2013 - Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) *2014 - Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) *2015 - Lionel Messi (Argentina) *2016 - Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)2017 - Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)2018 - Luka Modric (Croatia)2019 - Lionel Messi (Argentina)2020 - Award Cancelled (COVID-19 pandemic)2021 - Lionel Messi (Argentina)2022 - Karim Benzema (France)2023 - Lionel Messi (Argentina)2024 - Rodri (Spain)",Manchester City midfielder Rodri wins the Ballon d'Or award.

Ranji Trophy: Vidarbha thrash Uttarakhand for third successive win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-vidarbha-thrash-uttarakhand-for-third-successive-win/articleshow/114755739.cms,"Vidarbha spinner Harsh Dubey

BRIEF SCORES:

NAGPUR: The man playing his 100th First Class match triggered the Uttarakhand collapse. A youngster, billed to fill in the shoes of the milestone man, soon joined in and posted his career-best bowling figures. Together, the two gave Vidarbha a big win in Dehradun on Tuesday.The collapse, engineered by Akshay Wakhare and Harsh Dubey , saw Uttarakhand fold at just 71 in 21.2 overs. Vidarbha posted a crushing 266-win, their third of the season, to consolidate their top position in Elite Group ‘B’ with 18 points.The end of the Uttarakhand innings was sudden, almost unbelievable. The top three in the Uttarakhand batting lineup added a meagre 3 runs to the scoreboard in 51 balls. The last 4 wickets were gone in seven balls, for just 2 runs.It’s difficult to gauge if the Vidarbha bowlers dished out unplayable stuff or Uttarakhand batters lost a mental battle. Perhaps, it was a bit of both, and more. Chasing a 338-run target on the last day can be a daunting task. The Day 4 pitch at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Dehradun, though, wasn’t as roughed up to warrant the collapse.Wakhare, starting the Vidarbha attack, bowled a maiden first up. In his second, again a maiden over, offie Wakhare accounted for opener Avneesh Sudha. Next over, Aditya Thakare, who had not conceded a run till then, removed opener Vaibhav Bhatt for a duck.By the sixth over, Uttarakhand were 2 down for 2 runs when Wakhare — with his spell reading 3-2-1-1 — was taken off the attack. Dubey, replacing Wakhare, removed skipper Samarth R as Uttarakhand slid to 8 for 3 wickets in 8.3 overs.As Uttarakhand stared down the barrel, Yuvraj Choudhary, the No. 5 southpaw batter, adopted the hit out or get out approach. Choudhary (38;21b) hit 5 sixes, all off Dubey. The blitzkrieg helped Uttarakhand reach 53 for 3 in 15 overs.With Choudhary blazing all guns, Wakahre was brought back into the attack in the 14th over. After starting his second spell with a maiden, Wakhare struck on the first ball of the 16th over to send Choudharyback. .The Choudhary dismissal proved to be the beginning of the end of the Uttarakhand inning. Dubey, who had conceded 34 runs in four overs for one wicket till then, picked up two more — Kunal Chandela (13;40b;2x4) and Aditya Tare (0;1b) — in his fifth.There was no stopping Dubey after that. Post lunch, Dubey struck thrice in the 21st over of the Uttarakhand inning — accounting for Abhay Negi, Mayank Mishra and Deepak Dhapola. In the next over, Wakhare ended the rival inning with Swapnil Singh's wicket — his seventh of the match. Dubey, with 6 for 38, posted the best figures of his 11-match First Class career.Vidarbha 326 all out in 88 overs & 300 all out in 75 overs (Dhruv Shorey 59, Yash Rathod 56, Danish Malewar 42, Akshay Karnewar 31; Swapnil Singh 5 for 97; Deepak Dhapola 2 for 21, Mayank Mishra 2 for 82) beat Uttarakhand 289 all out in 107.2 overs & 71 all out in 21.2 overs (Yuvraj Choudhary 38; Harsh Dubey 6 for 38, Akshay Wakhare 3 for 17, Aditya Thakare 1 for 7) by 266 runs.Player of the Match: Yash Rathod","Vidarbha posted a crushing 266-win, their third of the season, to consolidate their top position in Elite Group ‘B’ with 18 points.

Brief Scores:

Jharkhand proved to be no match for the visitors throughout their Round 3 Ranji Trophy encounter in Jamshedpur as Chandigarh clinched the tie by 10 wickets to go top of Group D table on Tuesday.Starting the final day at Keenan Stadium on 28/3, the hosts could add just 102 runs to their second innings and set Chandigarh a meagre target of 43 runs to win as the visiting bowlers put up an allround show. And, riding their winning momentum, Chandigarh mustered the target in just 3.3 overs to finish the game on 45 for no loss.The 10-wicket victory earned the Manan Vohra-led side seven points to take them to 13 points from three matches. Jharkhand, on the other end, failed to earn any point from the four-day game to stay on fifth spot with six points from the three fxitures they have played so far.Earlier, the bowling trio of Nishunk Birla (3-17), Vishu Kashyap (3-46) and Raj Bawa (3-33) claimed three wickets each as Chandigarh, which had also garnered the first-innings lead, demolished any effort from Jharkhand to force a comeback on Day 4.The hosts’ debutant opener, Sharandeep Singh (64), was the only batter on the day to put up any resistance against the Chandigarh bowlers and hit his maiden half-century in a bid to carry his team’s cause. His partnership of 79 runs with skipper Virat Singh (30) for the fifth wicket was the only bright spot for the home side.However, the dismissals of Sharandeep and Virat in the space of just 12 balls and just 2 runs put paid to any of the hosts’ hopes to script a draw. Wicketkeeper-batter Robin Minz — also making his debut for Jharkhand — added 16 more runs with his bat to take the total to 130 as wickets kept tumbling at the other end.Later, Chandigarh openers Arslan Khan (25) and Shivam Bhambri (19) helped their team to a consecutive win without any hiccups on the way.Jharkhand 201 and 130 in 50.3 overs (Sharandeep Singh 64, Virat Singh 30; Nishunk Birla 3 for 17, Vishu Kashyap 3 for 46, Raj Bawa 3 for 33).

Brief Scores:

AHMEDABAD: Opener and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (100 off 122 balls; 10x4) answered questions about her form with a timely century as India chased down a 233- run target with six wickets to spare in the third and final ODI against New Zealand here on Tuesday.With meaningful contributions from captain Harmanpreet Kaur (59 not out; 63b; 6x4), No. 3 Yastika Bhatia (35; 49b; 4x4) and finishing touches from Jemimah Rodrigues (22; 18b; 4x4), the hosts chased down the target in 44.2 overs to take the series 2-1.India’s pursuit of 233 commenced with Shafali Verma striking two exquisite boundaries before she was caught down the leg side by Isabella Gaze off pacer Hannah Rowe. However, Mandhana and Bhatia batted in a composed manner, rotating the strike and hitting the odd bad ball for boundaries as India reached 40 for 1 in the first 10 overs.Mandhana’s first boundary came off the 27th delivery she faced while Bhatia got off the mark with a straight drive off Lea Tahuhu. Smriti lofted Eden Carson for a boundary over mid off before Yastika smashed the same bowler over extra cover for another four. Bhatia then hit Sophie Devine straight down the ground before spooning a catch back to the bowler off the next ball.Harmanpreet and Smriti's partnership started off slowly but eventually all the bowlers bore the brunt of their hitting prowess. Devine was struck for three boundaries while left-arm spinner Fran Jonas and pacer Rowe were smashed to all parts of the ground.Smriti was bowled just after she completed her hundred, off Rowe’s scrambled seam delivery. Jemimah's cameo, in which she struck four exquisite boundaries, was cut short by Jonas, who trapped her in front.Earlier, India had New Zealand in a spot of bother, first at 36 for 3 and then again at 88 for 5, but the White Ferns added 144 runs for the last five wickets to reach 232 in 49.5 overs.India 236 for 4 (Mandhana 100, Harmanpreet 59; Rowe 2 for 47) beat New Zealand 232 (Halliday 86, Deepti 3 for 39, Mishra 2 for 41) by 6 wickets.","Opener and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (100 off 122 balls; 10x4) answered questions about her form with a timely century.

MUMBAI: Delhi seamer Harshit Rana was called up on Tuesday to bowl in the India nets ahead of the third Test against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, which kicks off on Friday.Rana was recently named in India’s 18-member squad for the upcoming Borde rGavaskar Trophy in Australia. The 22-year-old has impressed this season with both ball and bat, taking 5 for 80 and 2 for 61, and scoring a half-century (59) to lead Delhi to a 10-wicket win over Assam at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. However, TOI has confirmed with sources in the BCCI that Rana has not yet been included in the squad.Alongside the injured Mayank Yadav, Nitish Reddy and Prasidh Krishna, Rana was chosen as a reserve for India’s three-match Test series against New Zealand. All the reserve pacers bowled in the nets before the first Test in Bengaluru.“Washington Sundar was added to the squad before the second Test after a meeting among selectors. No such meeting has happened regarding Rana. Realistically, one pacer out of Mohammed Siraj and Akashdeep Singh will partner Jasprit Bumrah, along with three spinners in the eleven. Rana was picked as a reserve bowler for the New Zealand series. With the next Ranji match starting on November 6, he can bowl in the India nets for a couple of days before joining the Delhi squad. As of now, he hasn’t been included in the squad,” a source told TOI.If not included in the main squad, the seamer is likely to fly to Chandigarh for Delhi’s next Ranji match.Known for his all-round abilities, Rana was close to making his debut in the Zimbabwe T20I series in July but missed out. Rana’s pace and precision caught the selectors’ eye, earning him a place in India’s T20I squad against Bangladesh, though he did not get a game.Meanwhile, KL Rahul, who was dropped from the second Test, trained at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday alongside wicketkeeper-batsman Dhruv Jurel.","Harshit Rana called up to bowl in India nets ahead of third Test against New Zealand.

Kolkata: For the second successive match, Bengal and Kerala had to be content with just one point each in their rain-affected Ranji Trophy Elite Group ‘C’ game at JU’s Salt Lake campus ground here that ended in a dull draw on Tuesday.Not even the first innings of both the sides could be completed in the match in which only seven sessions of play was possible after a washout on the first day. The result saw Karnataka, who beat Bihar, overtake Bengal on the points table as the latter slipped to the fourth spot with five points from three matches.Kerala declared their innings at 356 for nine, half-an-hour before lunch, leaving Bengal to get those runs in a minimum of 78 overs (63 + 15 mandatory overs) in just over two sessions of play. However, the hosts did not find it prudent to go for the chase and preferred to just play out the sessions getting 181 for the loss of three wickets when bad lights stopped play before the start of the mandatory overs.Bengal openers Shuvam Dey and Sudip Chatterjee negated any chance of Kerala pressing for the first-innings lead by stitching together a 101-run partnership in 31 overs. Debutant Dey played a cautious knock without trying any heroics. Chatterjee continued his good form and managed to find the occasional boundaries too. Both the batters got their fifties before seasoned campaigner Jalaj Saxena provided the breakthrough by having Chatterjee trapped in front for a well-made 57 that came off 102 balls with the help of nine boundaries as Bengal went into the tea break at 123 for one in 37 overs.Dey hit the only six of Bengal innings before being stumped by Mohammed Azharuddeen off Aditya Sarwate for 67. The left-arm spinner struck again when he had another debutant Avlin Ghosh trapped in front for four.But skipper Anushtup Majumder joined hands with Sudip Gharami to keep the Kerala attack at bay. Visiting skipper Sachin Baby used seven bowlers but failed to get any more breakthroughs. The two were involved in an unbroken 43-run stand as the contest dragged on without much purpose in the last session of play.Earlier in the morning overnight unbeaten batter Salma Nizar continued to frustrate Bengal attack as he stayed undefeated on a polished 95 facing 265 deliveries and hitting eight fours and one six. Man of the match Ishan Porel ended with six for 103.Brief scores: Kerala 356/9 declare in 120 overs. Bengal 181/3 in 63 overs (Shuvam Dey 67, Sudip Chatterjee 57). Match drawn.

The duo stitched together a crucial 76-run partnership for the second wicket, steadying the Indian innings.Bhatia played the perfect foil to Mandhana, scoring a brisk 35 runs before falling to a return catch.Mandhana's partnership with captain Harmanpreet Kaur proved decisive, effectively sealing the match for India.Their 118-run stand for the third wicket deflated the New Zealand bowling attack, with Kaur playing a supporting role with an unbeaten 59.By the time Mandhana departed in the 41st over, India were within touching distance of victory.Earlier in the day, New Zealand recovered from a precarious 88/5 to post a respectable total of 232/5, thanks to a fighting knock of 86 runs from Brooke Halliday.The Indian bowlers, led by Deepti Sharma and Priya Mishra , had initially dominated the proceedings, reducing New Zealand to a moderate total.Despite the late fightback from New Zealand, Mandhana's century proved to be the difference between the two sides.",India beat New Zealand by six wickets to win three-match ODI series.

Brief Scores

Gujarat 335 and 314/9 in 101 overs (Umang Kumar 153 not out, Jaymeet Patel 82; Manan Hingrajia 33; Ajay Singh Kukna 5-107, Aniket Choudhary 3-37, Arafat Khan 1-65) drew with Rajasthan 319 (Abhijeet Tomar 77, Ajay Singh Kukna 47, Jaymeet Patel 3-26, Arzan Nagwaswalla 3-99, Chintan Gaja 2-42).

JAIPUR: Breaking a long sequence of fifties, Umang Kumar slammed a maiden century as the Ranji Trophy match between Rajasthan and Gujarat ended in a tame draw at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Tuesday.In a pre-Diwali celebration, Umang produced a wide range of fireworks from his willow to accomplish his career’s highest score with an unbeaten 153.Thanks to Umang’s marathon innings, Gujarat piled up 314 for 9 in their second innings. The visitors opted for batting practice rather than going for an outright win on the fourth and final day on the placid track. With no result in sight, both the captains decided to call off the match just before the tea-time.Gujarat bagged three points on the basis of their 16-run first innings lead, while hosts settled for a solitary point. After the end of the third-round fixtures, Vidarbha led the Elite Group B with 18 points, followed closely by Gujarat (15). Rajasthan (10) slipped to the fourth spot as Himachal Pradesh jumped to the third position with 14 points to their credit.With only two teams qualifying for the knockouts from each group, Deepak Hooda-led side will have to improve their performance by a few notches up to make the cut.When Gujarat resumed at their overnight score of 129/4, the hosts were hoping against hope to wrap up the visiting side as quickly as possible and go for the target.However, Umang and Jaymeet Patel shattered their hopes with a gutsy display of batting to frustrate the home team. Umang and Jaymeet Patel, who were batting on 44 and 25, respectively on Monday evening, continued from where they had left to add 153 for the fifth wicket.By the time Jaymeet (82: 140, 10x4) departed the match was over for Rajasthan. Umang romped to his hundred off an excellent boundary to the mid-wicket fence off Arafat Khan. The diminutive batter jumped in joy and punched the air in wild celebration after reaching the milestone.Even though wickets were tumbling at the other end, the 23-year-old Umang kept scoring runs at will to reach the 150-run mark. Rajasthan left-arm spinner Ajay Singh Kukna bagged a five-wicket haul, while Aniket Choudhary claimed 3 for 37. Seamer Arafat Khan chipped in with a wicket.The Daman-based cricketer was ecstatic after the match.“The big baggage is off my shoulder now. I scored seven half-centuries and came quite close on a couple of occasions but couldn’t reach the three-figure mark. When I came to bat yesterday the match was hanging in balance. I am glad that due to my unbeaten ton, I helped my team come out with an honourable draw,” Umang told TOI on Tuesday.Jaymeet was adjudged as man-of-the match for his brilliant all-round performance. Even captain Chintan Gaja lauded the efforts of his young all-rounder.“Jaymeet’s deadly spell on the second day afternoon and his batting in crisis in both the innings was crucial in the ultimate outcome of the match. I am also happy for Umang for finally fulfilling his first century. We didn’t declare our second innings as we knew we can’t achieve a result on the flat track,” said Gaja.","Gujarat draw with Rajasthan in Ranji Trophy match at Sawai Mansingh Stadium.

You need to get to a situation for luck to play a role: Arjun Kadhe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/you-need-to-get-to-a-situation-for-luck-to-play-a-role-arjun-kadhe/articleshow/114661630.cms,"Arjun Kadhe

PUNE: It was his grandparents who sowed the seeds for Arjun Kadhe ’s career as a professional tennis player.More than two decades ago, when Arjun was taking baby steps in tennis, his paternal grandfather decided to sell their house and set aside the proceeds exclusively to help his grandson follow a dream.“I remember when I was eight years old … at that point we were not financially so super to think about tennis as a viable option for my career. But my granddad had a vision. He told me, ‘Okay, I will do anything. You just play tennis, you want to represent India, you want to play a Grand Slam ’. My parents were living on rent. It was unbelievable,” an emotional Kadhe, 30, said as he jogged his memory back.All the sacrifices, of his and of those around him, and the years of tireless pursuit of excellence bore fruit last week when Arjun claimed his first ATP Tour doubles title , in partnership with Rithvik Choudary at the Almaty Open in Kazakhstan last week.“The credit goes first to my parents, they've made huge sacrifices, then my coaches. Obviously, it's a team effort,” he said.""Obviously, Balu sir (coach M Balachandran) traveling with us, (former South African player) Raven (Klaasen) traveling with us, the Double Dream of India programme is helping us a lot.“And as you said, the journey is long, but it feels really, really good, because you get rewarded. In doubles you're playing 35 weeks alone on the road, and it can be really brutal sometimes.“So this win, we both want to take it in, get confidence, enjoy and go ahead again.”The Indian combination beat three teams ranked in the top-30 on the ATP Tour, including No. 13 pair Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul of France in the second round.In a thriller of a final, Arjun and Rithvik saved five match points in the super tiebreak to beat Germany’s Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, ranked 26th, 3-6, 7-6 (3), 14-12. Remarkably, the Indians won only 68 points to their rivals’ 80 in the match.Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard to get there in the first place.“I think luck played a big part. But at the same time, we were just talking, the coaches were telling us we lost two finals in the super tiebreak, where we were the better team, in the Challengers. As (personal coach) Hemant (Bendrey) sir was also saying, luck is there, but you have to get yourself into that situation for luck to play it out,” Arjun said.The Punekar, supported by Punit Balan group , rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win.“I'm really grateful that it has happened, but at the same time, I feel I was playing a good level,” he said.“It's about, you know, being there, giving yourself that chance, getting rejected, at some point it will come.“It's not in your hands when that click comes. For some people, it comes early. If they can sustain it, they move to the next level.“Some people get rejected, and get that breakthrough. It's about working hard and trying to improve, and take the next step. Everyone has their own journey, in my opinion.“I feel we deserve it, because I truly believe we have the level. Now it's about going the long way and trying to improve every day and not be satisfied with this one tournament.”Arjun had partnered Rithvik in the latter half of last season but parted ways at the start of 2024. Even before they combined, the Telangana lad had mentioned to Arjun of his desire to play with his previous partner Niki Poonacha whenever he decided to focus on doubles. So, the Maharashtra player was understandably cautious when Rithvik reached out to him in the middle of this season.“I feel like every challenge brings opportunity. At that point (when Rithvik chose to go back to Niki at the start of 2024), I was like, ‘oh my God. we are doing well, blah, blah, blah, what is happening?’ But then, if I look back now, I won (two Challenger) titles (with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Anirudh Chandrasekar),” Arjun said.“So it was really good for me.”This time around, Arjun said, the two were in for the long haul. And long-term partnership is something he strongly believes in.“To develop a good team, you need time,” he said, “because if you keep switching partners, the first few weeks of understanding how we want to play, understanding how my partner wants us to play in the future, what is our best?“For all that to align it takes a little bit of time, and in doubles you have super tiebreak. Sometimes you are winning from (facing) match points, sometimes losing from match points.”The Almaty title had given a pleasant surprise for both Arjun and Rithvik in terms of ranking jump — the latter had broken into the top-100 for the first time in his career, reaching 85 in the ATP charts.That means they will now give it a shot to make the Australian Open cut before closing the season.“Now it's about planning it smartly, taking care of your body, because it's the end of the year, you don't want to overplay,” he said.“If we want to be top-50 in the world, we need to improve a lot. We won this tournament, but those teams are doing so many things better than us. So, it’s important also to play the big events, lose, and then realize this is where we are at.“So, we are not thinking too far ahead, just trying to think next week. How can we try and make Australia? If we don't make it, we still have to try and make French.“The plan will go forward from there.”","Arjun Kadhe claims his first ATP Tour doubles title with Rithvik Choudary at Almaty Open in Kazakhstan. The 30-year-old rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win. Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114661721,imgsize-157286,width-400,resizemode-4/114661721.jpg"
My fighting spirit helped me win my first ITF title: Tanisha Kashyap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/my-fighting-spirit-helped-me-win-my-first-itf-title-tanisha-kashyap/articleshow/114554193.cms,"Tanisha Kashyap in action during the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru last week. (Photo Credit: KSLTA/Deepthi Indukuri)

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured. I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week.

Coaches view it as beneficial for player development and professional recognition. Umpires appreciate the shift, claiming it allows them to focus on officiating rather than policing coaching violations.However, the decision has drawn criticism from some prominent players.World number six Taylor Fritz took to social media platform X to express his disapproval, stating, ""Can we stop ruining the 1v1 mental/strategic aspect of the sport PLEASE.""Fritz, a US Open finalist, has previously voiced concerns about off-court coaching, believing it diminishes the individual strategic and mental battle inherent to tennis.Former world number 10 Denis Shapovalov echoed Fritz's sentiment, expressing disappointment on X, stating, ""Not just as atennis player but as a fan of this sport it’s sad to see this new off-court coaching rule. Tennis is special because you are out there alone. Why are you trying to change the beauty of this game.""Shapovalov's statement underscores the perspective that off-court coaching undermines the unique solitary nature of tennis, potentially impacting the sport's core appeal.The ITF's decision to formally implement off-court coaching marks a significant shift in the sport's landscape.While the organization emphasizes positive feedback from stakeholders and potential benefits, vocal opposition from high-ranking players like Fritz and Shapovalov highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the rule change and its potential long-term impact on the sport's fundamental dynamics.","The ITF has officially approved off-court coaching, starting January 1, 2025.
