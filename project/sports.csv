NEW DELHI: Former Indian wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik has cleared the air regarding his all-time India XI across formats, which surprisingly omitted legendary wicket-keeper and captain MS Dhoni . Karthik recently explained that the omission was an honest mistake, admitting he forgot to include a wicketkeeper in his lineup.Karthik made the clarification after receiving feedback once the episode aired on Cricbuzz.""Bhai log, bada galti ho gaya (Guys, I made a big mistake). Genuinely, it was a mistake. I realized only when the episode came out,"" Karthik confessed. He further elaborated that due to an oversight amidst various considerations, he did not include a wicketkeeper, leading to the assumption that Rahul Dravid would take on that role. ""Can you believe being a wicketkeeper, I forgot to have a wicketkeeper? It is a blunder,"" he added.Karthik, who himself has played as a wicketkeeper for India, lavished praise on Dhoni, calling him ""one of the greatest cricketers to have ever played the game."" He also clarified that if given the chance to redo his team, Dhoni would be his automatic choice for the No. 7 spot and would be the captain of any Indian team, irrespective of the format.The all-time India XI across formats that Karthik selected features a mix of India's finest talents across formats. The lineup includesVirender Sehwag and Rohit Sharma as openers, followed by Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar in the crucial No. 3 and No. 4 positions. Virat Kohli is at No. 5, adding further depth and firepower to the batting lineup.For the all-rounder slots, Karthik chose Yuvraj Singh and Ravindra Jadeja, both known for their match-winning abilities with both bat and ball. The spin department features Ravichandran Ashwin and Anil Kumble, two of India's most successful spinners, while the pace attack is led by Jasprit Bumrah and Zaheer Khan. Karthik also named Harbhajan Singh as the 12th man, recognizing his significant contributions to Indian cricket.Dinesh Karthik’s initial XI, which led to the controversy, was: Virender Sehwag, Rohit Sharma, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Anil Kumble, Jasprit Bumrah, and Zaheer Khan, with Harbhajan Singh as the 12th man.Despite the mix-up, Karthik’s selections underscore his respect for the greats of Indian cricket and highlight the depth of talent the country has produced over the years.","Former Indian wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik has cleared the air regarding his all-time India XI across formats.

MUMBAI: When Rahul Dravid is in a good mood, he can leave you in splits. At an event here on Wednesday night, he responded hilariously when quizzed about which actor he would pick to play himself in a biopic. “If the money is good enough, I will play it myself,” the cricket legend quipped. Having stepped down as Team India head coach after guiding Rohit Sharma & Co to their T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies in June, Dravid humorously referred to himself as “jobless” multiple times and even urged the audience to “send him an email with suggestions on what job he can take up next”.“My wife (Vijeta) wants me to be at home and take care of my boys,” he added.Dravid acknowledged that winning tournaments requires not only skill but also a bit of luck, which can play a significant role in the outcome of big matches.To emphasise this point, Dravid recalled two finals during his nearly three-year tenure as Team India head coach—one in Ahmedabad and the other in Barbados. The first was the 2023 World Cup final on Nov 19, when Travis Head survived a probing spell from India’s newball pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami before his 137-run knock broke a billion Indian hearts.“I’ve had time to reflect on it... You realize sometimes you have to do everything right, but luck plays its part,” Dravid said.“On November 19th… we beat Travis Head’s bat 15 times — he didn’t touch a single ball. Sometimes things go your way, but you have to stick to the process,” Dravid, who received the Lifetime Achievement honour at the Ceat Cricket Rating Awards, remarked.Dravid also pointed to India’s thrilling comeback against South Africa in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados on June 29. Despite South Africa needing just 30 runs off the last five overs, India (176/7) defended their total, withSuryakumar Yadav ’s stunning boundary catch turning the game in India’s favour.“Sometimes at the end of the day, you need a little bit of luck. (Against South Africa in T20WC final)… 30 balls to go, 30 runs to go. (It was about) incredible execution, incredible calmness by Rohit. We didn’t focus on what we needed to do, but we needed a guy who could keep his foot within one inch of a line. Sometimes (it is) the skill,” he said, recalling Suryakumar Yadav’s fabulous catch on the long-off boundary to pull off David Miller’s dismissal. It was a catch that tilted a tight game in India’s favour.Reflecting on his time as head coach, Dravid expressed pride in India’s journey to the 2023 World Cup final, where they won nine consecutive matches before losing to Australia in the title clash. “To travel across the country and witness the passion of the fans... just the experience as a coach was phenomenal,” he said.Though they fell short in the 2023 World Cup, Dravid credited the team’s T20 World Cup success to sticking with the same processes and energy. “We needed to create the same vibe, the same team atmosphere... and hope for a little bit of luck on the day,” the 51-year-old explained. Dravid waxed eloquent on India’s ability to churn out top-quality cricketers.“I left in 2011-2012. These (new) players have been able to carry the legacy forward. If you just look at the success that we’ve had over the last 12 years in all the three formats of the game, the time that after we left, it’s been absolutely phenomenal. Very easily, clearly in a lot of the rankings, we’re always (No.) 1 or 2… we’re always up there with anyone,” he said.“I have no doubt that this generation of players, led by people like Rohit and Surya and the (other) guys coming forward in all formats of the game is only going to continue to do that in the future,” he added.","Rahul Dravid jokes about playing himself in a biopic: 'If the money is good enough, I will play it myself' The cricket legend stepped down as Team India head coach after guiding Rohit Sharma & Co to their T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies in June.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112724666,imgsize-50480,width-400,resizemode-4/112724666.jpg"
"1st Test: Jamie Smith, Harry Brook drive England into lead against Sri Lanka",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/1st-test-jamie-smith-harry-brook-drive-england-into-lead-against-sri-lanka/articleshow/112724523.cms,"- POPE BOWLED -

NEW DELHI: Jamie Smith 's unbeaten 72 helped England secure a slim first-innings lead against Sri Lanka in the opening Test at Old Trafford on Thursday, despite the second day being curtailed by poor light and rain. England reached 259-6, a lead of 23 runs, in response to Sri Lanka's 236.Smith, batting at No 6 due to the absence of injured skipper Ben Stokes, registered his third half-century in four Test appearances.The 24-year-old wicketkeeper showcased his ability to support established batsmen and maintain the scoring rate while batting with the tail.He shared partnerships of 62 with Harry Brook (56) and 52 with Chris Woakes (25) before both were dismissed by left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya, who returned figures of 2-58 in 21 overs.England found themselves in trouble at 67-3 in the 15th over after the morning session was washed out, with paceman Asitha Fernando claiming 3-68 in 14 overs.Sri Lanka had experienced a similar collapse on Wednesday, losing their first three wickets for no runs in 10 balls before being bowled out for 236.Captain Dhananjaya de Silva top-scored with 74, while debutant Milan Rathnayake set a new record for the highest score by a No 9 batsman on debut with his 72.Dan Lawrence, recalled to open in place of the injured Zak Crawley , successfully reviewed an lbw decision against him off Asitha Fernando when on 10.However, two balls later, the paceman trapped Ben Duckett lbw for 18, with Sri Lanka overturning the original not out decision.Asitha Fernando's excellent bowling performance continued as he dismissed Ollie Pope, who was captaining England for the first time due to Stokes' torn hamstring, for just six runs with a ball that nipped back through the gap between bat and pad.Despite the setback, Lawrence appeared to be in good form until he edged a ball angled across him from left-arm seamer Vishwa Fernando to the diving wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal when he was on 30.Pope's dismissal brought Root to the crease, and the former England captain boasted an impressive record against Sri Lanka, having scored more than 1,000 runs in 11 previous Tests at an average of nearly 60, including four centuries.However, Asitha Fernando ended a promising partnership of 58 when Root, who had scored a typically elegant 42, inside-edged an intended drive, and Chandimal dived forward to take a fine low catch.Smith, the new batsman, confidently advanced down the pitch to drive Jayasuriya for six, and Brook completed a fifty off just 59 balls.On the same ground where Shane Warne bowled Mike Gatting with the 'Ball of the Century' in 1993, Jayasuriya made a bid for the modern-day equivalent by dismissing Brook in stunning fashion. The 25-year-old rising star had added just three runs to his tea score of 53 not out when he was turned inside out by a ball from left-armer Jayasuriya that dipped in on the line of middle and leg stumps before spinning sharply and bouncing to clip the top of off stump.Brook's dismissal left England at 187-5, and Woakes fell in a similar manner when he was clean bowled by a quicker Jayasuriya delivery that angled in and spun significantly away from the right-hander.","England reach 259-6, a lead of 23 runs, in response to Sri Lanka's 236. Jamie Smith scored 72, batting at No 6 due to absence of injured skipper Ben Stokes.

They demanded his resignation and called for the dissolution of the WFI.Their complaint to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president PT Usha prompted the formation of an inquiry committee, featuring prominent figures like Mary Kom and Yogeshwar Dutt. However, the WFI denied all allegations against its president and coaches.The Sports Ministry later intervened, suspending all WFI activities and sidelining assistant secretary Vinod Tomar.The legal battle intensified in May 2024 when a Delhi court formally framed charges against Brij Bhushan and Vinod Tomar.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant 's exceptional performance during India's previous tour of Australia has left a lasting impression on batting legend Matthew Hayden . The former Australian opener believes that Pant's ""muscle memory and thirst for victory"" will make him a crucial player for the Indian team when they embark on their upcoming five-Test series in Australia later this year.The highly-anticipated Test series is set to commence on November 22 in Perth, and Pant's presence in the Indian lineup is expected to be a significant factor in their quest for success.""Guys like Rishabh Pant have got a muscle memory and the thirst for victory. He was such a key player last time he played there and the Australian public loved him as well, because of the nature of the way he played his game,"" Hayden told media, as quoted by PTI, on the sidelines of 'CEAT Cricket Rating Awards' in Mumbai on Wednesday.""It was exciting. It was innovative. It was just fresh and good. Then you have got your old stewards, likeVirat Kohli , (he) will want to make an impression again. From a batting point of view, I'm excited to see how India have that strategy to take on the Australian conditions,"" the Australian added.Pant has staged a remarkable comeback to the sport following a harrowing accident that threatened his life in 2022. His return to the national team has been nothing short of spectacular, as he aims to replicate his heroic performances from the historic 2020-21 tour of Australia.During that unforgettable series, Pant played a pivotal role in India's triumph, scoring a scintillating 97 and an unbeaten 89. His fearless approach and ability to take on the Australian bowlers in their own backyard were instrumental in India's success.Against all odds, a depleted Indian side, missing several key players, orchestrated one of the most incredible comebacks in the annals of Test cricket. They defied expectations and stunned a formidable Australian team on their home turf, securing a victory that will be etched in the memories of cricket enthusiasts for generations to come.The visitors rebounded from the humiliation of being bowled out for 36 in the opening Adelaide Test to secure a 2-1 victory in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, their second consecutive series win.After the Adelaide match, Kohli had to return home for personal reasons, while five other players, including key pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, were sidelined due to injuries and fitness concerns.""The great thing from an Indian perspective is that when you look at the last victory, there was no Virat Kohli. There was very much a second team bowling line-up that won at the Gabba,"" Hayden said.""That's the kind of confidence that you can expect this Indian unit to go to our shores (with) and go, 'guys, we've done this before, and we've done it in a way that's second to none, even without our key players',"" he said.Hayden remarked that scheduling a day-night Test often diminishes the advantage Australian teams have traditionally enjoyed. In the upcoming series, the two sides are set to play a Pink Ball Test in Adelaide.""Once you get those overhead conditions under that twilight zone, they can be really difficult,"" he said.""I would go as far as to say that the home advantage in Australia has been taken away quite a lot, simply on the basis that if you get (on) the wrong side of a certain session, be that you are four for 130 at twilight, you can (soon) be eight for 150.""There's no chance to actually really naturally dominate a game,"" he added.Hayden praised Pat Cummins, noting that he has united his team like no other Australian captain before, leading Australia to victories in both the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup last year.""He has a very special leadership style and ability. It's a very different style to the former captains of the Australian cricket team that were (about) very much a carrot and stick type approach,"" he said.""He's operating on a model that's bringing out the individuals and individual preparation in particular - something which our game struggles with being a team sport,"" he added.Hayden remarked that Australia, under Cummins' leadership, has become an exceptionally close-knit team, earning the respect of former players like himself, who were initially upset by the way former coach Justin Langer was dismissed.""I (have) followed this team very closely over the last two years and they're an extremely close team. Even the former players, when we were upset with the removal of Justin Langer, they closed ranks and doubled down on how it is that they wanted to go about their work,"" he said.","Rishabh Pant's exceptional performance during India's previous tour of Australia has left a lasting impression on batting legend Matthew Hayden.

It was something that we were really hoping for. When we won the World Cup, it was important for all of us to enjoy the moment which we did pretty well and thanks to our nation as well for celebrating with us,"" he said.""As much as it meant for us, it meant a whole lot to the entire nation as well. It felt really great to bring it (trophy) back home here and celebrate with everyone here.""""(It is a) fantastic feeling that can never be put out in words. I don't think it's a feeling that can be expressed.

I have seen a lot of guys who are pretty much into 'how many grains the bat has', 'what is the weight of the bat' and 'how does it look from outside', but I am not that kind of a person. I will pick up the bat and if I feel this is the right bat, I will go and play with that,"" he said.Despite leading the Mumbai Indians to five IPL titles as captain, Rohit's hunger to add more trophies to his collection remains insatiable.""There is a reason I won five IPL trophies. I'm not going to stop, because once you get the taste of winning games, winning Cups, you don't want to stop and we'll keep pushing as a team. We'll keep striving for better things in the future,"" he said.As an extension, he wanted more success with India too as their ODI and Test leader.""We've got a couple of solid tours coming up, very challenging ones as well. For us, it never stops. Once you achieve something you always look forward to achieving more.""That is what I will be doing. I'm pretty sure my teammates will be thinking on the same line.

The dismissal also served as a reminder of the crucial role spinners can play in Test cricket , particularly on surfaces that offer assistance.With England seemingly in control and Brook looking comfortable at the crease, the wicket provided Sri Lanka with a much-needed breakthrough.It remains to be seen whether this moment of brilliance will prove decisive in the context of the match, but it undoubtedly added another chapter to the rich history of spin bowling at Old Trafford.","Sri Lanka spinner Prabath Jayasuriya dismisses England's Harry Brook for 56.

We saw it a bit in the summer and it’s quite exciting to see other players and other teams are also playing that aggressive style of cricket ,” Duckett said back then.Duckett's initial comments, made during the series, suggested that England's aggressive approach had influenced Jaiswal and other teams to adopt a similar style.The statement drew criticism, with many interpreting the English approach as an attempt to claim credit for Jaiswal's individual brilliance.However, in a recent interview with the Daily Mail, Duckett clarified his intentions, stating that his comments were intended as a compliment to Jaiswal's world-class talent.""It was actually me paying him (Jaiswal) a nice compliment. I'm pretty sure I said he was a world-class player, but no one spoke about that. Would I have said what I did during the fifth Test? No, because he played like that throughout the whole series and he was incredible,"" the batsman clarified.While England's ""Bazball"" approach has undoubtedly influenced the dynamics of Test cricket, attributing an individual player's success solely to this influence overlooks their inherent skill and temperament.Jaiswal's performance, characterized by his aggressive stroke play and remarkable consistency, showcased his individual talent and potential.While England's aggressive style might have presented a particular set of challenges, Jaiswal's success stemmed from his ability to adapt and excel within that context.","Yashasvi Jaiswal is only the second Indian batsman after Sunil Gavaskar to achieve this feat.

Singh took the field early in the Test after England decided to field first. He returned to the field again in the post-lunch session to substitute for Harry Brook.Harry Singh has a strong connection to Indian cricket beyond just sharing the surname Singh.His father, RP Singh Senior, played for India in the 1980s. As a left-arm fast bowler, RP Singh Senior represented India in two ODIs against Australia in 1986 and had a successful domestic career.Throughout his career, Harry's father played in 59 first-class matches, taking 150 wickets and scoring 1413 runs. His final competitive match was in the Duleep Trophy in 1991, where he played for Central Zone against North Zone.After his retirement, RP Singh Senior transitioned into coaching and moved to England in the late 1990s. He started working with Lancashire County Cricket Club and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).Harry Singh has been making steady progress in his own cricket career, following in his father's footsteps.In July of this year, he made his List A debut for Lancashire in the One-Day Cup. In his seven matches, the 20-year-old has scored 87 runs at an average of 12.42, with a strike rate of 64.44 and a highest score of 25.

During this period, I realised how much I missed the game and the excitement of working closely with players,” said Gregory. “India and Malappuram in particular, offers a unique and vibrant footballing environment that's full of potential and passion. The opportunity to return to a place where football is so deeply cherished and to contribute to its growth was something I couldn't pass up,” he added.Gregory feels that a local league like SLK will help in developing local talent. “Super League Kerala is an exciting development for the region’s football landscape. With my experience in the ISL, I believe a local league featuring foreign players can be incredibly beneficial. It not only raises the level of competition but also helps in developing local talent by providing them with valuable exposure and experience,” he said, adding that the presence of international players will bring diverse playing styles and a higher standard of play, which can be a tremendous learning opportunity for emerging players and coaches alike.With Malappuram having a huge legacy in sevens football and most of its players coming from a seven-a-side background, the transition from the shorter version to the eleven-a-side game will be one of the major challenges Gregory will face in his new job. “While Sevens football has its unique qualities, I see it as a valuable foundation rather than a limitation. Sevens players often possess excellent technical skills, quick decision-making, and agility, which are all crucial for success in the eleven-a-side game,” he said.“However, I acknowledge that endurance and fitness levels for a full 90-minute match are different. That’s why we focus on tailored conditioning programmes and gradually integrate them into the eleven-a-side style of play. It’s about leveraging their existing strengths while addressing any areas that need improvement. With the right support and training, I believe Sevens players can transition effectively and excel in the eleven-a-side format,” he added.",John Gregory will manage Malappuram FC in the inaugural edition of the league commencing on Sept 7. The Englishman had helped Chennaiyin FC clinch their second ISL title in 2017.

It's just down to us and how we apply ourselves in the season.""Speaking with AFP at Leverkusen's pre-season training camp in the Black Forest village of Donaueschingen, Tella said: ""There's no reason why we can't defend the title"".""We've seen Bayern do it for so many years. Why can't we do something similar to that?""There's no limit to what we can achieve. Last year, no-one believed in us and at the end of the season we were undefeated champions.""Being a part of this team, anything is possible.""Tella's optimistic remarks stand in stark contrast to the sentiment surrounding the club just a year ago.

PANAJI: Chhattisgarh ’s Bastar region , famous for its mythological importance as Ram, Sita and Laxman spent 13 years during their exile and infamous for its Naxalism, has found a new calling: Football.The hotbed of insurgency and bloody battleground has been seeing a different battle being fought on the football grounds as the All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has hosted two national championships at Narayanpur in Bastar region.AIFF has been so impressed with the successful hosting of the beautiful game in Narayanpur, one of the seven districts in the region, that it has confirmed the next two editions of the men’s U-20 National Football Championship at the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama Sports Complex in Narayanpur.“We have an understanding (with the Chhattisgarh FA) that we will hold the U-20 national championship in Bastar region for three consecutive years,” AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey told TOI. “If everything goes well, we will renew our agreement. The region has seen a lot of problems, but we can use football to bring about a change.”Named after Swami Vivekananda, the U-20 championship is a unique addition to the AIFF calendar since an inter-state meet in this age group was never organised before.The AIFF does not have such an understanding with any other state FA or organisation. In fact, when there were doubts over who would host the Junior National Championship for the BC Roy Trophy at short notice, early this month, the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama in Narayanpur proved to be a safe choice. The sprawling complex has an in-house full-fledged football pitch, training facilities, and a residential area.“FIFA (the governing body for the sport) believes that football unites the world and India is a country with diversity. Football has a role to unite the world. I am sure, in the coming years, Bastar will be an example to the nation how you can address certain issues through football,” said Chaubey, a former India goalkeeper and BJP politician from Bengal.In the past two years, the AIFF has taken national and international football to areas which remained out of bounds in the past. For example, the National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy , was played in Arunachal Pradesh, while Manipur hosted an international tournament for the first time. Both tournaments drew fantastic responses.“When visas were not issued to athletes from Arunachal Pradesh (for Asian Games), it was a big setback to the nation. I met the chief minister of Arunachal and we decided to host the Santosh Trophy. The crowd, ambience, was terrific and it helped send a message across the world,” said Chaubey.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has hosted two national championships at Narayanpur in Bastar region.

But they come from the heart: Thank you, Manu. For your unique, outstanding successes, of course. But especially for your camaraderie, your dedication, your inspiration for fellow players and millions of fans and footballers around the world.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic , energized by his triumphant performance at the Olympic Games, aims to break new Grand Slam records at the US Open starting Monday. Meanwhile, his main rival, Jannik Sinner , arrives in New York facing scrutiny over two positive drug tests.If Djokovic secures a fifth title, he can become the oldest Open era champion at the tournament, sharing the record with Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, and Roger Federer.A victory would also elevate him to 25 Grand Slam triumphs, surpassing the 24 he currently shares with Margaret Court.This year has been challenging for Djokovic, as Sinner succeeded him as the Australian Open champion and took over his world number one ranking. Additionally, Carlos Alcaraz claimed Djokovic's French Open title and dominated him in a one-sided Wimbledon final.However, Djokovic made a remarkable comeback on the clay courts of Roland Garros, stunning Alcaraz in the Olympic final. His emotional victory in Paris allowed him to join an elite group of only five players to complete a career Golden Slam, winning all four majors and an Olympic gold medal.The victory silenced the growing number of skeptics who had dismissed the Serb as a fading force in a new era dominated by the 23-year-old Sinner and 21-year-old Alcaraz.Djokovic, who underwent knee surgery in June, described his Olympic victory as his ""biggest sporting success"" and the 99th title of his professional career.""At the age of 37 and facing a 21-year-old who is probably the best player in the world right now, winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back, I can say that this is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had,"" insisted Djokovic.Sinner, the rising Italian tennis star, enters the US Open, the final Grand Slam event of the year, fresh off his victory at the Cincinnati Masters. The young player's impressive performance on the court, however, was quickly overshadowed by recent revelations regarding his drug tests.Earlier in the season, Sinner tested positive on two separate occasions for clostebol, ""an anabolic agent prohibited at all times by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)."" The news raised concerns about the athlete's integrity and the fairness of his competitions.Despite the positive tests, Sinner managed to avoid a prolonged suspension from the sport. Officials ultimately accepted his explanation that the banned substance had inadvertently entered his system due to contamination from a member of his support team.This decision allowed him to continue competing, but the incident has cast a shadow over his recent successes on the court.""I will now put this challenging and deeply unfortunate period behind me,"" said Sinner.","Novak Djokovic aims to break new Grand Slam records at the US Open starting Monday.

""Different rules for different players.""In a statement to ESPN, Sinner's coach, Darren Cahill, expressed their desire to put the incident behind them and focus on the future. ""We're not looking for any sorrow or anything because we are quite thankful there is no ban attached,"" he said.""He would never, ever intentionally do anything and he's in a situation which is incredibly unfortunate.""Sinner faced a challenging situation when he tested positive for clostebol during the Indian Wells tournament in March. The banned substance was detected in his system in low quantities, and a subsequent test days later also showed its presence. Despite this, the 23-year-old successfully challenged the automatic provisional suspensions that would have typically followed such findings.As a result of his successful appeal, Sinner is now eligible to participate in the upcoming US Open, which is set to take place from August 26 to September 8.Sinner lost in the semis at Indian Wells and was stripped of 400 ranking points and had to forfeit $325,000 in prize money that he had earned at the tournament.""Whether Sinner was doping or not, this is not right,"" British player Liam Broady wrote in a social media post. ""Plenty of players go through the same thing and have to wait months or years for their innocence to be declared. Not a good look.""The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), founded in 2021 by tennis governing bodies, has accepted Jannik Sinner's appeal to lift his provisional suspension.The agency sought expert opinions and found Sinner's explanation to be plausible, leading to their decision not to contest his appeal.Tara Moore, a former top-ranked British doubles player, highlighted the difference in the handling of her case compared to Sinner's. Moore was suspended for 19 months due to a failed drug test before being exonerated last year. She expressed her views on the matter through social media posts.""I guess only the top players' images matter,"" Moore wrote. ""I guess only the independent tribunal's opinion on the top players is taken as sound and right. Yet, they question them in my case. Just makes no sense.""Simona Halep, a former Wimbledon champion, faced a provisional suspension in October 2022 due to two distinct violations of anti-doping regulations. The initial suspension was followed by a four-year ban.In March, after an appeal was filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the ban was reduced to a period of nine months.The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), an organization founded by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in 2020, emphasized the need for a consistent approach within the anti-doping system.""Players winning anti-doping violation appeals is generally good,"" said Ahmad Nassar, an executive director of the player advocacy group.""But we have to have clear, consistent processes for all players. Whether ranked one, 100 or 1,000; whether man or woman. And no matter what region of the world they may call home.""The absence of a clear and consistent system creates obvious problems for players who are not the perceived ranking, gender and/or nationality of choice. The absence also undermines the tennis establishment's credibility with fans and media.""The ruling made on Tuesday may still face appeals from either the World Anti-Doping Agency or the Italian Anti-Doping Agency.Nick Kyrgios also expressed his disapproval of the decision.""Ridiculous - whether it was accidental or planned,"" the 2022 Wimbledon finalist wrote on social media. ""You get tested twice with a banned (steroid) substance... you should be gone for two years.""",The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) has accepted Jannik Sinner's appeal to lift his provisional suspension.

"Jannik Sinner cleared of wrongdoing after failed drug tests, ITIA says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-cleared-of-wrongdoing-after-failed-drug-tests-itia-says/articleshow/112667044.cms,"Jannik Sinner , the world's top-ranked tennis player, tested positive for a banned substance in two separate drug tests conducted in March. However, an independent tribunal has exonerated him of any wrongdoing, the International Tennis Integrity Agency announced on Tuesday, just days before the Italian is scheduled to compete in the US Open .The tribunal, organized by Sport Resolutions, accepted Sinner's explanation that the anabolic agent clostebol entered his system through massages and sports therapy administered by a member of his support team.According to the ITIA, Sinner stated that his physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi , used an over-the-counter spray containing clostebol to treat a minor finger injury. Naldi then performed massages on Sinner between March 5-13 without wearing gloves, inadvertently transferring the substance to the tennis star's body.Naldi had no knowledge that the substance he applied to his wound had clostebol in it, according to Sinner. Clostebol, a steroid, can be utilized to increase muscle mass.The initial positive sample from Sinner was collected on March 10, followed by another one eight days later. Although provisional suspensions were imposed after each positive result, his team's prompt appeals allowed him to continue participating in competitions.""Sinner's results, prize money and ranking points from the ATP Masters 1000 event at Indian Wells, where the player tested positive in competition for clostebol, are disqualified, "" ITIA said in a statement, citing World Anti-Doping Code and Tennis Anti-Doping Programme regulations.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has announced its intention to examine the ruling and has retained the option to challenge it. Sinner has consistently asserted his innocence throughout the process.According to Sinner, the quantity of clostebol detected in his system was minuscule, amounting to less than one billionth of a gram.""I will now put this challenging and deeply unfortunate period behind me,"" the 23-year-old said in a statement posted to social media.The ATP Tour emphasized that the incident ""underscores the need for players and their entourages to take utmost care in the use of products or treatments.""This incident follows another high-profile case involving Simona Halep, a two-time major champion. Halep's initial four-year doping suspension was reduced to nine months earlier this year after she tested positive for a banned substance at the 2022 U.S. Open. She maintained that she had inadvertently consumed the blood-booster roxadustat through tainted nutritional supplements.As the world's top-ranked player, Sinner was already anticipating increased attention upon his arrival in New York for the year's final major, which begins on Monday. However, this situation has added an extra layer of scrutiny, coming just a day after his victory in a significant U.S. Open preparatory tournament in Cincinnati.""It's certainly surprising and shocking, at this moment, especially to me when it happened apparently in March,"" seven-times major winner and ESPN analyst John McEnroe said.""I don't know how they differentiate between one person, you know, sort of saying he was unaware of it and the reasons behind it and then someone else who says the same thing, you know, gets suspended.""Nick Kyrgios disagreed with the ruling.""Ridiculous - whether it was accidental or planned. You get tested twice with a banned substance ... you should be gone for 2 years. Your performance was enhanced,"" Kyrgios said on X.",World's top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner tested positive for a banned substance in two separate drug tests conducted in March. An independent tribunal has exonerated him of any wrongdoing.

If I had a ban, why was I asked (to play)?”That was Mukund Sasikumar venting his frustration on social media after a news report said that he had been suspended for two Davis Cup ties over his non-availability for the World Group playoff against Pakistan earlier this year.Mukund has also opted out of the upcoming World Group I tie against Sweden in Stockholm but for reasons different from the one he had for skipping the visit to Islamabad in February. The 27-year-old had cited ""personal reasons"" then while his refusal to go to Sweden was down to a combination of factors.""I was asked to play (against Sweden) by captain ( Rohit Rajpal ) and coach, and I chose not to play because one, I don't have a visa and two, I just didn’t want to be there due to bad management,"" Mukund posted on Instagram to rebut the report of his ban.AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar said ""the decision (to sanction Mukund) was taken during the executive committee meeting soon after the Pakistan tie,"" but was evasive when asked for more details.""You should ask him (Mukund) why is he not playing for the country. Even when there is a ban, my captain had called him (urging him to play),"" Dhupar said.And that was even more odd: Why would the captain reach out to a player suspended by the association -- unless, of course, there was no ban to begin with?It maybe noted that Rajpal is also the treasurer of AITA, and as such is a member of the executive committee, which according to Dhupar handed out the two-tie suspension.As it turns out, the only information on record is that the chairman of the selection committee, former Davis Cup player and coach Nandan Bal, had recommended that Mukund be not considered for selection since he had made himself unavailable for national duty for a third time.There is neither a reference to Mukund being show-caused nor a discussion of his case by the ethics committee before the executive committee made its decision.The Chennai lad, who had reached a career-high ranking of 229 in 2019 before the pandemic threw a spanner in his works, regretted his emotional outburst on Instagram but reiterated his frustrations.""The medium, what I wrote, the choice of words were not right. I do not want a younger player to express himself in the way I had done, I regret that,"" he told The Times of India.""But the emotions were bottling up. My name had been in the papers for the wrong reasons, it has been there for many months and it got to me.""Mukund was referring to the tie against Morocco in Lucknow last September where he conceded the opening singles rubber due to cramps and was also pulled up by the association for wearing a jersey which had India's name on his back wrongly spelt.""What happened was not fair. You cannot ban a player just like that without informing the player. I would have understood if there was a breach of code (of conduct) or my actions had been harmful to my team.""There cannot be a ban only because I was not available to play. I should not have worn (that shirt), but to be treated like a criminal when it was not intended, how could I have known what's written in the back?""It should have been sorted out in the locker room or through a personal call ... We players are a bit thick-skinned but it is not easy for parents and friends to read about this in the media.""Mukund is not the first player, nor will he be the last, to make himself unavailable for a Davis Cup tie. Sumit Nagal opted out of the Pakistan tie saying his game was not suited for grass while Yuki Bhambri has skipped the Sweden match for reasons unknown.So, why single out Mukund?And the right-hander, who has been going through a challenging phase over the past two years, both on the court since the pandemic as well as off the court, posed some important questions.""It is a misconception that you represent your country only when you play the Davis Cup. It is wrong,"" Mukund had told TOI earlier this year while discussing his decision to not go to Pakistan.""Even when you play a Grand Slam, an ATP or WTA event, or any event, you are representing your country. The top players don't play the Davis Cup, but nobody makes an issue out of it.""There are 100 ways to show your love for your country. Even a simple act of following rules and being a good citizen means a lot.""Or you can help groom the next generation, like Rohan (Bopanna) and Somdev (Devvarman) are doing.""Now, that is something alien to the higher echelons of AITA!","Mukund Sasikumar has been suspended for two Davis Cup ties by All India Tennis Association. The 27-year-old has also opted out of the upcoming World Group I tie against Sweden in Stockholm. AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar said ""the decision (to sanction Mukund) was taken during the executive committee meeting""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112661274,imgsize-32160,width-400,resizemode-4/112661274.jpg"
Why tennis star Jannik Sinner tested positive for steroids twice but faces no suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/why-tennis-star-jannik-sinner-tested-positive-for-steroids-twice-but-faces-no-suspension/articleshow/112659493.cms,"NEW DELHI: Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner, currently ranked among the world's top players, faced a doping investigation after testing positive for a banned anabolic steroid in March 2023.While the positive tests resulted in the forfeiture of prize money and ranking points earned at the Indian Wells tournament, Sinner will not face suspension from professional tennis.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced on August 22nd that an independent tribunal determined Sinner's violation was unintentional. This decision follows a hearing held on August 15th, where evidence and testimonies were presented.Sinner, who achieved a career-high ranking of world No. 1 in June 2023, provided an explanation for the positive tests.He claimed that a member of his support team unknowingly used an over-the-counter spray containing Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, to treat a minor wound on Sinner. The same team member subsequently administered massages to Sinner, inadvertently leading to the contamination.The ITIA, after reviewing the evidence and accepting Sinner's explanation, concluded that the violation lacked intent.This determination, supported by the independent tribunal's findings, resulted in a ""No Fault or Negligence"" ruling, effectively clearing Sinner of intentional doping charges.The incident occurred during the Indian Wells tournament, where Sinner initially tested positive for low levels of Clostebol metabolites.A second positive test from an out-of-competition sample collected eight days later led to a provisional suspension, which was later lifted following Sinner's successful appeal.Despite the investigation and its impact on his Indian Wells results, Sinner has continued to excel on the court.

Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka win Cincinnati Open titles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-and-aryna-sabalenka-win-cincinnati-open-titles/articleshow/112639015.cms,"Top-seeded Jannik Sinner and the second-ranked women's player Ayrna Sabalenka both secured respective victories in straight sets during the Cincinnati Open finals on Monday. This marks the first time either player has won the title at the prestigious tournament.In the women's final, Sabalenka triumphed over Jessica Pegula 6-3, 7-5, claiming her first title since her victory at the Australian Open earlier this year in January.Sinner, who celebrated his 23rd birthday on Friday, defeated American player Frances Tiafoe 7-6 (4), 6-2. With this win, Sinner becomes the youngest champion at the Cincinnati Open since Andy Murray's victory in 2008 at the age of 21.“I’m very happy to be in the position where I am,"" Sinner said, as quoted by AP. ""I'm just trying to keep going this way mentally. It's important to recover to be ready for New York. That's the most important thing.”The US Open is set to commence on August 26 in New York City.In Cincinnati, Sinner and Tiafoe both reached their maiden finals, surpassing their previous best performances of reaching the third round.Despite Tiafoe's efforts to force a tiebreak in the opening set, a series of three consecutive errors resulted in a 7-6 loss.Sinner established a commanding 5-1 lead in the second set, but Tiafoe managed to save three match points, narrowing the gap to 5-2. However, Sinner ultimately prevailed, successfully serving out the match to secure the victory.Tiafoe's journey to the final was marked by unusual circumstances. In the quarterfinals on Saturday, he claimed the first set before his opponent, Hubert Hurkacz, retired due to a calf injury. Subsequently, in the semifinals, Tiafoe showcased his resilience by saving two match points and defeating Holger Rune in a thrilling three-set encounter.An American male tennis player hasn't secured the championship in Cincinnati since 2006, when Andy Roddick achieved the feat.Sabalenka, who climbed to the No. 2 position in the rankings prior to the match, showcased her dominance by winning the tournament without dropping a single set. This victory marks her 15th WTA title.Despite her previous struggles in Cincinnati, where she had never advanced beyond the semifinals, losing three times at that stage, Sabalenka finally broke through to claim the trophy.At 26 years old, Sabalenka has established herself as a top contender for the upcoming U.S. Open. The Belarusian player was forced to miss Wimbledon due to a shoulder injury but made her return to the tour two weeks ago in Washington.“I would say that I'm really playing great tennis,” Sabalenka said. “Probably not the best tennis I can play but I'm definitely getting there. Hopefully at the US Open I can reach even higher levels.”Sabalenka quickly established a commanding 4-1 lead in the opening set against Pegula, taking just 17 minutes to assert her dominance. Despite Pegula's efforts to mount a comeback, including breaking Sabalenka's serve for the first time to level the second set at 5-5, her five double faults proved costly.Sabalenka, however, remained focused and determined, claiming the next two games to secure victory in a match that lasted 1 hour and 14 minutes.“She was playing at a high level and never really came down,” Pegula said. “When she’s serving really well, it’s tough, especially on these fast courts.”Pegula, the sixth-ranked player, faced a tough journey to reach the final. Following her successful title defense in Toronto, the American had to play two matches on Friday due to delays caused by weather conditions. Additionally, three of her matches extended to three sets.“I'm proving to myself that I can play a lot of matches and overcome a lot of challenges,” Pegula said. “I'm looking forward to not doing anything for a few days.""Sabalenka joined top-ranked Iga Swiatek as the only players with 10 or more WTA titles since 2020. She beat Swiatek in the Cincinnati semis.","Top-seeded Jannik Sinner defeated Frances Tiafoe 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the final of the Cincinnati Open.
