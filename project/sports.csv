MUMBAI: Facing the prospect of a 3-0 series sweep by New Zealand at home, it will be intriguing to see what kind of pitch India prepares for the third and final Test at the Wankhede Stadium from November 1.The hosts have appeared vulnerable to both seam in Bengaluru and spin in Pune.TOI has learnt that the pitch for the third Test against New Zealand is unlikely to be a rank turner, the type that allowed Kiwi left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner to dismantle India's batting line-up in the second Test in Pune.In that match, Santner took seven for 53 and six for 104, for a match haul of 13/157.On Monday, BCCI 's chief pitch curator Ashish Bhowmick, along with elite panel curator Taposh Chatterjee, met Wankhede curator Ramesh Mamunkar to review the pitch.""It will be a sporting track. Right now, there's a bit of grass on the pitch. It's expected to be good for batting on Day 1 but should offer turn to spinners from Day 2,"" a reliable source told TOI.In the last Test at Wankhede in Dec 2021, India crushed New Zealand by 372 runs, bowling them out for 62 and 167 on a pitch that offered spin assistance, while scoring 325 and 276 for seven declared. Ravichandran Ashwin took a match haul of 8 for 42, while New Zealand's Ajaz Patel made history with figures of 10 for 119 in the first innings and four for 104 in the second, totalling 14 wickets for 223 runs.","The pitch for the third Test against New Zealand is unlikely to be a rank turner, the type that allowed Kiwi left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner to dismantle India's batting line-up in Pune.

There have been mixed reports about his omission from the Ranji team.

That report suggested that he had 35 per cent more body fat,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Mid-Day.Gavaskar also emphasized that physical appearance, such as weight or body shape, should not be the primary measure of a player's fitness in cricket. He cites examples of Sarfaraz Khan , who, despite public scrutiny over his physique, scored a brilliant 150 against New Zealand.""We have seen in the previous Test in Bengaluru how another player Sarfaraz Khan, whose weight and shape have also been discussed in the public domain, played a scintillating innings of 150, showing that it is not the shape or the size of your waist that determines cricket fitness.It's whether you can score 150-plus runs and that too bat for a whole day or bowl 20-plus overs in a day.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) chairman Ramiz Raja has addressed the controversy surrounding his post-match comments to Test team captain Shan Masood after Pakistan’s 2-1 Test series win over England.Raja’s remarks, particularly his question about Pakistan’s six consecutive losses, sparked criticism from fans and former players, including pacer Mohammad Amir , who called for more respect and professionalism in his behaviour.The 62-year-old sparked controversy by taunting skipper Shan Masood after Pakistan's series win, asking, ""Aapne 6 losses in a row kaise achieve kiya?"" (How did you achieve six losses in a row?) instead of celebrating the victory.Raja, speaking on his YouTube channel, defended his line of questioning, stating that his intention was not to undermine the team’s achievement but to explore how they overcame recent struggles.""I asked a couple of questions, and my goal wasn’t to belittle anyone or cast Pakistan's victory in a negative light. As a commentator, the more Pakistan wins, the more opportunities open up for all of us in the cricketing ecosystem,” Raja said.He dismissed the backlash as part of the social media landscape, saying, ""Pakistan zinda hi social media pe hai"" (Pakistan lives on social media).He expressed frustration with how people misinterpret his comments, adding, “If I lived my life based on social media narratives, I wouldn’t be in this field. There are many uninformed opinions from people who haven’t played cricket but act like experts.”Raja also underlined that he did not intend to question Shan Masood’s captaincy and expressed disbelief at how quickly the conversation spiralled into controversy. ""When Bangladesh won 2-0, I didn’t ask for anyone to be removed. Why would I question Shan's captaincy after a series win?"" Raja argued.Earlier, Mohammad Amir had publicly criticized Raja for his remarks, suggesting that the former chairman should have focused on celebrating the series win rather than bringing up past failures.In a viral video, Amir remarked, “You should celebrate the series win. There is a series-winning captain sitting next to you. You should have asked him about the win, next plans. But you are making fun of him. Have some respect. You are literate people and you should behave like one as well. Where the credit is due, you should give it. I was feeling so bad for Shan.

NEW DELHI: Spain and Manchester City midfielder Rodri was awarded the prestigious Ballon d'Or on Monday, recognizing him as the world's best player.

Odisha were handed a thrashing by hosts Baroda in their third-round Ranji Trophy Group A tie in Vadodara on Monday.After taking a first-innings lead of 263 runs with skipper Krunal Pandya scoring a century (119 off 143 balls) early in the day, the hosts bowled out Odisha for a mere 165 runs to win by an innings and 98 runs and earn seven points.It was Baroda's third successive victory in as many matches this season and they are on top of the table with 19 points from three matches. As for Odisha, they are placed sixth on the table with four points from three matches. While their first game against Tripura was abandoned, they were able to earn three points from their last game against Jammu & Kashmir thanks to a first-innings ton by skipper Govinda Poddar followed by some gutsy batting by Sandeep Pattnaik in the second essay.However, in Vadodara it was a disappointing show by the entire Odisha team as they just couldn't stand up to the challenge thrown in by the home side. Coming down to bat on the third day, they had a horrid beginning as Shantanu Mishra was dismissed for naught in the seventh over and the score read 11/1.Anurag Sarangi (49) and Pattnaik then steadied the innings and added 58 runs to the total. However, once Sarangi was clean bowled by Ninad Rathva in the 20th over, wickets started falling at regular intervals and in no time it was 88/5.The duo of Kartik Biswal (53 not out of 26 balls) and Aasirwad Swain tried their best to keep the Baroda bowlers at bay by playing some lusty shots.

The sun shining brightly on Keenan Stadium doesn't reflect the situation home side Jharkhand is in.Conceding first-innings lead to Chandigarh in their third-round fixture of Ranji Trophy Elite Group D, Jharkhand were left to saving the game in Jamshedpur late on Monday afternoon.Despite the bowlers' combined effort Jharkhand could not stop Chandigarh from scoring 290 in reply to their 202 as the visitors took a healthy 88-run first-innings lead to secure three points from the game. The hosts finished the third day on 28 for three from 14.3 overs in their second essay, still trailing Chandigarh by 60 runs.Debutant opener Sharandeep Singh is at the crease on 19 (off 46 balls) with nightwatchman Manishi giving him company scoring naught from 17 balls.Earlier, Chandigarh opener Arslan Khan played a fine knock of 76 off 110 balls with 12 fours and a six to help the visiting side make a steady start. But No. 4 bat Ankit Kaushik was the star of the day scoring a brilliant 112 off 188 balls with the crumbling lower middle order, which lost wickets at regular intervals as Kaushik stood firm in the other end. He was the last man to fall hitting 13 fours and a six.Later on, Jharkhand had a disastrous start losing opener Nazim Siddiquei for a golden duck in the first ball of their second innings as he returned a simple catch to rival captain Manan Vohra off medium pacer Nishunk Birla. No. 3 Kumar Suraj didn't last long either, staying for only six balls for another duck which reduced Jharkhand to 1/2 in 3.1 overs.No. 4 Aditya Singh joined Sharandeep to arrest the slide for about five overs but fell to a fine Birla delivery which castled him in the second ball of the ninth over as Jharkhand were down to 20/3. Manishi then combined with Sharandeep to see off the next few overs till the stumps were drawn in the middle of the 15th over.On the final day of the game, the Veer Pratap Singh-led side would need a much better batting display than their first innings effort to score a formidable total and take the lead beyond Chandigarh's wish for an outright win.Jharkhand 202 & 28/3 in 14.3 overs (Sharandeep Singh 19 batting; Nishunk Birla 2/5, V Kashyap 1/18).

Brief scores:

Kolkata: Jalaj Saxena did what he is always good at -- pulling his side out of the woods when in trouble. The veteran all-rounder walked in with Kerala in trouble at 78 for five. But Saxena never looked to be in trouble as he settled down well to take the attack into the rival camp. It was due to his resilient 84 (162 b, 4x12) that Kerala found them safe at 267 for seven at the end of Day III of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group ‘C’ clash against Bengal at the JU Salt Lake campus here on Monday.Bengal pacer Ishan Porel once again made early inroads dismissing both the overnight unbeaten batters --- Sachin Baby and Akshay Chandran in his consecutive overs within the first hour of third day’s play, but Saxena and Salma Nizar frustrated the Bengal attack stitching together a 140-run seventh-wicket stand that took Kerala to safety.Porel had Kerala skipper Baby clean bowled in his fifth over of the morning for 12 and then had Chandran (31) caught behind when the left-hander tried to pull a short one and wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha latched onto an edge jumping on to his right.At 83 for six, Bengal smelt blood. But Saxena had been there and done that in such situations for ages. He was a bit tentative in the initial stage and survived some close leg-before wicket calls. But once he settled down, he played a fluent knock finding the fence almost at will. However, both the Bengal left-arm spinners --- Shahbaz Ahmed and Pradipta Pramanik were guilty of bowling too short. Opting to restrict runs, they failed to create enough attack on the batters as Kerala took lunch at 117 for six.Nizar too grew in confidence and played some good cut shorts to anything bowled short. Jalaj, however, got a life when Bengal skipper Anushtup Majumder dropped an easy catch in the slip off Porel when the batter was on 72. But Saxena came back strongly hitting the pacer for two consecutive fours in the same over.Pacer Suraj Sindhu Jaiswal finally had Saxena bowled in the final session of play. But Mohammed Azharuddeen (30*) and Nizar (64*) were involved in an unbroken 44-run eighth-wicket stand to ensure Kerala end on top.Kerala 267/7 in 102 ovs (Jalaj Saxena 84, Salman Nizar 64*, Mohammed Azharuddeen 30*; Ishan Porel 5/83) vs Bengal",Jalaj Saxena scores 84 as Kerala reach 267-7 at the end of Day III of Ranji Trophy Elite Group ‘C’ clash against Bengal.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United have finally made the bold move, dismissing Erik ten Hag following a 2-1 defeat at West Ham as the club feels stranded in 14th place in the Premier League points table.The Dutch coach, appointed in 2022, initially brought hope by securing the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in consecutive seasons.However, inconsistent performances, a disappointing 8th-place finish last season, and a sluggish start to the current campaign left United with little choice but to make yet another managerial change.The departure of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013 marked the beginning of a turbulent era for United, with the club struggling to find a successor capable of replicating his success.David Moyes , handpicked by Ferguson, was sacked after just 10 months (295 days), failing to bring stability or results.Club legend Ryan Giggs briefly took over as caretaker and continued to hold the fort for 68 days, offering a temporary fix before the arrival of Louis van Gaal .The Dutchman won an FA Cup but failed to implement his “philosophy,” leading to his dismissal after 679 days at the job.In 2016, José Mourinho’s appointment was seen as a chance to re-establish United’s dominance. Despite delivering trophies, including the Europa League and League Cup, his tenure was marked by tension and inconsistency, ultimately ending in a fractured relationship with the club after 900 days.Ole Gunnar Solskjaer , another club icon, brought excitement back with his attacking style and a memorable Champions League comeback against PSG. However, his inability to deliver silverware or consistent league form led to his exit in 2021 after 969 days as full-time boss at the club.Interim stints from Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick failed to stabilize the team, leaving ten Hag to rebuild a squad still reeling from years of upheaval.Initially hailed as the solution, Ten Hag’s early success faded as the team faltered.With Manchester United underperforming again this season, and with INEOS’s potential takeover looming, the club felt compelled to act swiftly, limiting the Dutchman's tenure to 850 days.The search for yet another manager is now underway, but the question remains: can anyone finally revive United’s fortunes and bring them back to the top of English football ?","Manchester United sack manager Erik ten Hag after 2-1 defeat at West Ham.

You need to get to a situation for luck to play a role: Arjun Kadhe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/you-need-to-get-to-a-situation-for-luck-to-play-a-role-arjun-kadhe/articleshow/114661630.cms,"Arjun Kadhe

PUNE: It was his grandparents who sowed the seeds for Arjun Kadhe ’s career as a professional tennis player.More than two decades ago, when Arjun was taking baby steps in tennis, his paternal grandfather decided to sell their house and set aside the proceeds exclusively to help his grandson follow a dream.“I remember when I was eight years old … at that point we were not financially so super to think about tennis as a viable option for my career. But my granddad had a vision. He told me, ‘Okay, I will do anything. You just play tennis, you want to represent India, you want to play a Grand Slam ’. My parents were living on rent. It was unbelievable,” an emotional Kadhe, 30, said as he jogged his memory back.All the sacrifices, of his and of those around him, and the years of tireless pursuit of excellence bore fruit last week when Arjun claimed his first ATP Tour doubles title , in partnership with Rithvik Choudary at the Almaty Open in Kazakhstan last week.“The credit goes first to my parents, they've made huge sacrifices, then my coaches. Obviously, it's a team effort,” he said.""Obviously, Balu sir (coach M Balachandran) traveling with us, (former South African player) Raven (Klaasen) traveling with us, the Double Dream of India programme is helping us a lot.“And as you said, the journey is long, but it feels really, really good, because you get rewarded. In doubles you're playing 35 weeks alone on the road, and it can be really brutal sometimes.“So this win, we both want to take it in, get confidence, enjoy and go ahead again.”The Indian combination beat three teams ranked in the top-30 on the ATP Tour, including No. 13 pair Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul of France in the second round.In a thriller of a final, Arjun and Rithvik saved five match points in the super tiebreak to beat Germany’s Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, ranked 26th, 3-6, 7-6 (3), 14-12. Remarkably, the Indians won only 68 points to their rivals’ 80 in the match.Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard to get there in the first place.“I think luck played a big part. But at the same time, we were just talking, the coaches were telling us we lost two finals in the super tiebreak, where we were the better team, in the Challengers. As (personal coach) Hemant (Bendrey) sir was also saying, luck is there, but you have to get yourself into that situation for luck to play it out,” Arjun said.The Punekar, supported by Punit Balan group , rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win.“I'm really grateful that it has happened, but at the same time, I feel I was playing a good level,” he said.“It's about, you know, being there, giving yourself that chance, getting rejected, at some point it will come.“It's not in your hands when that click comes. For some people, it comes early. If they can sustain it, they move to the next level.“Some people get rejected, and get that breakthrough. It's about working hard and trying to improve, and take the next step. Everyone has their own journey, in my opinion.“I feel we deserve it, because I truly believe we have the level. Now it's about going the long way and trying to improve every day and not be satisfied with this one tournament.”Arjun had partnered Rithvik in the latter half of last season but parted ways at the start of 2024. Even before they combined, the Telangana lad had mentioned to Arjun of his desire to play with his previous partner Niki Poonacha whenever he decided to focus on doubles. So, the Maharashtra player was understandably cautious when Rithvik reached out to him in the middle of this season.“I feel like every challenge brings opportunity. At that point (when Rithvik chose to go back to Niki at the start of 2024), I was like, ‘oh my God. we are doing well, blah, blah, blah, what is happening?’ But then, if I look back now, I won (two Challenger) titles (with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Anirudh Chandrasekar),” Arjun said.“So it was really good for me.”This time around, Arjun said, the two were in for the long haul. And long-term partnership is something he strongly believes in.“To develop a good team, you need time,” he said, “because if you keep switching partners, the first few weeks of understanding how we want to play, understanding how my partner wants us to play in the future, what is our best?“For all that to align it takes a little bit of time, and in doubles you have super tiebreak. Sometimes you are winning from (facing) match points, sometimes losing from match points.”The Almaty title had given a pleasant surprise for both Arjun and Rithvik in terms of ranking jump — the latter had broken into the top-100 for the first time in his career, reaching 85 in the ATP charts.That means they will now give it a shot to make the Australian Open cut before closing the season.“Now it's about planning it smartly, taking care of your body, because it's the end of the year, you don't want to overplay,” he said.“If we want to be top-50 in the world, we need to improve a lot. We won this tournament, but those teams are doing so many things better than us. So, it’s important also to play the big events, lose, and then realize this is where we are at.“So, we are not thinking too far ahead, just trying to think next week. How can we try and make Australia? If we don't make it, we still have to try and make French.“The plan will go forward from there.”","Arjun Kadhe claims his first ATP Tour doubles title with Rithvik Choudary at Almaty Open in Kazakhstan. The 30-year-old rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win. Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114661721,imgsize-157286,width-400,resizemode-4/114661721.jpg"

(Photo Credit: KSLTA/Deepthi Indukuri)

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured. I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week. It was her first pro title on the pro circuit. The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season. She was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114554211,imgsize-34268,width-400,resizemode-4/114554211.jpg"

Tennis is special because you are out there alone.
