NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma ’s approach to managing Indian players on the field combines freedom with accountability. With his calm demeanor, Rohit empowers his teammates to play their natural game while setting clear expectations. He provides constructive feedback when necessary, and if a player falls short, his subtle yet telling reactions effectively communicate his message without words.India's star pacer Mohammed Shami highlighted this during an award function, mentioning that Rohit is a captain who gives his players a lot of freedom, allowing them to perform with confidence and without undue pressure.""The best thing about Rohit is that he gives you freedom. Agar aap uske hisaab se sahi nahi utre, to unke thode se reaction bahar aane lagte hain. Wo aapko bateyga ki aapko ye karna tha, ya ye chaiye tha. [The best thing about Rohit Sharma is that he gives you freedom. However, if you don’t meet his expectations, his reactions start to show a bit. He’ll tell you that you should have done this or needed to do that],"" Shami said during a award function.""Fir bhi aap uspe khare nahi utre, toh fir jo hum screen pe jo reactions dekhte hain, jo hum bina bole samajh jaate hain na, wo aane lagta hai [But if you still don’t live up to it, then the reactions we see on the screen, the ones we understand without him saying anything, start to come out],"" Shami said.Rohit made history by becoming the only Indian skipper, after MS Dhoni , to win the T20 World Cup .Under Rohit's leadership, India secured a memorable victory, breaking the long drought since Dhoni's 2007 triumph.India clinched the coveted trophy by defeating South Africa in a thrilling final in Barbados.","Rohit Sharma is the only Indian skipper to win the T20 World Cup.

This approach ultimately led to India's triumphant campaign in the T20 World Cup.India's journey in the ICC tournament culminated in a resounding victory against South Africa in the final, held in Barbados.This marked their second T20 world title, with the first being clinched in 2007.Rohit, who spearheaded the team's success, also announced his retirement from the shortest format following this remarkable achievement.""It was my dream to transform this team and not worry too much about the stats, the results, to make sure that we create that environment where people can go out there and play freely without thinking too much,"" Rohit said, as quoted by PTI, after being named the men's international cricketer of the year at the CEAT Cricket Rating Awards.""That is what was required. I got a lot of help from my three pillars, who are actually Mr Jay Shah, Mr Rahul Dravid (and the) chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar,"" he said.""That was very critical for me to do what I did and obviously not to forget the players, who came in at different points in time and helped the team to achieve what we achieved,"" he said.Rohit expressed that the feeling of winning the World Cup, which ended India's decade-long drought in global tournaments, was beyond words to describe.""(It was) a feeling that cannot come everyday. It was something that we were really hoping for. When we won the World Cup, it was important for all of us to enjoy the moment which we did pretty well and thanks to our nation as well for celebrating with us,"" he said.""As much as it meant for us, it meant a whole lot to the entire nation as well. It felt really great to bring it (trophy) back home here and celebrate with everyone here.""""(It is a) fantastic feeling that can never be put out in words. I don't think it's a feeling that can be expressed. It won't do justice to our effect when all that happened,"" Rohit said.The Mumbaikar mentioned that he doesn't worry about the exact weight of a bat, instead preferring to go by how it feels in his hands.""The guys who spend time with me in the changing room where I put my stickers and I put the bat tape and all that, will tell you (that) whichever bat I pick up, I go and play with that,"" he said.""The balance of the bat for me is very important. I have seen a lot of guys who are pretty much into 'how many grains the bat has', 'what is the weight of the bat' and 'how does it look from outside', but I am not that kind of a person. I will pick up the bat and if I feel this is the right bat, I will go and play with that,"" he said.Despite leading the Mumbai Indians to five IPL titles as captain, Rohit's hunger to add more trophies to his collection remains insatiable.""There is a reason I won five IPL trophies. I'm not going to stop, because once you get the taste of winning games, winning Cups, you don't want to stop and we'll keep pushing as a team. We'll keep striving for better things in the future,"" he said.As an extension, he wanted more success with India too as their ODI and Test leader.""We've got a couple of solid tours coming up, very challenging ones as well. For us, it never stops. Once you achieve something you always look forward to achieving more.""That is what I will be doing. I'm pretty sure my teammates will be thinking on the same line. What I've seen in the last two years in Indian cricket, there's some real excitement, some real good cricket is being played,"" he added.",Rohit Sharma was named the men's international cricketer of the year at the CEAT Cricket Rating Awards. The Mumbaikar led India to their second T20 World Cup victory in Barbados.

Mayank Yadav: Remember Mayank Yadav? Former India bowling coach feels BCCI 'can't wrap the pacer up in cotton wool',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/remember-mayank-yadav-former-india-bowling-coach-feels-bcci-cant-wrap-the-pacer-up-in-cotton-wool/articleshow/112667918.cms,"Mayank Yadav (TOI Photo)

NEW DELHI: Mayank Yadav , the promising 22-year-old fast bowler for Lucknow Super Giants , emerged as one of the standout players in IPL 2024 , impressing with his sheer pace and taking seven wickets in just four games. However, his season was abruptly halted due to injury, leading to uncertainty about his return to competitive cricket.BCCI secretary Jay Shah expressed doubts about Yadav's availability for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Test series scheduled for December.While recovering at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey insists on easing Yadav back into action, particularly focusing on first-class cricket.Yadav's blistering speed captured attention early in the IPL 2024 season, consistently bowling at speeds exceeding 150 kmph, and delivering the fourth fastest ball in IPL history at 156.7 kmph. Unfortunately, an injury curtailed his participation after just four games where he secured seven wickets.""I cannot give you any answer on Mayank Yadav as there is no guarantee whether he will be in the team or not. But he is potentially a good fast bowler, and we are looking after him. He is currently at the NCA,"" Shah told The Times of India last week.The concerns around Yadav's injury have sparked discussions about his immediate future and the appropriate path for his recovery. Former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey advocates for a gradual reintroduction to competitive cricket, particularly in the longer format. Mhambrey argues that keeping Yadav sidelined out of caution may not be the best approach for the young pacer.""I don't agree that if he is not ready, just don't play him. This is the age where he has to bowl. A bowler should bowl. The more you bowl, the more you will have control, you will know your threshold as to how much your body can take. You can't wrap him up in cotton wool saying he will get injured,"" Mhambrey told The Indian Express in an interview.Mhambrey believes that Yadav's development and injury management would benefit from playing red-ball cricket. He emphasized that first-class cricket is crucial for gaining the necessary experience and for understanding individual physical limits.""We can't overbowl and burn him out, but we have to be smart about how much he should bowl. As a fast bowler, he needs to play first-class cricket,"" Mhambrey said.He stressed the importance of studying Yadav's background and training regimen to better manage his fitness and workload.""You have to check his background. How much cricket has he played? How much has he bowled? Everything adds up. We need to go in depth about him, what have been his training methods? How many overs he used to bowl, his history of injuries,"" Mhambrey noted.Mhambrey also highlighted the significance of understanding that Yadav is still in the developmental phase of his career, and proactive management of his workload and fitness is crucial.""He's only 22. His body is still developing. He is in that injury-prone age group. His body has not completely developed yet. His injuries can be controlled if we understand his background well.""As the BCCI deliberates on the best course of action for Yadav, the young pacer's return to full fitness remains eagerly anticipated by fans and selectors alike. His impressive performances in the IPL have shown glimpses of his potential, and managing his recovery effectively could be key to his future success in Indian cricket.","Mayank Yadav was one of the standout players in IPL 2024.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's preparations for the upcoming two-Test series against Pakistan have been severely disrupted by the political unrest that has engulfed the nation. The foreign coaches of the team were confined to their residences, strictly adhering to the advisories issued by their respective embassies, while widespread protests prevented the team from gathering for training sessions.The composition of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is also uncertain, following the departure of president Nazmul Hassan from the country due to his ties with the ousted prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.Despite the political upheaval, star allrounder Shakib Al Hasan , who served as a member of parliament for Hasina's party, has been permitted to participate in the Pakistan series by the interim government.""Because of the situation it was not possible to practice,"" spin bowling coach Mushtaq Ahmed told reporters.The Pakistan Cricket Board offered some relief to the visiting team by inviting them to arrive four days earlier to compensate for their lack of preparation.A second-string Bangladesh team, including six players from the national squad, had already been participating in practice matches in Islamabad since August 10.Further compounding Bangladesh's challenges, in-form opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy has been sidelined from the first Test due to a groin injury, although senior batter Mushfiqur Rahim is expected to recover from a finger injury in time for the match.Bangladesh will be determined to break their winless streak against Pakistan, having suffered defeats in 12 out of the 13 Tests played between the two nations, with only one draw. The two-match Test series is part of the third cycle of the World Test Championship , with Pakistan currently occupying the sixth position in the nine-team table, while Bangladesh sits in eighth place.The second Test, originally scheduled to be held in Karachi, has been relocated to Rawalpindi due to ongoing construction work at the Karachi stadium and will commence on August 30.Following a 3-0 defeat in Australia earlier this year, Pakistan has brought in former Australian paceman Jason Gillespie as their Test coach and hired Adelaide groundsman Damien Hough to improve the quality of their pitches. Pakistan is expected to field an all-pace attack for the first Test, a strategy they last employed five years ago against Sri Lanka at the same venue.In contrast, Bangladesh will heavily rely on their spin trio of Shakib Al Hasan (237 wickets), Taijul Islam (195 wickets), and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (164 wickets).Pakistan captain Shan Masood dismissed the notion that the Bangladesh team is underprepared, stating, ""You expect all international Test sides to come into a series well prepared and trying to play their best cricket.""Masood also expressed optimism about Pakistan's potential improvement under the guidance of their new coaching staff, saying, ""We are excited to see how they (coaches) help us to be better people, better cricketers and -- most importantly -- be among the top teams in the world.""Pakistan vs Bangladesh 1st Test match will be played from Wednesday, August 21 to August 25.Pakistan vs Bangladesh 1st Test match will be played at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi.The live streaming of the first Test match between Pakistan and Bangladesh will be available on the Tamasha app and website for viewers in India.The upcoming Test series between Pakistan and Bangladesh will not be aired on any television channel. Indian viewers will be unable to watch the live telecast of the first Test match between the two nations on their TV sets, as no broadcaster holds the rights to televise the series.Cricket fans in India need not worry about missing out on the excitement of the game, despite the absence of a television broadcast deal.

Their batting records, consistency, and the ability to perform under pressure have inspired generations of cricketers in India and around the world.Gavaskar was the first player to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket . He held the record for the most Test centuries (34) for almost two decades before it was surpassed by Tendulkar.It was in the first Test against Bangladesh at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka in the 2004 series that Tendulkar equalled Gavaskar 's record of Test centuries.The first Test of the two-match series saw Anil Kumble breaking Kapil Dev 's record of 434 wickets to become India's leading Test wicket-taker and the rise of Irfan Pathan who registered his first ten-wicket haul in Tests on the third day at the Bangabandhu Stadium in Dhaka in December 2004.Pathan's five-wicket haul in the first innings saw Bangladesh being bundled out for 184. From then on, it was the Sachin Tendulkar show all the way.Sachin completed his 34th Test century to equal Sunil Gavaskar's record of Test centuries and also went on to notch up his career-best Test score (248*).Tendulkar, who was dropped when he was on 28 and 47, struck 35 boundaries in his knock and added 164 runs with Ganguly (71) for the fourth wicket and put up a 133-run stand with Zaheer (75) for the last wicket as India amassed 526 runs.Pathan then wrapped up the match early on Day 4 taking 6/51 in the Bangladesh second innings as India won by an innings and 140 runs.Tendulkar is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in cricket history and holds the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI cricket. He is the only player to have scored 100 international centuries (51 in Tests and 49 in ODIs).",Sachin Tendulkar equalled Sunil Gavaskar's record of Test centuries in 2004.

NEW DELHI: Fresh off her historic double-medal win at the Paris Olympics , ace shooter Manu Bhaker has embarked on a nationwide tour to inspire young athletes.During a visit to Velammal Nexus School in Chennai, the 22-year-old shared her journey, emphasizing the transformative power of sports and encouraging students to consider it as a viable career path.""My journey, coming from the Tokyo Olympics , it was very difficult for me to be confident again. I was world number two, but I did not do good in it. I know the taste of losing and then winning. It's the beauty of sports. One competition you lose, and you can win the other. But, it would only happen if you put in hard work,"" said Bhaker.Bhaker's message resonated deeply with the audience as she candidly addressed her struggles after the Tokyo Olympics, where she fell short of expectations despite being ranked second globally.Emphasizing the importance of ambition, Bhaker urged students to ""dream big"" and supplement their aspirations with unwavering effort.""To achieve the goal, we must put in a lot of hard work and effort. It doesn't always start with aiming for something big, you also have to work to achieve it. If you can dream big, you can achieve big. So, always start by dreaming big. I always tell myself that no matter if I win or lose in any competition, I'll always be very confident and hold myself high and together, and be very confident. We have many career options. You don't have to become a doctor or an engineer. Sports life is a beautiful life. From financial support to any kind of it, you get everything in sports,"" she added.The Olympian credited her mother as her biggest inspiration, instilling in her the importance of forging her own path. She acknowledged the crucial role parents and teachers play in shaping a child's journey, particularly in the formative years of a sporting career.Reflecting on her own experiences, Bhaker highlighted the personal growth she underwent during her eight-year journey, explaining, ""I have had eight and a half years in my shooting career.

Jaiswal is a package: Hayden

MUMBAI: Having won the T20 World Cup in the West Indies in June, Indian captain Rohit Sharma is now greedy for more trophies in his cabinet.“There’s a reason I won five IPL trophies. I’m not going to stop, you know, because once you get a taste of winning games, winning cups, you don’t want to stop. We’ll keep pushing as a team. We’ll keep striving for new things in the future.We’ve got a couple of solid tours coming up, very challenging ones as well. So, yes, for us, it never stops. Once you achieve something, you always look forward to achieving more, and that is what I’ll be doing as well. I’m pretty sure that my teammates will be thinking on the same lines as well. It’s exciting times for Indian cricket moving forward,” Rohit said at the Ceat Cricket Rating Awards on Wednesday.“Honestly, for the last two years from what I’ve seen in Indian cricket, there’s some real excitement, some good cricket being played as well. The next couple of years are exciting as well. So hopefully, we can go out there and enjoy the game at the same time, and then try and make the most of what opportunity lies ahead of us,” the Indian captain asserted.Meanwhile, BCCI secretary Jay Shah is at it again. Almost six months after successfully predicting India’s T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies, Shah has forecast that India could win three trophies in a row-the Women’s T20 World Cup in October in UAE, the ICC Champions Trophy in February next year in Pakistan, and the World Test Championship final in England in June 2025.“As I told you in Rajkot, that we are going to host our flag in Barbados, and our captain did that. If we have the blessing of 1.4 billion people, then we can do the same in the Champions Trophy, WTC final and the Women’s T20 World Cup,” Shah, who received the ‘CEAT Award for Excellence in Sports Administration’ said.Meanwhile, New Zealand captain Tim Southee reckons India pace spearheadJasprit Bumrah has looked more formidable since making a comeback from a back injury, which kept him out of the game for a major part in 2022.""To be able to firstly bounce back from the major injury and come back, he's even better than what he was beforehand. Throw in on top of that, having to juggle multiple formats, can be difficult at times as well,"" Southee said.""He seems to have been able to do that with ease. He's probably more experienced, understands his game a bit more. He probably had that time where he was injured to come back and be recharged, refreshed. We are just seeing a great version (of Bumrah) across all three formats. He's brilliant across all three at the moment. I don't think there's anyone that he's better in (better than him), he is tremendous across all three (formats),"" he said.Former Aussie great Matthew Hayden has given a thumbs-up to Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon's idea to start planning for Yashasvi Jaiswal , whom he felt was an ‘asset’ for Indian cricket, for the Border-Gavaskar five-Test series in December.""Isn't it great that the series is shaping up the bare-heavyweight bout, someone like the GOAT going after, what is in my opinion one of the key assets for Indian cricket.

We saw it a bit in the summer and it’s quite exciting to see other players and other teams are also playing that aggressive style of cricket ,” Duckett said back then.Duckett's initial comments, made during the series, suggested that England's aggressive approach had influenced Jaiswal and other teams to adopt a similar style.The statement drew criticism, with many interpreting the English approach as an attempt to claim credit for Jaiswal's individual brilliance.However, in a recent interview with the Daily Mail, Duckett clarified his intentions, stating that his comments were intended as a compliment to Jaiswal's world-class talent.""It was actually me paying him (Jaiswal) a nice compliment. I'm pretty sure I said he was a world-class player, but no one spoke about that. Would I have said what I did during the fifth Test? No, because he played like that throughout the whole series and he was incredible,"" the batsman clarified.While England's ""Bazball"" approach has undoubtedly influenced the dynamics of Test cricket, attributing an individual player's success solely to this influence overlooks their inherent skill and temperament.Jaiswal's performance, characterized by his aggressive stroke play and remarkable consistency, showcased his individual talent and potential.While England's aggressive style might have presented a particular set of challenges, Jaiswal's success stemmed from his ability to adapt and excel within that context.","Yashasvi Jaiswal is only the second Indian batsman after Sunil Gavaskar to achieve this feat.

The day's play was affected by rain, but the duo managed to steer their team to a respectable score of 158-4 at stumps.Pakistan found themselves in trouble early on, having lost three wickets with just 16 runs on the board.However, Shakeel and Ayub joined forces to stabilize the innings, forging a vital partnership of 98 runs for the fourth wicket, AFP reported.Ayub, playing in his debut Test match, showcased his talent by scoring 56 runs, while Shakeel remained unbeaten on 57 at the close of play.Shakeel achieved a significant milestone in his Test career, amassing 1,000 runs in just his 11th match. He reached this feat upon scoring 33 runs, which included five boundaries. This innings marked his seventh half-century in the format.Shakeel formed a valuable partnership with Mohammad Rizwan, contributing an additional 44 runs for the fifth wicket. Rizwan remained unbeaten on 24 at the end of the day's play.However, Ayub's innings came to an end in the latter stages of the day. After hitting four boundaries and a six, he fell victim to a reckless drive off Hasan Mahmud 's bowling, resulting in a catch at third slip.The new-ball duo of Shoriful Islam (2-30) and Mahmud (2-33) unsettled Pakistan following a 230-minute delay caused by a wet outfield from overnight rain.Shoriful dismissed the home team's captain Shan Masood for six and then sent star batter Babar Azam packing for a duck on just his second ball, before Pakistan began their recovery on a greenish pitch.After winning the toss, Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto swiftly opted to bat first and had Pakistan at 81-3 by tea. Mahmud provided the initial breakthrough, with Abdullah Shafique being well-caught at gully by Zakir Hasan for two in the fourth over.Shoriful then removed Shan Masood, who was caught behind off a sharp delivery. Bangladesh successfully overturned an initial not out decision by South African umpire Adrian Holdstock through a review.In Shoriful's next over, Babar Azam edged a leg-side delivery and was caught by wicketkeeper Liton Das, marking his first home-ground duck in 14 Test matches.Pakistan approached the Test with an all-pace attack, featuring four fast bowlers and no frontline spinner, while Bangladesh fielded three pacers and two spinners.The two-match series is part of the nine-team World Test Championship, with Pakistan currently sixth in the standings and Bangladesh in eighth.","Pakistan reach 158-4 at stumps on first day of opening Test against Bangladesh.

Ex-England all-rounder Paul Taylor aims to revolutionise Indian cricket with hybrid pitches,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ex-england-all-rounder-paul-taylor-aims-to-revolutionise-indian-cricket-with-hybrid-pitches/articleshow/112686950.cms,"NEW DELHI: Paul Taylor , a former English cricketer, has dedicated over four decades of his life to the sport. His extensive experience includes representing England and achieving remarkable feats in first-class cricket. Throughout his career, he has gained a deep understanding of the game's grassroots level.Currently, Taylor is actively working towards transforming Indian cricket through his company, SIS Pitches , by introducing Stitched Hybrid Pitches .These innovative pitches are composed of a blend of natural turf grass and approximately five percent twisted yarn. The integration of these materials has been shown to significantly enhance the durability of the pitch.The implementation of Stitched Hybrid Pitches not only extends the lifespan of the playing surface but also enables venues to host three times the number of matches compared to traditional pitches.SIS Pitches has launched its operations in India and has successfully installed these pitches at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA), where they have already delivered impressive results.""We've installed eight pitches at the HPC Stadium in Dharamshala. There are four on the main stadium site. and then there's two each in the practice areas. The pitches on the main stadium were used for practice, for the two IPL games that were recently played there, for range hitting and the feedback initially was very good. there was more pace, and more bounce,"" Paul Taylor told IANS.In 2019, the England & Wales Cricket Board approved the use of hybrid pitches for white-ball games, and the International Cricket Council permitted their use in international matches starting in 2022.Renowned venues such as Lord's, Edgbaston, Sydney Cricket Ground, Adelaide Oval, and Eden Park have since installed hybrid pitches provided by SIS.""The Indian players who used them didn't appreciate that they were hybrid pitches, which is a good thing . A couple of the English players did notice because there were a couple of bare areas from a previous game that had not fully recovered and they could see a few fibers. So Jonny Bairstow , Sam Curran , Tom Curran , and Liam Livingstone played there and they noticed it was a hybrid,"" he added.Given that the cricketing fraternity is confused by the new pitches being introduced in the game after the use of drop-in pitches in the USA phase of the T20 World Cup, Paul emphasized on how different the two surfaces are and the benefits of the new innovation.""A drop in pitch, is a fully natural surface that's built in sort of movable trays that are lifted in and out of a cricket ground or a sports stadium but it's still a fully natural pitch. with natural grass. A hybrid pitch is one where artificial fibers are injected into the natural turf surface and effectively gives the profile of the soil and the grass strength and stability. and that enables more play to take place, the pitch lives longer. The pace and bounce will increase over time. and effectively, you can play up to three times the amount of cricket on the same pitch,"" concluded Paul.",Former England cricketer Paul Taylor is introducing Stitched Hybrid Pitches.

Indian batters against spin needs mental shift: Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/indian-batters-against-spin-needs-mental-shift-assistant-coach-ryan-ten-doeschate/articleshow/112686218.cms,"NEW DELHI: Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate openly acknowledged that Indian batsmen's eagerness to perform well in foreign conditions has negatively impacted their proficiency against spin bowling.He stated that his primary objective is to help them regain their expertise in this area as they prepare for a crucial season that includes five home Test matches.India, known for their prowess against spin, surprisingly struggled in the recent three-match ODI series in Sri Lanka, where they lost 27 wickets to the host nation's spinners.The 0-2 series defeat marked India's first bilateral ODI series loss against Sri Lanka in nearly three decades.""We got undone against Sri Lanka. The mindset of India has been such that they've been so desperate to do well overseas,"" Doeschate told Talksport Cricket, as quoted by PTI.""The focus has moved to doing well in Australia and England. We've kind of let playing spin, which was always a strength of the Indian team, fall back a little bit.""That's one thing I'm looking forward to helping with, getting to that position where Indians are the best players of spin in the world again,"" said Doeschate.India will host Bangladesh and New Zealand in five Test matches during September and October. The visiting teams possess skilled spinners who could pose challenges for the Indian batsmen.According to Doeschate, a former Netherlands all-rounder with extensive coaching experience globally, tackling spin bowling effectively is more about a mental adjustment than significant technical modifications. He stated, playing spin is about making a mental shift rather than bringing about major technical changes.""I don't think much of what we're going to bring is technical knowledge. It's more about mindsets, situational awareness, and how we think they can control certain phases of the game.""We need to throw ideas out there... de-briefing and keeping the mental space really good. That's going to be really important,"" he elaborated.The 44-year-old Dutchman, who will be assisting head coach Gautam Gambhir and Abhishek Nayar , expressed that the team is eager to win the Champions Trophy next year.""There's the Champions Trophy (February 2025). With only three ODIs left in preparation, it's going to be really challenging to switch between the formats and get the team ready for that, which again is something they're desperate to win,"" he said.Doeschate stated that qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) final in June next year is another crucial goal for Team India .Currently, India lead the WTC table, with Australia close behind, and Doeschate aims to use the 10 Tests India is scheduled to play to solidify their strong position.""In terms of what we're looking forward to... qualifying for the WTC final... there's a great opportunity with 10 Tests left.""We have five (Tests) in India and then we are going to Australia (for another five Tests), which is going to be great.""Doeschate mentioned that stepping into the Indian cricketing establishment was a daunting task, especially following their T20 World Cup victory in June.""In terms of timing (his appointment), it's quite difficult to walk into a team that's just come back with the (T20) World Cup.""But in terms of what's ahead of us for the next 18 months, it's mouth-watering as a coach.

PANAJI: Chhattisgarh ’s Bastar region , famous for its mythological importance as Ram, Sita and Laxman spent 13 years during their exile and infamous for its Naxalism, has found a new calling: Football.The hotbed of insurgency and bloody battleground has been seeing a different battle being fought on the football grounds as the All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has hosted two national championships at Narayanpur in Bastar region.AIFF has been so impressed with the successful hosting of the beautiful game in Narayanpur, one of the seven districts in the region, that it has confirmed the next two editions of the men’s U-20 National Football Championship at the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama Sports Complex in Narayanpur.“We have an understanding (with the Chhattisgarh FA) that we will hold the U-20 national championship in Bastar region for three consecutive years,” AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey told TOI. “If everything goes well, we will renew our agreement. The region has seen a lot of problems, but we can use football to bring about a change.”Named after Swami Vivekananda, the U-20 championship is a unique addition to the AIFF calendar since an inter-state meet in this age group was never organised before.The AIFF does not have such an understanding with any other state FA or organisation. In fact, when there were doubts over who would host the Junior National Championship for the BC Roy Trophy at short notice, early this month, the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama in Narayanpur proved to be a safe choice. The sprawling complex has an in-house full-fledged football pitch, training facilities, and a residential area.“FIFA (the governing body for the sport) believes that football unites the world and India is a country with diversity. Football has a role to unite the world. I am sure, in the coming years, Bastar will be an example to the nation how you can address certain issues through football,” said Chaubey, a former India goalkeeper and BJP politician from Bengal.In the past two years, the AIFF has taken national and international football to areas which remained out of bounds in the past. For example, the National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy , was played in Arunachal Pradesh, while Manipur hosted an international tournament for the first time. Both tournaments drew fantastic responses.“When visas were not issued to athletes from Arunachal Pradesh (for Asian Games), it was a big setback to the nation. I met the chief minister of Arunachal and we decided to host the Santosh Trophy. The crowd, ambience, was terrific and it helped send a message across the world,” said Chaubey.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has hosted two national championships at Narayanpur in Bastar region.

""Different rules for different players.""In a statement to ESPN, Sinner's coach, Darren Cahill, expressed their desire to put the incident behind them and focus on the future. ""We're not looking for any sorrow or anything because we are quite thankful there is no ban attached,"" he said.""He would never, ever intentionally do anything and he's in a situation which is incredibly unfortunate.""Sinner faced a challenging situation when he tested positive for clostebol during the Indian Wells tournament in March. The banned substance was detected in his system in low quantities, and a subsequent test days later also showed its presence. Despite this, the 23-year-old successfully challenged the automatic provisional suspensions that would have typically followed such findings.As a result of his successful appeal, Sinner is now eligible to participate in the upcoming US Open, which is set to take place from August 26 to September 8.Sinner lost in the semis at Indian Wells and was stripped of 400 ranking points and had to forfeit $325,000 in prize money that he had earned at the tournament.""Whether Sinner was doping or not, this is not right,"" British player Liam Broady wrote in a social media post. ""Plenty of players go through the same thing and have to wait months or years for their innocence to be declared. Not a good look.""The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), founded in 2021 by tennis governing bodies, has accepted Jannik Sinner's appeal to lift his provisional suspension.The agency sought expert opinions and found Sinner's explanation to be plausible, leading to their decision not to contest his appeal.Tara Moore, a former top-ranked British doubles player, highlighted the difference in the handling of her case compared to Sinner's. Moore was suspended for 19 months due to a failed drug test before being exonerated last year. She expressed her views on the matter through social media posts.""I guess only the top players' images matter,"" Moore wrote. ""I guess only the independent tribunal's opinion on the top players is taken as sound and right. Yet, they question them in my case. Just makes no sense.""Simona Halep, a former Wimbledon champion, faced a provisional suspension in October 2022 due to two distinct violations of anti-doping regulations. The initial suspension was followed by a four-year ban.In March, after an appeal was filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the ban was reduced to a period of nine months.The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), an organization founded by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in 2020, emphasized the need for a consistent approach within the anti-doping system.""Players winning anti-doping violation appeals is generally good,"" said Ahmad Nassar, an executive director of the player advocacy group.""But we have to have clear, consistent processes for all players. Whether ranked one, 100 or 1,000; whether man or woman. And no matter what region of the world they may call home.""The absence of a clear and consistent system creates obvious problems for players who are not the perceived ranking, gender and/or nationality of choice. The absence also undermines the tennis establishment's credibility with fans and media.""The ruling made on Tuesday may still face appeals from either the World Anti-Doping Agency or the Italian Anti-Doping Agency.Nick Kyrgios also expressed his disapproval of the decision.""Ridiculous - whether it was accidental or planned,"" the 2022 Wimbledon finalist wrote on social media. ""You get tested twice with a banned (steroid) substance... you should be gone for two years.""",The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) has accepted Jannik Sinner's appeal to lift his provisional suspension. Sinner tested positive for clostebol during the Indian Wells tournament in March.
