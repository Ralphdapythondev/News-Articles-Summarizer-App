Virat Kohli: 'Mai kabhi ladai nahi karta kisi se' - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/virat-kohli-mai-kabhi-ladai-nahi-karta-kisi-se-watch/articleshow/112257679.cms,"WATCH VIDEO

In a candid chat during an interview, the clip of which has gone viral on social media, India's batting legend Virat Kohli is heard telling the interviewer ""mai kabhi ladai nahi karta kisi se (I never fight with anyone)"".The comment understandably is followed by Kohli bursting into laughter, probably because he knew the follow-up question would be around his aggressive, never-step-back approach and 'verbal volleys' while on the field.""Mai kabhi ladai-vadai nahi karta kisi se, physical to chance hi nahi. Koi mujhe maar ke nikal jayega (I don't fight, never physically, somebody can hit me and leave),"" Kohli said.And when the former India captain was dropped a hint that his comment was contrary to his aggressive body language and verbal altercations on the field, he smiled and said: ""Muh se kuchh bhi bulva lo, but mai physical ladai nahi karta (I can say things verbally but never get involved in a physical fight)""Kohli added: ""Even that (aggression) I do on the ground because I know it won't lead to a fight as the umpires would intervene.""Of late, Kohli's infamous on-field altercations with Gautam Gambhir returned to hog the limelight when the latter was announced as India's new head coach replacing Rahul Dravid, whose tenure ended after the T20 World Cup in June.Kohli and Gambhir had been eye to eye more than once and as recent as the 2023 IPL season when the Royal Challengers Bengaluru icon Kohli had an angry face-off with Gambhir, who was mentoring Lucknow Super Giants at that time.However, both have said that they have moved on from those differences. The duo, part of the 2011 ODI World Cup-winning team, reunited in the Indian dressing room for the ongoing ODI leg of the tour of Sri Lanka.","Virat Kohli tells interviewer: ""I never fight with anyone"" The comment is followed by Kohli bursting into laughter.

Confusion: Why there was no 'Super Over' in the tied first ODI between India and Sri Lanka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/confusion-why-there-was-no-super-over-in-the-tied-first-odi-between-india-and-sri-lanka/articleshow/112256966.cms,"ACCORDING TO THE RULE

THE MOST FAMOUS SUPER OVER IN ODIs

The first match of the ODI series between India and Sri Lanka ended in a tie, but the ' Super Over ' rule was not used as a tiebreaker to decide a winner despite the ICC rules stating that it ""shall be played"".While it's unclear if the rule was amended for the ODI series after mutual agreement between the two teams, the third match of the T20I series in the earlier part of this tour was decided by a 'Super Over'.That led to confusion the day after the first ODI on Friday at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo ended in a tie as India's chase ended at 230 all out, the same total as Sri Lanka's.The ICC's ODI Playing Conditions pertaining to tied ODIs suggest the 'Super Over' rule should have been used by the match officials.The ICC Men's ODI Playing Conditions were last amended in December 2023 and the same have applied ever since. Clause 16.3.1.1 states all ODI matches ending in a tie shall have a 'Super Over' unless conditions don't allow it to be played.According to the rule: ""...a Super Over shall be played. If the Super Over is a tie, then unless exceptional circumstances arise, subsequent Super Overs shall be played until there is a winner. Should it not be possible to play or complete the Super Overs needed to determine a winner, the match shall be tied.”The final of the 2019 ODI World Cup had to be decided on boundary countback after both the stipulated 50-overs-a-side match and the subsequent 'Super Over' ended in ties and couldn't break the deadlock.The second ODI of the series will be played on Sunday.","The first match of the ODI series between India and Sri Lanka ended in a tie.

Manu Bhaker: Paris Olympics: How two below-par rounds cost double Olympic medallist Manu Bhaker historic treble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/paris-olympics-how-two-below-par-rounds-cost-double-olympic-medallist-manu-bhaker-historic-treble/articleshow/112257516.cms,"CHATEAUROUX: A rollercoaster. That's how Manu Bhaker described it later here on Saturday morning. Her bid for a historic third medal had ended in an agonizing finish. It must have left her feeling empty inside, but she did not show it. She has learnt not to show it. She was there, up there. And then she was not. A couple of poor shots, a couple of poor series – at the beginning and the end – and that was it.That's sport for you.When it all started, Manu looked confident when she walked up to station G inside the 25m pistol women's final hall. The routine was the same, the rigour same. She set up her station, did some shadow shooting and was ready. Both hands in pocket, she waited.The first series was a disaster. She was surely feeling the pressure. She shot 2/5 and found herself in the sixth position in the eight-woman field. A shrug of the shoulders, a fleeting look at her coach Jaspal Rana – sitting in the same seat in the stands when Manu won her first bronze – and she was back to the task. She was not giving up.The second series brought her back. She was alive. 4/5 was just what she needed. She had jumped up to the fourth position. She shot another 4/5 in the third series and moved up to the second position. It was all falling into place.The fourth series was an average 3/5 and Manu slid to the sixth place, just a shot below three above her. But she was very near elimination. Another poor round and it would be all over.But no, that was not the script. She shot a perfect 5/5 to move towards safety and a possible medal. She was now third on 18 points, a point behind Hungary's Veronica Major and two behind South Korea's Yang Jin who went on to win the gold medal.The elimination had started, and Manu was way clear. In the sixth series, she got a 4/5, missing her last shot. But she was back to second, trailing the Korean by two points. The Indians in the stands had started celebrating.The seventh series was again a brilliant 4/5. She stayed in the second spot, now just a point separating her from Jin. The roar in the right corner of the stands was deafening. The India corner.This is where the course changed. A 3/5 could have kept Manu in the hunt for a silver medal, maybe even a gold. With the last four standing, she failed to hold her nerve. 2/5 and Manu found herself in a shoot-off with Major, both now on 28 points.One poor series and it had come to that. Fingers crossed.In the shoot-off, Manu got the first two targets, missed the third and fourth and hit the last one. The Hungarian got four shots to win 4/3. Manu was out. She looked disappointed as she walked back to her corner and sat quietly, probably trying to figure out what went wrong.But the Indian fans were still celebrating, chanting her name, clapping. They had travelled a long distance just to see her shoot, to back her, to show her love. The medal went missing in that single shot, but she was still a champion. A star was born at the shooting ranges here last Sunday. She shone bright the whole week.Manu is just 22. Her journey from Tokyo 2021 to here has been a difficult one, full of sacrifices. She followed a rigid regimen, a strict diet, worked out hard in the gym and trained for hours and hours at the range. Pushed by her coach, she steeled herself to come out of a dark place and discover a new Manu.Manu 2.0 has been a revelation. Very few who saw her crash badly in Tokyo were willing to back her. There were stories of indiscipline, all kinds of rumours. And to think she was just 19 then, mentally fragile, helpless. Alone. She went back to Rana and that changed her life. He held her hand, helped her heal and slowly moulded her into a tough cookie. She would crumble no more.Manu Bhaker has come a long way, but her journey is incomplete. She wants more. India wants more.","Manu Bhaker's bid for a historic third medal ended in an agonizing finish. The 22-year-old shot a perfect 5/5 to move towards safety and a possible medal.

India captain Rohit Sharma was in full flow with the bat during the practice sessions in Sri Lanka after joining the ODI squad for the three-match series beginning on Friday, and one of his big hits in the nets got even head coach Gautam Gambhir looking skywards to see where the ball was headed.After announcing his retirement from T20Is following India's T20 World Cup triumph in the Caribbean on June 29 this year, a well-rested Rohit is back to lead India in 50-over internationals.Also returning to the squad is Virat Kohli, who also decided to retire from T20Is after India became the T20 world champions.But it didn't take time for the two seasoned pros to get back in the groove for the longer version of white-ball cricket , as both Rohit and Virat had a good feel of the Sri Lankan conditions, which, however, are not much dissimilar to India.During one of the training sessions in Colombo , with Rohit facing the bowlers in the nets, the skipper launched himself into a big aerial shot.

NEW DELHI: Imane Khelif ’s Olympic journey in Paris began with a victory shrouded in controversy, setting the stage for a dramatic and polarizing narrative.The Algerian boxer , who had been reinstated for the Games despite a previous disqualification from the 2023 World Championships due to a failed gender eligibility test, found herself at the centre of a storm before she even stepped into the ring.In her opening bout, Khelif faced Italy’s Angela Carini , a seasoned fighter with high expectations.However, the match ended abruptly after just 46 seconds, a rare occurrence in Olympic boxing .Carini, visibly distraught and bleeding from her nose, cited intense pain from the initial exchanges as the reason for her sudden withdrawal.She vehemently denied any political motivation behind her decision, saying, ""If an athlete is this way, and in that sense it’s not right or it is right, it’s not up to me to decide. I just did my job as a boxer. I got into the ring and fought. I did it with my head held high and with a broken heart for not having finished the last kilometre.”Yet, the tension was palpable when Carini refused to shake Khelif’s hand after the fight.Carini’s refusal to engage in the customary post-fight handshake was seen by many as a silent protest, though she insisted it was merely a result of her physical distress. The incident, however, intensified the scrutiny on Khelif’s presence at the Games.Khelif is not a transgender athlete .She was born female but has a disorder of sex development (DSD) that results in XY chromosomes and testosterone levels similar to those of male athletes.The IOC's Framework on Fairness, Inclusion, and Non-discrimination based on gender identity and sex variations provides guidelines for sports federations to promote inclusion and fairness, particularly for athletes with Differences of Sexual Development (DSD).DSD encompasses a group of rare conditions that affect genes, hormones, and reproductive organs.Individuals with DSDs may be raised as female but possess XY chromosomes and testosterone levels typically found in males.Despite the controversy, Khelif, a silver medalist at the 2022 IBA World Championships, remains undeterred in her Olympic aspirations.Her next challenge is a quarterfinal bout against Hungarian trailblazer Anna Luca Hamori, a match that holds significant weight. A victory would not only secure Khelif an Olympic medal but also potentially reignite the ethical and sporting debates surrounding her eligibility.",Algerian boxer Imane Khelif is not a transgender athlete.

Who is Imane Khelif?

Critics argue that differing standards between the IBA and IOC create confusion and potential unfairness in competition.Italy's Family Minister Eugenia Roccella and Sports Minister Andrea Abodi have expressed concerns about the lack of uniform criteria at the international level, questioning the fairness and safety of allowing Khelif to compete against other female athletes.The Algerian Olympic Committee (COA) has come to Khelif’s defence, condemning what they describe as “malicious and unethical attacks” by foreign media. The COA has emphasized their unwavering support for Khelif, denouncing the scrutiny as ""baseless propaganda"" aimed at undermining her credibility and morale as she competes at the pinnacle of her career.During her brief but impactful fight in Paris, Khelif faced Italy’s Angela Carini, who suffered a badly hurt nose and was unable to continue, leading to an official abandonment of the match.The swift victory was met with mixed reactions, with Algerian fans in the North Paris Arena showing their support by chanting Khelif’s name, while Carini’s emotional response highlighted the intense pressure and stakes involved in the competition.As the debate over gender eligibility in sports continues, Khelif’s journey at the Paris Olympics is likely to remain under the spotlight, reflecting broader discussions about fairness, safety, and the evolving standards in women’s sports. Despite the controversy, Khelif remains focused on her Olympic goals, buoyed by the support of her nation and the determination to prove herself on the world stage.",Algerian boxer Imane Khelif has become a focal point of controversy at the Paris Olympics.

Bumrah turned the tide of the match by dismissing the dangerous Mohammad Rizwan , sending Pakistan reeling when they were comfortably placed at 80/3.Then, in the Barbados final, Bumrah bowled a game-changing spell against the Proteas, giving up only four runs in the 16th over and dismissing dangerous power-hitter Marco Jansen to put the opposition on the defensive in their pursuit of 176.""He (Bumrah) just showed the world what it takes...and you know, it's not often in your career when you have a ball in your hand and you say, 'do this and the ball does that',"" Shastri said in the ICC Review, according to PTI.""I think the India-Pakistan (match) because India were made to fight there and realise what the right combination should be going forward in the tournament.

He believes this strategy can serve as a ""surprise element"" against the opposing team.In the opening ODI against Sri Lanka, which concluded in a tie on Friday, opener Shubman Gill was given the opportunity to showcase his bowling skills.Despite conceding 14 runs in his solitary over, Bahutule affirmed that this approach will continue to be implemented in the future.“I think our batters are good bowlers as well, to be honest. You know their primary skill is batting, so at times, they don't focus much on their bowling. But they have the skills,” said Bahutule in the post-match press meet.Charith Asalanka, the Sri Lankan captain and their top batter, demonstrated his all-round skills by bowling 8.5 overs and claiming three wickets for 30 runs.His victims included Shivam Dube and Arshdeep Singh , who were dismissed in consecutive deliveries. Asalanka's crucial contribution helped Sri Lanka secure a tie in the match.To support his argument, Bahutule cited the instances of Suryakumar Yadav and Rinku Singh being called upon to bowl in the T20I series against Sri Lanka.The inclusion of these part-time bowlers in the playing eleven highlights the importance of having multiple bowling options in the shortest format of the game.“You might have seen in the T20Is…Rinku and Surya contributed with the ball. So, an opportunity was given to Shubman here. It's going to be an all-rounder's game in the coming days.“So, if one or two (batsmen) from the top-order can bowl it will definitely help the team, of course, depending on pitch conditions and situations.“Also, it will be a surprise element to the opposition, if a batter can bowl. So, moving ahead there will be ample opportunities for batters to bowl,” he explained.Bahutule expressed that the visiting team had the opportunity to build more substantial partnerships, especially after their explosive start to the innings. He felt that they could have capitalized on the strong foundation laid by the openers and constructed a more formidable total.“To have a tie in ODI is always exciting. Yeah, we should have got that one run and finished off the match. Nevertheless, I thought we bowled really well.“We did bat well in patches, and we could have had few partnerships that would have taken us (home) with less wickets going,” he said.Bahutule admitted that the Lankan spinners used the nature of the pitch to the hilt.“I think the nature of the pitch and the way they bowled…Hasaranga and Asalanka executed their skills very well.“We tried our best to get into the partnerships, and Shivam (Dube) also batted well and contributed. But yes, we could have put in that one extra effort of scoring that single run.”The former India leg-spinner said the team should have capitalised on the start given by skipper Rohit Sharma . Rohit made a superb 58 off 47 balls that helped India reach 75 in 12.4 overs.“The start given by Rohit was fantastic, and at one stage it looked like we wouldn't lose too many wickets. It (the way Rohit batted) was important when the ball was hard and coming onto the bat. I think it was his first ODI innings after the (50-over) World Cup.“It didn't look like there was a break. He takes on the responsibility, sets the tone against any opposition, any pace attack. He is very positive in his intent.”","Sairaj Bahutule says India will continue to give top-order batsmen chances to bowl.

India vs Sri Lanka 2nd ODI: India look to find a way past Sri Lankan spinners on a slow pitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/india-vs-sri-lanka-2nd-odi-india-look-to-find-a-way-past-sri-lankan-spinners-on-a-slow-pitch/articleshow/112241417.cms,"Teams (from):

Sri Lanka:

NEW DELHI: Strategies to counter a slow pitch and a variety of slow bowlers from Sri Lanka will be at the top of India's list of priorities for the second ODI, which is set to take place in Colombo on Sunday.India lost the first ODI on Friday after chasing a respectable 231 and being well positioned at 130 for three. The Lankan spinners had enough bravery to dismiss the visitors for 230 and force a tie.After surviving the initial onslaught from Rohit Sharma , Lanka successfully carried out their strategy against the Indian hitters, who are not the most cunning players on rank turners-though few are.With surprisingly good results, the host team used their army of tweakers to target the core of the Indian top and middle order-Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, and Shreyas Iyer .Though not uncomfortable, the troika was unable to break away due to several well-planned maneuvers made by the accurate and well-resourced Lankans.Left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage and leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga tied Kohli down as the Indian batsman faced 29 of the 32 balls that the spinners produced.Eventually, Hasaranga got the better of him, and with Shreyas comfortable against spinners, Lankan captainCharith Asalanka brought pacer Asitha Fernando into the fold.Fernando proved his worth by getting rid of Shreyas with a peach, which was also the only Indian wicket to fall to a pacer.Hasaranga also managed to snatch up Rahul, another outstanding player of spin.The Indians will be keen to bat long and rotate strike, which is the key to neutralising spinners on such surfaces, but faltering in one match leaves too little of a footprint to pursue some of the accomplished names.Despite a barrage of wickets at the other end, Sri Lankans Pathum Nissanka and Wellalage demonstrated this en route to their fifties while handling Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, and Washington Sundar with efficiency.In contrast to their Sri Lankan counterparts, who leaked 167 in 37.5 overs for nine wickets, the four Indian spinners, including Shubman Gill , leaked 126 in 30 overs for four wickets.Therefore, the Indians will aim to limit the harm without sacrificing their ability to score runs, according to PTI.Bowling coach Sairaj Bahutule said as much. ""We did bat well in patches, and we could have had some partnerships that would have taken us (home) with less wickets going. We tried our best to get into partnerships,"" said Bahutule after the first match.Bringing in Rishabh Pant or Riyan Parag is one option India might consider, as both are excellent at combating spinners and can throw off their rhythm by playing some of those unconventional smashes.While scooping and reverse-sweeping Washington Sundar and Axar, Wellalage accomplished that to flawless effect.Parag also brings with him the package deal of being both an off-spinner and a leg-spinner.It is still to be seen, though, if the Indian team management-which hasn't been their habit lately-will alter their ways after just one game.After limiting a far better and far more experienced opponent, Sri Lanka will go into the second game of the three-match series in a healthier mental state.They will, however, be monitoring Hasaranga's fitness as he was observed clenching his hamstring near the end of his spell in the first one-dayer.Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Virat Kohli , KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd.

Will 'Skeleton bone test' be able to end the age fraud menace in Indian grassroots football?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-skeleton-bone-test-be-able-to-end-the-age-fraud-menace-in-indian-grassroots-football/articleshow/112229085.cms,"What is a skeleton bone test?

NEW DELHI: If you google "" age fraud in Indian football "", you'll find countless entries, articles, short-form, long-form, evidence-driven ones, written by countless writers, journalists, and observers of the beautiful game of football.One can find the news of the Indian under-15 football team's captain turning out to be almost eighteen months over the age limit for the Asian under-16 championship in April 2019 or an under-17 player initially rejected by coach Nicolai Adam for his ""unnatural height"" at age 14 was later accepted into the team under Luis Norton de Matos, everything is already so well-documented.While age fraud remains a persistent issue in Indian football, we should now be looking for a more permanent and accurate solution to fight it.And it should begin early, from the grassroots level of Indian football, like the Subroto Cup , an annual school football tournament held in India, named after Subroto Mukerjee, the founder of the Air India Football Club. The prestigious tournament, established in 1960, was once graced by players like Baichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri and will enter its 63rd edition on August 5.Aimed at promoting the sport at the grassroots level, it will host a jaw-dropping 111 teams across three categories, with the sub-junior (under-15) category introduced for the first time this year. It will also have some teams from foreign countries too.To fight the demon of age fraud, the organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament, offering a promising solution to address this issue effectively.During the opening press conference of the Subroto Cup, TimesofIndia.com raised concerns about age fraud. Answering, an Air Force Sports Control Board (AFSCB) spokesperson stated, ""All and every footballer (who will be participating in the Subroto Cup) is registered on the AIFF website. And each of them gets a unique code. We also want to avoid age fraud. As per the AIFF guidelines, a skeleton bone test will be done for the under-15 boys category. For the under-17 category, it will be normal medical. The skeleton bone test or the age-detection test will all be done under the guidelines of AIFF.""The skeleton bone test, commonly known as a bone age assessment, estimates a person's age, especially in children and adolescents, by analyzing their bones.This process typically involves taking an X-ray of the left hand and wrist, as this area contains bones that undergo predictable developmental changes with age. The X-ray is then compared to standard reference images, such as those in the Greulich-Pyle Atlas, to determine the bone's developmental stage, including the appearance of growth plates and the fusion of epiphyses.It is understood that 22 teams in the under-14 category were disqualified and did not participate in the Subroto Cup after failing the age-determination test last time. According to AIFF guidelines, if four or more players from a team are found to be over-aged, that team will be immediately disqualified and barred from the tournament.""Apart from that, all the players who have already registered through AIFF and CRS (central registration system), have their age verified. The people who are coming are less in numbers. So, in times to come, age fraud, which is prevalent in football, is likely to reduce,"" he ended on a positive note, sounding hopeful, as we all are, of a better future.","The Subroto Cup is an annual school football tournament held in India.
