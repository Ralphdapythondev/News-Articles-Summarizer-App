NEW DELHI: Former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly praised Rohit Sharma 's captaincy skills on Friday, attributing them to India's undefeated streak in the current T20 World Cup . He encouraged the team to approach the final against South Africa with an unrestrained mindset, aiming to conclude an 11-year drought without an ICC title.The highly anticipated championship match between India and South Africa will take place in Bridgetown, Barbados.The Indian team is determined to secure their first international trophy since their triumphant campaign in the 2013 Champions Trophy.""I'm very happy for Rohit Sharma. Life comes full circle. Six months ago he was not even the captain of Mumbai Indians and the same man is now leading India to a World Cup final, unbeaten,"" Ganguly said, as quoted by PTI, after being roped in as the brand ambassador of Veedol.The former BCCI president Ganguly disclosed that Rohit was hesitant to assume the captaincy responsibilities following Virat Kohli's decision to step down from the leadership role.""He has played two World Cup finals where he has gone into the final unbeaten. That speaks of his captaincy and leadership quality and I'm not surprised because he became captain when I was the BCCI president and when Virat didn't want to captain India anymore.""It took a lot of time to make him captain because he was not ready to captain. It took a lot of pushing from all of us to make him captain and I'm very happy to see the progress of Indian cricket under him.""Ganguly expressed that securing victories in the Indian Premier League (IPL) can occasionally be a more demanding task due to the extended length of the competition.""Rohit has the record of winning five IPL titles, which is a huge achievement. Winning an IPL sometimes is more difficult. Don't misquote me, I'm not saying IPL is better than international cricket.""But you have to win 16-17 (12-13) matches to win an IPL; here you need to win 8-9 matches to win a World Cup. The honour is more in winning the World Cup, and I hope Rohit does it tomorrow.""""I don't think he can lose two World Cup finals in seven (six) months. He will probably jump into the Barbados ocean if he loses two finals under his captaincy in seven months. He has led from the front, batted brilliantly, and I hope it continues tomorrow. Hope India finishes on the right side, and they should play with freedom.""They have been the best side of the competition. I wish them luck, I wish they win. Hope they have a little bit of luck tomorrow because that is required to win big tournaments,"" Ganguly added.India's journey since their triumphant Champions Trophy campaign has been marked by a series of near misses in major tournaments. They fought their way to the final of the 2014 T20 World Cup, showcasing their prowess in the shortest format of the game. However, they fell short at the final hurdle, unable to clinch the coveted title.""I look at it differently. At least we are getting to the finals, we can only win once we get to the final,"" he said.""The positive thing is India is not getting eliminated. Secondly, they are dominating. You saw the World Cup in India seven months ago; they were the best side in the competition, although they lost to Australia in the final.""They were a better side than Australia right through the tournament; they just had one bad day,"" he pointed out.Ganguly expressed his views on South Africa's historic achievement of reaching the World Cup final for the first time since their reintegration into international cricket in 1991.""It's a huge moment for South African cricket. Imagine a team that came back to international cricket in 1992, and it took them 32 years to play in a World Cup final. So, it's going to be a big day for both teams,"" he said.Kohli has been experiencing a relatively average performance in the current World Cup while opening the batting order. However, Ganguly believes that Kohli should maintain his position and not shift to the No. 3 spot in the lineup.""Virat should continue to open. He just had a World Cup of 700 runs seven months ago. He is human. Sometimes, he will also fail, and you have to accept it.""People like Kohli, (Sachin) Tendulkar, (Rahul) Dravid, they are institutions for Indian cricket. Three-four matches don't make them weaker players. Don't rule him out in the final tomorrow,"" added Ganguly.Former England captain Michael Vaughan has expressed disapproval of the ICC. He alleges that the governing body has given India an advantage by selecting a venue for the World Cup semifinal in Guyana that is conducive to spin bowling.Furthermore, Vaughan has leveled accusations against broadcasters, claiming that they have consistently allocated India the desirable 8pm IST time slot for all of their matches in the tournament.Dismissing such claims, Ganguly said: ""Michael Vaughan is a very dear friend of mine.

Giving away just 4 runs in it, Bumrah kept India's hopes alive and that's where South Africa's choking in the chase began.Although the win predictor still showed 92% Proteas win and India's chances at only 8% after 16 overs, the reality on the ground looked different.The equation was now 26 off 24 as Hardik Pandya came back into the attack to bowl the 17th over.Dismissing a fifty-up Heinrich Klaasen on the first ball of the over, Hardik broke the backbone of the Proteas chase.As a potentially match winning knock from Klaasen ended via a caught behind dismissal, India were now right back in the contest.In the 17th over, Hardik gave just 4 runs apart from the Klaasen wicket as South Africa now needed 22 off 18.For Rohit now, it was a tough choice, whether to give Bumrah the 18th or the 19th over and the skipper went with the former.After a couple of dot balls and a single, Bumrah knocked over Marco Jansen (2) on the fourth ball as David Miller, at the non-striker's end helplessly watched the Proteas implosion.With just two runs and a wicket coming in the 18th Bumrah over, the pressure was now all on South Africa.Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh then came in and delivered an incredible penultimate over, giving away just 4 runs to David Miller (21*) and Keshav Maharaj (2*).The four exceptional overs after the 16th had now given Hardik 16 to defend in the final over.On the first ball of the final Hardik over, Surykumar Yadav, at long-off pulled off the catch for the ages to get rid of Miller for 21 as India delivered the knockout punch to the Proteas.With Maharaj and Kagiso Rabada now in the middle and 16 to defend off 5 balls, Hardik finished off the job with perfection as India sealed a famous seven-run win.",India beat South Africa by seven runs at the T20 World Cup in Barbados.

NEW DELHI: India's victory in the T20 World Cup final against South Africa was the culmination of a three-year journey filled with meticulous planning and diligent preparation, rather than a singular display of flawless execution on the day of the championship match, according to an emotionally charged Rohit Sharma , the team's captain.In a closely contested final, India managed to secure a seven-run win over South Africa, bringing an end to a title drought that had lasted for more than a decade.""I am completely lost and can't say what kind of emotions I am going through. Can't explain it in words. Let this sink in. Last night, I couldn't sleep as I was desperate and wanted it so badly. But I managed myself well inside the ground,"" Rohit, as quoted by PTI, said after becoming the third India captain after Kapil Dev and Mahendra Singh Dhoni to clinch a global title.""Hard to sum up what we've been through in last three-four years. A lot behind the scenes, not what we did today, it's what we did before,"" said the skipper.Rohit, still haunted by the memories of the ODI World Cup loss from the previous year, understood the importance of absorbing pressure in high-stakes situations.""A lot of high-pressure games, and we've been on the wrong side of it. Guys understand when the pressure is on, what needs to be done, today was perfect example, we stuck together with backs to the wall.""Rohit made sure to acknowledge the crucial role played by the team management and his teammates in answering his call for action.""We wanted this really bad, a lot of minds need to come together, very proud of the bunch of boys and the management, giving us the liberty to play and that trust. Starts from management, coach, captain, and the players.""Rohit, who has shared the cricket field with Virat Kohli for over a decade and a half, remained unfazed by his teammate's lean patch leading up to the crucial match. The Indian captain had unwavering faith in Kohli's abilities, despite the recent struggles with the bat.""No-one was in doubt about the form of Virat, on top of his game for last 15 years. Come the occasion, big players stand up. Crucial to hold that end, for the others to play around him.""...it wasn't a wicket to bat freely. He did that perfectly, that experience of all the years come together, and Axar's batting was crucial,"" he said, lauding the 47-run effort by Patel.Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional abilities on the cricket field are challenging to articulate for the average person. Even the team captain admits that he struggles to adequately capture the essence of Bumrah's bowling prowess.""Jasprit, I understand you guys trying to put it into words, but I don't know how he does it, it's just masterclass. He backs his skills which is more than enough, and is a confident lad. Class act,"" Rohit said about the player of the tournament.Following a challenging IPL season with the Mumbai Indians, Hardik Pandya showcased his skills during the T20 World Cup. His impressive performance did not go unnoticed by the national team captain, who praised Pandya's efforts.""Hardik was brilliant, to bowl that last over, proud of the boys. And the fans, from New York to Barbados, and back home. Late in India but they've been waiting a long time. Very proud of what we've achieved today.""Rohit's face radiated with satisfaction and joy as he carried his daughter Samaira on his shoulders during a victory lap. The skipper had every reason to bask in the moment, having earned the right to celebrate.","Rohit Sharma says India's victory in T20 World Cup final was culmination of three-year journey.

Brazil Vs Paraguay: Vinicius Junior nets brace in Brazil's 4-1 Copa America victory over Paraguay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/vinicius-junior-nets-brace-in-brazils-4-1-copa-america-victory-over-paraguay/articleshow/111354745.cms,"NEW DELHI: Brazil displayed a convincing 4-1 victory over Paraguay in their second Group D match of the Copa America on Friday, with Real Madrid 's Vinicius Junior playing a pivotal role by scoring two goals. The result helped Brazil bounce back strongly from a disappointing opening performance.Vinicius, who had a subdued outing in the previous game, was a constant menace down the left flank throughout the match.His movement and trickery caused significant problems for the Paraguayan defence.His first goal, arriving in the 35th minute, exemplified Brazil's fluid attacking play. A well-worked team move culminated in Lucas Paqueta delivering a precise first-time pass to Vinicius, who calmly slotted the ball home.Brazil doubled their lead shortly after through Girona winger Savio, who reacted quickest to a rebound inside the penalty area. Vinicius then added his second and Brazil's third just before half-time, capitalizing on a defensive error by Omar Alderete .The Paraguayan defender's attempted clearance struck Vinicius's outstretched leg and deflected into the net.Paraguay showed resilience early in the second half, pulling a goal back through a spectacular long-range strike from Alderete. However, any hopes of an unlikely comeback were dashed when Lucas Paqueta atoned for an earlier penalty miss by converting a spot-kick in the 68th minute.This victory leads Brazil to second place in Group D with four points from two matches. Colombia currently lead the group with a perfect record of two wins from two, securing their place in the quarter-finals. Costa Rica, on the other hand, occupy the third spot with one point, while Paraguay sit at the bottom of the table with two losses.","Brazil beat Paraguay 4-1 in their second Group D match of the Copa America.

On the other hand, Gareca was late in bringing on a player at halftime during Chile's match against Argentina on Tuesday.CONMEBOL cited articles 104 and 145 of the tournament's regulations, which stipulate that teams must take the field on time for the scheduled start or restart of play. Failure to do so has resulted in the one-match suspension for both Scaloni and Gareca, preventing them from being present on the substitutes' bench during their respective teams' final group stage matches on Saturday.In addition to the suspensions, the Argentine and Chilean football federations have each been fined $15,000 as a consequence of their teams' tardiness.As things stand, Argentina currently top Group A with six points and have already secured their place in the quarter-finals. They will face Peru on Saturday without the presence of Scaloni on the sidelines.Meanwhile, Chile, with only one point, will take on group runners-up Canada in their final group match, also without the guidance of Gareca from the bench.While the suspensions and fines may seem harsh, they serve as a reminder to teams and coaching staff of the need to respect the established rules and schedules, ensuring the smooth and timely progression of the competition.","The South American football governing body, CONMEBOL, has taken disciplinary action against the coaches of Argentina and Chile, Lionel Scaloni and Ricardo Gareca.

The goals from Luis Diaz , Davinson Sanchez , and Jhon Cordoba ensured that Colombia finished in the top two positions in Group D.With this win, Colombia extended their unbeaten streak to 25 games, a remarkable achievement that dates back to February 2022 when they suffered a defeat against Argentina.Nestor Lorenzo's well-drilled side displayed a composed and organized performance, never allowing Costa Rica to threaten their unbeaten record.The opening goal came in the 31st minute when Liverpool's Luis Diaz converted a penalty kick with authority after Costa Rican goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira committed a reckless challenge on Jhon Cordoba near the edge of the penalty area. Diaz's powerful strike found the top corner, giving Colombia the lead.Colombia came close to doubling their advantage in the 37th minute when veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picked out Diaz at the back post with a precise cross. However, Diaz's attempted cutback across the face of the goal narrowly evaded the outstretched Davinson Sanchez.Sanchez made amends for the missed opportunity in the 59th minute, glancing in Jhon Arias's left-wing cross to extend Colombia's lead to 2-0. Three minutes later, Cordoba scored the third goal with a clinical finish, latching onto Rodriguez's incisive through ball and firing a low shot across the goalkeeper and into the far corner.With this comprehensive victory, Colombia will qualify for the quarter-finals as group winners if they can secure at least a point against Brazil in their final group game on Tuesday.

This unexpected result has given the Slovaks belief that they can overcome their higher-ranked opponent and progress further in the competition.""The English have quality, but every opponent they have played were able to torment them,"" Slovakia midfielder Ondrej Duda told TV Markíza.Slovakia's head coach, Francesco Calzona , referred to his squad as the unexpected success story of the group stage following their victory against Belgium. Meanwhile, the underdog team from Georgia also exceeded predictions by stunning Portugal with a 2-0 win, demonstrating that no team should be underestimated.Although England supporters celebrated their team's placement on the more favorable side of the tournament bracket, potentially providing a less challenging path to the final, this advantage exists only in theory.""I think everyone has seen in this competition that there is not a favourable side of the draw,"" England defender Marc Guehi told reporters on Thursday. ""Every team, every opponent, is really tough to come up against. I think we need to remain calm.""England demonstrated some progress in the latter half of their goalless draw against Slovenia on Tuesday, with Kobbie Mainoo and Cole Palmer making a positive impact as substitutes.Although England's backline was a significant worry prior to the tournament due to the absence of experienced players like Harry Maguire, it has been the strongest aspect of the team's Euro performance . Throughout the group stage, England have conceded the fewest expected goals (xG) - a metric that quantifies the quality of scoring opportunities allowed to opponents.Southgate will be hoping for an improved display from Jude Bellingham , who excelled in the first half of their 1-0 victory against Serbia but faded in the subsequent two matches.Slovakia's key player is the skillful Napoli midfielder Stanislav Lobotka , whom Italian legend Andrea Pirlo described as ""the best playmaker in the Italian league.""Calzona, who had served as an assistant throughout his career before being named Slovakia's manager in 2022, stated that his team had already achieved their primary objective of reaching Euro. ""Everything else,"" he told UEFA , ""is icing on the cake.""""One of the goals now will certainly be to play beautiful football and make these people proud, because we've had a great following at recent matches,"" he said.England faces a challenging match against Slovakia, who are expected to adopt a defensive approach. The English side has had difficulties breaking down teams that employ a low block defensive strategy.However, England can take comfort in their historical record against Slovakia, having never lost to them in six previous encounters, including five victories and a goalless draw during the group stage of Euro 2016.Both teams had impressive Euro qualifying campaigns, with Slovakia securing seven wins and a draw in their 10 matches, while England emerged from their five-team group with six wins and two draws.The victor of this encounter will progress to the quarter-finals, where they will face the winner of the match between Italy and Switzerland.","England face Slovakia in Euro 2024 last-16 match.

A well-executed set piece culminated in Facundo Pellistri finding the back of the net with a decisive header.Maintaining their offensive pressure, Uruguay doubled their advantage just past the 20-minute mark.Darwin Nunez , continuing his impressive scoring streak, unleashed a powerful left-footed strike that beat Bolivian goalkeeper Guillermo Vizcarra. This goal marked Nunez's seventh consecutive international match finding the scoresheet.Despite a period of reduced intensity at the start of the second half, much to the visible frustration of manager Marcelo Bielsa , Uruguay reignited their attacking momentum. In the 77th minute, Maximiliano Araujo effectively sealed the victory, capitalizing on a precise through ball from Nicolas de la Cruz to score from close range.Uruguay's dominance continued into the closing stages of the match. Federico Valverde extended the lead to 4-0 just four minutes after Araujo's goal. Substitute Rodrigo Bentancur added the final touch to the rout, heading home Uruguay's fifth goal in the 89th minute, marking his first touch of the game.With this victory, Uruguay are firmly in control of their Copa America destiny. A draw or better against the United States in their final group stage match on Monday will guarantee them top spot in Group C and a place in the quarter-finals. Even a defeat might see them progress, given their superior goal difference.For Bolivia, the loss marks their second in as many games, leaving them with a slim mathematical chance of avoiding a fourth consecutive group stage exit.The match also provided a platform for Uruguay's emerging talents. Darwin Nunez further solidified his position as a key player, netting his 13th international goal.Meanwhile, the legendary Luis Suarez, Uruguay's all-time leading scorer, made a late appearance as a substitute, immediately assuming the captain's armband.","Uruguay beat Bolivia 5-0 in their Copa America Group C encounter at New Jersey's Red Bull Arena.

The 37-year-old emphasized that skipping the prestigious event would not have been the right decision.Djokovic, who is on a quest to match Roger Federer 's record of eight Wimbledon titles and become the oldest champion in the modern era, attributed his participation to his ""incredible desire to play and compete"".The injury occurred during the French Open earlier this month, where Djokovic was compelled to withdraw before his quarter-final match. He subsequently underwent surgery to repair the damaged meniscus in his right knee and has not competed since then.""I do have something that is described as a feeling of not missing out at a Grand Slam while I can still play and while I'm still active and at this level,"" AFP quoted Djokovic as saying.""I wouldn't call it a fear of missing out. I would just say it's this incredible desire to play, just to compete.""Particularly because it is Wimbledon, the tournament that always has been a dream tournament for me when I was a kid. Just the thought of me missing Wimbledon was just not correct. I didn't want to deal with that.""Djokovic finds himself in an unfamiliar position as he sets foot in London for the upcoming tournament. The Serbian player, known for his dominance on the court, has yet to secure a title in the current season.In a surprising turn of events, the young Italian sensation, Jannik Sinner , not only claimed Djokovic's Australian Open title but also dethroned him from the world number one spot. At just 22 years of age, Sinner has emerged as a formidable force in the tennis world.To add to Djokovic's challenges, Carlos Alcaraz , who had previously ended the Serbian's reign at Wimbledon last year, has now achieved another significant milestone. The rising star from Spain recently clinched the French Open title, further solidifying his position as a top contender in the sport.""I'm confident about the health of my knee and just the general physical state is really good,"" said the Serb who is chasing a 25th Grand Slam title.""I haven't had any setbacks. If I had one setback, I would be questioning whether I should be here or not. But I haven't had a single one. Why not give it a shot?""Alcaraz, the young Spanish tennis sensation, has expressed his admiration for Novak Djokovic's remarkable recovery just over three weeks following his knee surgery. Alcaraz referred to the Serbian star as ""superhuman"" on Saturday, acknowledging his incredible resilience and determination.However, Djokovic revealed that his inspiration came from another player, American Taylor Fritz , who underwent a similar knee operation in 2021. Fritz sustained his injury during the French Open and required assistance from a wheelchair to leave the court.Remarkably, Fritz made a swift comeback, returning to action at Wimbledon a mere 21 days after his surgery. Despite the short recovery time, he managed to reach the third round of the prestigious tournament, showcasing his tenacity and dedication to the sport.""I think Taylor Fritz is a superhuman,"" insisted Djokovic.""His situation really gave me optimism that I can make it, too.""Three weeks is just making the cut, so to say. It's not ideal, maybe in the eyes of the doctors and specialists that would normally tell you it's normally between three and six weeks.""But it's also individual. It's very subjective. Everyone has a different response to the recovery.""","Novak Djokovic will play at Wimbledon despite undergoing knee surgery. The Serbian star has not played since the French Open earlier this month.

The German player, currently ranked fourth in the world, made a bold statement on Saturday, asserting that ""this year's showpiece 'is the most open in 20 years'.""Despite never having advanced beyond the fourth round at the All England Club, Zverev sees a unique opportunity in the current landscape of men's tennis.With the absence of some of the sport's biggest names, such as the retired Roger Federer and the resting Rafael Nadal , coupled with the injury concerns surrounding Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray , the 27-year-old anticipates a significant shift in the balance of power at Wimbledon.Zverev's confidence in his own abilities, combined with the perceived vulnerabilities of his rivals, has led him to believe that this year's tournament presents a golden opportunity for him to make a deep run and potentially claim his first Wimbledon title.""I think this is the most open Wimbledon Championship that we maybe had in 20 years in terms of favourites, in terms of potential winners,"" AFP quoted Zverev as saying.""I think there's multiple guys who have a very decent chance of going deep and very decent chance of winning the tournament.""I don't think it has been like that for maybe 20 years since before Roger started playing, right? After Roger came Rafa, Novak, Andy. I really feel it's different this year.""For over two decades, Wimbledon was ruled by a select group of tennis greats. Following Lleyton Hewitt's triumph in 2002, the prestigious tournament witnessed the rise of the 'Big Four'.Roger Federer amassed an impressive eight titles, while Novak Djokovic secured seven. Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray each claimed two victories during this era.However, the 2023 championship match marked a significant shift in the tournament's history. Carlos Alcaraz , a rising star, managed to overcome Djokovic in a thrilling encounter, effectively ending the 'Big Four' dominance that had persisted for so long.As the tournament approaches, both Djokovic and Murray, now 37 years old, find themselves recovering from recent surgeries.Djokovic underwent a procedure on his right knee, while Murray required an operation to remove a cyst from his back.
