NEW DELHI: After the victory against Mumbai Indians in their final fixture of the Indian Premier League 2024, Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul expressed his disappointment with the team's overall performance in the 17th edition of the cash-rich league.Despite the win, LSG ended their season with 14 points from 14 games and were eliminated from the playoffs race.At the post-match interaction, Rahul managed to lighten the mood with a humorous reference to a popular advertisement featuring himself, his father-in-law Suniel Shetty , and Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma .""I'm on my father-in-law's team now. We'll both be cheering for Sharma ji ka beta in the World Cup,"" he quipped, indicating his support for the Rohit-led Indian team in the upcoming T20 World Cup .Reflecting on the season, Rahul stated, ""Very disappointing. At the beginning of the season, I really felt we had a strong team and had most bases covered. A couple of injuries - happen to every team. We didn't play well enough collectively. Today was a really good performance. This is the kind of game we wanted to play more. Unfortunately, we didn't do that.""Rahul praised the hard work and development of LSG's Indian pacers, noting the franchise's significant investment in their training.""Really happy for them. The franchise has invested a lot of time and energy with them. It's not just two months in the year. We sent Mayank and Yudhvir to South Africa to train with Morne Morkel. Hard work for them has paid off, but the franchise and the team have worked a lot with them,"" he said.The 32-year-old also shared insights on his personal journey and future goals.""There's not much T20 cricket coming up now. It's been a season where I've learnt a lot about my own batting and what I need to do to get back in the team. Maybe middle-order, maybe not. We would've ideally wanted him (Pooran) to bat higher, but with how the team's lined up, we want our senior international players to bat in positions where they can absorb pressure. Didn't want our two overseas batters to bat close together,"" Rahul explained.While the season didn't end as hoped for LSG, Rahul's comments highlight both the challenges faced and the valuable lessons learned, as he looks forward to future opportunities in his cricketing career.","Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul expressed his disappointment with the team's overall performance in the 17th edition of the cash-rich league.

MS Dhoni: 'Fans chahte hai aap jyada waqt bitaye pitch me...': Pathan advocates for Dhoni's higher batting position in crucial CSK vs RCB clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/fans-chahte-hai-aap-jyada-waqt-bitaye-pitch-me-pathan-advocates-for-dhonis-higher-batting-position-in-crucial-csk-vs-rcb-clash/articleshow/110221609.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has voiced his support for seeing Mahendra Singh Dhoni bat higher up the order for Chennai Super Kings in their pivotal final league match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Saturday.Pathan believes that Dhoni's current hitting form and the high-scoring nature of the Bengaluru ground make a compelling case for this change.Speaking on Star Sports, Pathan acknowledged the reasons behind Dhoni batting primarily in the final few overs but expressed his hope that Dhoni would entertain his vast fan base by spending more time on the pitch with the bat.""Mahendra Singh Dhoni's batting is not the same as it used to be during his peak, when he was 32-33 years old. Here there is a knee issue; he has been playing for so long and faced many problems along the way. He knows that in the last 2-3 years he hasn't played big innings. He used to come to bat during the 12th-13th over, but he is not now. He has accepted and we should accept it too. But we can only hope,"" Pathan said. ""He is not coming higher up the order to preserve his knee. Still, I want him to bat more with the form he is in.""Highlighting Dhoni's impressive form this season, Pathan added, ""He was not in form the last two seasons. But this year, his hitting form is brilliant. He is striking fast bowlers for sixes over the covers. He has excellent reach this time, and it comes with good fitness and when the knees are in good shape. He is hitting with one hand too and he has always showcased power with his backlift. He is even hitting low full tosses. He won't get a better pitch than Bengaluru. There's no turn and the ground is not big. And the bowling of RCB is also not up to the mark.""Despite Dhoni not being the official captain, Pathan emphasized his leadership role within the team. ""Even though he is not officially captain of the side, still he is one of the leaders of the team. So taking all the situations into account, he should take the responsibility and come to bat up the order,"" Pathan noted.Pathan also highlighted Dhoni's running between the wickets, saying, ""It is not that he is not running for runs. He is running and when two can be scored he runs with the same intensity and looks good. Then why not? You had said that you are playing for the fans, then fans want to see you spend more time on the pitch with the bat [Aapne kaha na ki aap fans ke liye khel rahe hai, woh chahte hai aap jyada waqt bitaye pitch me balle ke saath],"" Pathan concluded.The upcoming clash between RCB and CSK is a high-stakes encounter that will determine the final team to qualify for the IPL playoffs. Thursday's washout in Hyderabad confirmed Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, and Rajasthan Royals as playoff contenders, leaving one spot open for either CSK or RCB.CSK, with 13 points and a net run-rate of 0.528, are favorites due to their superior standings and historical performance at the venue, having lost only once in eight matches against the home side. RCB, with 12 points and a net run-rate of 0.387, face a tougher challenge and must win decisively to secure their playoff spot.Adding to the drama is the forecast of rain, which could result in a washout favoring CSK's playoff chances. RCB will need to win by at least 18 runs or chase their target with about 11 balls to spare to advance, intensifying the pressure on the in-form team that has staged a remarkable comeback with five consecutive wins after a six-match losing streak.",Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has voiced his support for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to bat higher up the order for Chennai Super Kings.

Scottie Scheffler: World No.1 golfer Scottie Scheffler arrested but returns to shine at PGA Championship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/golf/top-stories/world-no-1-golfer-scottie-scheffler-arrested-but-returns-to-shine-at-pga-championship/articleshow/110222493.cms,"Cole Turner of New York wore a t-shirt that had the Louisville Metro Corrections mug shot of Scottie Scheffler.

(With inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: In a series of events as dramatic as any in golf history, world number one Scottie Scheffler was handcuffed and arrested on Friday outside the PGA Championship at Valhalla. The incident occurred after Scheffler allegedly dragged a police officer with his car while trying to navigate around a traffic control outside the tournament venue.Scheffler, 27, was charged with felony assault on a police officer, criminal mischief, reckless driving, and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic.He was detained by Louisville Metro police after driving onto a curb in an attempt to bypass a prior accident at the Valhalla entrance, an accident that tragically resulted in the death of pedestrian John Mills .""My sympathies go out to the family of Mr. Mills. I can't imagine what they're going through,"" Scheffler said.Despite this chaotic ordeal, Scheffler was released and managed to return to the course in time for his second round. Remarkably, he fired a five-under-par 66, positioning himself in a tie for third place early in the second round.""I still feel like my head is spinning a little bit, but I was fortunate to be able to make it back out and play some golf,"" Scheffler said. ""I've kept myself in the tournament now with a pretty chaotic day.""The arrest stemmed from an incident where Scheffler, attempting to navigate around the accident scene, reportedly disobeyed orders to stop his car and accelerated, causing Officer Bryan Gillis to be dragged to the ground. Gillis was hospitalized with pain, bruising, and swelling in his left wrist and knee. An arraignment is set for Tuesday.""I never intended to disregard any of the instructions,"" Scheffler said in a statement before his round. ""My situation will get handled. I can't comment on any of the specifics, but it was just a huge misunderstanding that will get resolved I think fairly quickly.""The PGA of America expressed their condolences for the fatal accident and confirmed their cooperation with local authorities. ""We were devastated to learn that a worker with one of our vendors was tragically struck and killed by a shuttle bus,"" the organization said in a statement. ""This is heartbreaking to all of us involved with the PGA Championship.""Despite his tumultuous start to the day, Scheffler arrived at Valhalla just under an hour before his tee time. He composed himself quickly, heading to the practice range and managing to play a solid round of golf.""I was pretty rattled to say the least,"" Scheffler admitted. ""I was shaking. I would say in shock and in fear. Coming out here and trying to play today was definitely a challenge, but I did my best. It probably took a few holes to feel normal.""Fans showed their support with loud cheers as Scheffler walked onto the course, even sporting T-shirts with his mugshot, which had been posted by the Louisville Metropolitan Department of Corrections after his booking.Tournament leader Xander Schauffele commented on the surreal nature of the situation. ""You felt like it was sort of a prank or something when you see a mugshot of Scottie,"" Schauffele said. ""He's a solid guy and there was no malintent by him to anyone. So hopefully he goes out unscathed. Scottie's a good dude.""Scheffler, who has been on an impressive run with four wins in his past five starts, including the Masters and Heritage last month, continues to be a formidable contender despite the day's disruptions. His resilience was noted by fellow golfer Mark Hubbard, who marveled at Scheffler's performance after such a turbulent morning.""I saw as everybody did the mug shot and the police report,"" Hubbard said. ""Unbelievable that he gets arrested and then goes out and shoots 66.""","Scottie Scheffler charged with felony assault on a police officer, criminal mischief, reckless driving, and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic.

Lucknow Super Giants beat Mumbai Indians by 18 runs after Rohit Sharma's sparkly 68 in IPL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/lucknow-super-giants-beat-mumbai-indians-by-18-runs-after-rohit-sharmas-sparkly-68-in-ipl/articleshow/110217339.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma delivered his best performance of the season in a valiant effort, scoring a blistering 68 off 38 balls, but it wasn't enough to prevent Mumbai Indians (MI) from ending their IPL 2024 campaign on a low note.MI suffered an 18-run defeat to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at home, finishing at 196 for six in pursuit of 215, ultimately placing last in the league for the second time in three years.Despite Rohit's early fireworks, MI's middle-order faltered, losing momentum and failing to capitalize on the strong platform set by their captain. Young talent Naman Dhir showcased his potential with a late half-century, but his effort came too late to change the game's outcome.For LSG, Nicholas Pooran 's explosive 75 off 29 balls, coupled with KL Rahul 's measured 55, propelled them to a formidable total of 214 for 6. This victory moved LSG to the sixth spot in the standings, although their net run rate remained marginally negative at -0.667.The match potentially marked the end of Rohit Sharma's 14-year journey with MI, as rumors swirl about his future with the franchise following Hardik Pandya's controversial appointment as captain. Despite enduring a challenging season, Rohit ended as MI's third-highest run-scorer.Hardik Pandya's captaincy faced significant backlash from fans, who frequently booed him and showed unwavering support for Rohit, their long-time leader.Even during Rohit's outstanding innings, the crowd's ovation quickly turned to hooting when Hardik took the field, underscoring the fans' discontent with the leadership change.Earlier in the game, Pooran's quick-fire innings rescued LSG from a sluggish start. Struggling at 69 for 3 at the halfway mark, his aggressive batting helped LSG recover and post a competitive total, ultimately securing a crucial win.","Rohit Sharma scores 68 as Mumbai Indians finish last in IPL 2024.

His ability to adapt to different playing conditions and his hunger for runs have made him a formidable opponent for any bowling attack.However, there is always someone who nurtures young talent, and according to legendary Sunil Gavaskar, MS Dhoni played a significant role in shaping Kohli into a modern-day great.""When Virat Kohli started his career it was a stop-start career. The fact that MS Dhoni gave him that little extra momentum is why he is the Kohli we see today,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.Both Gavaskar and Kohli were involved in a war of words when the former batter criticized him for his slow strike-rate in the IPL.""If you have a strike rate of 118, you come and face the first ball, and then you get out in the 14th or 15th over and your strike rate is 118 – if you want applause for that, then that's a little bit different,"" Gavaskar had said.Kohli also hit back at the criticism saying: ""Not really, all the people who talk about strike-rates and me not playing spin well are the ones talking about this stuff. For me, it's about winning the games for the team and there's a reason why you've done it for 15 years, you've done this day in and day out, you've won games for your teams, I'm not quite sure that if you haven't been in that situation yourself, to sit and talk about the game in the box. For me, people can talk about their assumptions day in and day out, but those who have done day in and day out, they know what's happening and it's a kind of muscle memory for me now"".Gavaskar believed that such comments were a direct insult to the knowledge of former cricketers who are working as experts.""All these guys talk about, 'oh we don't care about outside noise'. Accha! Then why are you replying to any outside noise or whatever it is. We all played a bit of cricket, not a lot of cricket. We don't have agendas. We speak about what we see. We don't necessarily have any likes and dislikes. Even if we have likes and dislikes, we actually speak on what is happening,"" Gavaskar said.","Virat Kohli is a modern-day great, says Sunil Gavaskar.

Usain Bolt is intimately familiar with life in the fast lane, so it's no wonder he's chosen T20 as his favourite cricket format. This sport runs in his blood, thanks to his father's passionate influence.Bolt, renowned as one of the greatest athletes in history with eight Olympic gold medals, harbored aspirations of becoming a fast bowler during his upbringing in Jamaica.Now, as the ambassador for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup , he's fulfilling his cricketing dreams.""I grew up on cricket. My dad was a massive cricket fan and still is. It is something that I have always in my blood. To actually get to be a part of cricket again as an ambassador, it is wonderful. I never got to live my dream of being a cricketer so to be ambassador of T20 World Cup is wonderful,"" Bolt said while talking to PTI over the phone from New York.In 2017, the world record holder in the prestigious 100m and 200m events, concluded his extraordinary career. Seven years later, his charisma still stands unparalleled.As he made his way towards the makeshift cricket stadium in New York, one of the three T20 World Cup venues on the American mainland and the site for the India-Pakistan clash on June 9, a child-like excitement radiated from him while discussing cricket.His recent months have been filled with global travels for music, football and various other endeavors, leaving him little time to catch live cricket on television, including the ongoing IPL.""I have not been able to watch as much as I would like to but when I get time, I try to catch up on T20s,"" said the 'Lightning Bolt'.Bolt remains exhilarated by speed, which is why he deems T20 as the ultimate format of the game.""T20s for sure... When they started, it was a great idea and still is. It compresses the game because you have to be strong and quick but also be strategic, set a field and get things done quick. To me it combines Test match and one-day together to create the perfect game.""Bolt isn't alone in the Caribbean in being drawn to the shortest format. Elite cricketers from the region are increasingly celebrated for their performances in T20 leagues rather than their contributions to the West Indian team.With the surge in popularity of T20 cricket, Test cricket is under serious threat in the region. Bolt concurs that the future favors the slam-bang format.""I think the T20s and one dayers (ODIs) are still massive in the Caribbean. People actually don't enjoy Test cricket that much. It is all about the speed of the game, big hitters like Andre Russell, so for me that is the direction that is going in (game is going in the Caribbean).""It will bring more people to watch the sport. Because people love excitement. That is the key,"" he said.For the first time, the USA is hosting a global cricket event. Although the sport is currently dominated by South Asian and Caribbean expats, Bolt holds the belief that the local American community will gradually embrace and engage with cricket.""I surely think the game can grow in USA. When you have presence in a country people start gravitating towards it and want to know more about.""Despite his limited free time, Bolt reminisces about watching plenty of cricket while growing up in Jamaica, often alongside his father. He vividly recalls the sight of Wasim Akram dismissing batters with his in-swinging yorkers, a memory that remains etched in his mind.""Over the years, one of my favourites growing up was Wasim Akram because of the in-swinging yorker that he had. Of course, Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose, all these guys that I admired over the years, they were so dominant in their space.""Was there anyone in the Indian team he particularly admired?""Like my father, I always support the West Indies (laughs). But yes, I have also been a Sachin Tendulkar fan. He and Brian Lara were part of my life growing up. It was a great rivalry,"" he said referring to the two legendary batters.Among the current lot, Bolt says ""Kohli is the standout one for sure"".When questioned about the possibility of a cricketer having even a hint of potential as a sprinter, Bolt's showmanship shone through.""We have a running joke right now, me and Chris Gayle; he said actually he can beat me over 100 metres. We are looking to put out a race and see what happens (laughs).""When it comes to speed, I am the best. I don't think there is any cricketer right now that can challenge me (laughs),"" said Bolt.","Usain Bolt is the ambassador for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup. The Jamaican sprinter has chosen T20 as his favourite cricket format. Bolt says cricket runs in his blood, thanks to his father's passionate influence. He believes that Test cricket is under serious threat in the Caribbean.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110171842,imgsize-162636,width-400,resizemode-4/110171842.jpg"

Virat, who has batted with a strike rate of 155.16, including one century and five fifties, is gearing up for the crucial match against the Chennai Super Kings on Saturday, May 18.Ahead of this highly-anticipated and must-win clash between CSK and RCB, Virat was taken by surprise during the latest episode of the RCB Insider Show with Mr.Nags.The conversation started with a witty wordplay by host Mr. Nags, who mentioned the name Sunil. This nearly caught Virat off guard until Mr. Nags quickly clarified with ""Chhetri,"" causing both Virat and the host to burst into laughter.“See Virat, I want to talk about a friend of yours. Not mine but your friend. He said a lot of nice things about you… Sunil"".: “Who?”: “Chhetri"" (Both Virat and host burst into laughter)Virat revealed that Chhetri personally informed him about the retirement decision.: “He (Chhetri) actually messaged me as well, informing me that he is going to do it.

He is a lovely lovely guy.”The conversation between Virat and Mr. Nags humorously referenced the Sunil Gavaskar-Virat saga, which had taken social media by storm after the former cricketer criticised Virat's strike rate.“If you have a strike rate of 118, you come and face the first ball, and then you get out in the 14th or 15th over and your strike rate is 118 – if you want applause for that, then that’s a little bit different,” Gavaskar had said.“We’ve all played a bit of cricket, not a lot of cricket, but we speak about what we see. We don’t necessarily have any likes and dislikes. Even if we have likes or dislikes, we actually speak about what’s happening. So, I would be very disappointed if Star Sports showed this once more because that would be questioning all of us commentators,” Gavaskar had said.In the next match, Virat whacked 92 off 47 balls against Punjab Kings and was awarded Man of the Match.During the post-match presentation, Virat cheekily responded to Gavaskar's comments and said: ""It was important to keep up my strike rate through the innings, so I wanted to take on the momentum,"" Kohli said with a wry smile during the mid-innings interview with the broadcasters.""","Virat Kohli was taken by surprise during the latest episode of the RCB Insider Show.

His statement, ""Depends on where I stand and what I need to do,"" reflects a mindset focused on adaptability and self-awareness.Rahul, who has not been selected in India's T20 World Cup squad, understands that his return to the team is not just about his desire to play but also about being in the right form and fulfilling the team's requirements. Lucknow Super Giants skipper Rahul shared his views after his team handed Mumbai Indians a disappointing 18-run defeat in Mumbai on Friday.The defeat also confirmed Mumbai Indians' last-place finish for the second time in the last three editions, with 2022 iteration being the first.Rahul summed up the LSG's IPL 2024 season as disappointing after leading the team to seven wins and as many losses to finish sixth with 14 points in the standings.""Very disappointing. At the start of the season, I felt we had a very strong season and most bases were covered. Couple of injuries happen to every season and team but the guys who went away dented us a little bit. We didn't play well enough collectively and couldn't come together as much as we wanted to. Today was the kind of game we wanted to play more when the bowlers and batters both came together. Really happy for them (the youngsters), we spent a lot of time and energy with the squad, the support staff and we had sent Mayank and Yudhvir to South Africa to train with Morkel.

It depends on where I stand and what I need to do to get back in the team, I'll think about what the team needs. (Was Pooran batting too low down the order?) Not really, we'd have ideally wanted him to bat higher but how the teams line up is how the international players slot to absorb the pressure.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia cricketer Shane Watson has suggested that the match against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 might be Rohit Sharma 's final game for Mumbai Indians (MI).This speculation follows the appointment of Hardik Pandya as MI's new skipper, which has fueled rumors about Rohit's future with the franchise.Rohit, 37, has been a stalwart for Mumbai Indians, but there are indications that IPL 2024 could be his last season with the team.In this season, Rohit has scored 349 runs at an impressive strike rate of 145.42 across 13 matches. His contributions have been significant, but the leadership change has led to increased speculation about his tenure with MI.As fans and analysts await further developments, the match against LSG will be watched closely, potentially marking the end of an era for Rohit with Mumbai Indians.Speaking at Jio Cinema, Watson said the former MI skipper has been a great leader for Mumbai.""This could be Rohit Sharma's last game for Mumbai Indians. You never know how exactly things will play out after this season but what an incredible player he has been and a leader for the Mumbai Indians. To have so much success with the franchise and him being so entrenched in the Mumbai Indians family,"" Watson said.Watson felt the decision to remove Rohit from the captaincy was a ""wrong call"" since he is a well-respected leader.""But for me personally, I think that was the wrong call. Because he is such a well-respected leader. It just shook-up the team, knowing that they could move on next season potentially and have Hardik Pandya as captain. This could be his swansong for the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium . So, I am sure that he is going to go out on a great note,"" he added.Last year, MI announced that all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who returned to the Mumbai franchise after guiding the Gujarat Titans (GT) to the IPL title in its debut season and the final in the subsequent edition, will lead the franchise in the 2024 edition of the league. Which meant removing Rohit as the skipper, who had led the franchise to five titles since starting his reign in 2013.In November last year, Pandya moved back from Gujarat Titans (GT) to his former franchise as part of a trade between both franchises. The star all-rounder spent two momentous years with GT, spearheading their campaign in the cash-rich league with aplomb. In GT's debut season in 2022, Hardik got them off to a fairytale start, with the team lifting the coveted trophy.The Mumbai-based franchise stands at the bottom of the IPL 2024 standings with eight points. Hardik Pandya's side displayed a sloppy performance in the 17th season of the tournament and won just four games after playing 13 matches.","Former Australia cricketer Shane Watson has suggested that the match against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 might be Rohit Sharma's final game for Mumbai Indians.

NEW DELHI: Nicholas Pooran 's whirlwind 75 compensated for skipper KL Rahul 's steady 55, providing the much-needed impetus for the Lucknow Super Giants to reach an impressive total of 214 for 6 against the Mumbai Indians in an IPL match in Mumbai on Friday.Struggling for momentum on what appeared to be a two-paced wicket at the start, LSG managed only 69 for 3 at the halfway stage. However, Pooran's stunning knock made up for another lackluster Powerplay effort by Rahul, who struggled to adapt his game during the early overs.Mumbai Indians' bowling woes persisted, with skipper Hardik Pandya employing eight different bowling options.Despite this, only seasoned Piyush Chawla (3/29) and newcomer Nuwan Thushara (3/28) managed to make an impact.Pooran's innings was a treat to watch for the spectators, especially for the visiting Trinidad & Tobago's Prime Minister Dr. Keith Rowley, who must have been delighted to see his countryman dominate the opposition bowlers with such ease.His lofted hits to clear the covers as well as powerful pulls on the leg side were equally compelling until Pooran found Suryakumar Yadav grabbing the ball out of thin air at long on in the 17th over.By then, the free-flowing West Indian had already notched up his highest score of the season, hammering eight sixes and five fours for 75 off a mere 29 balls.Pooran's dismissal followed Rahul's exit after their 44-ball stand for 109 runs for the fourth wicket, which gave LSG the platform to push for a total exceeding 200.Pooran's onslaught also debunked the slowness of the pitch - if there was any as made evident by LSG's top order - and Rahul's solidity in tough phases ensured that the visitors did not stumble at any stage in their innings.The LSG skipper did well to not rush into imposing himself on the game despite his side not able to find their feet for a large part of their innings.Rahul forged two crucial partnerships, including 48 runs for second wicket with Marcus Stoinis, and put on 55 off 41 balls with three fours and as many sixes.Ayush Badoni also chipped in with a 10-ball 22, collecting 19 runs off Romario Shepherd in the last over.LSG were off to a rocky start with Devdutt Padikkal dismissed for a first-ball duck. Nuwan Thushara (3/28) swung the ball back into the left-hander who was pinned in front of the wickets and burned a review.But there was no such mistake committed by Stoinis, trapped leg-before at the end of the powerplay by Chawla after the Australian stroked his way to 28 off 22 balls with five fours.Stoinis also used the DRS to perfection when the on-field umpire obliged a passionate appeal for leg-before by Arjun Tendulkar, with the replays confirming that the ball would have passed over the stumps. Tendulkar however was clobbered mercilessly by Pooran and after being hit for back-to-back sixes, the young left-arm seamer was forced to leave the field as he suddenly started suffering from cramps.",Lucknow Super Giants reach 214-6 in IPL match against Mumbai Indians.

As CSK gear up for the showdown against RCB, Bravo's strategic guidance could prove decisive in securing a crucial victory.""You should respect the opposition and RCB rightly so, we respect them.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola has warned that Manchester City cannot take anything for granted as they seek to claim an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title against West Ham on Sunday.City currently lead Arsenal by two points going into the final day of the season, meaning they control their destiny in the title race.Guardiola highlighted the importance of remaining vigilant and focused, recalling the dramatic final day two years ago when City had to come from 2-0 down late on to beat Aston Villa 3-2, securing the title and denying Liverpool .This serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of football and the need for City to maintain their concentration until the very end.In their recent match, City faced a tough challenge from Tottenham, eventually winning 2-0. Despite many Spurs fans wanting their own side to lose to prevent their north London rivals Arsenal from claiming their first title in 20 years, City had to work hard to secure the victory.Guardiola's cautious approach underscores the competitive nature of the Premier League and the necessity for City to give their all in the decisive match against West Ham.""We would like to be 3-0 up after 10 minutes but that's not going to happen,"" Guardiola said at his pre-match press conference on Friday.""I'm ready for it to be a tough, tough game. I want to put in the mind of the players, 'Look at Tottenham, how they fought for every ball'.""It was the same with Aston Villa two years ago -- they were in the same position, they didn't have anything to play for -- and we know what happened.""Our people have to come here and be ready from the first minute, to be with us and do it together.""City are attempting to become the first side in history to win four straight English top-flight titles and are on the brink of a sixth Premier League win in the past seven seasons.Guardiola batted away suggestions that his side do not get the credit they deserve for the scale of those achievements.""I don't know what people think but if you ask all the Premier League teams at the start of the season, they would want to be in our position,"" he said.""We have one game left, destiny in our hands. Win our game and we will be champions.""They (the players) know it is win or win, otherwise Arsenal will be champions.""",Pep Guardiola has warned that Manchester City cannot take anything for granted as they seek to claim an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title.

""In those days, it was common for Kolkata's big clubs to hold trials for aspiring footballers regularly in a move to catch them young. As the head coach of Mohun Bagan 's senior football team, I was privileged to oversee such trials and recommend who would be offered a contract.""There was a diminutive guy playing as a striker in one such trial match and he caught me by surprise when he scored from a bicycle kick. The goal was straight from the page of Shyam Thapa's skill-book. 'Sign him,' I told the club management after seeing that goal,"" the former Mohun Bagan defender and coach recalled.A week later, he was signed on a three-year contract with Mohun Bagan.And this was how Sunil Chhetri 's career as a professional footballer took wing in 2002 on the famed Maidan at the age of 17 years.""He was diminutive, but his spot-jump was excellent, allowing him to beat a defender in the air and score many goals during his time at Mohun Bagan under my coaching,"" Bhattacharya pointed out.After India's World Cup qualifier against Kuwait in Kolkata this June, Chhetri in the India jersey would also be the past.Little did Bhattacharya realize during that pre-season trial in 2002 how the diminutive dynamo would explode in theIndian football landscape in the next couple of decades. Little did the Bagan coach realize that he would one day welcome him as son-in-law.After courting Bhattacharya's daughter Sonam for many years, Chhetri tied the knot with her on Dec 4 in 2017.Although he had represented India in the Asian School Championship in 2001, Chhetri 's main objective was to get admission in Delhi's St Stephen's College through sports quota. But that contract with Mohun Bagan changed his life completely.""I never realized that he would grow into such a legend. As a player, I've got to put Sunil in the class of Chunni Goswami, Balaram and Parimal Dey. His dedication, discipline and hunger should always be an example for the future generation,"" Bhattacharya maintained.And as a son-in-law? Bhattacharya smiled. ""We don't usually talk about football at home. Sunil has taken his game to such a height that I've hardly anything to suggest to him. But I want him to remain involved in the game. It's his call to take,"" the 72-year-old said.",Subrata Bhattacharya was the head coach of Mohun Bagan's senior football team.

It was Sunday, June 12, 2005 in Quetta, Pakistan. Chhetri had played in Pakistan before; just over a year ago he had played for India's Under-23 side in the Islamabad SAF Games, but this was something else altogether.The 21-year-old striker couldn't hide his joy.""It was unbelievable,"" Chhetri recalled on Thursday, almost two decades after that national team debut in 2005. ""I can't tell you how I was feeling. I took my jersey and sprayed some perfume on it. Everything that happened that day once coach told me, from breakfast to lunch, I'll never forget. It's one of my best days on my national team journey.""That journey which started with a goal in front of 20,000 partisan Pakistanis, is special, and one that no footballer has experienced before. It's been 19 years, 150 matches and 94 goals, the scale of his achievements impossible to compute. In a country where cricket is religion, Chhetri won fans and wooed crowds with his dare and discipline.Now, he has decided to call time on his phenomenal international career. The game against Kuwait in Kolkata on June 6, a crucial one where India need a win to make it to the third round of theFIFA World Cup qualifiers for the first time, will be his last.Chhetri's decision, announced on Thursday morning, didn't really raise eyebrows.For some time now, there were calls for him to make way for younger strikers. The goals were drying up too; his last field goal was against Malaysia in October last year and he went six games without scoring, including three in the high-profile AFC Asian Cup 2023.""When the instinct came that this should be my last game, and I thought about it a lot, eventually I came to this decision. Will I be sad, of course. It took time (for this decision) because the kid inside me, he never wants to stop, if given a chance, to play for this country. Never,"" said Chhetri.Chhetri, 39, will end his international career as the most capped player, and the highest Indian international goal scorer, his tally only behind global superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the active players' list.Some of his goals have been jaw dropping: the great run against Kyrgyz Republic from just outside India's own danger zone, the imperious chip over Kenya goalkeeper, the strike to break the Myanmar jinx; the set-piece goal against Oman. And who can forget all the penalties where he was guaranteed to score and lift India's mood.""I am fortunate. So many amazing things have happened, I've practically lived a dream, but nothing comes close to playing for the country. The kid kept fighting and probably in the future will keep fighting inside. But the mature person inside, knows this is it. It wasn't easy.""I think it's time for the country to see the next number nine (forward). It's time we build on it. Already we are a little bit handicapped because a lot of national team boys don't play number nines at their clubs (who prefer foreigners). At least now, when I am not there, I am sure so many will step up and they need time,"" said Chhetri.The next game for India, Chhetri's final one, is among the most crucial.Win against Kuwait and the team makes it to the third round of the World Cup qualifiers for the first time. There's immense pressure on coach Igor Stimac - lose and he's out - besides the players. But the face of Indian football remains calm.""I don't feel the pressure at a time when this game demands pressure,"" said Chhetri.""We need the three points against Kuwait to qualify for the next round. It's hugely important for us. But in a strange and nice way, I don't feel the pressure. I know these 15-20 days of training and the Kuwait game is my last. I am quite certain that I will enjoy.""Fans will have big expectations of Chhetri when he takes the field for India, one final time. A goal against Kuwait and fans will start singing, 'We've got Chhetri, Sunil Chhetri... I just don't think you understand. Oh! when he scores, we go f***ing mad... We've got Sunil Chhetri.'

Apart from national team, we have played together across clubs like JCT, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. Even now we are together at Bengaluru and I think he has another year there,” said an emotional BFC assistant coach.Asked about his message to Chhetri, the former India captain said, “I want him to enjoy his last game, last 90 minutes in national colours.
