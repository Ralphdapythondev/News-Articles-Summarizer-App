'I was so furious that ...': Yuvraj Singh recalls his iconic 6 sixes in 2007 T20 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/i-was-so-furious-that-yuvraj-singh-recalls-his-iconic-6-sixes-in-2007-t20-world-cup/articleshow/111294040.cms,"Inside the mind of Yuvraj Singh: The legend behind famous six sixes | T20WC 2007

NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh 's iconic six sixes still remain fresh in everyone's memory after 17 long years, and the man himself hasn't forgotten an inch of that epic moment when he smacked England pacer Stuart Broad half a dozen times out of the park.While recalling that historic feat in a video interview with ICC , Yuvraj said, ""In the last couple of innings I didn't do well so I was very keen to get out there and get some big hits and some kind of form. It was the 19th over and I had to swing everything.Freddie ( Andrew Flintoff ) bowled two really good balls actually and on the last ball of the 18th over I took a single. (Few words were exchanged between the two of them). And I was just like. I am sorry, what did you say? Obviously I was angry then the umpire came in. Anyways I was furious. I was so furious that I just wanted to hit every ball out of the ground. The first ball went out of the park. I remember hitting this one without even realising how big that hit is.""When the anchor asked Yuvraj that after hitting four sixes to Broad, do you have six sixes in mind at that point? To which he replied after taking a big breath,"" No, I have actually five sixes in my mind since I was hit for five sixes by Dimitri Mascrenahas in the final over of the 2007 Oval ODI. It was very demeaning as well. You don't want to get hit for five sixes. I had been in this place and getting hit for 5 sixes is not a good feeling.I was like Dimitri was standing at deep mid-wicket and Flintoff was at deep square leg. I know where he was standing. Here what happened was Broad actually switched to over the stumps at the last moment. When he did that, in my mind I was like I knew where he was going to bowl. I was ready that it was going to be a full yorker towards my legs, and I just wanted to get my bat on it.""On being nervous before the sixth and final six, Yuvraj said, ""I was not nervous at all. He (Broad) was the one who was nervous as I can see his body language. If you will see there was a smile on my face at that moment, and that smile was for Dimitri. I normally bat at No. 4 and MS Dhoni at No. 4 and after I hit the final six, MS said to me that everytime you come out to bat after me your strike rate is double.The great thing about Freddie is he talked about it after the game and shook hands, and that is why I have a lot of respect for Flintoff. (On Broad) I think that was a big moment of his career because he knew from here on he had to add more variety in his bowling. He just can't come and bowl yorkers. He has to bowl slower balls, bouncers. Obviously he was young and learning as well. And from there on he went on to take 600 Test wickets. I don't think without this moment, he would have ended up with 600 wickets. This moment probably made him work harder and realise how important it is to succeed. Definitely this is the moment that made him a legend.""""Ya, this was one of the iconic moments and I cherish it but if we wouldn't have won the World Cup, it wouldn’t have been that special I guess,"" concluded Yuvraj.Yuvraj's blistering innings came to an end when he was caught at long-on off the penultimate delivery of the final over, having amassed a stunning 58 runs from a mere 16 balls. His explosive performance proved decisive, as India went on to secure a 20-run victory.","Yuvraj Singh hit Stuart Broad for six sixes in the final over of the 2007 Oval ODI.

I don't see any reason why Rohit Sharma can't win the World Cup: Former India World Cup winner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/i-dont-see-any-reason-why-rohit-sharma-cant-win-the-world-cup-former-india-world-cup-winner/articleshow/111290202.cms,"NEW DELHI: It has been a long time since Team India won an ICC trophy. The wait has felt endless.Last year, India had a significant opportunity to claim an ICC trophy on home soil. However, Rohit Sharma 's team fell short in the ODI World Cup final against Australia, missing a crucial chance to add to their elusive collection of trophies.At 36, Rohit is determined to secure an ICC title for India, a feat that has eluded them since their ICC Champions Trophy victory in 2013, came under the leadership of legendary Mahendra Singh Dhoni.India's last T20 World Cup victory was in the inaugural edition in 2007, where Dhoni led the team to a five-run win over Pakistan in the final. This remains India's only title in the tournament's history. Since their 2007 triumph, India have reached the final only once in eight editions, finishing as runners-up in the 2014 tournament in Bangladesh after losing to Sri Lanka by six wickets.Team India has advanced to the semifinals of the T20 World Cup 2024 with an unbeaten streak, including a magnificent win over Australia. They are set to face England in the semis at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Thursday.The last time these two teams met at this stage, it was a one-sided affair as England outplayed an outdated India in the semifinal of the 2022 edition.Can Rohit lead India to an ICC title this time?Former India pacer S Sreesanth, who was part of India's two ICC title wins — the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 ODI World Cup — is confident that the 36-year-old will succeed this time.""Rohit Sharma has all the capabilities of a winning captain. He's got that experience, so I don't see any reason why he can't go all the way and win the World Cup. We spoke about Rashid Khan and how, with brotherhood, he has kept the team as a unit. Similarly, Rohit Sharma has also done it many times in franchise cricket. He knows every player individually,"" Sreesanth, who is a cricket expert and commentator, told TimesofIndia.com on Star Sports Press Room.""We wouldn't be surprised if Rohit Sharma lifts that trophy on 29th June,"" he said.Sreesanth also praised India's all-rounder Hardik Pandya , who has been in outstanding form with both bat and ball in the mega tournament.Despite not having a great season as a player and captain for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL 2024, Pandya has scored 116 runs in 6 matches, averaging 58.00, and has taken 8 wickets in the ongoing T20 World Cup.""Despite the speculations going on throughout the week, in the last press conference, he spoke about Hardik Pandya being a key player in the team. Just like Yuvraj Singh in the 2011 World Cup as an all-rounder with bat, ball, and fielding, I think Hardik Pandya is very much capable of doing that in this World Cup,"" Sreesanth said.","Team India has advanced to the semifinals of the T20 World Cup 2024 with an unbeaten streak, including a magnificent win over Australia.

Robinson conceded an astonishing 43 runs in a single over, setting a new record.Sussex had set a daunting target of 464 runs after declaring their second innings on 296-6. Leicestershire were struggling at 144-6 when Kimber entered the crease and started hitting boundaries, quickly reaching his half-century.During the 59th over, bowled by Robinson, Kimber unleashed a barrage of shots, smashing 'two sixes and six boundaries' while Robinson overstepped three times. In County Cricket, no balls result in a two-run penalty, leading to an expensive nine-ball over, reported Reuters.Kimber reached his century with a boundary, and even when Robinson tried to change his angle by coming around the wicket, the batter remained unstoppable. He broke the record for the most runs scored off an over in the County Championship 's 134-year history.Just two days prior, Shoaib Bashir had conceded 38 runs in an over during a county match between Surrey and Worcestershire. He may be relieved that his England teammate has now taken his place in the record books.Remarkably, Kimber was not even at the crease when the day's play began.

Ex-Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq alleges India tampered with the ball - 'Umpires ko aankhein khuli rakhni chahiye',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/ex-pakistan-captain-inzamam-ul-haq-alleges-india-tampered-with-the-ball-umpires-ko-aanhein-khuli-rakhni-chahiye/articleshow/111273987.cms,"Indian bowler ne cheating ki | inzamam ul haq latest on India vs Australia T20 world cup match

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has sparked a fresh controversy, accusing the Indian team of ball tampering during their T20 World Cup 'Super 8s' game against Australia on Monday.Inzamam's claims came after India's convincing 24-run victory over Australia at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St. Lucia.T20 World Cup: Schedule The 1992 ODI World Cup winner's allegations centre on the unusual reverse swing extracted by left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh , who was brought back for his second spell in the 16th over.Reverse swing typically occurs with an older ball, and Inzamam questioned how the Indian bowlers managed to achieve it with a ball that remains relatively new for the duration of an innings in a T20 game.""When Arshdeep Singh was bowling the 15th over (16th), he was getting reverse swing. With a (relatively) new ball, is it too early to get reverse swing? Was the ball ready for reverse swing by the 12th or 13th over? Because when he came to bowl, the ball started reversing. Umpires ko aankhein khuli rakhni chahiye (the umpires should keep their eyes open),"" Inzamam said while talking on a Pakistani TV channel.India posted a formidable total of 205-5 in their 20 overs, thanks to captain Rohit Sharma 's blistering 92 off 41 balls, and Suryakumar Yadav 's rapid 31. Contributions from Shivam Dube (28) and Hardik Pandya (27 not out) further bolstered India's innings. Australia's bowlers, led by Mitchell Starc (2-45) and Marcus Stoinis (2-56), struggled to contain the Indian batsmen on a batting-friendly pitch.Chasing 206, Australia managed 181-7 in their 20 overs. Travis Head top-scored with 76. However, the Indian bowlers, particularly Arshdeep, who took 3-37, and Kuldeep Yadav , who claimed 2-24, kept the Australian batsmen in check. Jasprit Bumrah and Axar Patel also chipped in with crucial wickets, ensuring India maintained their grip on the match.With a strong all-round performance, India once again showcased their potential as tournament favourites and secured a place in the semi-finals, where they will take on defending champions England on Thursday at the Providence Stadium in Guyana.",Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq accuses India of ball tampering.

'There was one moment where Rohit...': Brad Hogg says Australia weren't prepared for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/there-was-one-moment-where-rohit-brad-hogg-says-australia-werent-prepared-for-india/articleshow/111262588.cms,"NEW DELHI: Brad Hogg criticised the Australian team's lack of preparation for their match against India. Former Australian cricketer specifically pointed out the ineffectiveness of Mitchell Starc , the pace bowler, who struggled to contain Rohit Sharma 's onslaught during the T20 World Cup Super Eights encounter in Saint Lucia.In a remarkable display of batting prowess, Rohit unleashed a blistering 41-ball 92, which included an over where he plundered 29 runs off Starc's bowling. This explosive innings propelled India to an imposing total of 205 runs.India's formidable score proved to be too much for Australia , as they fell short by 24 runs in their chase. With this victory, India secured their place in the semifinals, where they are set to face England in what promises to be an exciting clash.""I thought they weren't prepared. This is a worry with Mitchell Starc. If the ball is not swinging, he doesn't change his length quickly enough. And he didn't change his length quickly enough to Rohit Sharma as well when he got hit for 29 runs there,"" PTI quoted Hogg, a veteran of seven Tests, 123 ODIs and 15 T20Is for Australia, as saying on Star Sports Press Room.""There was one moment where Rohit Sharma came out of the wicket. And then you saw Starc turn around. And I don't know whether he said Rohit's hitting with the wind or there's no swing there. That was a moment where I thought Australia were in a lot of trouble,"" he said in his critical analysis of the former champions.Hogg pointed out that in addition to Rohit's explosive batting performance, the subpar fielding display by the Australian team also played a role in their loss against India.As a consequence of their defeat to India and Afghanistan 's victory over Bangladesh, Australia's journey in the World Cup came to an end, resulting in their elimination from the tournament.""(I knew) They're not going to come back because they were starting just to look at what's going wrong rather than looking for the solutions. So, that's probably where it went wrong.""And also, dropping Hardik Pandya, it was an easy catch there for Mitchell Marsh, the skipper, with a couple of overs to go. And I think Hardik scored 22 off the next 10 balls. You can't afford to drop Hardik Pandya when you've just bought your way back into the game. That was also crucial,"" Hogg said.Hogg, at 53 years old, expressed his belief that South Africa, often labeled as chokers, are finding their rhythm at the crucial stages of the T20 World Cup. He praised Aiden Markram 's team, calling them ""amazing,"" and suggested they have the potential to overcome their historical struggle of never securing an ICC trophy.Despite consistently being considered one of the top contenders in ICC tournaments, South Africa has repeatedly fallen short due to lackluster performances and misfortune. They have yet to claim a title in these prestigious events.In the 2021 T20 World Cup, the Proteas narrowly missed out on a spot in the semifinals, losing the opportunity to England based on a lower net run rate. The 2022 T20 World Cup saw them suffer an unexpected loss against the Netherlands, further extending their disappointing record.But Hogg feels the Proteas have just started to blossom.""They are just spawning from here. It's amazing. I regard (opener Reeza)Hendricks as well, I really like him as a player. And then you've got to build a wall, they can build a nice spin with especially (Heinrich) Klassen. I expect him to do really well against Afghanistan and get to the finals,"" said Hogg.Given their history of strong performances, Hogg is confident that South Africa has what it takes to overcome the challenge posed by Afghanistan and advance to the championship match.""I think it is going to be South Africa and we have got a really strong squad, good spin with (Tabraiz) Shamsi and (Keshav) Maharaj. I don't plan on the big nations now, and I think they'll have to go out there and play it out again instead and just have that confidence to go with the final side.""For me, if I get past that semifinal right, South Africa is going to win the final this year. I just think I've got the team balanced and I've got the aggression as well. I really like Markram as the captain. He is correct and very composed. And I also think, we are going to win as a very well-composed team, not panicking and just setting the right conditions,"" added Hogg.Hogg also slammed the Australian team's fielding performance in their match against Afghanistan during the Super 8s stage. He described their efforts on the field as ""terrible,"" expressing his disappointment with their subpar display.In a stunning turn of events, Afghanistan managed to secure a 21-run victory over Australia, defying expectations. The Afghan team then proceeded to defeat a resilient Bangladesh side, securing their spot in the semifinals. This remarkable achievement sent the people of Afghanistan, a nation afflicted by conflict, into a state of euphoria and celebration.""Australia took Afghanistan too lightly. They rocked up. They weren't at their best. They were terrible in the field. They were terrible with the ball. And at the end of the day, Afghanistan deserved to be there rather than Australia.""Talking about (captain) Mitchell Marsh, he is probably the bro of the team. He's like Andrew Symonds. He has a lot of fun. If there's a little bit of division in the camp, or there's a bit of argy-bargy, he generally lights the load. So, he's that bro. But the other thing is, Pat Cummins probably wasn't a certainty to play in the playing XI of this World Cup,"" he said.","Former Australian cricketer Brad Hogg criticised the Australian team's lack of preparation for their match against India.

We still haven't played our best game yet: South Africa coach Rob Walter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/we-still-havent-played-our-best-game-yet-south-africa-coach-rob-walter/articleshow/111288138.cms,"NEW DELHI: South Africa coach Rob Walter expressed optimism about the team's future prospects, stating that their finest performances are still ahead of them. He emphasized that the squad is not weighed down by previous close defeats and will draw inspiration from their ability to perform well in critical situations as they progress to the T20 World Cup semifinals.South Africa, often considered a formidable underdog, will face Afghanistan in the first semifinal match in Tarouba on Thursday. Afghanistan has made waves in the tournament with their impressive performances, particularly their stunning victory over powerhouse Australia.During the pre-match press conference, when asked if this could be South Africa's moment to shine after navigating through challenging opponents and difficult conditions in recent weeks, Walter responded, ""take confidence,"" indicating the team's belief in their abilities and readiness to seize the opportunity.""Definitely it's always great to dream and I think everyone in South Africa dreams of the time when a trophy gets lifted. No doubt that will happen. Whether it's going to be this week, that remains to be seen.""We're just going to try and play the best game of cricket that we can. And we still haven't played our best game yet,"" PTI quoted Walter as saying to reporters.South Africa's ability to overcome challenging circumstances, a weakness that has plagued them in previous tournaments, is a promising sign for the team as they pursue their first-ever World Cup victory.""From the closeness point of view, yeah, we've managed to get over the line in quite a number of close games in the lead up to the semifinal, which for a team has been great for us.""We've potentially missed out on a few of those moments in the past, and this time around we managed to get over the line. So, we certainly take confidence out of that.""We still want to play our best cricket in the key moments of the game tomorrow.""Since their readmission to international cricket following the apartheid ban, South Africa has consistently found themselves in a challenging position during the crucial semifinals of ICC tournaments. Their journey began with the 1992 World Cup, which marked their return to the global cricketing stage.Needless to say, the subject was broached during the interaction.""Look, I said, the near misses in the past, they belong to the people who missed them. To be honest, this team is a different team. We own whatever is ours to own. And so, our nearest reflection point is this tournament where we've managed to get over the line. So that's what we think about.""Walter didn't attempt to minimise the intensity and anticipation that comes with participating in a World Cup semifinal match.""It's never just another game. I think that sort of rhetoric around semifinals is always untrue, or people trying to downplay the occasion. Certainly, we don't do that. It is a semifinal of a World Cup, and we appreciate that and we're looking forward to it.""Instead, he played down the luck factor.""I don't think you can win a cricket game because of luck. I think potentially a few things can go your way but there's a few things that might not. So, skill will always trump luck, that's for sure. So, I'd like to think that.""Walter commended Afghanistan's remarkable journey to the World Cup semifinals, an unprecedented achievement for the country that has endured years of conflict.""We're seeing Afghanistan in a T20 semifinal. It's awesome for the game of cricket. I love the way they play the game and the way they support it.""How well does he know the Afghanistan team?In today's cricket world, analyzing opposing teams has become a simpler task due to the abundance of technological resources available, remarked Walter.""Look, I mean, a number of their players play in a number of the leagues around the world. In this day and age, there's not too many players where there's no footage or no information about.""So, from an Afghanistan player point of view, we do have that sort of information. We've also got an entire World Cup, which they've also played seven games in.""So, from that point of view, we've had the opportunity to watch games of cricket as near as last night and then also in the different leagues that the guys have played and played together. So, we're comfortable with our knowledge in it.""Walter is wary of the threats Afghanistan could pose in the semifinal.""I think you, yeah, you would have seen it all in the last two days. I think they are a well-rounded team. Gone are the days where there is an area of the team that is not strong. They wouldn't be in a semi-final if that was the case.""You're talking about some world-class spinners. Everyone knows about the world-class spinners led by Rashid Khan . I mean, he's a top-class T20 spinner anywhere in the world. So, we know about that. But as I said, it's not a one-man show anymore. That's for sure,"" Walter said.",South Africa coach Rob Walter expresses optimism about the team's future prospects.

They achieved this feat by defeating Portugal, a team that previously won the Eruo, with a scoreline of 2-0.The victory was primarily orchestrated through an early goal from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and a penalty converted by Georges Mikautadze . Despite facing a Portugal side that fielded many of their reserve players, having already qualified for the next round, this triumph is considered Georgia's most significant achievement since gaining independence in 1991.Georgia's journey to Euro 2024 was not straightforward. After finishing fourth in their qualifying group, they had to navigate through the Euro Nations tournament, where they topped their group before overcoming Greece in a playoff.This backdrop makes their group stage performance and progression to the knockout rounds even more commendable. Under the guidance of Coach Willy Sagnol , a former defender for Bayern Munich and France, Georgia not only advanced but also secured a third-place finish in Group F, setting up a last-16 clash with Spain, a team that has won the Euro tournament three times.The implications of Georgia's victory extend beyond their own achievements. It has also determined the matchups for other teams in the round of 16, with England facing Slovakia, Romania taking on the Netherlands, and Portugal meeting Slovenia. Hungary, who were contenders for advancement, were ultimately eliminated.Georgia's assertive start in the match was highlighted by Kvaratskhelia's goal in the second minute, following a mistake from Portugal's Antonio Silva.Cristiano Ronaldo , despite his efforts and the historical significance of potentially becoming the oldest goal-scorer in Euro tournament history, could not influence the game's outcome.Georgia's defence remained impenetrable, effectively neutralizing Portugal's attempts to score, and their strategy to exploit counter-attacking opportunities was further validated when Silva's foul led to a penalty, confirmed after a VAR review. Mikautadze's successful penalty not only secured the win but also made him the tournament's leading scorer at that point.The match saw Ronaldo, visibly frustrated, receive a booking for dissent and later express his disappointment by kicking a water bottle following his substitution. Georgia's goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili played a crucial role in the final moments to preserve the lead, culminating in jubilant celebrations from the Georgian players and coaching staff at the final whistle, witnessed by thousands of their supporters.","Georgia secured their passage to the knockout stages in what is their inaugural appearance at the European Championship.

Messi may skip Argentina's Copa America game against Peru to rest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/messi-may-skip-argentinas-copa-america-game-against-peru-to-rest/articleshow/111288515.cms,"STAGE SET?

Lionel Messi , who recently celebrated his 37th birthday, might be absent from Argentina 's upcoming Copa America match against Peru due to a thigh injury. The team has already secured a spot in the next round after winning their first two games.During Argentina's narrow 1-0 win over Chile in the tournament hosted by the United States, Messi needed short-term medical attention for his thigh. However, he managed to play the entire game, nearly scoring with a long-range effort that hit the post and being instrumental in Argentina's offensive plays.With Argentina's qualification for the next stage already confirmed, the team may decide to rest Messi against Peru to allow his sore thigh to recover, considering the muscle discomfort he has been experiencing lately.""It bothers me a bit, but I was able to stay on until the end. I hope it's nothing serious ... I wasn't able to move properly because of the bother,"" Reuters quoted Messi , who acknowledged it might be wiser to sit out the Peru game on Saturday.""Let's see how the next few days go, how I recover. We've taken an important step to qualify and be relaxed. It's a lot of games, a lot of travelling,"" added Messi, saying he had also suffered from a sore throat and fever before the Chile game.Argentina, the reigning world champions and top contenders for the Copa America title, have secured a solid start to the tournament, despite not performing at their peak level. Their 2-0 triumph over Canada, coupled with their previous win, has placed them in a commanding position.With six points, Argentina sit atop Group A, while Canada trail behind with three points following their success against Peru.The Argentinian team is relieved to have commenced the Copa with straightforward victories, a stark contrast to their previous major tournament experience.In the World Cup held in Qatar, they suffered a shocking 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in their opening match, which went down as one of the greatest upsets in football history.Lautaro Martinez's late goal at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday helped Messi overcome one of his most difficult career moments at the same venue eight years prior.His missed penalty in the shootout contributed to Argentina's heartbreaking defeat to Chile in the 2016 Copa America final, leaving a devastated Messi pledging to retire from international football following another disappointment with his national team.Lionel Scaloni , the coach, declined to confirm whether he would give Messi a rest against Peru to ensure his fitness for the quarter-finals, but Argentine football pundits presumed he would.Despite achieving numerous accolades at the club level with Barcelona from a young age, it was only in the latter stages of his career that Messi finally succeeded in winning a major international tournament with Argentina, matching Diego Maradona 's godlike status in his football-obsessed homeland.He led Argentina to victory in the previous Copa America in 2021 and the Qatar World Cup in 2022.As fans ponder whether this is his last international tournament, Scaloni has encouraged them to savor watching Messi play rather than speculating about his future plans.The conditions seem to be in place for another potential Messi fairy-tale ending. Brazil, their rivals, are in poor form and could only manage a 0-0 draw with Costa Rica in their opening match, and the Copa final on July 14 will be held in Florida, where Messi plays for Inter Miami .","Lionel Messi may miss Argentina's Copa America match against Peru due to a thigh injury.

After the match, Bopanna told me that he was going to pick me and send an email to the AITA.

Andy Murray a Wimbledon doubt after injury forces him to retire at Queen's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/andy-murray-a-wimbledon-doubt-after-injury-forces-him-to-retire-at-queens/articleshow/111120587.cms,"NEW DELHI: Andy Murray 's second-round match at Queen's came to a premature end on Wednesday when he was forced to retire after just five games due to injury, raising concerns about his potential farewell appearance at Wimbledon , AFP reported.The 37-year-old Murray's hip and right leg appeared to give way following his very first serve of the match against Australia's Jordan Thompson .Despite serving out the game virtually on one leg and holding for 1-2 after dropping the first two games, Murray's condition did not improve.During the changeover, Murray received vigorous treatment on his right hip, which he had replaced in 2019, and his right knee during a medical time-out.Although he returned to play the fourth game, Murray struggled to chase down anything out of reach and served first serves at speeds below 100 mph (160 kph).The official explanation for Murray's retirement at 4-1 down was a back injury . The Scot, who is a two-time Wimbledon champion and five-time Queen's winner, had already shown signs of discomfort during his first-round victory over Alexei Popyrin on Tuesday.As Murray enters what is expected to be his final year on tour, fitness issues continue to plague him, potentially jeopardizing his hopes of making a final appearance at Wimbledon, which is set to begin in less than two weeks.Reflecting on the brief encounter, the 30-year-old Thompson noted, ""I could see he had a problem in the warm-up and then his first serve.""""I thought, 'hit the ball in and make him run'. I actually learned that from him, when he was playing, and if a guy was hurt or cramping or something, he'd always use a drop shot or just try and take it up the line.""He added: ""I learned a lot of things watching him play, so it's an honour to share the court with him, but it's just sad that it ended like that.""","Andy Murray forced to retire after just five games due to injury.

"Not satisfied with Olympics entry, want to win the medal: Sriram Balaji",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/not-satisfied-with-olympics-entry-want-to-win-the-medal-sriram-balaji/articleshow/111120088.cms,"PUNE: It has already been an incredible journey as a professional tennis player for Sriram Balaji .Having started comparatively late at the age of nine in the southern city of Coimbatore, the 34-year-old Balaji is now on the cusp of playing in the Olympics — as Grand Slam champion Rohan Bopanna ’s doubles partner in Paris.Only Nirupama Sanjeev from the city known for its textile and auto industry has wielded the racquet for India at the Summer Games before.Yet, Balaji has come a long way, so much so that he is not ready to be satisfied by simply turning up in India colours, but go all the way and fetch the coveted medal.“Last year I played couple of slams. I did have the game, but was not sharp enough. The last couple of months I have been playing much better tennis. Earlier I would question myself, now I believe in myself much more, my confidence level has gone up. Right now, I am not getting satisfied (with) just making the entry, I want to win the medal,” Balaji, world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles, said.Balaji conceded playing in the Olympics had not been his goal until recently.“It is truly dream come true for me, thanks to Bops (Bopanna). Yuki (Bhambri) is 10 spots ahead of me in rankings,” said Balaji.“When I started, wanted to take it step by step. First the Under-14s (for India), then the Davis Cup. Olympics was not in my thoughts.""The right-hander who began his tennis journey at Perks Tennis School near his home in Coimbatore under the guidance of Elango Ranganathan, whose daughter Madura was a women’s pro.The first major step-up for Balaji was moving to Chennai at the age of 16 and beginning to work Hiten Joshi and Ilyas Hussain.“They (Joshi and Hussain) told me 'don't play juniors' … so I started playing the men’s (circuit). I earned my first ATP ranking point when I was 16. They were the ones who put me on to (Alexander) Waske (in Germany),” he said.Moving base to Europe was another steep learning curve for the Tamil Nadu lad as he had to adapt fast to the difference in culture and tennis.“It was totally different. My ranking was 800 but I was not even getting into qualifying (of ITF men's events),” Balaji said.“That's how tough it was, the standard was very high. It took me one year (to start winning) ... I lost all my matches. I went there in 2010, it was only in 2011 summer that I started getting into qualifying and winning.“It was also mentally very difficult. It makes you think, 'what am I doing here?' I got a lot of help from the coaches and my parents. They never let me down. They pushed me, they believed in me.”Balaji encountered another speed bump a few years later when his game began to stagnate at between 300 and 400 in world rankings. He was at a crossroads and needed to choose his path — continue to pursue success in singles or switch to doubles.“I did have limitations in my game. It was 2017 and I had to make a choice. That was also my best year,” he said of winning nine doubles titles, including his maiden Challenger, with Vishnu Vardhan .The preceding year the duo had won seven ITF titles.“My belief in singles was less. I believed I could get to top-200, but to get inside top-100 ... I could see that I had limitations, and I knew that in doubles I was capable of top-50.“So the choice was whether to go for top-200 in singles or top-20 in doubles. I chose top-20 doubles.”Almost immediately his ambitions suffered a setback as Vardhan decided to stop playing full schedule.“I didn't have a set partner after that. Every four-five weeks I had a different partner. In 2022, I started playing with Jeevan, in 2023 we did well and then he wanted to take a break,” Balaji said.But the tide began to turn when he started forging a partnership last year with Andre Begemann, a 39-year-old German who had ranked 36 in 2015 and won four ATP Tour titles.The Indo-German combination won three Challengers with Balaji getting into the top-100 in rankings for the first time and Begemann returning to the elite bracket too.“Both of us play in the German league, so I knew him already. It is only in the slams I play with a different partner since we don't get in. Otherwise in Challengers I play with Andre,” said Balaji who had beaten Rajeev Ram and Scott Lipsky in the company of Jeeven Nedunchezhiyan at the Chennai ATP Tour event in 2012.Balaji credited the ‘Doubles Dream of India’ programme for supporting the top-200 ranked players in the country.“It makes a lot of difference. Having a coach through the whole year is not affordable, especially with the less prize money in doubles,” he said.“Someone watching from outside can tell you what you cannot absorb when you are playing.“Providing a coach and a trainer during the matches in doubles, you don't find that in many countries. We have eight players in the top-200 ... without this (programme), players would have a lot of struggle.”This year’s French Open was a sort of dress rehearsal for the Olympics tennis competition, which will be held at the Roland Garros.Balaji had made it to the second round last year, and went one step further this year in tandem with Mexican Miguel-Angel Reyes-Varela. The pair lost to none other than Bopanna and Aussie Matthew Ebden.The fortnight proved to be a rewarding one in many ways for the Indian.“I was not in the tournament to begin with, we were sixth out,” Balaji said.“Rohan also has been mentoring me, telling which tournaments I should be playing. This time I told him I want to come to Paris, it's ok if I miss a Challenger.“I decided I was going to take my chances and signed in. The other thing is you also get to practise with the top players during the Grand Slam.“Finally we got in, thanks to the (inclement) weather also, as the singles players pulled out.”The match against the Australian Open winners in the third round was a difficult one but also brought out the best in Balaji and Begemann.“It was not an easy match, it was really hard (to play against Bopanna),” Balaji said.“I look up to him, he is like a mentor to me. I felt I handled it well.”",Sriram Balaji is on the cusp of playing in the Olympics as Rohan Bopanna’s doubles partner in Paris. The 34-year-old is world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles.
