BRIDGETOWN: There’s no time to rest. India had just finished a comprehensive win against Afghanistan at the Kensington Oval on Thursday, but even before they could catch their breath, Rohit Sharma’s boys were on the road again. It’s going to be like this till the end of the World Cup. This time it’s destination Antigua , where they take on neighbours Bangladesh, who haven’t really been a match for India over the years.The pitch at the Vivian Richards Stadium isn’t what it used to be. The pace and bounce that were so integral to cricket in this part of the world is a thing of the past and now it’s only spin, spin and more spin.Quite predictably, India shifted from their four-pacer theory in the USA leg of the World Cup to a three-spin line-up, with Kuldeep Yadav being added to a lineup which already included Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel .Kuldeep took 2-32 against the Afghans after star pacer Jasprit Bumrah had done the early damage. The Indian attack is truly looking very balanced.Bangladesh, too, during the course of their loss to Australia in Antigua in a day-nighter on Thursday, played four spinners. Offies Mahedi Hassan and Mahmadullah will be backed by leggie Rishad Hossain and left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hassan.On paper, Bangladesh have a bit of depth, but that doesn’t count for much in a game against India. Man to man, India’s spinners are better than Bangladesh, the Indian batters’ ability against spin should also stand them in good stead.Suryakumar Yadav is probably the best player of spin in limited-overs cricket and he has been in supreme touch of late, scoring two back-to-back, match-winning half-centuries. Shivam Dube, too, is a monster against spin, and so is Rishabh Pant.Virat Kohli is still due for a big score but batting coach Vikram Rathour seems hardly bothered.“Obviously we want him to score but even when he hasn’t, the others have chipped in, which is a good sign. But Virat stays at the top of the order and we know he will get the runs,” Rathour said.Though there is a quiet confidence about the way India are going about their job, there can always be a worry that complacency may creep into the ranks, especially against a team that isn’t fancied on paper. And the World Cup is being played in such a format that one defeat can suddenly make qualification difficult, especially with the threat of rain always round the corner.While India will be keen not to have a curtailed game — Antigua doesn’t have any rain forecast in the next couple of days — Rathour insisted that the team is taking all measures to ensure they don’t lose focus ahead of a match like this.“We know what we are expected to do and everyone understands that. There is absolutely no option for any kind of complacency,” Rathour said.The fact that Bangladesh have a bit of depth in their spin attack has also kept the Indian management on their toes.“They have some experienced spinners in conditions which are favourable for spin. And they are a good team, there’s a reason why they are in the Super 8,” the batting coach warned.The likes of Shakib, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Liton Das or Mustafizur Rahman have been playing India for a very long time and it is not that they haven’t troubled the Men in Blue on an odd occasion or two, especially in bilateral T20 cricket.Left-arm medium pacer Mustafizur, not too long ago, looked particularly good playing for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL and his cutters may just be effective on a pitch like Antigua’s. Add to that the extra gear that Bangladesh will try to find, especially because it’s India and their survival in the World Cup is on the line. India will have to avoid any possible pitfalls.","India take on Bangladesh in their second T20 of the World Cup in Antigua. The match will be played on a pitch that is more favourable to spin. Bangladesh have a bit of depth in their spin attack, but that doesn’t count for much against India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111180277,imgsize-62912,width-400,resizemode-4/111180277.jpg"
T20 World Cup: Watch out for India's triple left-arm spin threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-watch-out-for-indias-triple-left-arm-spin-threat/articleshow/111180055.cms,"T20 World Cup:

BRIDGETOWN: The overriding theme of this T20 World Cup , from now on, is going to be spin bowling. How teams deal with spin is going to be key. Yes, there’s also a Jasprit Bumrah or a Pat Cummins who are masters of their craft — fast bowling — and can win games in all conditions, but it’s the tweakers who will call the shots.India, in their team selection, have been quite unorthodox, to say the least.Once they landed in the West Indies, they opted to go in with three left-arm spinners, something we don’t always see teams doing.Captain Rohit Sharma has been adamant going into this World Cup — probably his last as captain — he won’t care for reputation and will go with instinct and current form. Hence, it’s Ravindra Jadeja , Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav together, unless of course there are seamer-friendly conditions available, as Rohit pointed out after the win on Thursday.Even though Jadeja, Axar and Kuldeep are left-armers, they are not necessarily the same bowlers. As for Jadeja and Axar, the release points are not the same, because the Gujarat man is taller. So the bounce and the angles that are generated are different and the use of the crease is also not the same.Jadeja comes closer to the stumps while Axar normally prefers to go slightly wider while delivering the ball. Kuldeep, meanwhile, is a wrist-spinner who is a completely different kettle of fish. He is an out-and-out attacking option. Rohit looks to buy wickets with him, even if it is at the cost of a few runs, as was the case against Afghanistan.Axar, who is one of the key components of this attacking formation, explained how they go about their job.“We have played quite a bit together and we communicate well. Whoever comes to bowl first lets the other know what is working and what is not. I think that is very important when you work as a bowling unit,” Axar said.While Kuldeep and Jadeja are the ones who are brought into action after the Powerplay is over, Axar often bowls in the first six overs as well, when nine fielders are inside the ring.“I can bowl in the Powerplay, middle or towards the end, in the 15th or 16th overs. I know my role well and can be called by the captain in any situation. My plan is to know what the team needs at that time — if there is a need for wickets I go for it, if the choice is to defend, I try that,” Axar said.The left-armer explained that with examples from the Pakistan game in New York, where Axar bowled a superb 16th over to turn the game around.“In that game, I felt that if I give less runs in the 16th over, that would be very good for the team. So, basically according to the situation, I plan my bowling,” Axar said.Jadeja is more or less similar, just that his role is slightly more restricted between the 7th and 15th overs. He has been doing it for CSK for a long time now and if he can translate his IPL performances into something similar in the World Cup, India can go from strength to strength.","The overriding theme of this T20 World Cup, from now on, is going to be spin bowling.

NEW DELHI: Wicket-keepers are known to be livewires on the field. One of their unofficial tasks is to cheer up their teammates when the shoulders are down.And Rishabh Pant is known for this. He is quite 'chirpy' behind the stumps and always tends to be over-excited whether asking for a review for going for a catch.And then comes captain Rohit Sharma who is quite laidback in his attitude and tends to take things easily, which reflects in his batting also and even makes his lazy elegance look stylish.A quite hilarious moment occurred during the India-Afghanistan Super 8 T20 World Cup match that India won by 47 runs on Thursday.Kuldeep Yadav bowled the 11th over of the Afghanistan run chase and Gulbadin Naib mishit the second delivery high up in the air over the covers.Pant ran from behind the stumps shouting ""mine, mine"". Rohit who could have also gone for the catch, remained stationed at his position hardly moving an inch.To Pant's credit, he made the catch look simple but he had to cover some distance while keeping his eyes on the ball.And to Rohit's credit, he chose not to disturb Pant in taking the catch and in his typical style seemed to have said, ""All yours"".As Pant completed the catch, he even threw the ball to his skipper who still didn't catch it!The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) shared a video of the moment on their Instagram handle:The Indian cricket team now heads to Antigua to face Bangladesh on Saturday.","Rishabh Pant ran from behind the stumps shouting ""mine, mine"".

Rashid Khan and his lonely quest for excellence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/rashid-khan-and-his-lonely-quest-for-excellence/articleshow/111180591.cms,"T20 WORLD CUP

BRIDGETOWN: There are times you feel for Rashid Khan . Shane Warne used to call him the best modern-day spinner. However, there isn’t enough international success to back up such a claim.Take Thursday’s game, for example. The spinner was outstanding against an Indian batting lineup that is probably the best against spin across the globe. He had figures of 3/26. The wickets in his bag were that of Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant and Shivam Dube, all excellent players of spin. Yet, the first question coach Jonathan Trott and Rashid himself had to face after the defeat was whether the skipper did the right thing by finishing his quota of overs within the 15th over.While Rashid was smiling sitting at the other end of the table, Trott categorically said that “it was definitely not the reason why Afghanistan lost the match”.But that’s the predicament of Rashid in a team like Afghanistan, where he doesn’t always get the support to churn out consistent winning performances. In a way, he at times reminds you of Kapil Dev away from home in the late 1970s and through the 1980s.When Trott was asked about Rashid’s role, the coach’s first reaction was: “How much time do we have? With all great players it’s often what they do off the field, that’s not in front of the cameras. The way they conduct themselves. Rashid is sitting here and he won’t mind me saying, setting high standards for themselves that take others with them and inspire other people is what he does,” Trott said.While Rashid is probably the best spinner playing in this World Cup, the coach insists that he “never stops learning”.“It’s his work ethic, desire, ability to listen and learn, and always wanting to grow and discover, try new deliveries, and push the boundaries of the game,” Trott enlisted the qualities that have made the 25-year-old a global superstar.It’s true that Rashid sets an example for his teammates, but against India it wasn’t enough. There wasn’t enough help either with the bat or ball that could ensure a win for Afghanistan.You could see Rashid was disappointed, but he tried not to blame his younger colleagues, who according to him “are still new to international cricket”.We have seen time and time again, both in the IPL and international cricket , that despite the options Rashid has, he generally sticks to a plan. He was probably slightly frustrated on Thursday about the fact that his teammates were “trying too many things”.“You don’t need to have so many plans, it is about one clear plan and sticking to it. In your desperation to try many things, if you end up giving three extra boundaries, that’s when the pressure starts to build, especially against top sides,” Rashid said.",Afghanistan lost to India in the T20 World Cup on Thursday. Rashid Khan took three wickets for the hosts. The spinner was outstanding against an Indian batting lineup that is probably the best against spin across the globe. Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott insists that Rashid ‘never stops learning’,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111180597,imgsize-31438,width-400,resizemode-4/111180597.jpg"
Pant can be as good as Gilchrist: Smith,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/pant-can-be-as-good-as-gilchrist-smith/articleshow/111179488.cms,"ST LUCIA: Ian Smith is one of New Zealand ’s greatest wicketkeeper batters and has virtually been the voice of cricket of the Trans-Tasman nation. Smith’s commentary during the 2019 World Cup semi-final during India’s ouster and consequently New Zealand’s title triumph are stuff of legends.Smith is part of the commentary team for the ongoing T20 World Cup and when TOI caught up with him at the Bridgetown airport, the famous keeper-batter was effusive in his praise of India’s own little dynamite Rishabh Pant .Smith feels the way Pant is going, in a few years, he can be as good as none other than the GOAT keeper-batter Adam Gilcrhist.“He still has a bit to go, but yes he is a similar type of cricketer to Gilchrist. In Tests, he can bat down the order and in white-ball cricket at the top of the order, so there is similarity with Gilchrist there,” Smith said.The 67-year-old, who was part of Martin Crowe ’s New Zealand team that fell short to Pakistan in the 1992 World Cup semis, is confident that if he continues in the same vein in a few years people “will say Gilchrist and Pant are very close”.When asked who is the best wicketkeeper-batter in the game at the moment, Smith thought for a bit and kept Pant on a par with the likes of Quinton de Kock and Jos Butler .“In white-ball cricket, De Kock is showing good form and is invaluable at the top of the order. Jos Butler is also there, while Pant is a dynamic batsman --- aggressive, dangerous --- and can compliment Virat Kohli orRohit Sharma ,” Smith said.The keeper felt No. 3 is a good spot for Pant, because “best players should have the opportunity to face the most deliveries”. “He can hit the first ball for six he faces…And he has replaced a very good player in KL Rahul, so Pant is really a good player for me.”When asked who his favourite would be to win the World Cup, Smith named both India and Australia. “Both are playing good cricket and they are the favourites for me,” Smith said.",Ian Smith is one of New Zealand ’s greatest wicketkeeper batters.

They maintained their line and length, making it difficult for the English batsmen to score freely on a pitch that offered even bounce and favored the batsmen.

Gautam Gambhir is a very misunderstood person: Ashwin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/gautam-gambhir-is-a-very-misunderstood-person-ashwin/articleshow/111174320.cms,"'Dhoni didn't know someone like me existed'

'Kirsten, an outstanding human being'

NEW DELHI: Veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin praised Gautam Gambhir on Friday, describing him as a tenacious and exceptional motivator. Gambhir is the leading candidate to replace Rahul Dravid as India's head coach. Ashwin credited Gambhir with instilling confidence in him during the early stages of his Test career.The spinner reminisced about his conversations with Gambhir during his debut full series for India, which took place against New Zealand in 2012. ""Gambhir was a fighter,"" Ashwin stated, emphasizing the former opener's role in his development as a cricketer.""I was playing my first full series. I only carried drinks during the first two years before the World Cup (in 2011). He gave me a lot of confidence at the beginning (of his career). I was not used to someone beyond my state (Tamil Nadu) giving me that sort of confidence,"" Ashwin, as quoted by PTI, said while launching his book -- I Have the Streets - A Kutti Cricket Story -- in Chennai.Ashwin expressed his views on the former Indian opener, stating that the cricketer's frank and straightforward manner often led to misinterpretation of his character.""Gautam Gambhir is a very misunderstood person. It's all about perception. He is a fighter.""The biggest issue with many of us is that we give hero status to someone in our mind and forget about everyone else. This is a sport, not a movie narrative.""There are no heroes and villains. Gambhir is a competitor. His desire and hunger to win is unbelievable. I have massive respect (for him),"" he added.Ashwin's rise to prominence in the Indian Premier League (IPL) occurred in 2010 when he was selected to play for the Chennai Super Kings , led by the iconic MS Dhoni . This opportunity proved to be a turning point in Ashwin's career, showcasing his skills on a grand stage.However, Ashwin's journey to the IPL spotlight can be traced back to a pivotal moment in the 2008 Challenger Trophy. It was during this tournament that Ashwin managed to catch the eye of Dhoni, who recognized the young spinner's potential.""It's an evolving relationship. MS didn't even know someone like me existed in 2008,"" he remembered.""And because of that, I made it my life's goal -- from 2009, it was to get the wicket of MS Dhoni. When a person has a goal like this, he will go crazy when an opportunity to achieve it pops up.""Ashwin went back to that final match held in Nagpur.""We were playing the Challenger Trophy, and I bowled an unbelievable spell. MS would struggle through that spell in Nagpur. Once, when he tried to play, the ball went through his gates.""I got him out in the final. From then on, I think he saw somebody with skill, and the relationship matured.""Ashwin revealed that once a player gained Dhoni's confidence, they would receive numerous opportunities to showcase their abilities.""One of MS' usual qualities is that, if he decides this horse (a player) is not ready to race, he will not use you. He needs to know you're a horse.""But, once he knows you're a horse, only when you feel like giving up, he will look past you. That is MS Dhoni; he believes in you,"" he added.Ashwin's contribution to India's historic 2011 World Cup triumph was minimal. However, the Tamil Nadu spinner fondly remembered the inclusive atmosphere created by head coach Gary Kirsten and the entire team, ensuring he never felt left out or unappreciated.""After winning (the WC), Gary called me over and said we have not done justice to your talent. You have waited two years, but make no mistake, take it from me -- you will achieve far greater things, and I am upset that I will not be a part of it,"" he reflected.""So, Gary actually resigned (as head coach) with me first before announcing it outside (laughs). It was surprising for me because in all these two years, Gary actually spoke, maybe, 100 lines to me. Gary was a man of few words and an outstanding human being,"" he added.In fact, Ashwin was used sparingly even in the run-up to that World Cup. He offered a reason for that.""One of the reasons why MS did not play me leading up to the World Cup (2011) was the novelty factor. But eventually, I figured out that they would play me.""I was about to play the match against Pakistan (2nd semifinal in Mohali). But, they decided to opt for an extra fast bowler because there was heavy dew the previous day there,"" he concluded.",Ravichandran Ashwin says Gautam Gambhir is a tenacious and exceptional motivator. The spinner credits the former Indian opener with instilling confidence in him.

Many believe he is the frontrunner to take over from current head coach Rahul Dravid , whose tenure is set to conclude after the ongoing T20 World Cup .Despite his recent success as a team mentor, playing a key role in KKR's third IPL title win, Gambhir refused to comment on his prospects.""I don't see that far ahead. You are grilling me, asking me all tough questions,"" Gambhir, as quoted by PTI, said.""It is difficult to answer right now. All I can say is that I'm happy being here, just finished a brilliant journey (and) let's enjoy that. I'm in a very happy space right now,"" Gambhir said at a 'Rise To Leadership' seminar.Gambhir emphasized that prioritizing the team over individual players forms the foundation of his approach to coaching.""If you have the intent of keeping your team ahead of any individual, things will fall in place. If not today, tomorrow, if not tomorrow, someday it will fall in place,"" he said.""But if you start thinking on that, or if you know that you need to help one or two individuals perform, then your team will only suffer.""""My job is not to make individuals perform. My job, as a mentor, is to make KKR win,"" said Gambhir who was praised all over for his role in KKR's winning run this year.""For me, the guru mantra is team first philosophy. I think team-first ideology, team-first philosophy is the most important ideology in any team sport,"" he added.Gambhir said KKR's near-flawless run in the tournament can be credited to the team's cohesive and leadership-driven environment.""Yes I was the leader but all of us in the dressing room made the change. it was about making Kolkata proud. It was morale responsibility for me to give something back to Kolkata,"" he said.The ex-cricket player, who had the opportunity to lead the Indian team in several matches, emphasized that his philosophy revolves around giving equal treatment to all players within the team.""In a team sport, it's the team that matters the most.

Despite the brevity of his leadership role, he remained content with his contributions to the team during his time at the helm.""I have always thought about performing for the fans, and that has been my thought since the last year of my training career. In the middle, I got this honour of captaining India for six games. I tried doing it to the best of my ability,"" he said.""Otherwise, I have no regrets whatsoever because my job was not to captain the series. My job was to make my country win, and whichever team I play for, make that team win,"" he added.Gambhir does have one regret though.""I wish I had finished that game,"" he said referring to the 2011 World Cup final in which then skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored the winning runs.""It was my job to finish the game, rather than leaving someone to finish the game. If I had to turn back the clock, I would go back there and score the last run, irrespective of how many runs I scored,"" added the left-hander, who scored 97 runs in that epic clash against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium.",Gautam Gambhir refused to comment on his potential appointment as the next head coach of the Indian cricket team. The 42-year-old was speaking at an event organized by the Indian Chambers of Commerce in Kolkata on Friday. Many believe he is the frontrunner to take over from current head coach Rahul Dravid.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111173953,imgsize-22514,width-400,resizemode-4/111173953.jpg"
'Your football is imprisoned': Outgoing coach Igor Stimac tells India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/your-football-is-imprisoned-outgoing-coach-igor-stimac-tells-india/articleshow/111181274.cms,"PANAJI: Igor Stimac isn’t going down without a fight. Sacked earlier this week for a string of disappointing results that started with India finishing as the worst-performing among 24 teams at the AFC Asian Cup — no goals, no point — and missing out on qualification to the next stage of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Stimac said he was planning to resign, even if India had made it to the third round of the qualifiers for the first time.“I had informed some senior players that I have decided to leave, even if India qualified, since it was impossible to work without proper support, just listening to lies,” Stimac told reporters during an online media interaction that lasted for almost two hours on Friday.“Nobody was bothered about the players, everyone (at the All India Football Federation) is more worried about their own personal interests.”For most part, Stimac trained his guns at senior AIFF officials, starting with president Kalyan Chaubey .“Sooner he leaves, Indian football stands a chance,” he roared.Vice president NA Haris was always “entering airports, travelling, not serious enough (about football),” while secretary general M Satyanarayan, he said, astounded him by proposing an Inter-Continental Cup in July, a time when clubs start their preseason.Even the legendary IM Vijayan wasn’t spared. In his words, “a great footballer and legend but not the right person to be chairman of a technical committee.”Then there was the customary stick reserved for FSDL, the body that owns and runs the Indian Super League (ISL), India’s top-tier league.Stimac said the contract between AIFF and FSDL started in good faith but remains questionable.“The league and top tier cannot be run by corporate business,” he said.Handed an extension seven months ago, Stimac was sacked this week after a poor AFC Asian Cup campaign and an even poorer FIFA World Cup qualifying run. The sacking, Stimac suggested, came less than 24 hours after he had told the AIFF that he was negotiating with two potential employers and needed time to resign.“I told (AIFF secretary general) Satya I am negotiating with two parties for jobs in the future, so until the end of the month, I will accept one of the offers and you won’t have to pay more than one (month’s) salary. The next day I received the termination letter on email. I could not believe it. This happened only half a day after telling him to be patient and not get influenced with social media,” said Stimac.A bronze medal winner at the FIFA World Cup in 1998 with Croatia, Stimac got the India job in 2019 after convincing the technical committee that he could help Indian footballers punch above their weight. Five years later, while India are playing more attractive football and won a record three trophies last year, the Croat is leaving with a bitter taste in his mouth.“I came here with open arms, but your football is imprisoned. Without the law being changed and allowing PIO players to represent India, nothing will change. It’s a slow process. Will take another two decades or so to make progress,” said Stimac.The AIFF has started the process to look for Stimac’s successor. On the first day itself, there were 45 applications from coaches across the world. But given the negative publicity surrounding the sport here, Stimac felt the job wouldn’t attract bigger profiles.“The new coach will know immediately (what awaits him),” he said. “You cannot get a big-name coach. Everyone knows what kind of things we deal with in Indian football. How we operate, you might get someone who is desperate for a job. Don’t think there will be any success.”Asked what he would have done differently during his fiveyear tenure, Stimac said he should have resigned after the SAFF Championship in July last year, winning his third trophy of the year.“I shouldn’t have trusted these people,” said Stimac. “After winning three trophies in 2023, I had huge support among the media and fans. As much as they wanted me out, they could do nothing. The only way they knew of running was through social media. They don’t care about other things. It’s a wrong approach to run any serious institution.”","Igor Stimac says he was planning to resign even if India had made it to the third round of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers for the first time. Stimac trained his guns at senior AIFF officials, starting with president Kalyan Chaubey. “Sooner he leaves, Indian football stands a chance,” he roared.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111181279,imgsize-41714,width-400,resizemode-4/111181279.jpg"

Poland managed to equalize through Krzysztof Piatek, who skillfully found the net after a rebound.However, Austria regained control in the second half with goals from Christoph Baumgartner and Marko Arnautovic , the latter converting a penalty, securing the win for Austria.This match was of particular interest given the geographical proximity of Austria and Poland to the host nation, Germany, contributing to a sold-out Olympiastadion and a vibrant atmosphere.Despite Poland's efforts and the introduction of Lewandowski in the second half, Austria's performance under the guidance of coachRalf Rangnick was too strong, with Baumgartner praising Rangnick for his motivational support.Elsewhere, in Group E, Ukraine secured a 2-1 victory over Slovakia, moving them into second place ahead of their next match. The results of these matches are pivotal, shaping the path to the knockout stages for the competing teams.Austria's win places them in a favourable position ahead of their final group match against the Netherlands in Berlin, while Poland face a challenging game against France, with their chances of advancement hanging in the balance.

Coach Roberto Martinez has confirmed Ronaldo's participation in the upcoming match, emphasizing his enduring value to the team.Martinez highlighted Ronaldo's experience, tactical awareness, goal-scoring prowess, and ability to create space as key assets.""I think what's important is to understand what a player brings. For us, Cristiano brings the experience, brings the know-how, brings the goal-scoring opportunities, the movement in the box, the opportunity to open up space If you want to analyse the stats in terms of the physical side, well you need to look at what he's done in the last 12 months,"" Martinez said, as quoted by AFP.""Cristiano is in the national team of Portugal because he deserves to be, and all the physical stats just back that he can play every four days,"" the coach added.Ronaldo's recent form supports Martinez's assessment. He has an impressive scoring record for both club and country, netting 44 goals in 45 appearances for Al Nassr and seven goals in seven international matches leading up to the Euros.However, Ronaldo's performance in Portugal's opening 2-1 victory against the Czech Republic, where he failed to score despite playing the full match, raises questions about his effectiveness within the team's current tactical framework. While his overall contribution might be valuable, his ability to convert chances and be the decisive factor in crucial games requires further scrutiny.Looking at Portugal's qualification prospects, they currently trail group leaders Turkey on goal difference. A victory against Turkey in Dortmund, coupled with a Czech Republic win or draw against Georgia in Hamburg, would secure Portugal's place in the Euro 2024 knock-outs.","Cristiano Ronaldo will play for Portugal against Turkey in Euro 2024 qualifier.

After a subdued first half, they responded with vigour, levelling the score in the 54th minute through Mykola Shaparenko .

All words, no action

NEW DELHI: Ousted India football coach Igor Stimac launched a scathing attack on AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey on Friday. Stimac, who was sacked from his position on Monday following the team's inability to advance to the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers , stated that the sooner Chaubey steps down from his role, the better it will be for the future of football in India, where the sport is not progressing at all.The Croatian coach had earlier threatened to take legal action against the AIFF in the FIFA Tribunal if his outstanding payments were not settled within 10 days of his dismissal.During an extensive online press conference, Stimac expressed his frustration with the current state of Indian football, describing it as ""imprisoned."" He held Chaubey responsible for a significant portion of the issues plaguing the sport in the country.Furthermore, Stimac revealed that he had grown ""fed up of the lies and unfulfilled promises"" throughout his tenure as the head coach of the Indian national team.""The sooner Kalyan Chaubey leaves AIFF, the better it is for Indian football,"" Stimac said as quoted by PTI.""Kalyan only cares about being popular - recent media meets shows that. You say he is a politician, no one knows him even in Kolkata. We need someone strong, influential and with backing to lead Indian football.""Kalyan's priority is to increase clicks on social media and get photographed with famous players instead of thinking about the wellbeing of Indian football.""Football is the most popular sport in the world, but India is the only place where football is not growing,"" he added.Stimac's tenure as the head coach came to an end shortly after the team's loss to Qatar in the concluding match of the World Cup Qualifiers' second round. The AIFF decided to terminate Stimac's contract, which had begun in March 2019 when he replaced Stephen Constantine.In addition to his dismissal, the forthright coach also criticized IM Vijayan , a legendary figure in Indian football who currently serves as the head of the AIFF Technical Committee.Stimac expressed his belief that Vijayan is not suitable for the position he holds within the organization.""IM Vijayan was a fantastic player but he is not the person to head the national federation's technical committee,"" he said.Stimac recently revealed that his dismissal from the position was a first in his coaching career. The Croatian tactician, who represented his nation during their successful campaign at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where they secured the bronze medal, expressed his surprise at the decision.""It was impossible for me to continue without enough support, I was fed up of the lies, the unfulfilled promises and being surrounded by people who are only thinking about their own interests,"" Stimac said from Croatia.The 56-year-old Stimac disclosed that he received an ultimatum from the AIFF prior to the Asian Cup. The reason for this warning was his attempt to persuade the federation about the significance of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers.The coach further mentioned that as a consequence of the meeting, he had to be hospitalized and undergo a surgical procedure to address a cardiac issue.""I was disturbed with everything going on; stressed from the obvious problems. I had an immediate surgery on my heart. I wasn't ready to speak to anyone or find excuses.""I was ready to put myself on the line to prepare my team for the Asian Cup to give the best shot,"" Stimac said.The AIFF decided to end Stimac's tenure as the head coach of the Indian national team. This decision was made after the team's disappointing performances in recent matches. However, Stimac criticized the federation, claiming that the AIFF president did not seek his input when scheduling the team's fixtures.Furthermore, Stimac highlighted a lack of trust and cooperation between the AIFF and the Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), the federation's commercial partners responsible for organizing the Indian Super League , India's premier football competition.""I was very angry with them (AIFF) at that time. I said to them either we separate our ways or they show the trust. They only care about what's there on social media. They are are not concerned about other things.""These new guys (the dispensation under Chaubey) who entered the football house, know nothing about football.""Stimac expressed his concerns about the lack of a well-defined framework and consistency within Indian football, attributing the issues to the AIFF.The coach also mentioned that the situation was more favorable when Shaji Prabhakaran, the former secretary general, was responsible for overseeing the daily operations of Indian football. Prabhakaran was terminated by the AIFF due to 'breach of trust' in November of the previous year.""I was told that Shaji would take over and that was nice. Contract renewal happened on October 2-3. I was invited to check the draft of the contract and I saw that things were fine with my contract.""But what happened next was that Shaji was removed from office and after that everything went quiet. There was no word on anything.""""My staff was working mostly without any compensation, team manager was working without any sleep, managing multiple teams knowing that we are not going to get enough time for preparation.""Stimac expressed his dissatisfaction with the lack of modern football technology available to his support staff, which is commonly utilized by teams globally.""We were working without GPS equipment, without VO camera, which I asked for long back to analyse our training session. I also told them if you have problem with budget I would do it, but it was not allowed, and AIFF also didn't do.""Throughout we were renting match analysts from Goa...we were in fact stealing the platforms from Goa FC, that's how we were working.""When the new set of office-bearers took charge of AIFF two years ago, Stimac said he was told that his contract would not be renewed if the team failed to make the quarterfinals of Asian Cup.""...it was clear that these people don't favour my work, they have a different idea but I wanted to do my work with as much support as possible,"" he said.","Ousted India football coach Igor Stimac launched a scathing attack on AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey on Friday.

Andy Murray a Wimbledon doubt after injury forces him to retire at Queen's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/andy-murray-a-wimbledon-doubt-after-injury-forces-him-to-retire-at-queens/articleshow/111120587.cms,"NEW DELHI: Andy Murray 's second-round match at Queen's came to a premature end on Wednesday when he was forced to retire after just five games due to injury, raising concerns about his potential farewell appearance at Wimbledon , AFP reported.The 37-year-old Murray's hip and right leg appeared to give way following his very first serve of the match against Australia's Jordan Thompson .Despite serving out the game virtually on one leg and holding for 1-2 after dropping the first two games, Murray's condition did not improve.During the changeover, Murray received vigorous treatment on his right hip, which he had replaced in 2019, and his right knee during a medical time-out.Although he returned to play the fourth game, Murray struggled to chase down anything out of reach and served first serves at speeds below 100 mph (160 kph).The official explanation for Murray's retirement at 4-1 down was a back injury . The Scot, who is a two-time Wimbledon champion and five-time Queen's winner, had already shown signs of discomfort during his first-round victory over Alexei Popyrin on Tuesday.As Murray enters what is expected to be his final year on tour, fitness issues continue to plague him, potentially jeopardizing his hopes of making a final appearance at Wimbledon, which is set to begin in less than two weeks.Reflecting on the brief encounter, the 30-year-old Thompson noted, ""I could see he had a problem in the warm-up and then his first serve.""""I thought, 'hit the ball in and make him run'. I actually learned that from him, when he was playing, and if a guy was hurt or cramping or something, he'd always use a drop shot or just try and take it up the line.""He added: ""I learned a lot of things watching him play, so it's an honour to share the court with him, but it's just sad that it ended like that.""","Andy Murray forced to retire after just five games due to injury.

"Not satisfied with Olympics entry, want to win the medal: Sriram Balaji",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/not-satisfied-with-olympics-entry-want-to-win-the-medal-sriram-balaji/articleshow/111120088.cms,"PUNE: It has already been an incredible journey as a professional tennis player for Sriram Balaji .Having started comparatively late at the age of nine in the southern city of Coimbatore, the 34-year-old Balaji is now on the cusp of playing in the Olympics — as Grand Slam champion Rohan Bopanna ’s doubles partner in Paris.Only Nirupama Sanjeev from the city known for its textile and auto industry has wielded the racquet for India at the Summer Games before.Yet, Balaji has come a long way, so much so that he is not ready to be satisfied by simply turning up in India colours, but go all the way and fetch the coveted medal.“Last year I played couple of slams. I did have the game, but was not sharp enough. The last couple of months I have been playing much better tennis. Earlier I would question myself, now I believe in myself much more, my confidence level has gone up. Right now, I am not getting satisfied (with) just making the entry, I want to win the medal,” Balaji, world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles, said.Balaji conceded playing in the Olympics had not been his goal until recently.“It is truly dream come true for me, thanks to Bops (Bopanna). Yuki (Bhambri) is 10 spots ahead of me in rankings,” said Balaji.“When I started, wanted to take it step by step. First the Under-14s (for India), then the Davis Cup. Olympics was not in my thoughts.""The right-hander who began his tennis journey at Perks Tennis School near his home in Coimbatore under the guidance of Elango Ranganathan, whose daughter Madura was a women’s pro.The first major step-up for Balaji was moving to Chennai at the age of 16 and beginning to work Hiten Joshi and Ilyas Hussain.“They (Joshi and Hussain) told me 'don't play juniors' … so I started playing the men’s (circuit). I earned my first ATP ranking point when I was 16. They were the ones who put me on to (Alexander) Waske (in Germany),” he said.Moving base to Europe was another steep learning curve for the Tamil Nadu lad as he had to adapt fast to the difference in culture and tennis.“It was totally different. My ranking was 800 but I was not even getting into qualifying (of ITF men's events),” Balaji said.“That's how tough it was, the standard was very high. It took me one year (to start winning) ... I lost all my matches. I went there in 2010, it was only in 2011 summer that I started getting into qualifying and winning.“It was also mentally very difficult. It makes you think, 'what am I doing here?' I got a lot of help from the coaches and my parents. They never let me down. They pushed me, they believed in me.”Balaji encountered another speed bump a few years later when his game began to stagnate at between 300 and 400 in world rankings. He was at a crossroads and needed to choose his path — continue to pursue success in singles or switch to doubles.“I did have limitations in my game. It was 2017 and I had to make a choice. That was also my best year,” he said of winning nine doubles titles, including his maiden Challenger, with Vishnu Vardhan .The preceding year the duo had won seven ITF titles.“My belief in singles was less. I believed I could get to top-200, but to get inside top-100 ... I could see that I had limitations, and I knew that in doubles I was capable of top-50.“So the choice was whether to go for top-200 in singles or top-20 in doubles. I chose top-20 doubles.”Almost immediately his ambitions suffered a setback as Vardhan decided to stop playing full schedule.“I didn't have a set partner after that. Every four-five weeks I had a different partner. In 2022, I started playing with Jeevan, in 2023 we did well and then he wanted to take a break,” Balaji said.But the tide began to turn when he started forging a partnership last year with Andre Begemann, a 39-year-old German who had ranked 36 in 2015 and won four ATP Tour titles.The Indo-German combination won three Challengers with Balaji getting into the top-100 in rankings for the first time and Begemann returning to the elite bracket too.“Both of us play in the German league, so I knew him already. It is only in the slams I play with a different partner since we don't get in. Otherwise in Challengers I play with Andre,” said Balaji who had beaten Rajeev Ram and Scott Lipsky in the company of Jeeven Nedunchezhiyan at the Chennai ATP Tour event in 2012.Balaji credited the ‘Doubles Dream of India’ programme for supporting the top-200 ranked players in the country.“It makes a lot of difference. Having a coach through the whole year is not affordable, especially with the less prize money in doubles,” he said.“Someone watching from outside can tell you what you cannot absorb when you are playing.“Providing a coach and a trainer during the matches in doubles, you don't find that in many countries. We have eight players in the top-200 ... without this (programme), players would have a lot of struggle.”This year’s French Open was a sort of dress rehearsal for the Olympics tennis competition, which will be held at the Roland Garros.Balaji had made it to the second round last year, and went one step further this year in tandem with Mexican Miguel-Angel Reyes-Varela. The pair lost to none other than Bopanna and Aussie Matthew Ebden.The fortnight proved to be a rewarding one in many ways for the Indian.“I was not in the tournament to begin with, we were sixth out,” Balaji said.“Rohan also has been mentoring me, telling which tournaments I should be playing. This time I told him I want to come to Paris, it's ok if I miss a Challenger.“I decided I was going to take my chances and signed in. The other thing is you also get to practise with the top players during the Grand Slam.“Finally we got in, thanks to the (inclement) weather also, as the singles players pulled out.”The match against the Australian Open winners in the third round was a difficult one but also brought out the best in Balaji and Begemann.“It was not an easy match, it was really hard (to play against Bopanna),” Balaji said.“I look up to him, he is like a mentor to me. I felt I handled it well.”",Sriram Balaji is on the cusp of playing in the Olympics as Rohan Bopanna’s doubles partner in Paris. The 34-year-old is world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles.
