In short:

How we calculate the chances

With 12 games left to be played in the league stage of IPL 2024, there remain nearly 4,100 possible combinations of match results. No one is yet certain of making the playoffs , but two teams ( MI and PBKS) are totally ruled out.We look at the chances of each team:The team currently topping the table have a 36% chance of finishing the sole toppers and they could do that even with just one win from their remaining three games.Their chances of finishing joint toppers on points are an impressive 62.5%. Yet, they are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied fourth with DC or LSG depending on results in other games. But there's just a 0.4% chance of such a scenario.Like KKR, they have a 36% chance of being sole toppers at the end of the league phase and a 62.5% chance of being at least tied for the first spot on points. Yet, they too are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied fourth with DC or LSG depending on results in other games. But again, there's just a 0.4% chance of such a scenario.Currently in third place, SRH have nearly 94% chance of finishing among the top four in terms of points. The best they can hope for is a joint first spot with one to three other teams and the chances of that are a little under 5%.Fourth-placed CSK have a little over 73% chance of finishing within the top four slots either singly or jointly. Like SRH, the best they can do is tied for top spot with one to three other teams. And the chances of that are a mere 4%.Lying in fifth place at the moment, DC have no chance of finishing the toppers or even joint toppers. Their chances of ending up among the top four singly or jointly are just under 50%. Their best case scenario is joint second on points and there's a little under 4% chance of that happening.At the moment in sixth place, LSG's chances of making the top four singly or jointly are just under 50%. Like DC, the best they can do is tie for the second spot with one to three other teams. The chances of that happening are just under 4%.Despite Thursday's win, RCB remain in seventh place and the best they can hope for is tied third or fourth. The win, however, upped the chances of that from around 8% to over 16%.The title holders find themselves at the bottom of the table and their chances of progressing are slim at a little under 8%.Thursday's loss to RCB has effectively ended Punjab's 2024 campaign as they can no longer make it to the last four. Even the chances of a joint fifth spot are a lowly 0.3%.MI were already out of the playoffs. They too can at best end up joint 5th and even that is just a 0.6% chance.Bet on KKR and RR making the playoffs to be joined by two out of CSK, SRH, LSG and DC, with the first two having a distinctly better chance. For RCB or GT to get into the mix would need much to go their way.With 12 games remaining, there remain 4,096 possible combinations of match outcomes. We look at each one of those and what it would mean in terms of the final rankings of the teams. Then we work out the percentage of outcomes that would give team ""A"" a chance of finishing in the top four, or the first spot and so on. The underlying assumption is that any given match is a 50-50 game, not unreasonable given how the IPL has unfolded this year and in other years. For instance, of the 4,096 combinations, SRH finish among the top four slots singly or jointly in 3,840 combinations, which means a 93.8% chance of making the top four spots singly or jointly.","With 12 games left to be played in the league stage of IPL 2024, there remain nearly 4,100 possible combinations of match results.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming has shed light on the team's approach towards managing the fitness of former skipper MS Dhoni in the lead-up to their upcoming encounter against Gujarat Titans in the ongoing Indian Premier League 2024.Addressing concerns over Dhoni's physical condition, Fleming emphasized the cautious stance adopted by the team management, acknowledging the immense value Dhoni brings to the squad.Despite Dhoni's lower position in the batting order, Fleming urged against underestimating his impact, citing his proficiency in scoring boundaries and his prowess behind the stumps.""Like just hitting sixes and fours, which he has done pretty well. And keep as well as some of the best in the competition if not the best in the competition. So don't underestimate his influence on the team just because he comes in at No. 9. There's a timing aspect, but we're very wary of what he can give us. And we'll max that out,"" Fleming told ESPNcricinfo.Fleming stressed the delicate balance between maximizing Dhoni's contributions and ensuring his fitness remains intact to avoid any risk of injury.""But we don't want to max that out where we lose him. So it's a delicate balance, but trust me, his best interest is with us, and his interest [is] in performing well for us is still very high,"" he explained, underscoring Dhoni's continued commitment to performing at his best for the franchise.Assuring fans about Dhoni's well-being, Fleming reassured, ""To put the nation at ease - he's okay.""Currently, CSK occupy the fourth position in the IPL 2024 standings, having secured 12 points from six victories out of 11 matches played, with a commendable net run rate of +0.700.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar delivered impressive fifties before the bowlers shone, helping Royal Challengers Bengaluru keep their playoff hopes alive with a dominant 60-run victory over Punjab Kings in the IPL on Thursday.Kohli's 47-ball 92 was the foundation of RCB's innings, as he excelled in two partnerships: 72 runs off 32 balls with Patidar (55 off 23 balls) and 92 runs off 46 balls with Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls), propelling RCB to 241/7.In response, Rilee Rossouw dazzled with a 27-ball 61, but Karn Sharma's twin breakthroughs sparked a collapse as PBKS were bowled out for 181 in 17 overs.This marked RCB's fourth consecutive win, bringing them to 10 points, while PBKS were eliminated from the playoff race with 8 points, as they can only reach a maximum of 12 points from their remaining two games.Swapnil Singh (2/28), Karn (2/36) and Lockie Ferguson (2/29) took two each, while Mohammed Siraj (3/43) claimed three wickets for RCB.Chasing a stiff target, PBKS lost Prabhsimran Singh (6) early but Rossouw looked unstoppable as left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh was carted for two fours before Siraj was belted for three fours and a six.Yash Dayal and Ferguson were then hit for 16 and 14 runs by Jonny Bairstow (27) and Rossouw as PBKS scored 75 runs in six overs.Once Bairstow was removed by Ferguson, Rossouw turned his attention on Green, blasting two fours and a six on way to his fifty off 21 balls.Jitesh Sharma was then cleaned up by Karn, while Swapnil got rid of Liam Livingstone (0) as Punjab slipped to 126 for 5 in 12th over.They couldn't recover from those blows and it was all over when Shashank Singh (37), Sam Curran (22) and Ashutosh Sharma (8) returned to the dugout.Earlier, Kohli, who was dropped on 0 and 10, timed the ball nicely, used his feet and wrists to bring up his sixth IPL fifty this season. He reached his mark in 32 balls, before slamming another 40 in his next 15 balls. He cracked seven fours and six maximums.Patidar, who was also given two lives, provided the early momentum as he slammed six maximums and three fours during his 23-ball 55.After Patidar's dismissal, Kohli and Green continued the onslaught to take RCB past the 200-mark. Green hit five fours and a six before being caught in the final ball as RCB scored 77 in last five overs.Pacer Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/36) picked up two wickets in the powerplay on his IPL debut but his figures could have been much better had the fielders not dropped three catches off his bowling.Kohli was dropped in the third ball but Kaverappa dismissed Faf du Plessis (9) and removed Will Jacks (12) but PBKS couldn't create pressure as Sam Curran (1/50) and Harshal Patel (3/38) leaked runs.Patel, who had dropped Patidar, conceded three boundaries in his first over as RCB scored 56 in the powerplay.It started raining sixes thereafter as Kohli and Patidar slammed a maximum each to spoil Kaverappa's bowling figures.Patidar then creamed spinner Rahul Chahar for three mighty maximums before depositing Arshdeep and Sam Curran for two more sixes, the last one bringing up his fifty in 21 balls.With Patidar on fire, RCB crossed 100 in the ninth over. Curran, however, got rid of Patidar in the 10th over, when rain halted play for a brief while.After resumption, Kohli completed his fifty and hit Livingstone for two fours.Green brought up the 150 with a four off Patel. Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum. He sent one over long-on for another maximum.Dinesh Karthik (18) played a cameo before Patel claimed three wickets in last over.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by 60 runs in IPL. Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar hit fifties before bowlers shone for RCB. Rilee Rossouw dazzled with a 27-ball 61 for Punjab Kings.

Undoubtedly Virat Kohli had a lucky day on the crease in the IPL on Thursday, but the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) icon, who was dropped twice before playing a sensational knock, made the most of it and Punjab Kings paid a heavy price for their lapses on the field.Punjab could have dismissed Kohli without scoring and then on 10, but missed both the opportunities and the RCB opener sparkled to produced 92 runs off just 47 balls, including 6 sixes and 7 fours.Kohli's knock powered RCB to a mammoth 241 for 7, as Rajat Patidar (55 off 23 balls) and Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls) kept the momentum in the middle overs and towards the end. The RCB bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj's 3 for 43, then bowled out Punjab for 181 to complete a 60-run triumph. Swapnil Singh, Lockie Ferguson and Karn Sharma took two wickets each.After the win, 'Player of the Match' Kohli explained how he has re-introduced the slog-sweep in his game to counter spinners -- something he did against Gujarat Titans' spinners, before using it against Punjab's Rahul Chahar and Liam Livingstone on Thursday.""I brought out the slog-sweep against the spinners. I didn't practice it, I know I can hit it as I have done in the past. I am always looking to expose that side of the field against spin. I know I need to take risks, it needs a bit of conviction. I have been managing to stay ahead of that thought and trying to keep up with the strike rate for me and the team,"" said Kohli at the post-match presentation ceremony.Orange Cap-holder Kohli now has 634 runs in 12 innings, becoming only the second batsman after KL Rahul to score 600-plus runs in four IPL seasons.Kohli's strike rate, which is 153.51 after 12 innings so far in this IPL season, had been questioned earlier. Hinting towards that, Kohli remarked that for him it's ""still quality over quantity'.""Still quality over quantity, more so at this stage of my career. Understading your game over so many years allows you to practise but still stay switched on and still aiming to improve aspects of your game that you want to get better on,"" he said.The win, which is RCB's fourth in a row, took their points tally to 10, which means their faint hopes of reaching the playoffs stay alive.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by 60 runs in the IPL.

WATCH VIDEO OF GOENKA TALKING TO RAHUL AFTER THE MATCH

After Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) got hammered by Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in an unbelievable run-chase pulled off by Hyderabad openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, Lucknow skipper KL Rahul found himself at the receiving end of an animated discussion with franchise's owner Sanjiv Goenka near the LSG dugout but maintained his calm.Chasing LSG's below-par 165 for 4, Hyderabad openers launched an almost unreal attack on Lucknow bowlers to reach the target in a mere 9.4 overs and register a massive 10-wicket win.Hitting 14 sixes and 16 fours collectively, Head and Abhihsek smashed 89* off just 30 balls and 75* off only 28 balls, respectively.Before being clueless against SRH's attack as a captain, Rahul had a forgettable outing as a batsman, scoring 29 off 33 balls. It was only because of Nicholas Pooran's 48* off 26 balls and Ayush Badoni's 55* off 30 that LSG could put up a competitive total on the board.Scenes that unfolded on the sidelines after the match showed team's owner Goenka involved in a serious dicussion with Rahul on the outcome of the match.The defeat pushed LSG down to number six on the points table after their sixth defeat in 12 matches, thereby making the team's task of qualifying for the playoffs tougher. SRH moved up to number three with their seventh win in 12 matches.As the footage of Goenka talking to Rahul was being aired on live broadcast, the commentators said: ""You always feel these conversations should always be behind closed doors. There are so many cameras that miss nothing, and KL Rahul is not going to go at press conferences and various other things and probably potentially explain what is being discussed there. He has done well here to keep his cool.""","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by 10 wickets.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) captain Faf du Plessis has forged a strong friendship with batting legend Virat Kohli , especially since the South African joined Kohli at RCB and both started opening for the team in the Indian Premier League IPL ).Still having an outside chance in the race to IPL 2024 playoffs, RCB will take on Punjab Kings at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala on Thursday, as both the teams face a must-win situation.Ahead of the game, Du Plessis spoke about his bond with Kohli on the 'Captains Speak' segment of Star Sports show.""We both love food.

Olympiakos secured their place in the Europa Conference League final by defeating Aston Villa 2-0 in the second leg of the semi-finals, marking a historic moment for the club. Led by Jose Luis Mendilibar, Olympiakos sealed a commanding 6-2 aggregate victory, largely thanks to Ayoub El Kaabi's brace, who had also scored a hat-trick in the first leg.The atmosphere at the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus was electrifying as Olympiakos, boasting a record 47 Greek championships, earned their debut in a major European final.This achievement places them alongside Panathinaikos as the only Greek clubs to reach such heights, with Panathinaikos falling to Ajax in the 1971 European Cup final.The upcoming final against Fiorentina at the AEK Arena adds to the sense of destiny for Olympiakos, as it lies just 10 miles away from their home ground, further emphasizing the local rivalry.Despite Mendilibar's recent appointment in February, he has quickly become an iconic figure for Olympiakos, turning around their European fortunes after several disappointments in previous seasons.Under the ownership of Evangelos Marinakis, Olympiakos had struggled in Europe, failing to progress past the group stage 14 times out of 16 attempts. However, this season presents an opportunity for redemption, with Olympiakos aiming to secure their first European trophy in their nearly century-long history, a feat that would rival Greece's memorable Euro 2004 triumph.It has been a remarkable year for Olympiakos, highlighted by their Under-19 team's success in the UEFA Youth League final against AC Milan in April.On the other hand, Fiorentina booked their spot in the final by overcoming Club Brugge in the semi-finals, setting the stage for a thrilling showdown.Villa's departure marked a painful end to their quest for their first European final appearance since 1982. After returning to European competition following a 13-year hiatus, Villa now face the challenge of regrouping and redirecting their focus towards securing a top-four finish in the Premier League to qualify for the next season's Champions League.Under the guidance of Unai Emery, currently occupying fourth place in the league standings, Villa hold a seven-point lead over Tottenham, who sit in fifth place with three games remaining, compared to Villa's two.Early in the match, Olympiakos's Chiquinho had a chance on goal after bypassing Villa's defense, but his shot missed the target. However, Villa failed to take heed of this warning as Olympiakos capitalized on their defensive lapses to take the lead in the 10th minute.Despite Villa's attempts to find their rhythm, they struggled to coordinate their efforts, exemplified by Leon Bailey's slip as he attempted a shot that posed little threat to Olympiakos goalkeeper Kostas Tzolakis, who showcased his skill with a remarkable save to deny Bailey's powerful strike just before halftime.With Olympiakos firmly in control of the match, they pressed relentlessly and defended resolutely to keep Villa at bay. In the 78th minute, Ayoub El Kaabi sealed the result for Olympiakos, capitalizing on Tzolakis's clearance to score, securing their victory and igniting celebrations among the Olympiakos faithful.",Olympiakos defeated Aston Villa 2-0 in the second leg of the semi-finals.

Moments later, he secured the win with a second goal, albeit controversially initially ruled out for offside before being awarded following a VAR review .Reflecting on the team's indomitable spirit, midfielder Jude Bellingham remarked, ""We've seen it a lot of times this season when it looked as though we're dead and buried ... it doesn’t matter who scores the goals but someone always manages it... that mentality of never say die.""Real Madrid's dominance throughout the game was evident, with Vinicius Jr leading the charge down the left channel and Neuer putting up a valiant defense for Bayern.

Defender Matthijs De Ligt expressed frustration, labeling the call ""a disgraceful decision.""With their Bundesliga reign ended by Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern's hopes for silverware were dashed, leaving them with only the Champions League to fight for this season.

NEW DELHI: The long-lost Golden Ball trophy awarded to Diego Maradona for his outstanding performance in the 1986 World Cup has been rediscovered and will be put up for auction by Aguttes house in Paris next month.Maradona, who passed away in 2020 at the age of 60, led Argentina to a 3-2 victory over West Germany in the final held in Mexico City. Prior to the final, he scored two memorable goals in the quarterfinals against England: the controversial ""Hand of God"" goal and the ""Goal of the Century.""The auction house anticipates that the trophy will fetch a substantial sum due to its rarity.Maradona received the award at a ceremony held at the Lido cabaret on the Champs-Élysées in 1986, after which it vanished, leading to various speculations about its whereabouts.Some rumours suggested that it was lost in a poker game or sold to settle debts, while others claimed that it was stored in a Naples bank safe that was robbed by local gangsters in 1989 when Maradona was playing in the Italian league.However, Aguttes dismisses the theory that the trophy was melted down into gold pieces, stating, ""A far-fetched theory, given that it was made of a gold-copper alloy. It was thoroughly investigated and authenticated as Diego Maradona's Adidas Golden Ball trophy.""The trophy resurfaced in 2016 as part of a private collection that was auctioned in Paris.

The 2018 World Cup winner, who is set to leave PSG when his contract expires at the end of the season, likely to join Real Madrid , had hoped to sign off by guiding the club to European glory at Wembley next month.Despite PSG's status as favourites and their 31 attempts on goal, they failed to overturn a one-goal first-leg deficit, with Mats Hummels scoring the only goal of the night to secure a 2-0 aggregate victory for Dortmund. Mbappe, one of four PSG players to hit the woodwork in the second half, admitted that they needed to be more clinical in front of goal.""I don't really like to talk about bad luck. When you are good, you don't hit the post, you score. I tried to help the best I could. When I say we needed to be more clinical, I am the one who has to be scoring. But this is life, we need to pick ourselves up,"" Mbappe said after the loss.The defeat marks the closest Mbappe has come to lifting the European Cup with his hometown team, for whom he is their all-time top scorer with 255 goals, including 42 in the Champions League. The French sports daily L'Equipe described the result as ""the end of his dream"" and gave a scathing assessment of Mbappe's performance, rating him just two out of 10.PSG's elimination by a team sitting fifth in the Bundesliga is seen as a significant disappointment for a club that has invested heavily since the Qatari takeover in 2011. It is the latest in a series of Champions League knockout round failures, with their 6-1 defeat by Barcelona in 2017 still the most notable.Despite the presence of Mbappe, this PSG side was not seriously expected to reach this stage of the competition, having undergone a major overhaul following the departures of Lionel Messi and Neymar. Coach Luis Enrique, brought in to oversee the new project, acknowledged that his objective was to compete as well as possible for every trophy. Mbappe's final game for the club will now be the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25.The lack of experience at this level may have ultimately cost PSG, with their starting line-up having an average age of just 24 years and 157 days, the youngest for any team in a Champions League semi-final since Arsenal faced Manchester United in 2009. Captain Marquinhos emphasized the need to focus on the positives, saying, ""We need to remember that it is a new project with a new coach, with lots of changes. There are lots of positives and good things to take forward into next season.""However, it remains to be seen how PSG can improve their chances of winning the Champions League without Mbappe, even with the likely significant investment in a replacement.The coach's strategy of resting Mbappe or substituting him in domestic league games over the past three months, apparently in preparation for next season, has not ultimately helped PSG secure the trophy they most desire. As Mbappe, now 25, prepares to leave Paris, he will hope to finally get his hands on the Champions League trophy with his next club.",Kylian Mbappe is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season.

Parthib Gogoi a step away from achieving his dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/parthib-gogoi-a-step-away-from-achieving-his-dream/articleshow/109926682.cms,"KOLKATA: “Every young footballer dreams of playing for India,” was how Parthib Gogoi — named for the first time by Igor Stimac among the probables for the crucial World Cup qualifiers — put it when asked about his national team aspirations.“Playing for India is always a different kind of feeling. All of us have a lot of passion for playing in national colours.There is this feeling that we will give our lives to win the game for India. So that’s the feeling I get and get connected emotionally when representing India.”While the 21-year-old has chosen to stay low before the final squad selection, the Assam footballer is one of the new faces that head coach Stimac chose to give a shot ahead of India’s vital June fixtures in quest to progress to the third round of World Cup qualifiers. He will join NEUFC teammate and fellow first-time India probable Jithin MS for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar set to begin this week.And if NEUFC’s only player to score in four consecutive games for his club makes it into Stimac’s final squad, it will be a milestone in Gogoi’s journey from his father’s football training centre in Assam’s Sivasagar to donning the jersey for the senior national team.“My idol is Sunil Chhetri . And if I get to share the dressing room with him, I can learn so much from him. If young players get a chance in the Indian squad, we can learn so much from the senior players. But it depends on the coach. If he picks me, I will give my best,” Parthib said during a freewheeling interaction with TOI.Parthib, along with Jithin this season, has been a bright spot in the Highlanders’ last two Indian Super League campaigns and has been getting better with time and experience. He had eight shots on target, of which three were goals, in 18 appearances in 2022-23 and continued the form at Durand Cup this year with his first hat-trick for NEUFC.Having extended his NEUFC contract till 2026-27, Parthib scored five goals for his team this ISL season while also providing two assists. But what captivated fans are three spectacular strikes from long range – against title winners Mumbai City, Chennaiyin and East Bengal.Parthib expressed his love for such piledrivers during the interaction. “That’s something I really love to do. Even while playing FIFA on Playstation, I always look for opportunities to shoot from distance,” he said.Having started his football journey as a two-year-old by following his brother Pragyan – also his teammate and “mental support” at NEUFC – to the field, Parthib has had the support of his entire family in his pursuit.“My father and his colleagues started a football training centre in 2005 that trains kids even today. My brother used to go there for training from 2005. My father, who was not a footballer but loves the game, used to carry me to the ground when I was two to watch my brother play and if I liked it, I could play it too. So that's how my football journey started in 2007. Also, papa used to get football clips on his phone, like those of Messi or Ronaldo, for us and watching these clips, I got attracted to the game,” Parthib said before adding with a laugh, “I have broken many doors in my house.”Having climbed through the ranks of Assam age-group teams, Bengaluru’s Ozone Football Academy and Indian Arrows, Parthib has also represented India at age-group competitions, the most recent being U23 AFC Cup Qualifiers in China followed by friendlies in Indonesia.But the bigger test begins for him this week as he looks to grab a place in Stimac’s scheme of things and add a goalscoring touch to the squad against Kuwait and Qatar.Asked about his future goal, the Messi fan and self-proclaimed “Barcelona boy” said, “I want to become one of the best footballers in India.”The dream bodes well for India, too, with the team in dire need of goal scorers as Chhetri approaches his twilight days with the team.",Parthib Gogoi named among probables for India's World Cup qualifiers.

I need to keep exploring how I'll be able to manage to play every day. But yeah, I'm happy the way that I feel today.""The 22-time Grand Slam champion noted that he had difficult moments during his first training session in Rome prior to Thursday's opening match against Zizou Bergs and in his last two tournaments.""But in general, the line's going up, without a doubt,"" he added.

Madrid was a good test for me playing, I think, two days in a row, one match over three hours.""All the matches are difficult and more unpredictable than they used to be for me, especially on clay. I accept that role. I accept that challenge.""On May 26, the French Open gets underway.",Rafael Nadal returns to action at the Rome Masters on Thursday.
