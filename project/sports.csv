"'They should have won more trophies': Michael Vaughan on Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja's white-ball careers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/they-should-have-won-more-trophies-michael-vaughan-on-virat-kohli-rohit-sharma-and-ravindra-jadejas-white-ball-careers/articleshow/111592310.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former England captain Michael Vaughan took a sly dig at Indian cricket legends Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma , and Ravindra Jadeja for their limited success in winning white-ball trophies, following their announcement of retirement from T20 Internationals. The three players have only secured one ICC trophy , the 2024 T20 World Cup , in the last decade, which they won in their final T20I appearances.The trio has been integral to Indian cricket for many years. Vaughan pointed out their underwhelming record in recent ICC tournaments despite their significance in the team.""They'll all agree that it is a perfect way to go, but they should have won more white-ball trophies amongst them,"" Vaughan said on the Club Prairie Fire podcast. ""To think that he (Rohit) has taken another seventeen years to get another one in his hand, I think he will be the first one to admit that they should have won one or two more.""Kohli was the first to announce his retirement after receiving the Player of the Match award in the World Cup final. Rohit revealed his decision during the post-match press conference an hour later. The duo ended their T20I careers as the top two run-scorers in the format, with Rohit accumulating 4,231 runs and Kohli 4,188 runs. Jadeja joined them in retirement the following day.Despite his criticism, Vaughan acknowledged that the trio retired at an opportune time, allowing them to focus on other formats and the Indian Premier League.""What a way to go out with a win in Barbados and a trophy in your hand. Now they can sit back and play Test cricket, a bit of one-day cricket, and in the IPL like MS Dhoni, play on forever. In Indian cricket, they will be replaced as there's plenty of talent in that team,"" Vaughan added.Kohli, Rohit, and Jadeja’s departure from T20Is marks the end of an era for Indian cricket. Their contributions, both individually and collectively, have left an indelible mark on the sport. As they transition to focus on Test and ODI formats, as well as the IPL, their legacy will inspire the next generation of Indian cricketers.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ravindra Jadeja have retired from T20 Internationals.

In another notable match, Taylor Fritz pulled off an upset victory against fourth seed Alexander Zverev.Elina Svitolina of Ukraine, visibly emotional and wearing a black ribbon, progressed to the next round just hours after a devastating Russian missile attack in Kyiv claimed numerous lives and severely damaged a children's hospital.Djokovic, a seven-time Wimbledon champion, was anticipated to face a tough challenge from Rune.However, the Serb delivered a commanding performance, securing a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory in just over two hours. Despite wearing a knee support following recent surgery, the 37-year-old dominated the match from the outset, not conceding a single point in the first three games against his overwhelmed opponent.The Serbian star effortlessly broke Rune's serve once in the second set and twice more in the third, sealing his place in the quarter-finals, where he will face Australian ninth seed Alex de Minaur.Notwithstanding his impressive performance, Djokovic expressed frustration with certain members of the Centre Court audience, accusing them of disrespectful behavior towards him.""To all the fans that have had respect and stayed here tonight, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and I appreciate it,"" said a frustrated Djokovic after reaching a 60th Grand Slam quarter-final.""And to all those people that have chosen to disrespect the player -- in this case me -- have a good night,"" he added, mocking his tormentors.Djokovic, the defending champion, is on a quest to match Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon men's singles titles. Additionally, he aims to surpass Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles.In another match, Taylor Fritz, seeded 13th, staged a remarkable comeback against the powerful-serving Alexander Zverev. Despite being down two sets, Fritz managed to turn the tables, securing a 4-6, 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 victory.Initially, Zverev's formidable serve seemed insurmountable, and Fritz appeared to be on the brink of defeat. However, the American player achieved a pivotal break in the third set, marking the first time Zverev had been broken throughout the entire tournament. This shift in momentum proved to be the turning point of the match, propelling Fritz to an impressive victory.""It was amazing to do that on Centre Court, two sets down in front of this crowd. It's a dream,"" said the American, who will face Italian 25th seed Lorenzo Musetti in the last eight.""The thing was I still felt I was playing really well for being down two sets. I was just thinking it sucked to be playing this well and to lose in straights.""Zverev, sporting a brace on his left knee, revealed that he was essentially playing ""on one leg today"" due to an injury he sustained during his third-round victory over Cameron Norrie.""It is nothing that I need surgery on,"" he added. ""It is nothing that doesn't heal by itself. It just needs time.""Zverev, who finished second at Roland Garros in June, dismissed concerns about his ability to compete for gold at the forthcoming Olympics in Paris, despite being 27 years old.After defeating Wang Xinyu of China 6-2, 6-1 in a mere 55 minutes, Svitolina shed tears on the court as she advanced to the quarterfinals for the third time.The Ukrainian player, seeded 21st and sporting a black ribbon on her white shirt, took to the court following Russian missile strikes on various Ukrainian cities. According to Ukrainian authorities, the attacks claimed 36 lives and caused significant damage to a children's hospital in Kyiv.""It's a very difficult day today for all Ukraine people,"" said the 29-year-old Svitolina.""It was not easy to focus on the match. Since this morning it has been very difficult to read the news and go on court.""Svitolina's next opponent will be Elena Rybakina, a Kazakh player of Russian origin, who advanced when Anna Kalinskaya retired with the score at 6-3, 3-0.De Minaur, the ninth-seeded Australian who recently triumphed at the grass-court tournament in 's-Hertogenbosch, overcame France's Arthur Fils in a four-set battle.Despite losing the first set, Musetti managed to spoil the 21st birthday celebration of Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, the powerful French server, by rallying to secure a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory.Jelena Ostapenko, a past French Open winner, defeated Yulia Putintseva, who had previously upset Iga Swiatek, with a score of 6-2, 6-3.

Despite nearly an hour-long wait for the weather to clear, match officials eventually called off the game, resulting in both teams sharing a point each from the rain-affected match.This encounter was notable as it marked the first time any team had surpassed 200 runs this season and also the first occurrence of the 200-run total at Church Street Park.Earlier, Texas Super Kings, led by skipper Faf du Plessis , set a formidable total of 203 for 5 in their 20 overs. Du Plessis scored a brilliant century off 58 balls, leading his team from the front. Devon Conway provided crucial support, amassing 39 runs off 26 balls, and together they built a 109-run partnership for the opening wicket.Du Plessis was relentless against any loose deliveries, consistently punishing the Washington bowlers throughout his innings. Marcus Stoinis, despite nursing an injured right hand, contributed a vital 29 runs off 18 balls.The Washington Freedom's bowling and fielding were subpar, with several dropped catches and missed opportunities that allowed the Texas Super Kings to amass their substantial total.While the rain ultimately denied what could have been an exciting finish, both teams will aim to build on their performances as the Major League Cricket season progresses.","The fifth match of the 2024 Major League Cricket season between Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings was called off due to rain.

The Mumbaikar has been actively participating in every series since the South Africa Test series in December-January, followed by the Afghanistan T20Is, the England Test series, the IPL, and the recently-concluded T20 World Cup.""Both are automatic choices in ODI set up and the three 50 over games against England before the Champions Trophy is good enough practice for them.

Jyothi Yarraji looks to hurdle past obstacles in Paris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/jyothi-yarraji-looks-to-hurdle-past-obstacles-in-paris/articleshow/111592677.cms,"Having recovered from a nasty injury, 100m hurdler is hoping to get her personal best at the Olympics

NEW DELHI: Jyothi Yarraji 's indomitable spirit has helped her fly past any hurdle that life has thrown her way. The 23-year-old from Andhra Pradesh has surmounted several difficulties to attain the tag of India's indisputable hurdles queen.Her father, Suryanarayana, works as a private security guard while her mother, Kumari, doubles up as a domestic help and a part-time cleaner at a city hospital in Visakhapatnam .Their combined income of just Rs 20,000 per month wasn't enough to sustain Jyothi's athletics dream. But Jyothi didn't let her family's financial constraints stop her progress.A couple of days ago, she created history when an official confirmation from World Athletics (WA) came her way about her qualification for the Paris Olympics – a moment she had waited for all along. The women's 100m hurdles event has been a part of every Olympics since 1972, but this will be the first time that an Indian athlete will feature on the start list.""Olympics is like a dream for every athlete. I just want to go there (in Paris) and express myself. I try to become a better athlete every day. I always take on challenges to move forward. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to get there. Once you are an Olympian, it will always stay with your name. I want to do my best over there and not repeat mistakes,"" Jyothi told TOI.Jyothi secured the Paris athletics quota for India through her world ranking. The qualification window for athletics events for Paris 2024 had ended on June 30. However, the final Road to Paris standings were officially confirmed by World Athletics late last week. Jyothi occupied the 34th position in women's 100m hurdles to make the cut-off among 40 athletes.Jyothi could have breached the automatic entry standard for Paris on her own instead of waiting for her world ranking update, but a nasty fall at the Monet Grand Prix in Finland in May hampered her progress. She ran 12.78s in Finland and missed the mark by just one-hundredth of a second.""I hit the 10th hurdle hard with my lead leg during the race and badly lost my balance and momentum. It took me at least 5-6 weeks to recover from that injury. I would have loved to achieve the qualification mark. While I was confident of qualifying through my world ranking, the injury did affect my preparations for Paris. I have three weeks left to train for the Olympics and I want to use this time judiciously. I will look to achieve my personal best in Paris,"" said Jyothi, who is supported by Reliance Foundation and trains at its High Performance Centre in Bhubaneswar under coach James Hillier.The reigning national record holder in the event, Jyothi is also the only Indian woman to win a medal in the women's 100m hurdles at the Asian Games, where she won silver last year. She is the only Indian woman to go below the 13s-mark and holds the 15 fastest times ever run by an Indian in this category.As a knock-on effect, three other women have now run faster than the longstanding national record of Anuradha Biswal that Jyothi broke. Jyothi's personal best stands at 12.78s. She recently won gold at the senior inter-state athletics championships, continuing her unbeaten run in India.""As Jyothi has qualified for Paris, our training regime would be slightly different from what we have been doing till now. She had a fairly serious injury 5-6 weeks ago and, because of that, she missed a lot of training sessions. Normally, when I train Jyothi for major championships, I will go for a lot of flat sprinting because she is a brilliant sprinter. For Paris, we will go less flatter in sprinting and focus a lot more on hurdling. We have to be very specific about what we do. Hopefully, Jyothi gets to a position where her muscle remembers what performances she had delivered earlier in her season and that comes back to her during the competition,"" Jyothi's coach Hiller said.","Jyothi Yarraji is the reigning national record holder in the women's 100m hurdles.

He said that's a good start but he must be very happy and proud just like my family,"" Abhishek said in a video posted by BCCI.Abhishek acknowledged the significant role Yuvraj played in his development, both on and off the cricket pitch. Yuvraj, who was instrumental in India's victorious 2011 World Cup campaign, took Abhishek under his wing and helped him refine his cricketing abilities.""It's all because of him as well, the hard work he has put in (shaping) me. (For) two-three years, he has worked really hard not only on my cricket but off the field (life) as well.""After playing a spectacular match-winning knock in second T2I, Abhishek called Yuvraj.""Well done very proud, you deserve it. Many more (such innings) to come this is just the start,"" Yuvraj said.The Indian team benefited from the quick turnaround between the first two matches of the five-game series.With no rest day scheduled, the visiting side had little opportunity to dwell on their initial defeat. This lack of reflection time played into India's hands, allowing them to swiftly bounce back and even the series at 1-1.""We lost yesterday but I felt, today is my day and I should take the match to the end, the positive was that we didn't have much time to think about the next game,"" he pointed out.Abhishek and Ruturaj Gaikwad (77 not out off 47 ball) stiched a match-winning 137-run stand for the second wicket.""I was in a flow, and just wanted to express myself. I spoke to Rutu as well, he said the same thing that 'don't think much about the balls and hit what you think you can',"" he said.Abhishek also lauded skipper Shubman Gill for lending him his bat.""Special thanks to Shubman who timely gave me his bat, this was a much-needed innings for me and the team.""This has been going on from U-14 times. Whenever I play with his bat I have done well, today also, the same happened.""I played with his bat only, which I got after a lot of difficulty, he doesn't give it easily.

This sparked speculation about whether it was Kohli's initiative to include the anthem during the victory celebrations.The BCCI honored the Men in Blue with a prize money of Rs 125 crore for their victorious campaign in the T20 World Cup.Following their monumental contributions to India's second T20 World Cup triumph, skipper Rohit Sharma and superstar Virat Kohli announced their retirements from T20 Internationals.Kohli, awarded player of the match for his sublime 76 in the final against South Africa, was the first to announce his decision, followed shortly by Rohit, who stated that having achieved his goals, it was time to step aside.","India clinched their second T20 World Cup title by defeating South Africa in the thrilling final.

India vs Zimbabwe: Abhishek Sharma's secret? A borrowed bat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/india-vs-zimbabwe-abhishek-sharmas-secret-a-borrowed-bat/articleshow/111563982.cms,"Abhishek Sharma announced his arrival on the international stage with a sizzling century in the second T20I of his career against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club on Sunday, and he did it with a borrowed bat.After scoring 100 off 47 balls, which powered India to a mammoth 234 for 2 and eventually helped the visitors win by 100 runs to level the five-match series at 1-1, the 23-year-old Abhishek revealed that he did with skipper Shubman Gill 's bat.""Today I played with Shubman Gill's bat...whenever I think there is a pressure game or this is a match where I should perform, I usually take his bat,"" said the batting sensation, who, like Gill, hails from Punjab and is also mentored by India great Yuvraj Singh.Coming out to open, Abhishek smashed 8 sixes and 7 fours in his innings that came at a strike rate of 212.77, before being dismissed by left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza.Ruturaj Gaikwad contributed an equally blistering 77 not out off 47 balls, followed by Rinku Singh who smashed an unbeaten 48 off 22 balls.Pacers Avesh Khan and Mukesh Kumar then took three wickets each to complete India's big win.Abhishek and Gill have been playing together since their under-12 days.“It has been quite beautiful, starting as kids of 11-12 years...When I was selected for the country, the first call I received was from Shubman,” said Abhishek in the post-match press conference.Abhishek said it's not the first time he borrowed Gill's bat.“It happened from the under-12 days, as whenever I play a pressure game I ask him for a bat. It had happened in the IPL as well. Today was no exception as it went well as it usually happens,” said Abhishek, who played IPL 2024 for Sunrisers Hyderabad and knocked on BCCI selectors' doors with his big-hitting prowess.The left-handed opener credited his father and Yuvraj for his success and ability to play fearlessly.“Yuvi paaji has made a big contribution. I don't consider myself as sixer-king or something like that. Special thanks to my dad for allowing me to play lofted shots. Generally, coaches don't allow a young batter to hit lofted shots. But my dad always said if you wanted to play a lofted shot, then it should go out of the ground. So I wanted to follow that,” he added.India lost the first match of the series, where Abhishek made his debut and got out for a duck. However, he said he didn't feel any pressure.“I think the IPL plays a big role in this (handling pressure). We did not feel much pressure when we came here to represent the country as debutants. Unfortunately, we didn't start well in the first match. But my mindset and approach were pretty much similar – to show the right intent,” he explained.“Of course, my execution was better today (in the 2nd T20I ) than yesterday. I was just calculating the risk that I should take in the first over, or whether to play according to the merit of the ball. Whenever I get boundaries or sixes in the first few balls, then I believe that it's my day,” he concluded.",India beat Zimbabwe by 100 runs in second T20I at Harare Sports Club. Abhishek Sharma scored 100 off 47 balls and hit 8 sixes and 7 fours. India captain Shubman Gill's bat was used in the innings. India level five-match series 1-1.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111563989,imgsize-48508,width-400,resizemode-4/111563989.jpg"

Points Table

NEW DELHI: The San Francisco Unicorns secured a commanding win against the LA Knight Riders in the fourth match of the 2024 Major League Cricket , triumphing by six wickets with 28 balls remaining. Opting to field first at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, the Unicorns limited the Knight Riders to 165/6, thanks to the efforts of debutant Broady Couch (2/24) and Harris Rauf (2/38), who claimed two wickets each.The Unicorns' chase was propelled by scintillating half-centuries from Finn Allen (63) and Matthew Short (58).Despite Andre Russel 's (40*) valiant effort, it proved insufficient for the Knight Riders, as their key batsmen, including David Miller (24), Shakib Al Hassan (35), and Jason Roy (26), failed to make the most of their starts.The Unicorns' pursuit began with the early dismissal of opener Jake Fraser Mcgurk (9), caught behind off Spencer Johnson's bowling. However, Finn Allen wasted no time in attacking the target, smashing five sixes in just five deliveries across the fifth and sixth overs. By the end of the powerplay, the Unicorns held a commanding position at 67/1.Following the powerplay, opener Matthew Short shifted into high gear, striking two more sixes off Corne Dry in the seventh over. Allen reached his half-century in 23 deliveries in the eighth over, while Short followed suit, also in 23 balls, with five sixes and three fours. The massive 116-run partnership between Allen and Short was eventually broken by Sunil Narine in the 12th over, but by then, the Unicorns needed only 29 runs from 48 balls.Although Finn Allen fell to Spencer Johnson in the 13th over, contributions from Josh Inglis (15), Corey Anderson (11), and Hassan Khan (2) helped the Unicorns reach their target in 15.2 overs. Spencer Johnson emerged as the Knight Riders' most successful bowler, taking 3/36.Earlier, the Unicorns had kept the Knight Riders in check, reducing them to 42/2 by the end of the powerplay, having dismissed Sunil Narine (6) and Unmukt Chand (0). Opener Jason Roy (26) appeared threatening, striking four boundaries in his 18-ball innings before being bowled by Liam Plunkett in the seventh over.Experienced campaigners Shakib Al Hassan (35) and Nitish Kumar (20) forged the innings' most substantial partnership, adding 45 runs in 31 deliveries during the middle overs before being dismissed by Abrar Ahmed and Brody Couch in successive overs.David Miller (24) and Andre Russell (40*) put together a 34-run stand, but Miller was removed by Haris Rauf in the 17th over, just as the Knight Riders looked to accelerate. Russel's unbeaten 25-ball cameo, which included three sixes and two fours, concluded with 15 runs off Haris Rauf in the final over.Currently, the San Francisco Unicorns top the chart, having played and won one match, earning them 2 points with the highest Net Run Rate of +2.576.MI New York, in second place, has played two matches, winning one and losing one, also earning 2 points but with a Net Run Rate of +1.472.Washington Freedom, in third, has played and won one match, gaining 2 points and a Net Run Rate of +0.522.The Los Angeles Knight Riders, placed fourth, have played two matches, winning one and losing one, with a Net Run Rate of -0.768, also earning 2 points.Texas Super Kings, in fifth place, have played and lost one match, earning no points with a Net Run Rate of -0.600.Lastly, Seattle Orcans, also without any points, are in last place, having played and lost one match, with a Net Run Rate of -2.344.","The San Francisco Unicorns secured a commanding win against the LA Knight Riders in the fourth match of the 2024 Major League Cricket.

'When you don't have quality...': Ravi Shastri's advice to 'sustain interest in Test cricket',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/when-you-dont-have-quality-ravi-shastris-advice-to-sustain-interest-in-test-cricket/articleshow/111580240.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) hosted a symposium on Sunday where various perspectives were shared regarding the future of Test cricket and the potential use of the 20-overs format to expand the sport's reach. One suggestion was to limit Test cricket to only six or seven teams.The appeal of Test cricket has been waning outside of India, England, and Australia, coinciding with the rapid growth of lucrative T20 leagues worldwide.While top-level Test cricket still frequently delivers thrilling moments, the shorter and more action-oriented nature of 20-overs cricket has quickly become the preferred format for new fans of the game.Ravi Shastri , a former Indian player and coach, emphasized the importance of maintaining a competitive Test cricket landscape. He proposed that the only way to achieve this is by restricting participation in the format to the relatively stronger teams.""When you don't have quality, that is when the ratings drop, there are fewer people in the crowd, its meaningless cricket, which is the last thing sport wants,"" Shastri said, as quoted by Reuters, at World Cricket Connects, an event at Lord's hosted by the MCC.""You have 12 Test match teams. Bring it down to six or seven and have promotion and relegation system.""You can have two tiers but let the top six keep playing to sustain the interest in Test cricket.""You can spread the game in other formats, like T20,"" added the former India coach.Justin Langer , the former Australian batsman and coach, expressed his fondness for T20 leagues but emphasized the importance of safeguarding international cricket due to its potential influence on the younger generation.To illustrate his point, Langer mentioned the case of West Indies fast bowler Shamar Joseph, who had memorial debut series in Australia this year.""...it had Australia enthralled and it brought the Caribbean to life,"" Langer said.""Last week we saw a million people turn up to see India celebrated for winning the World Cup.""That is bilateral cricket and international cricket.""MCC President Mark Nicholas summarized the key points discussed, emphasizing that the opinions expressed were not intended to imply that Test cricket was unjustified. He acknowledged that cricket, like any other sport, required financial resources to maintain its existence and continue its operations."" T20 cricket is the behemoth that everybody wants,"" he said.""It is where the new market is, where the fans are and where the money is.""In cricket, money is seen as a dirty word but it shouldn't be because it is the only way to sustain the game.""","The appeal of Test cricket has been waning outside of India, England, and Australia.

NEW DELHI: Temba Bavuma is set to make his international cricket comeback after a hiatus that lasted the entire year. He will lead the South African team in a two-Test series against the West Indies, scheduled to take place in the upcoming month.Bavuma's prolonged absence from the South African squad highlights the current state of the cricketing world, as pointed out by coach Shukri Conrad.The coach emphasizes that the modern cricket landscape is predominantly focused on white-ball formats, which has had an impact on Bavuma's participation in the national team.""It is what it is and we just have to make it work,"" Conrad said, as quoted by AFP, at a press conference announcing a 16-man squad for the tour.Conrad will face a challenge in the upcoming pre-tour camp in Durban, as only half of his 16-man squad will be present due to their commitments in white-ball cricket and the English county season.Bavuma sustained an injury during the first Test match against India in December last year, forcing him to sit out the second Test. The Proteas suffered a humiliating defeat within one-and-a-half days on a subpar pitch in his absence.Subsequently, Bavuma was also unavailable for the two-Test series in New Zealand. South Africa sent a depleted squad, which resulted in losses in both matches, as the contracted players were obligated to participate in the SA20, a domestic franchise tournament.Bavuma did not participate in the T20 World Cup, where South Africa finished as runners-up.The majority of South Africa's T20 players are currently engaged in the Major League Cricket tournament in the United States, which concludes on July 28. The selected players for the West Indies tour will travel straight to the Caribbean, allowing them to participate in a warm-up match before the opening Test.Despite the circumstances, Conrad opted to maintain an optimistic outlook on the situation.""We've got the luxury of a warm-up game, so we've got 10 days in Trinidad before the first Test match,"" he said.""I mentioned to Temba that it's the first time as a Test unit that we're going to spend some extended time together.""My first series was against the West Indies (in February and March 2023) when we got together three days before the first game and we got together two days before the India series because there were Monday matches going on.""You just have to roll with the punches. It is the modern day world. Players can easily move from T20 and Test match cricket.""I'm very comfortable that guys will be in America. They'll take a short flight across and then we'll have a week's preparation before the first Test.""Matthew Breetzke , a 25-year-old batsman with experience in six T20 internationals and currently playing for Northamptonshire, an English county, has been selected as the sole uncapped player in the squad for the Tests in Trinidad and Guyana.The West Indies tour marks the beginning of a busy period for the Proteas, who have only played four Tests in the past year.

NEW DELHI: India are aiming to level the three-match women's T20 series against South Africa as they enter the final game on Tuesday, with inclement weather posing a significant threat to their ambitions. After the second match was washed out, leaving India trailing 0-1, the team is not only focused on the game but also hoping that rain does not become a decisive factor.In the first match of the series, India fell short by 12 runs against South Africa.The second game saw persistent drizzle halt the play midway, compounding India's troubles. With rain forecasts showing a 30 to 40 percent chance of precipitation on Tuesday, the Indian team remains anxious about the weather's impact.Indian bowlers have struggled in the series so far, with South Africa posting 189 for 9 and 177 for 6 in the two games. Pooja Vastrakar has been the standout performer for India, picking up two wickets in each game. Spinner Deepti Sharma has also shown some promise, but the rest of the bowling unit has failed to impress.Renuka Singh, who conceded too many runs in the first game, was replaced by Sajeevan Sajana in the second match, but Sajana did not make much impact either.Shreyanka Patil and Radha Yadav each managed to take a wicket in the second game but continued to be expensive.India's captain Harmanpreet Kaur, emphasizing the importance of a tighter bowling effort, has expressed her expectations clearly for the bowlers to improve their performance with the series on the line.On the batting side, India have had a decent run. Key players like Jemimah Rodrigues (53 not out), Smriti Mandhana(46), Harmanpreet (35), Shafali Verma (18), and Dayalan Hemalatha (14) have all contributed. Uma Chetry, who debuted in the T20I format on Sunday, is likely to get another chance to showcase her abilities with the bat.South Africa have displayed robust batting performances, led primarily by Tazmin Brits, who has scored consecutive half-centuries. Additionally, significant contributions have come from skipper Laura Wolvaardt, Marizanne Kapp, and Anneke Bosch.The sole concern for South Africa has been Chloe Tryon, who managed identical 12 runs in both games.With the upcoming T20 World Cup in Bangladesh, Tryon will be keen to prove her critics wrong and find her form.India look forward to an all-around improved performance in the final game while paying close attention to weather updates that could influence the outcome significantly.Harmanpreet Kaur(c), Smriti Mandhana(vc), Uma Chetry(wk), Richa Ghosh(wk), Dayalan Hemalatha, Jemimah Rodrigues, Shafali Verma, Amanjot Kaur, Shreyanka Patil, Sajeevan Sajana, Deepti Sharma, Asha Sobhana, Arundhati Reddy, Renuka Singh, Shabnam Shakil, Pooja Vastrakar and Radha Yadav.Laura Wolvaardt(c), Tazmin Brits, Mieke de Ridder(wk), Sinalo Jafta(wk), Anneke Bosch, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Marizanne Kapp, Sune Luus, Chloe Tryon, Ayabonga Khaka, Masabata Klaas, Eliz-Mari Marx, Nonkululeko Mlaba and Tumi Sekhukhune.","India are aiming to level the three-match women's T20 series against South Africa.

NEW DELHI: Uruguay advanced to the Copa America semi-finals after a hard-fought 0-0 draw against Brazil at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, ultimately prevailing 4-2 in a penalty shootout.The match was marked by a red card for Uruguay's Nahitan Nandez in the second half, leaving his team with 10 men.Brazil, without the suspended Vinicius Jr, found it challenging to create chances despite their numerical advantage.In the penalty shootout, Uruguay gained the advantage when Sergio Rochet saved Eder Militao's spot kick and Douglas Luiz hit the post.Although Alisson Becker kept Brazil's hopes alive by denying Jose Maria Gimenez and Gabriel Martinelli scored his penalty, Manuel Ugarte sealed the victory for Uruguay with the decisive kick. Uruguay now face Colombia in the semi-finals as they continue their pursuit of a record-extending 16th Copa America title.""It was a very tense match, against a very tough opponent, suffering in the last minutes a man down. But we showed character despite our youth,"" Rochet said.""To finish with penalties and winning, I was able to save one... The truth is that it is a tremendous happiness that this group deserves, the country deserves it. We are very excited, so we are going for more.""The match between Brazil and Uruguay was a physical battle, with both teams committing a total of 41 fouls. Players from both sides engaged in intense challenges throughout the game.Uruguay's high-pressing strategy left little room for Brazil's young forward Endrick to operate, as he found himself on the receiving end of some tough tackles. In one instance, Ronald Araujo pushed Endrick to the ground, prompting an angry reaction from Brazil's captain Raphinha, who shoved Araujo in retaliation. The referee intervened, having a firm conversation with both players without issuing any cards.Araujo's match was cut short when he had to be substituted due to an injury just after the 30-minute mark. The game suddenly came to life moments later when Darwin Nunez missed a close-range header. Brazil quickly launched a counter-attack, but Raphinha's shot was denied by goalkeeper Rochet in what was Brazil's best chance of the first half.Uruguay struggled to penetrate Brazil's defense, prompting coach Marcelo Bielsa to make three substitutions by the 67th minute. However, his strategy was disrupted when Nandez was sent off after a VAR review for a reckless tackle on Rodrygo.Despite having a numerical advantage, Brazil failed to score against Uruguay's compact defense, as the Uruguayans opted to sit back and take their chances in the penalty shootout, knowing that there is no extra-time in the Copa America except for the final.This marks Brazil's second consecutive quarter-final exit via penalties in a major tournament, following their defeat to Croatia in the 2022 World Cup.""We want to put Brazil at the top, we will continue working and preparing for the World Cup (qualifiers),"" Endrick said.""We know that this is a difficult moment, but we hope to have the support of all Brazilians.""","Uruguay advance to the Copa America semi-finals after beating Brazil 4-2 in a penalty shootout.

Cristiano Ronaldo , the Portuguese superstar, comforted his tearful teammate Pepe following their heartbreaking defeat to France in the quarterfinals of the European Championship in Hamburg on Friday. The loss came via a penalty shootout, marking a painful exit from what could potentially be their last major international tournament together.Pepe, performing admirably even at the age of 41, wept on Ronaldo's shoulder after Protugal's defeat.Ronaldo had also wept earlier in the tournament, after he couldn't convert the penalty against Slovenia in the extra time of their last-16 match -- a sight similar to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, when Ronaldo left the field in tears following Portugal 's defeat against Morocco in the quarters.On Friday, disappointment and regret writ large on the legend's face.The next major tournament, the 2026 World Cup, will be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. By then, Ronaldo will be 41 years old, raising questions about his ability to continue playing at the highest level, where he holds the men's record for international goals (130) and appearances (212).But he has now gone eight consecutive games without scoring in major tournaments. This includes all five of Portugal's matches atEuro 2024 and their final three games at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Although he successfully converted his penalty in the shootout against France, it wasn't enough to secure victory.“I won't say it publicly,"" Pepe replied when asked by TV station Canal 11 what Ronaldo said to him. ""But we feel it a lot. Contrary to what many people think, we feel it a lot. We feel the frustration of not winning a game, of being eliminated in such a big competition as the European Championship, knowing that we had a lot of quality to go through. That's the pain we feel.”Cristiano Ronaldo concludes his European Championship journey with an unparalleled 14 goals, remaining the tournament's all-time leading scorer, which is five goals more than Michel Platini, as mentioned in an AP report.Ronaldo's longevity and consistency are unmatched, as he stands alone as the sole player to participate in six European Championship tournaments.","Portugal lost to France on penalties in the quarterfinals of the European Championship.

The match will be a rematch of the tournament opener, which saw Argentina secure a 2-0 victory.Canada became the fourth CONCACAF team to reach the Copa America semifinals, following in the footsteps of Mexico, Honduras and the United States.Despite scoring only one goal in their three group-stage matches, Canada started the match against Venezuela with unexpected intensity, and their efforts were rewarded in the 13th minute when Jacob Shaffelburg converted a cross from Jonathan David.After scoring, Shaffelburg held up the jersey of teammate Tajon Buchanan, who suffered a broken leg in training this week.Jesse Marsch's team squandered several opportunities to increase their lead in the first half, with Shaffelburg testing goalkeeper Rafael Romo from the edge of the area and David sending an effort wide of the post after finding himself through one-on-one.Venezuela pushed for a goal and enjoyed more possession but were mostly restricted to speculative crosses and long-range shots, with all-time leading goal-scorer Salomon Rondon twice forcing saves from Crepeau.In the second half, Canada's Cyle Larin fired over the bar from close range in the 52nd minute, while Venezuela's Jose Martinez sent a rebound high over the bar two minutes later.Venezuela finally equalized in the 64th minute through Rondon, who spotted Canada's Crepeau off his line and produced an audacious lob that sailed over the scrambling goalkeeper into the empty net.

The game ended 0-0 after 120 minutes, with France prevailing 5-3 in the shoot-out. This match is likely to be remembered as Cristiano Ronaldo 's final appearance in the tournament.France converted all their penalties, setting up a semi-final clash with Spain.Portugal's Joao Felix was the only player to miss, hitting the post with his team's third attempt.The shoot-out triumph was a welcome change for France, who had previously suffered penalty heartbreaks in major tournaments. They lost the 2022 World Cup final to Argentina and were eliminated from the last Euros by Switzerland in the round of 16, both via penalties. Additionally, they were defeated by Italy in the 2006 World Cup final, which was also held in Germany.Kylian Mbappe, who had missed the decisive penalty against Switzerland, was substituted by Bradley Barcola during extra time and did not participate in the shoot-out. Barcola, along with Ousmane Dembele, Youssouf Fofana, and Jules Kounde, successfully converted their spot-kicks for France.""I am proud of my players. Even if we are not doing everything perfectly we don't give up,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps.""Once again we are in the semi-finals. I will savour this a little even if we have another game coming up.""Mbappe struggled to find his rhythm throughout the match, as he continues to adapt to playing with a protective mask covering his recently fractured nose, an injury sustained during France's initial encounter against Austria.Despite the setback, the young forward will have another opportunity to showcase his talents in the upcoming semi-final. On the other hand, Ronaldo, at the age of 39, seems to have made his final appearance in the European Championship.This tournament marked Ronaldo's sixth European Championship, but he was unable to contribute to his record-breaking tally of 14 goals in the competition, having failed to find the back of the net in all five of Portugal's matches in Germany.Although Ronaldo successfully converted his penalty, which was Portugal's first, Roberto Martinez's squad has been eliminated after failing to score in over six hours of play. They advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating Slovenia on penalties following a goalless draw in the round of 16, but this time, they fell short in what turned out to be a lackluster match in Hamburg.""In the same way that it was maybe cruel for Slovenia in the last 16, today it was cruel for us. That's football ,"" Bernardo Silva told CNN.France and Portugal, both underperforming in the tournament, faced off in a match that lacked intensity but had moments of excitement in the second half.Portugal started to threaten with midfield runners getting into the box, as Bruno Fernandes and Vitinha tested Mike Maignan, who was determined to maintain his clean sheet in open play. Ronaldo nearly scored from close range, but Maignan reacted quickly to deny him.France countered with Kolo Muani and Kounde combining, but Ruben Dias made a crucial interception.Deschamps brought on Dembele, who immediately set up a golden opportunity for Camavinga, which the midfielder missed. The game drifted towards extra time, where Ronaldo missed a good chance from Francisco Conceicao's cutback.Mbappe, France's captain, watched the end of extra time from the bench as Maignan denied Nuno Mendes at the very end of 120 minutes, leading to a penalty shoot-out.The shoot-out took place at the Portugal end of the Volksparkstadion, with Maignan not making any saves but not needing to. Despite Diogo Costa's heroics in the previous round, saving three Slovenia penalties, he could not stop any this time.","France beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties in Euro 2024 quarter-final match.

NEW DELHI: Taylor Fritz staged a remarkable comeback to defeat fourth seed Alexander Zverev 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 6-3 and reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals. The German's flawless serving record at this year's tournament was shattered by the American's resilient performance.Initially, Zverev showed no signs of being hampered by the knee injury he sustained in the previous round.His serve remained untouchable, as he extended his streak of consecutive holds to 56 across four matches, and he appeared poised to secure his first-ever last-eight berth at the grasscourt major.However, at 4-4 in the third set, a surprising double fault from Zverev handed Fritz a crucial break. From that moment, the American's game soared to new heights. He relentlessly pursued every shot the German fired at him and produced some stunning diving winners in the decisive set, leaving Zverev visibly stunned.Facing two break points at 2-1 down in the fifth set, Zverev managed to stay in the game by concluding a grueling yet mesmerizing 21-shot rally with a blistering forehand winner. Despite his valiant efforts, the German ultimately succumbed to Fritz's determined play, ending his Wimbledon campaign in a hard-fought five-set battle.Fritz's determination was evident as he threw himself across the court, his 6-foot-4 frame sprawling in a valiant effort to return Zverev's forehand.Though he missed that particular shot, Fritz quickly regrouped and secured the break in the very next point, establishing a commanding 3-1 lead. From that moment, Zverev's chances of a comeback diminished rapidly.As Fritz struck a decisive backhand winner into an unguarded part of the court, he released his racket and raised his arms, savoring the moment of victory. On the other side of the net, Zverev was left to contemplate another frustrating departure from the Wimbledon tournament.""It was amazing to do that on Centre Court when you are two sets down in front of this crowd. It's a dream,"" Fritz told the crowd after defeating a top five player at a Grand Slam for the first time in his career.""I was just thinking it sucked to be playing this well and to lose in three straights. Even though I lost the first two sets, I really believed I was playing good tennis . I felt it was just a couple of point here and there and that I could take it one step at a time and turn it around.""The American 13th seed will next face Italian Lorenzo Musetti.","Taylor Fritz beats fourth seed Alexander Zverev 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3) Fritz will next face Italian Lorenzo Musetti in the quarter-finals.
