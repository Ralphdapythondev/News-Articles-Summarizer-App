Babar Azam: 'Pakistan ki cricket tabaah ho jayegi': Former cricketer Basit Ali alleges favoritism and mismanagement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/pakistan-ki-cricket-tabaah-ho-jayegi-former-cricketer-basit-ali-alleges-favoritism-and-mismanagement/articleshow/111648006.cms,"WATCH:

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has made serious allegations against the current management of the Pakistan cricket team , accusing them of favoring captain Babar Azam and planning to scapegoat Shaheen Shah Afridi and Mohammad Rizwan for the team's disappointing T20 World Cup campaign.In a video circulating on social media, Basit Ali, who played 19 Tests and 50 ODIs for Pakistan, claimed that the management is compiling a report to blame Afridi and Rizwan for the team’s failures.He warned that such actions could lead to the downfall of Pakistan cricket.""Taeyari jo ki ja rahi hai, jo report banayi ja rahi hai woh banayi ja rahi hai Shaheen Shah Afridi aur Rizwan ke against. Inhone grouping kar di hai. Jo galat hai. Yeh jo report bana rahe hai, jinke mind me yeh cheez hai ki woh apna malba inpar daal de, aisa mat kijiye ga. Pakistan ki cricket tabaah ho jayegi. Tabaah!"" Basit said.He emphasized the gravity of the situation, stating that if Afridi and Rizwan are not on the same page with Babar, all three should be removed from the team instead of making two scapegoats and one a hero.""Yeh wording issi liye abhi kah raha hoon, allah na kare ye cheez ho gayi toh aap ki bhool hai. Agar aap samajhte hai ki Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi aur Babar Azam ek pitch par nahi hai. Agar aapne hatana hai toh teenon ki chhuti karey. Yeh nahi ki do ko aap kurbaani ka bakra banaye aur teesre ko aap hero bana de,"" he added.Basit Ali also criticized Babar Azam's captaincy, not only in the recent T20 World Cup but also in previous matches, highlighting a controversial decision where Babar chose to bowl Nawaz in the final over in Melbourne.""Galat hai. Babar ne kya kaptaani kari hai. Abhi iss tournament me hi nahi, World Cup se jo woh kaptaani kar raha hai. Jo Nawaz ko Melbourne me usne jo last over karaya tha. Kya aankhen nahi khuli thi tab,"" Basit remarked.He further expressed empathy for Afridi, who was removed from the captaincy after just five matches, acknowledging the natural frustration such a decision would cause.""Aap mujhe bataye ek ladke ko paanch match ke baad kaptaani se hata diya, kya usko khaleej nahi hogi. Hum jis TV par baithte hai agar kursiyan hamari change ho jaaye toh khaleez hoti hai - 'kyun meri kurshi change kardi, main sahi nahi bol raha'. Yeh toh natural cheez hai,"" he said.These allegations come in the wake of Pakistan's early exit from the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024, where they failed to progress beyond the Group Stage, suffering losses to the USA and India.",Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has made serious allegations against the current management of the Pakistan cricket team.

MUMBAI: Former India and Mumbai allrounder Abhishek Nayar could be India's new assistant coach, TOI has learnt.Apparently, India's newly-appointed head coach Gautam Gambhir , who was a mentor of 2024 IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders, is highly impressed with the work put in by Nayar in the backroom as an assistant coach at the franchise, where he has been in the post since 2018, and wants him as an integral part of 'Team Gambhir' for India.It will also help that Nayar has an excellent equation with India's ODI and Test captain Rohit Sharma . It can be recalled that a few years back, India's wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik , who retired recently, had credited Nayar and his coaching methods for his resurgence. Soon after KKR 's IPL triumph in May, leg-spinner Varun Chakravarthy had praised Nayar's role in the set-up.TOI tried to get in touch with Nayar, but he didn't respond to calls or messages.Talking about Nayar's input in the IPL title win, KKR head coach Chandrakant Pandit had told this paper in an interview, ""Nayar's contribution was huge. He spends time throughout the year with our domestic players. Whenever they are free, our domestic players come to Mumbai for a camp with us. It's not necessary that 15 players have to be there for us to have a camp. Even if one player is available, he's welcome to fly down to practice with us.""In the Mumbai team and later at KKR, Nayar played a mentor to several youngsters, including KKR captain and India batter Shreyas Iyer . ""Nayar loves guiding the youngsters. These days, he often comes to Mumbai's training camp at BKC, and spends time with the players, giving them valuable tips. And he isn't charging a rupee for this to the Mumbai Cricket Association. He is just passionate about Mumbai cricket,"" a source told TOI.The 40-year-old Nayar played three ODIs for India in 2009.Meanwhile, if reports are to be believed, the BCCI is interested in roping in India's pace bowling great Zaheer Khan as the men's team's new bowling coach. Gambhir is believed to have proposed former India and Karnataka speedster Vinay Kumar 's name for the role, with L Balaji being the other option.One member of Rahul Dravid's outgoing staff, fielding coach T Dilip, could be retained.","Former India and Mumbai allrounder Abhishek Nayar could be India's new assistant coach, TOI has learnt.

1st Test: England 189/3 at stumps on Day 1 after Gus Atkinson demolished West Indies at Lord's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/1st-test-england-189/3-at-stumps-on-day-1-after-gus-atkinson-demolished-west-indies-at-lords/articleshow/111648444.cms,"Gus Atkinson , making his Test debut for England, overshadowed the farewell of the legendary James Anderson by claiming an astonishing seven wickets as the West Indies were skittled out for a mere 121 runs on the first day at Lord's on Wednesday.England capitalized on their strong position, reaching 189 for 3 at the close of play, establishing a lead of 68 runs.Zak Crawley (76) and Ollie Pope (57) both contributed well-crafted half-centuries.Crawley appeared to be on track for a century before Seales bowled him with a rapid leg-stump yorker, bringing his spectacular 89-ball innings, which included 14 fours, to an end.Prior to the start of this three-match series, the focus had been on Anderson's final international match, following a record-breaking Test career that has now yielded 701 wickets -- the most by any fast bowler at this level. However, it was the 26-year-old Atkinson who stole the limelight with his remarkable figures of 7 for 45 in 12 overs, which included a triple wicket-maiden.Atkinson's final figures, after dismissing Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, were the second best by an England bowler on a Test debut behind Dominic Cork's 7 for 43 against the West Indies at Lord's in 1995. In contrast, Anderson had to wait until the last wicket to add to his tally of Test wickets, trapping Jayden Seales lbw to conclude the West Indies innings.West Indies debutant Mikyle Louis, the first Test cricketer from St Kitts, was the top-scorer with 27 in an innings where only three batsmen reached the 20s.The West Indies, having played just one warm-up match and with inexperienced top-order batsmen Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze and Kavem Hodge holding only nine caps between them before this Test, predictably struggled after losing the toss in overcast conditions.They were 88 for 3 when Atkinson, who had already claimed two wickets before lunch, came on to bowl the 35th over.With his second ball of the over, he had Athanaze caught by Joe Root in the slips for 23.Atkinson bowled with precision and accuracy, maintaining a challenging line and length. His next delivery was a superb one that former West Indies captain Holder, returning to Test cricket after nearly a year, edged to Harry Brook in the cordon.Joshua Da Silva managed to survive the hat-trick ball, but on the very next delivery, he too fell for a duck. An inside edge was caught by the opposing wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, who, along with his Surrey teammate Atkinson, was also making his Test debut.With three wickets in four balls without conceding a run, Atkinson secured his place on the Lord's honours board for a five-wicket haul in a Test match.Earlier in the day, when England captain Ben Stokes chose to field after winning the toss, a decision met with huge cheers from the crowd at the 'Home of Cricket', Anderson was immediately in the thick of the action. Despite bowling a probing new-ball spell of five overs for 11 runs, the 41-year-old was unable to dismiss either West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite or fellow opener Louis.The West Indies were relying on Brathwaite, playing in his 90th Test, to make a substantial score. However, he was out for two, chopping the ball onto his stumps, as Atkinson struck with only his second delivery of the day.Louis's promising 58-ball innings came to an end when the 23-year-old was caught by a brilliant low catch by the diving Harry Brook at third slip off Stokes.The West Indies' predicament was epitomized when Hodge, after a fierce square cut off Chris Woakes, was well caught by Pope at point for 24, leaving the batsman sinking to his knees in disbelief.","Gus Atkinson takes seven wickets on Test debut for England. West Indies skittled out for 121 runs on first day at Lord's. England reach 189 for 3 at close of play, a lead of 68 runs.

German referee Felix Zwayer ruled that Denzel Dumfries had fouled Harry Kane in the box. Kane confidently converted the penalty, despite his past miss against France in the 2022 World Cup, leveling the score at 1-1.The game appeared destined for extra time until Watkins, substituted in for Kane, received a pass from fellow substitute Cole Palmer. With his back to the goal, Watkins turned and fired low into the far corner in the first minute of stoppage time, leaving the Netherlands stunned.England's journey under Gareth Southgate has been less than convincing, yet they have managed to reach their second consecutive European Championship final.

Jaiswal, making his presence felt after not playing in the T20 World Cup, launched his innings with a couple of fours and a six in the opening over.Gill continued the momentum with a stylish on-drive and a six over fine-leg off the bowling of Richard Ngarava. Despite a promising start, India’s scoring rate slowed, with the team accumulating 55 runs in the powerplay without losing a wicket. Zimbabwe’s fielding was subpar, resulting in extra runs and dropped catches.Zimbabwe skipper Sikandar Raza momentarily shifted the tide, dismissing Jaiswal with a reverse sweep catch at backward point and Abhishek Sharma, who was caught in the deep. Gaikwad, batting in an unusual position, showed his prowess by accumulating boundaries and sixes, finishing with four boundaries and three sixes to his name.After India set a target of 182, Zimbabwe’s chase began with Avesh Khan removing opener Wessly Madhevere early. The home team’s struggle continued as they lost five wickets for just 39 runs. The partnership between Myers and Clive Madande (37 off 26) brought some stability, adding 77 runs off 57 balls.Washington Sundar , expected to play a more significant role post the retirement of Ravindra Jadeja, made a notable impact, taking three wickets. Additionally, Avesh Khan’s two wickets were crucial in curtailing Zimbabwe’s chase.After Avesh bounced out opener Wessly Madhevere in the second over, the wickets them kept falling for the home team.However, Zimbabwe did well to stead the ship after losing their first five wickets for 39 runs. The 77-run stand off 57 balls between Myers and Clive Madande (37 off 26) put much needed life into the game.Blessing Muzarabani (2/25) stood out as Zimbabwe’s best bowler, extracting extra bounce from his deliveries. However, that too was not enough to restrict an in-form Indian batting lineup.The next match in this five-match series is scheduled for Saturday, July 13. India’s recent victories have seen them recover the momentum after losing the series opener.",India beat Zimbabwe by 23 runs to take 2-1 lead in five-match series.

1st Test: Atkinson's magnificent seven scuppers West Indies for 121,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/1st-test-atkinsons-magnificent-seven-scuppers-west-indies-for-121/articleshow/111639961.cms,"NEW DELHI: England debutant Gus Atkinson took seven wickets, overshadowing James Anderson 's final appearance in the first Test against the West Indies at Lord's.On Wednesday's opening day, Atkinson secured a remarkable 7-45 in 12 overs, which contributed significantly to the West Indies' collapse to 121 all out.The build-up to this series had been focused on Anderson, who has a record-breaking 701 Test wickets, the most by any fast bowler.However, it was Atkinson who emerged as the star on the day.Atkinson's performance included taking three wickets in just one over, creating an unforgettable debut. In contrast, Anderson did not add to his tally of Test wickets until he dismissed West Indies' last man, Jayden Seales, lbw, concluding the innings.West Indies debutant Mikyle Louis was the top scorer for the visitors with 27 runs, as his team was dismissed in under 42 overs.The West Indies came into the game with an inexperienced top order, featuring Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze, and Kavem Hodge, who collectively had just nine Test caps before this match. Following the toss, held in overcast conditions, England captain Ben Stokes opted to field, and the West Indies struggled from there on.At the beginning of the day, Anderson was brought straight into action. Despite a probing new-ball spell and conceding just 11 runs in five overs, the 41-year-old was unable to dislodge West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite or opener Mikyle Louis early on.At the other end, Chris Woakes faced some resistance when Louis hit a legside six off his bowling. Louis, at 23, is the first West Indies Test cricketer from St Kitts. The West Indies were banking on Brathwaite, playing his 90th Test, to build a strong innings, but he was dismissed for just two runs when he chopped onto his stumps off Atkinson's second ball in Test cricket.Louis's promising 58-ball innings ended just before lunch when he was caught by Harry Brook at third slip off Stokes, reducing the visitors further.The West Indies' troubles were compounded when Hodge's aggressive cut off Woakes was brilliantly caught by Ollie Pope at point, leaving the batsman in disbelief as he sunk to his knees. Hodge managed to score 24 before his dismissal.Atkinson returned to bowl the 35th over, having already claimed two wickets before lunch. He first had Athanaze caught by Joe Root in the slips for 23 and then delivered a superb ball that Jason Holder edged to Harry Brook. Joshua Da Silva, coming to the crease, narrowly survived a hat-trick but was caught by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, another Test debutant from Surrey, off his next ball.Atkinson's final figures, after securing the wickets of Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, are the second-best by an England bowler on Test debut. His performance is second only to Dominic Cork's 7-43 against the West Indies at Lord's in 1995.Reflecting on their plight, West Indies were 88-3 when Atkinson's spell further dismantled their lineup. Nonetheless, their batting in overcast conditions, combined with the inexperience of their line-up, clearly impacted their performance.The conclusion of the innings came when Anderson, showcasing his skill one final time in Test cricket, dismissed Jayden Seales lbw. This day will be remembered for Atkinson's incredible debut, marking his potential as a significant future asset for the England cricket team.","Gus Atkinson took seven wickets on his Test debut for England against the West Indies.

There was speculation that Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole, who is representing Mazgaon CC in this election, will contest, but he withdrew in favour of Patil.Following the untimely demise of Amol Kale in New York on June 10, the MCA will conduct the election of its president on July 23 at the Wankhede Stadium. Now, the scrutiny of the candidates will take place on Thursday, while the candidates can withdraw till 5pm on July 16.On a dramatic day, T20 League Governing Council chairman Vihang Sarnaik (Shiv Sena MLA (Shinde) Pratap Sarnaik's son) too had filed his nomination for the MCA president's post, but withdrew his nomination a few hours later. In case Ajinkya Naik or Sanjay Naik win the presidential election, there would be a by-election within 45 days for the vacant post of secretary/vice-president.

It wouldn't have been nice on my part to turn their request down, since I respect all of them a lot. You can notice the difference in the MCA's administration from 2022 till now, compared to that of 2019-22. In the last 20 months, we've won eight titles, including the Ranji Trophy. As an administrator, I've strived to provide the right environment and culture for cricket excellence, and transparency in the system.

Amongst the 375 eligible voters are: 211 maidan clubs, 77 office clubs, 37 schools and college clubs, and 50 former international players of the city.""I've filed my nomination from the Ashish Shelar-Pawar group, and I'm confident about winning because of my team. Ashishji gave the go-ahead, and I've spoken to the Apex Council members and trustees of the MCA before filing my nomination,"" Sanjay Naik told this paper. ""Earlier in the MCA, when the president's post became vacant mid-term, it was the vice-president who took over the post. It is the VP who would chair the meeting in the absence of the president. In principle, I should've become the MCA president, but the constitution says that there should be an election for the post, which is not wrong, since the others too have aspirations for the post. It will be a healthy contest,"" he added.""I've been associated with the MCA for the last 26 years. All the MCA members know me well. After he came to know about my interest in contesting the MCA elections, Nana Patole (Maharashtra Congress president) decided to back me,"" said Patil.Earlier, Sarnaik withdrew from the race, and mentioned in a post on 'X': ""Dear friends, I wanted to let you know that I had initially put forth my name for the position of MCA president. However, after much thought, I have decided to take back my candidature as some of my fellow colleagues (who are also office-bearers) are also running for the same position. I'm excited about continuing to work for and support the cause of cricket, both now and in the future.

""The BEST batter I have faced in my career is..."" 😮 | James Anderson Fan Q&A

NEW DELHI: Seasoned England fast bowler James Anderson , who is set to retire from Test cricket after the match against the West Indies at Lord's, praised legendary Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar as the greatest opponent he has ever bowled against.With 188 Test matches under his belt, he stands second on the list of players with the most appearances, after Tendulkar (200) in the longest format of the game.With an impressive tally of 700 wickets from 187 matches, Anderson currently holds the third spot on the list of highest wicket-takers in Test history.This final match also presents him with an opportunity to surpass legendary spinner Shane Warne's record of 708 wickets.During a Q&A session on Sky Sports Cricket , the 41-year-old pacer was asked about the best batter he has faced throughout his remarkable career.Interestingly, Anderson overlooked many contemporary stars, instead naming Indian legend as the most formidable batter he has encountered.""The best batter I would have to say is Sachin Tendulkar,"" Anderson stated.Having played 39 Tests against India, Anderson has claimed a total of 149 wickets, dismissing Tendulkar on nine occasions.When questioned about the best bowler he has faced, Anderson acknowledged the prowess of Australia's Glenn McGrath and South Africa's Dale Steyn .""The best bowler I faced probably Glenn McGrath or Dale Steyn. Hard to pick between the two. Slightly different bowlers, but both world-class,"" he remarked.Reflecting on his career, England's all-time leading wicket-taker in Tests singled out his dismissal of former Australian captain Michael Clarke in the 2013 Trent Bridge Test as his most memorable wicket. However, when it came to the achievement he takes the most pride in, Anderson surprisingly chose his batting performance.""Career achievement I am most proud of his getting 81 at Trent Bridge against India. I know, I probably should pick a wicket or bowling performance, but getting 81 with the bat, I think, it is just something I still can't believe I have done,"" he shared.","James Anderson is set to retire from Test cricket after the match against the West Indies at Lord's.

The seasoned batsman has set his sights on contributing to the country's cricketing aspirations, marking a significant shift in his professional journey. KKR experienced a remarkable run of success under Gambhir's leadership, clinching the coveted trophy in both 2012 and 2014.However, in the years that followed, the team struggled to replicate their winning formula. The elusive silverware seemed to slip through their grasp repeatedly, despite their relentless efforts.KKR's journey in the subsequent seasons was marked by near misses and disappointing exits. They reached the finals in 2021, showcasing their potential, but fell short of ultimate glory. From 2016 to 2018, the team consistently made it to the playoffs, only to be eliminated before reaching the pinnacle. In five other seasons, their campaign ended prematurely in the group stages, leaving fans and management yearning for a breakthroughAmidst this prolonged drought, Shah Rukh Khan , the team's owner, decided to turn to a familiar face – someone he had relied upon in the past.""Make it or break it. This is your own franchise,"" Shah Rukh had told Gambhir when he asked him to rejoin the franchise as a mentor.Gambhir and his companion ceased their discussions about cricket and focused solely on the former's role as a mentor and guide.Gambhir's bold moves, such as acquiring Mitchell Starc for a record-breaking Rs 24.75-crore in the IPL and encouraging lead spinner Sunil Narine to open the batting aggressively, became the focal points of the IPL 2024 season.Despite his limited coaching experience, Gambhir emerged as the leading candidate for the most prestigious and demanding position in international cricket.However, with Gambhir's departure from KKR following the successful 2024 campaign and the likely exit of assistant coach Abhishek Nayar, who oversees the KKR Academy, to join him in the Team India coaching staff, the purple franchise is left with an immediate void to fill.Chandrakant Pandit, KKR's head coach with one year remaining on his contract, acknowledged the situation as a ""big challenge"" for the team.""We will enter the IPL as the defending champions , so it's going to be a big thing. Every year you play, every tournament you compete, is a big challenge for coaches, support staff, and players,"" Pandit told PTI.""Everyone contributed, and similarly, Gautam, coming with his great experience as a captain and mentor, also helped the team. Obviously, his inputs and mentoring of the players equally benefitted.""It's going to be a big challenge and a responsibility for us to rebuild the side but I'm sure we will do a fine job,"" he said looking ahead to the IPL 2025 Mega Auction which is happened every three years.The franchises have the option to keep three players from their current squad, while they can also use the RTM (right-to-match) card to acquire one released player during the auction.Although the mega auction is expected to take place in the beginning of the upcoming year, it is uncertain whether KKR will retain their veteran players, Narine and Andre Russell, who were both retained prior to the IPL 2022 mega auction.""It's just one month or so after the IPL. We have to keep working as we do every year. We will discuss. As of now there has not been any discussions all our options are open.""""The important mega auction is coming up. We will have to think about the players' roles and then see the combinations. We will have to study like every other team,"" added the astute tactician, who had coached Vidarbha to successive Ranji titles in 2018 and 2019 and then handed Madhya Pradesh their maiden triumph in 2022.Pandit will undoubtedly feel the absence of Gambhir on a personal level, especially considering the conversations they shared during their triumphant journey to secure the IPL title.""Obviously yes, We had a good rapport, discussing team strategies and planning with the captain to achieve better combinations. Obviously, we will miss the communication we had.But he has a bigger responsibility on his shoulders, Pandit added.""We're extremely elated with Gambhir being appointed as the head coach of the Indian cricket team. I'm sure he will do a wonderful job, as he has been doing over the last few years.""He has been pivotal for the success of KKR over the years, and also played big roles in India winning the World Cups in 2007 (T20I) and 2011 (ODI).""He carries a lot of experience and is definitely the right choice. I'm really happy for BCCI.""Yesterday, I messaged him, congratulated him. It's a prestigious job and a prestigious role he is going to play for our country. Obviously, I was very happy to message him. He also messaged me back.Asked whether he was sounded out about Nayar too following suit of Gambhir, Pandit said: ""This is also in the news.""""He (Nayar) has also done a great job with KKR for the last few years. He was equally valued to us. If someone gets the opportunity to excel in their career, one should be happy about that,"" he signed off.","Gautam Gambhir leaves Kolkata Knight Riders to join Team India coaching staff.

By no means was he playing his tidiest tennis, but he was sticky, as solid as a slab of concrete and completely centered. He was the immovable object. And whoever thought the maverick Russian was capable of that.In a rematch of this year's Australian Open final -- where Jannik Sinner recovered from two-sets-to-love down to win in five sets - the lanky Medvedev, built more like a high jumper than a tennis player, came through to make his second successive Wimbledon semifinals with a 6-7 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (4), 2-6, 6-3 win.There was no celebration from Medvedev after he wrapped up the win on Centre Court in four hours, he simply looked at his box --- where his coaches Gilles Cervara and Gilles Simon and wife Daria -- were on their feet clapping.The first of the men's singles quarterfinals between world No.1 Sinner and the No.5 Medvedev, their 12th meeting, with the Russian winning the first six and the Italian locking up the next five was about many things in the first four sets, including illness. Sinner was forced to take a medical timeout as he was overcome with dizziness. The deciding fifth set, however, was all about nerve.Medvedev broke the top-seed in the fourth game and didn't look back.""I knew if I wanted to beat Jannik it needs to be a tough match,"" Medvedev said. ""He's not anymore, a guy you can beat easy. At one moment he was not feeling that good and this can get away, but he started feeling better. I'm happy that I managed to stay at a high level.""Medvedev said it wasn't easy to go up against an opponent who was clearly struggling. ""It's always tricky, you want to play more points to make him suffer in a good way, but at one point, he will go, 'ok I can't run anymore' and go full power. That's what Sinner did.""In women's action, Donna Vekic of Croatia made her first Grand Slam semifinal in her 43rd start at a major when she put New Zealand's Lulu Sun to shade with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-1 win on Tuesday.Meanwhile, it has been raining every day at this south-west London suburb, more so in the last few days, where play on the outside courts (read not Centre and No.1 both of which have roofs) has been erratic. On Tuesday, it was as late as 4 pm when action on the outside courts started. Consequently, first rounds of the mixed doubles are yet to be played, forcing organizers to move the final from Thursday to Sunday.All the rain has made the courts slippery, on Monday Novak Djokovic slipped a few times on Centre Court, but it has been far worse on the outside courts.

When asked about his thoughts on the high number of extended matches at this year's rain-affected Wimbledon, Medvedev suggested that the playing surface might be a contributing factor.""I don't know. Maybe the level is closer than before,"" said Medvedev. ""In my opinion, grass is always a surface where it's very tough to win like straight three sets. One break can decide the outcome of the set.
