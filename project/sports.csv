In stark contrast to their Punjab counterparts, the CSK spinners gave away 44 runs in five overs without any return.But Bairstow's attempt to be too cheeky ended his stay. The England batter went for a cute ramp shot off Shivam Dube, but could only manage to feather it to MS Dhoni behind the stumps.However, Rossouw and Shashank Singh (25 not out, 26b) made 44 runs in quick time as PBKS remained ahead in the game.Rossouw, who pummelled Dube and Thakur for a six each, had a brilliant chance to make a fifty. But his attempt to smash Thakur's low full-toss out of ground resulted in his stumps getting rearranged.But those were minor irritants in an otherwise polished effort as Shashank and skipper Sam Curran (26 not out, 20b) knocked off the remaining runs without much fuss during their unbroken 50-run alliance.Earlier, Gaikwad braved a sluggish Chepauk pitch to make a solid fifty, but CSK struggled massively against Punjab spinners – Harpreet Brar and Rahul Chahar.Gaikwad and Ajinkya Rahane (29, 24b) added 61 runs for the opening wicket but they consumed 49 balls.There were flashes of intent too. Gaikwad played a fine upper cut off pacer Arshdeep Singh for a boundary and Rahane creamed three fours in a row off Curran, including a lovely cover drive.The slide of CSK began once PBKS brought their spinners on immediately after the Power Play that yielded a satisfactory 55 runs.Rahane tried to slog sweep Brar but his skier ended in the hands of Rossouw in the deep.But the left-arm spinner inflicted a bigger blow in the next delivery, trapping Dube, who was named in India's T20 World Cup squad, leg before for a first-ball duck.Dube, promoted to No. 3 to counter spin, failed to connect an almighty heave off a fuller ball on the middle-stump by Brar, and he had to walk back despite seeking help from DRS.In the next over, leg-spinner Chahar got rid of Ravindra Jadeja, who was deceived by a delivery that turned into him a whisker to beat his prod.It was a total shutdown for CSK between sixth and 10th over, losing three wickets for just 16 runs.For a team that generally bosses the middle passage between the seventh and 15th over making runs at a rate of 10.6, the CSK was a shadow of their marauding self, managing just 47 runs against PBKS.A big chunk of credit should go to two Punjab spinners -- Brar and Chahar -- who exploited a slow track to the hilt to return with combined figures of 33 in eight overs for four wickets.They also did not concede a single boundary in their spell.Gaikwad did his best to bring CSK back into the match, using his wide array of shots against pacers Harshal Patel and Curran, and reached his fifty in 44 balls.The right-hander brought up his third fifty in a row in this IPL with a six off Curran over long-on as they took 20 runs in that over. CSK made 60 runs in the last five overs.",Punjab Kings beat Chennai Super Kings by seven wickets in IPL match. Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw score half-centuries for PBKS.

NEW DELHI: In the upcoming 49th match of IPL 2024 , Chennai Super Kings (CSK) will host the Punjab Kings (PBKS) on Wednesday. CSK showcased their dominance in their recent match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, securing a commanding win. They currently stand strong in third place on the IPL 2024 points table . Meanwhile, PBKS also clinched a resounding victory against the Kolkata Knight Riders but finds themselves in the eighth position on the IPL 2024 team rankings.This sets the stage for an intriguing clash between the two teams as they vie for crucial points in the tournament.In their head-to-head battles, CSK holds a slight edge, having emerged victorious in 15 out of their 28 encounters against PBKS. However, in their last five matches, PBKS has dominated, securing victory four times.Overall, the head-to-head record stands at 15 wins for CSK, 12 wins for PBKS, and one match ending in a tie. It sets the stage for an exciting clash between the two teams with both sides aiming for a crucial win in the tournament.Also see: IPL live score The MA Chidambaram Stadium pitch for the CSK vs PBKS match has shown a change in behavior compared to previous seasons, favouring batters more. The matches have been competitive, suggesting a high-scoring and close game.Also see: IPL match result In IPL 2024 at this venue, teams batting first have won three matches, while those batting second have won two. The average first innings total is 188, with the second innings averaging 161. The highest total recorded was 213/4 by Lucknow Super Giants against Chennai Super Kings, and the lowest was 134/10 by Sunrisers Hyderabad against Chennai Super Kings.Considering the pitch, more batters from the team chasing could be a good option, especially with the dew factor potentially making batting easier in the second innings. For bowlers, spinners and pacers who can bowl well in the death overs with variations and yorkers should be valuable.He has been on fire in IPL 2024, amassing 447 runs in just 9 innings after a somewhat average start to the tournament. His recent performances have been outstanding, playing pivotal roles in CSK's batting lineup. With his current form and impact on the team, Gaikwad emerges as a safe pick for fantasy contests. He's currently sitting in second place in the IPL 2024 Orange Cap race.The medium-pacer for PBKS, has been a standout performer, bagging 14 wickets in 8 matches so far in IPL 2024. Despite some expensive spells, Patel has consistently taken wickets, making him a valuable asset for his team. Given that the match will be played at the Chepauk wicket, known for favoring bowlers, Patel should be a top choice from the bowling section.The Bangladeshi bowler for CSK, has also been in stellar form, claiming 14 wickets in 8 matches. He currently sits second in the Purple Cap race, just behind Jasprit Bumrah, albeit with a slightly higher economy and average. Rahman's bowling style, particularly his change of pace, is well-suited to the Chennai pitch, making him a potent threat. In this match, he'll be aiming to overtake Bumrah and claim the top spot in the IPL 2024 Purple Cap race.Jonny Bairstow, Sam Curran(c), Rilee Rossouw, Jitesh Sharma(w), Shashank Singh, Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh, Prabhsimran Singh, Rishi Dhawan, Vidhwath Kaverappa, Shivam Singh, Prince Choudhary, Vishwanath Singh, Nathan Ellis, Atharva Taide, Tanay Thyagarajan, Liam Livingstone, Sikandar Raza, Chris Woakes, Harpreet Singh Bhatia, Shikhar DhawanAjinkya Rahane, Ruturaj Gaikwad(c), Daryl Mitchell, Moeen Ali, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni(w), Deepak Chahar, Tushar Deshpande, Mustafizur Rahman, Matheesha Pathirana, Sameer Rizvi, Shardul Thakur, Shaik Rasheed, Mitchell Santner, Rachin Ravindra, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Prashant Solanki, Mukesh Choudhary, Simarjeet Singh, RS Hangargekar, Maheesh Theekshana, Nishant Sindhu, Aravelly Avanish, Richard GleesonWicketkeepers: Jonny Bairtsow, Jitesh SharmaBatters: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Daryl Mitchell, Shashank Singh, Shivam DubeAll-rounders: Ravindra Jadeja, Sam CurranBowlers: Harshal Patel, Mustafizur Rahman, Matheesha Pathirana","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) will host the Punjab Kings (PBKS) on Wednesday.

"Sanju Samson: T20 World Cup: Forever padded up, door opens for Sanju Samson",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-forever-padded-up-door-opens-for-sanju-samson/articleshow/109743192.cms,"Rajasthan Royals' captain Sanju Samson gestures after his team's win against Lucknow Super Giants. (AFP Photo)

KOCHI: Just like his batting, Sanju Samson 's name always creates a buzz on social media. His talent has never been in doubt ever since he announced his arrival before the cricketing world with his exploits in the IPL and the Champions League T20 in 2013, as former players rave about his strokeplay.However, after making his international debut in a T20 international in Harare back in 2015, critics have always questioned the Kerala wicketkeeper-batsman 's inconsistency.This has meant that the 29-year-old has only managed to play 25 T20Is and 16 ODIs in the last eight years.However, this IPL season has been different for Samson for more reasons than one. The Rajasthan Royals skipper has led his side with aplomb, which sees his team sitting at the top of the IPL points table with 16 points from nine games.But more importantly, this has been Samson's most consistent run in the IPL, with a match-winning unbeaten 33-ball 71 in Royals’ last game against Lucknow Super Giants being one of the high points of his career. He has amassed 385 runs from nine games at an average of 77 and a strike rate of 161.08 and is placed sixth in the run-scorer's chart in this IPL.Batting at no.3, Samson has been the glue in a star-studded Royals’ batting lineup and has switched his roles as an anchor and aggressor easily.But this change in Samson's batting hasn't come overnight.""For the last eight months, Sanju has trained specifically keeping the T20 World Cup in mind. He knew performance in the IPL just before the World Cup would be crucial. Our focus was more on his mental make-up before he went out to bat and while he was at the crease. He started focusing on the process. This change has reflected in his batting,"" says Bijumon N, who has been Samson's personal coach for the past year.""We did some minor alterations to his batting technique. If you notice now, his bat swing has changed and it is more free flowing,"" he added.Throughout his career, Samson was always at ease against pace bowlers but found himself susceptible to spinners. But as is evident in this IPL, there has been a marked improvement in that facet of his game.""I don’t agree with the assumption that Sanju is not good at tackling spinners. But against the real slow bowlers, at times he has found it difficult. To counter that, he has started to use his feet more now. On the tactical front, he has added a couple more strokes to his armoury against the spinners and has started playing each ball on its merit,"" revealed Bijumon.Bijumon travelled with Samson wherever Kerala played domestic cricket in the last season, and their training sessions always revolved around the bigger goal in mind.""During our training sessions in Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram, and Bengaluru, we did a lot of match simulations keeping in mind the IPL and the T20 World Cup. Even now, we keep talking over the phone after Rajasthan's each match and discuss the scope for improvement in his game,"" he said.However, the composition of the Indian team bound for the US means that Rishabh Pant will, in all probability, be the first-choice keeper of the team management. Having pipped the other contenders for the second wicketkeeper's slot, Samson's chance to make it to the playing XI is only likely to arise if Pant's form dips or if one of the top-order batters has a wretched run.There is a popular joke in Kerala cricket circles that India will only win World Cups if a Malayali is in the squad. Sunil Valson, a Kerala native, who played for Delhi in domestic cricket, was part of Kapil's 1983 World Cup-winning squad while S Sreesanth was in the Indian team that lifted the 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup. Will Samson prove to be Team India’s lucky charm in the US and the Caribbean?",Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson has led his side with aplomb. Samson has amassed 385 runs from nine games at an average of 77.

You decided that you don't want them. That's why neither Rohit Sharma nor Virat Kohli was seen in T20Is. You had said that we will go with all the young boys,"" Pathan remarked, pointing out the management's earlier preference for young players over experienced campaigners.However, Pathan expressed surprise at the apparent reversal of this approach in the current squad selection, where experience seems to have taken precedence over youth. He emphasized the importance of adhering to a consistent selection process, suggesting that while experience may be crucial, following a defined process could lead to better outcomes.""But when the talk of the World Cup came up, then you felt that you should still go on the basis of experience here. You should always go on the basis of experience, especially on difficult wickets. But if there is a process, then that process needs to be followed completely. In this you can get better results,"" Pathan insisted, highlighting the need for clarity and transparency in the selection criteria.Pathan's disappointment was particularly evident in the absence of young talent like Rinku Singh from the squad. ""I am very disappointed with Rinku Singh's absence here,"" Pathan lamented, expressing concern over the exclusion of promising players and the potential impact on team dynamics.In contrast, cricketing legend Sunil Gavaskar offered a different perspective, attributing Rinku's exclusion to his current form in the ongoing IPL.""Maybe his form in this particular edition of the IPL hasn't been great.

NEW DELHI: Young fast bowler Mayank Yadav 's continued participation in the remainder of the IPL round-robin stage hangs in the balance following a suspected abdominal muscle tear suffered during the recent match against the Mumbai Indians.This marks the second injury setback for the promising pace sensation from Delhi within the span of four weeks.Amidst this setback, there's a silver lining for the 21-year-old cricketer.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is reportedly preparing to offer him a pace bowling contract , alongside fellow talents Umran Malik, Vidwath Kaverappa, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Yash Dayal, and Akash Deep.Under this contract, Mayank will come under the supervision of the National Cricket Academy 's (NCA) Sports Science and Medical team. They will assume responsibility for managing his injury and overseeing his fitness regimen, a departure from his current arrangements with the IPL franchise Lucknow Super Giants ""Mayank has a tear but it is more likely a grade 1 tear. It will be cutting it fine but in case LSG qualifies for the play-offs, he might just be able to play the knock-out games. But it is like hoping against hope and right now he is doubtful for the remaining IPL games,"" a BCCI source informed PTI on condition of anonymity.Mayank Yadav made a spectacular entry onto the IPL stage, showcasing his talent with 155 km/h deliveries and earning consecutive 'Player of the Match' awards at the outset of the tournament. However, his fortunes took a downturn when he suffered an injury breakdown in the third match, sidelining him for four weeks.His much-anticipated return against the Mumbai Indians on Tuesday seemed promising after passing fitness assessments. Yet, his comeback was short-lived as he was compelled to retreat to the dugout after bowling 3.1 overs, during which he conceded 31 runs.Had Mayank been fit all this while, there was a possibility of him being a left-field selection in the T20 World Cup but right now, handling him with care is the primary job of the Indian cricket establishment.""He will soon be handed a pace bowling contract and once he is in BCCI Pathways structure, his growth will be systematically monitored.""The national selection committee and the Indian team management would like to gradually blood him and ensure that he can maintain peak fitness,"" the BCCI source added.",Young fast bowler Mayank Yadav's continued participation in the remainder of the IPL round-robin stage hangs in the balance.

He had dropped around 13 kg before the IPL started, in the last week of March. Interestingly, he is now around 9 kg lighter than his pre-accident weight.During an exclusive interview with TOI after being declared fit by BCCI on March 12, Pant had said: “I can’t wait to get back into the Indian dressing room and enjoy the feeling with my teammates. I have left no stone unturned to do that. I ensured nobody gets a chance to complain about any aspect of my game.”Along with his fitness routines, Pant put himself through a punishing diet.“He adopted a calorie-deficit diet since late December. If his body demanded 1400 calories a day, he was given around 1000 calories. It was tough on him since he had to train very hard to gain match-fitness and had to strengthen the muscles on his injured right leg,” a source involved in Pant’s rehabilitation said.His favourite food — rasmalai, biryani and fried chicken — was banished from his dining table. Even sushi, a dish considered healthy for the fitness conscious, was not allowed.“Pant wanted flavour in his food. That’s why he moved into a rented house in Bengaluru while he was at the NCA, instead of a hotel. He preferred home-cooked food. He was allowed only 5 ml of extra virgin olive oil. He couldn’t give up his love for chilly chicken. So, a recipe was derived to make it with that much oil. Goan bhindi was one of his favourites,” the source said.Not just the diet, he had to adhere to a strict sleep cycle too.“All gadgets, including phones, iPads and TVs were shut down by 11 in the night. He had to have eight-nine hours of uninterrupted sleep to get back to rigorous training next morning,” the source said.As he got closer to full fitness, Pant batted for about two and a half hours every day. He resumed his wicketkeeping drills on the heels of the IPL, practicing his glovework for about 45 minutes a day.The results are there for everyone to see. Pant looks as lean as he was when he first burst onto the scene. Now, cricket watchers can’t wait to see Pant in India colours again, that too in a World Cup.","Rishabh Pant has shed a total of around 16 kg in the past four months. He had dropped around 13 kg before the IPL started, in the last week of March. Interestingly, he is now around 9 kg lighter than his pre-accident weight.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109744485,imgsize-65772,width-400,resizemode-4/109744485.jpg"

From his emergence as a promising talent at the ICC T20 World Cup 2007 to his current status as one of the most revered figures in the sport, Rohit's evolution has been nothing short of extraordinary.Debuting in international cricket in 2007, Rohit swiftly made his mark with a string of impressive performances.His ability to anchor innings with grace and power has endeared him to fans worldwide, earning him a reputation as one of the finest batsmen of his generation.A pivotal moment in Rohit's career came during the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where his promotion to the opening slot proved to be a masterstroke. Since then, he has redefined the art of opening batting, amassing over 10,000 runs in ODIs with a staggering average of 49.12, including a monumental 264 – the highest individual score in ODI history.Not content with excelling in white-ball cricket, Rohit has also left an indelible mark in the longest format of the game. With over 4,000 runs in Test cricket at an average of 45.46, he has cemented his place as a dependable opener, capable of withstanding the toughest bowling attacks.Rohit's leadership prowess has been on full display, particularly in the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he has led the Mumbai Indians to a record-breaking five titles. His astute captaincy and ability to inspire his teammates have made him a revered figure in the world of T20 cricket.The 2023 ODI World Cup served as another chapter in Rohit's storied career, where he finished as the tournament's second-highest run-scorer, showcasing his mettle on the grandest stage of them all.As Rohit continues to mesmerize cricketing aficionados with his elegant strokeplay and calm demeanor, his legacy as one of the game's true icons only continues to grow.

NEW DELHI: The national selection committee, headed by Ajit Agarkar, will convene in Ahmedabad on Tuesday to meet with BCCI secretary Jay Shah. The purpose of this meeting is to finalize the 15-member squad for the ICC T20 World Cup in the Americas, although the official announcement may be delayed by a day.Shah, who also serves as the convenor of the senior selection committee (men), has prior political commitments that are keeping him occupied.Therefore, the selection meeting will be held in Ahmedabad to accommodate his schedule.Key discussion points during the meeting will include deciding on the second wicketkeeper's slot and assessing the inclusion of all-rounder Hardik Pandya in the squad.It's understood that KL Rahul , with an IPL strike rate of 144 and 378 runs in the tournament so far, and Sanju Samson , who has scored 385 runs at a striking rate of 161, are vying for the second wicketkeeper's position.Despite Samson's impressive performances for Rajasthan Royals as their captain this season, marking the first time in over a decade he's shown such consistent form for his IPL team, his batting at No. 3 isn't likely to secure him a spot on the Indian team.Another school of thought is that someone like Samson, who has 25 T20Is under his belt but an average of just 20 and a strike rate of around 135, should not be considered based on just one good IPL season.In case of Rahul, it can be said that one senior member of the coaching staff will certainly go all out to push for his inclusion but many believe that the stylish right-handed batter's approach in T20 cricket remains archaic.However, he is still considered a better bet than Samson at No. 5 or 6 on slowish Caribbean tracks.The other option, Jitesh Sharma, is in very poor form, while Dhruv Jurel hasn't got a chance to keep wickets. During the last game in Lucknow, he did get an opportunity to bat long and scored a fifty.Left-handed batter Tilak Varma, who is also a handy off-spinner, remains an option along with pacer Sandeep Sharma, the Punjab veteran whose slower variations at the death have played a big role in Rajasthan Royals' surge to the top of the IPL table.","The national selection committee, headed by Ajit Agarkar, will convene in Ahmedabad on Tuesday to meet with BCCI secretary Jay Shah.

Here's what Samson's other RR teammates had to say:

If you have to pick one player who has never stopped knocking on the doors of BCCI selectors, it has to be Sanju Samson; and the 29-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman has deservingly been rewarded with a place in India's T20 World Cup squad.The Rajasthan Royals captain, who has been leading the team by example in this IPL, has been picked in India's squad as the second wicketkeeper-batsman besides Rishabh Pant, but both Samson and Pant have the batting credentials to be in the playing eleven as pure batsmen as well.Talking about Samson, under whom RR top the points table currently with a staggering 8 wins in 9 matches, the Kerala man sits at No. 7 on the list of top run-getters of IPL 2024 with 385 runs in 9 matches, including four half-centuries, at a strike rate of 161.08 and average of 77.0.Hailing his recall to India colours, RR posted a video on social media where Samson's teammates are congratulating him for his T20 World Cup selection.""Congratulations my Chintu bro,"" said RR leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal , who incidentally will also make his India comeback at the T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings ' skipper, Ruturaj Gaikwad , attributed their seven-wicket loss to Punjab Kings to the absence of frontline bowlers Matheesha Pathirana and Tushar Deshpande , compounded by significant dew at the Chepauk Stadium .CSK struggled to post a competitive total, managing only 162/7 despite Gaikwad's impressive 62. The team encountered difficulty facing the accurate spin bowling of Harpreet Brar and Rahul Chahar.CSK was forced to make two changes due to Pathirana's injury and Deshpande's illness. However, replacements Richard Gleeson and Shardul Thakur failed to make an impact as heavy dew hampered their performance during Punjab Kings' chase.""It is a real problem (not having Pathirana and Deshpande). There are phases where you want to get a wicket, and you have only two bowlers, plus the spinners are out of the question because of the dew. Can't do much,"" Gaikwad rued during the post-match presentation.The skipper added that the dew compounded CSK's problem as they tried to restrict PBKS batters.""It's very difficult. Even in the last game, we were quite surprised that we would win by that much margin.""This (dew) is something we can't control. We can slightly bat better in the first innings. In the last two games, we tried our best to get 200-210. It was tough to get 180 on this pitch,"" he said.Gaikwad said another 50-60 runs would have made the difference.""50-60 runs short to be honest. When we were batting first, the pitch wasn't great, plus the dew as well (in the second innings).""The CSK skipper also expressed frustration over his luck with the toss, lamenting that despite his efforts, he couldn't seem to find the right formula to call it correctly.""I have practiced (toss) a lot. I tossed it in the match. I am winning in the practice, but not winning in the match. What to do. I am really under pressure at the toss, not at the game,"" said Gaikwad.PBKS' stand-in skipper Sam Curran who played a crucial role with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 26, said beating CSK at their home turf was always a great feeling.""Anytime you come to Chennai and get two points, it is a huge feeling. Last year also we lost all our home games and won the away games. We are getting a hint of the formulas.""Curran said winning the toss gave PBKS a massive advantage, given the dew factor which comes into play in the second innings.""Pretty obvious, winning the toss was huge. KG (Kagiso) Rabada set the tone wonderfully. We thought today we'll give him the new ball and he stormed in.""Leg-spinner Chahar was simply unplayable and returned figures of 2/16. Curran acknowledged the role of spinners.""Chahar has come back into the team really well. We tried something different in the 19th over. He showed the confidence to bowl to MS (Dhoni), which was great. The spinners were the pick of the bowlers.""I bowled and got hit. The pace bowlers were going all the way, so thankfully it (spin) worked. This game is tough for the bowlers, we have got to be creative,"" added Curran.Rilee Rossouw, who scored 43 for PBKS, said his side could still enter the playoffs.""Never over till it's over.

Everytime you come to Chennai and take two wins, always a special feeling. Same as last year, we lost a lot of our home games and won away, finding a similar pattern. We are in a position where we need to win all our games, we come up against the same opposition in a few days. I think when you come to Chennai, you know how hot it is and dew is going to settle in. Today we wanted to try something different by trying Rabada in the powerplay.

Asked Rilee what he reckoned and took that gamble with spin. In this game where everyone has been going for runs, you need to take such gambles. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. We come against the same opposition so we have one up on them. It is a new game, new conditions but this win will give us a lot of confidence.

Initially slow to gather momentum, openers Gaikwad and Ajinkya Rahane found their footing, with skipper striking a crucial four off Arshdeep Singh's third ball.Their partnership flourished, with Gaikwad and Rahane hammering Arshdeep for 14 runs and Sam Curran for 18 runs, propelling CSK to 55/0 at the end of the powerplay.However, CSK suffered setbacks in the 9th over, losing Rahane and Shivam Dube to Harpreet Brar. The wickets continued to fall, with star all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja departing early, courtesy of Rahul Chahar. Despite some wayward bowling from Harshal Patel in the 15th over, CSK's momentum remained intact.Gaikwad, the standout performer, accelerated to his half-century in 44 balls, including a stunning six that amassed 20 runs. However, his departure for 62 off Arshdeep Singh's bowling in the 16th over halted CSK's surge.In the final overs, Punjab Kings' bowlers managed to contain CSK, with Chahar removing Moeen Ali for 15 runs.

India will kick off their World Cup campaign against Ireland in New York on June 5.Following BCCI 's announcement of India's 15-member squad, there was backlash on social media for Pandya's appointment as captain Rohit Sharma 's deputy.Was appointing Pandya in leadership role a wise decision given his struggles ever since his return to cricket following an ankle injury during the ODI World Cup last year?Former Indian allrounder Irfan Pathan believes that premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah would have been a more suitable choice for India's vice-captaincy in the mega tournament.""Selection processes typically involve meticulous planning. However, there have been concerns regarding the clarity of planning, evident in decisions like excluding Rinku Singh from the squad despite earlier inclusion plans,"" said Irfan talking to Timesofindia.com.""Following the (last) T20 World Cup, there is a shift in strategy from avoiding senior players to including them for their experience. Clarity in planning is crucial... Previously, Hardik Pandya had the captaincy, but (now) Rohit Sharma took over for T20 matches.""Post the T20 World Cup, there was a new plan; they (BCCI) aimed for a younger team with Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav as potential captains,” Irfan, who was part of India's only T20 World Cup triumph in 2007, added.""Hardik Pandya being vice-captain, I understand the rationale behind it due to the importance of continuity in leadership...Yet, I believe someone like (Jasprit) Bumrah wouldn't have been a bad choice either,"" Irfan further saidPandya, who replaced Rohit Sharma as Mumbai Indians captain ahead of the IPL 2024, has scored 197 runs and taken only six wickets in 10 games, with his team sitting in ninth place.He also faced booing in the early IPL matches after taking over as Mumbai Indians captain from Rohit who led the franchise to five titles.""Yet, questions arise regarding Pandya's performance consistency and commitment to Indian cricket. Regular participation in domestic cricket is essential for serving Indian cricket throughout the year. Injuries are inevitable, but proper planning involving consistent match play, including domestic cricket, is vital for a player's return. But then there's this one player who returns from injury without fulfilling the same requirements. That shouldn't happen because it sends the wrong message to the rest of the team. When they see one player receiving special treatment, it disrupts the team environment,"" the former allrounder said.""Cricket isn't like tennis; it's a team sport where equality is vital. Every player should be treated fairly and equally. Regardless of whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned player like Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli, cricket is a team sport first and foremost. I've witnessed things in the past, particularly during the T20 World Cup last year, that went against the principles of Indian cricket—instances where certain players were given undue advantage, which is unacceptable,"" Irfan, who is a cricket expert and commentator on Star Sports Press Room, said.""To succeed in tournaments like the World Cup, it's imperative that every player is treated fairly and equally.

NEW DELHI: The United States and Mexico have withdrawn their joint bid to host the 2027 Women's World Cup , just weeks before FIFA is set to vote on the tournament's host at a meeting in Bangkok.The two countries' football federations announced in a joint statement that they will now focus on submitting a successful bid for the 2031 tournament.This unexpected decision comes as FIFA officials prepare to hold an open vote at the FIFA Congress in Bangkok on May 17 to determine the 2027 hosts.With the US-Mexico bid withdrawn, two contenders remain: a joint bid from Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and a solo bid from Brazil.The United States had been aiming to host the women's football flagship event for the third time, having successfully hosted the tournament on its own in 1999 and 2003.However, the withdrawal of the US-Mexico bid for 2027 comes amidst a crowded calendar of large-scale sporting events in North America. The region is already preparing to host the men's 2026 World Cup , the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in 2024, and this year's 16-team Copa America.According to US Soccer, postponing their bid until 2031 will provide tournament organizers with more time to plan and incorporate lessons learned from the region's hosting of the 2026 men's World Cup. ""Hosting a World Cup tournament is a huge undertaking -- and having additional time to prepare allows us to maximize its impact across the globe,"" said US Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone .""I'm proud of our commitment to provide equitable experiences for the players, fans and all our stakeholders.

NEW DELHI: Renowned Inter Miami star and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi took a break from his football duties to attend the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics on Monday night.Accompanied by his teammates Jordi Alba , Sergio Busquets , and Luis Suarez , who also played with him at Barcelona, Messi arrived at the arena just before tip-off.The group, with some wearing Heat attire and Busquets donning a Heat hoodie, entered through the players' parking garage and were escorted via a VIP entrance to their suite seats above the lower level.Although Messi had previously visited the arena for at least one other event, this marked his first arranged attendance at a Heat game since relocating to Miami last year.Inter Miami have been performing exceptionally well in the Major League Soccer (MLS) this season, boasting a 6-2-3 record and currently leading the Eastern Conference with the highest points tally in the league.Messi's contributions have been instrumental, with two goals and an assist in Inter Miami's recent 4-1 victory over New England on Saturday. He has achieved the remarkable feat of having multiple goal contributions in five consecutive matches, a first for any MLS player.Throughout his illustrious career, Messi has amassed over 800 goals for both club and country, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in soccer history.His crowning achievement came in 2022 when he led Argentina to the World Cup title, scoring twice in the final against France. The match ended in a thrilling 3-3 draw, with Argentina ultimately triumphing 4-2 on penalty kicks.","Lionel Messi attended the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics.

ISL: Mumbai see off Goa to set up final showdown with Bagan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mumbai-see-off-goa-to-set-up-final-showdown-with-bagan/articleshow/109703553.cms,"MUMBAI: Jorge Pereyra Diaz wanted to lap up every second of it. The Argentinian striker had just given Mumbai the lead in the second leg of their Indian Super League semifinal against FC Goa , putting the Islanders 4-2 ahead on aggregate, and he was in the mood to celebrate.Joining him were thousands of Mumbai City fans who made sure their delight was heard around the 7000-capacity Mumbai Football Arena.They had to wait until the 69th minute for that joyous moment, and it was to get even better seven minutes from the end of regulation time.This time it was Lallianzuala Chhangte who timed his run perfectly from inside his half to latch on to a sublime assist from Vikram Partap Singh, neatly take it past Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, and tap the ball into the net to make it 2-0. For the second time in five days, Goa were left crestfallen.They had been looking good to arrive here with a 2-0 lead from their first leg at Fatorda last Wednesday. But in a matter of six crazy minutes in the closing stages of that game, the Gaurs watched in agony as Chhangte and Vikram turned that lead into a 3-2 win in favour of the Islanders.Despite that slap in the face, Manolo Marquez's side, backed by around 250 travelling fans, would have come to Mumbai encouraged by their form on the road, having scored in their last nine away games. It's another matter that they were up against the league's meanest defence, and the latter eventually won.Mumbai's 2-0 victory on Monday and a 5-2 win on aggregate has earned them the right to take on Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Saturday's final. Petr Kratky's side will look at it as a chance to avenge their narrow defeat to the Kolkata giants a fortnight ago on the last day of the league stage which saw Bagan thwart Mumbai's hopes of becoming the first team to defend the League Winners Shield.For now though, the Islanders will cherish a win they had to work extremely hard for, against an opponent who has challenged them each time they have met this season.They may have endured a nightmare finish to the first leg of this semifinal but Goa managed to make a positive start here, looking clearly to their American winger Noah Sadaoui to launch attacks down the left channel.After his tremendous impact as a second half substitute in Fatorda, where he produced two sublime assists for the goals that contributed to Mumbai's jaw-dropping comeback, Jayesh Rane was duly rewarded with a starting spot on this occasion. But the midfielder struggled to get his teeth into the game for most of the first half.The home side soon settled and would come the closest to scoring in the opening 45 minutes when they struck the post twice, first through a Tiri header off a corner, and later when Chhangte wasn't able to curl his left-footed effort enough.In his pre-match press conference, Marquez had admitted that the Gaurs could well find themselves in a situation where they would have to take increased risks. That moment arrived in the second half when Mumbai captain Rahul Bheke saw his header off Yoel van Nieff's corner cleared off the goal line by Goa defender Nim Dorjee Tamang. But Pereyra Diaz was there, as he usually is, perfectly placed, to poke the ball home.Vikram has scored eight times for the Islanders in the league this season, including a hat-trick against NorthEast United in March, but the forward showed how well he can create opportunities too, releasing Chhangte with a delightful pass around Goa's defence, as Mumbai's number 7 got the home support going again with a fine finish.There are likely to be questions raised about the relevance of the ISL playoffs going forward, with the format now really holding no significance apart from the prize money on offer. What there can be little doubt about though, is the two best teams over the course of the 2023-24 campaign will clash for the trophy at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday!","Mumbai City beat FC Goa 4-2 on aggregate to reach Indian Super League final.

Premier League clubs take step towards spending cap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-clubs-take-step-towards-spending-cap/articleshow/109702643.cms,"(With Reuters inputs)

Premier League clubs have taken a significant stride towards introducing a spending cap, with a vote on Monday endorsing the completion of economic and legal assessments necessary for such a model.Reports from British media indicate that the proposed model will be presented to clubs ahead of a final vote at the league's Annual General Meeting, potentially in June.If approved, it would supplant the existing Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR) starting from the 2025-26 season.The introduction of a spending cap aims to curb excessive spending by clubs, thus mitigating the risk of super-rich teams monopolizing the league. Concerns over the widening gap between financially endowed clubs and their counterparts have underscored the necessity for such measures.Discussed at a Premier League shareholders' meeting, the proposed cap would be tied to the revenue of the lowest-earning club in the league, primarily derived from television rights.Implementation could be as early as the 2025-26 season, marking a proactive step by the league to promote financial fairness and competitive balance among its member clubs.""We will obviously wait to see further details of these specific proposals but we have always been clear that we would oppose any measure that would place a 'hard' cap on player wages,"" the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said.""There is an established process in place to ensure that proposals like this, which would directly impact our members, have to be properly consulted on,"" the statement added.Media reports indicate that 16 Premier League clubs have voted in favor of the league exploring the implementation of a salary cap. However, notable clubs such as Chelsea abstained from the vote, while Manchester City , Manchester United, and Aston Villa dissented.Manchester City's dissent is particularly noteworthy as the club faces over 100 charges of allegedly breaching the league's financial regulations. Despite the allegations, the club has maintained its innocence.The urgency for financial reform in the league has been highlighted by recent penalties imposed on clubs like Everton and Nottingham Forest for breaching the Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Everton faced a deduction of points, while Forest appealed a similar penalty.In April, Premier League clubs had initially agreed to introduce new financial regulations for the upcoming season, opting for squad cost ratio rules to replace the PSR. If adopted at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in June, the new rules could limit clubs to spending 85% of their revenue on transfers, wages, and agents' fees.Although the PSR will remain in place for the next season with a transition period in 2024-25, points deductions will continue to be a part of the league's disciplinary measures even under the new regulations.","Premier League clubs have taken a significant stride towards introducing a spending cap.

NEW DELHI: Amelie Mauresmo , the tournament director of Roland Garros , indicated on Thursday that former world number one Rafael Nadal is unlikely to receive a seed at the upcoming French Open next month.Nadal himself expressed uncertainty on Wednesday regarding his participation in this year's tournament, despite his remarkable record of winning the French Open a record 14 times.At 37 years old, Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, has seen a significant drop in his ranking, currently standing at 512, following an extended absence due to a hip flexor injury that kept him sidelined for almost a year.Although he has secured a place in the main draw of the French Open via his protected ranking, this ranking does not guarantee seeding, as seeding is determined by the top 32 ranked players.Without a seed, Nadal could potentially face formidable opponents in the early stages of the tournament.Traditionally, Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam event that did not strictly adhere to the ATP and WTA rankings, instead considering a player's past performances on grass courts when determining seeding. However, this approach faced criticism from players, including Nadal, leading to its abandonment in 2020.Asked about Nadal being seeded at this year's French Open, Mauresmo told reporters: ""Right now it's not a topic...""Wimbledon did it for a very, very, very long time, and it certainly brought some advantages but we also saw all the disadvantages it could bring. For the moment, it's not on the table.""We're keeping our fingers crossed for him above all, for us too obviously. We're keeping a close eye on what's happening for him on court.

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal declared on Wednesday that he'll only participate in the upcoming French Open if he feels ""capable enough to compete well.""The 14-time Roland Garros champion acknowledged that if the event commenced today, he wouldn't be ready to take part. However, he pledged to persevere in his efforts to secure the opportunity to play at his most triumphant tournament for one final time.""I don't know what's going to happen in the next three weeks.I will keep fighting and doing the things I believe I have to do so I can try to play in Paris, and if I can play, I play, if I can't, I can't,"" the former world number one told reporters at the Madrid Open on Wednesday.""I will not play in Paris if I am the way I am now. If Paris were today, I wouldn't take to the court. That's the reality. I will only play in Paris if I feel capable enough to compete well.""Nadal made his tennis comeback in Brisbane in January after nearly a year of sidelined recovery from a psoas injury. However, his return was cut short due to a muscle issue sustained in Australia, limiting him to just five matches this season.Last week, he began his clay campaign in Barcelona, exiting in the second round. Now, he is poised to take on 16-year-old American Darwin Blanch in his Madrid opener on Thursday.""I don't think I'm ready to play at my 100 percent but I'm prepared to go out and play tomorrow. It's important for me to play one last time here in Madrid, for me it means a lot,"" said the 37-year-old Nadal.As he attempts to resume his 'Last Dance' in Madrid and say goodbye to one of his favourite tournaments on court, rather than on the sidelines, the 22-time major champion admits his farewell tour hasn't been as enjoyable as he would have hoped.""A few weeks ago, I didn't know if I will be able to play again on the professional tour, so today I am playing,"" he added.""It's not perfect, of course not perfect, but at least I am playing and I can enjoy again, especially in the few tournaments that are so emotional for me. I'm able to enjoy the fact that I can say probably good-bye on court.""Nadal says he's hitting the ball well when he is able to be on court but ""it's about more body limitations. I went through a lot of things last year and a half, two years"".""So body feelings are not enough good to feel myself playing with freedom enough in terms of body issues.
