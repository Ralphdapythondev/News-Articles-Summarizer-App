""She's such a great player, really tough opponent.""Earlier this year, Navarro emerged victorious against Sabalenka in a hard-fought three-set match at Indian Wells.

The India A team is under the leadership of renowned Indian batsman Shubman Gill , while Abhimanyu Easwaran is at the helm of India B.During the match, Shubman's unique taped-up jersey has garnered significant attention from spectators.The precise reason for the tape remains uncertain, but it is speculated that it could be due to Gill not having access to his usual '77' jersey.Alternatively, he might have temporarily borrowed a teammate's jersey and opted to cover the number to prevent any confusion.It is worth noting that Shubman has a particular affinity for the number 7.In a previous revelation during his participation in the U19 World Cup, Shubman shared that he initially wanted to sport the number 7 jersey but had to settle for doubling the number to 77 when it was unavailable.","India A and India B are currently facing off in the opening match of the Duleep Trophy 2024, being held at Bengaluru's M.

My observation is that in the last three-four years, the management and captains have not shown patience to develop the spinners,"" he told PTI.Akmal expressed his concern regarding the exclusion of seasoned spinners from the team. He mentioned that players like Yasir Shah, Noman Ali, Sajid Khan, Bilal Asif, Zahid Mahmood or Usman Qadir should not have been overlooked without proper justification.""When Babar (Azam) was captain, he kept some spinners in the squad but never bothered to play them regularly. Unless spinners get constant exposure, how will they come through?"" he said.Akmal highlighted Pakistan's successful track record in home matches, where they have triumphed by employing a balanced attack of fast bowlers and spinners.""Even when we were forced to play in UAE, we won Tests mainly because of our spinners,"" he said.""We don't have pacers who are as strong as those we had in the past and yet we are expecting them to win us the series. The recent series against Bangladesh is an example.""""Where is Yasir Shah? Isn't he still active in first class cricket? Where has Noman Ali gone? Didn't he take wickets? Did he get punished? He had appendicitis in Australia, got operated on, and was then sidelined.""""What was Usman Qadir's fault? What was Sajid Khan's fault? What was Bilal Asif's fault? All of them have taken five-wicket hauls and yet are out of the team,"" he said.Akmal said Pakistan batters' 'legs start to give way' against pacers. ""Our batters are comfortable against pacers bowling at 130-140 kmph, but when they face a pace of 140 kmph or more, and they see that on the scoreboard during the match, their legs start to give way,"" he said.""See how we struggled against Nahid Rana and Taskin Ahmed who bowl 140 kmph plus. Look at the way our main batters were dismissed,"" he said.Akmal emphasized that players should prioritize domestic cricket rather than solely focusing on overseas leagues.""They prefer to go and play in useless foreign leagues to earn money and this is not helping them develop their skills. This lack of commitment towards domestic cricket is leading to inconsistent performances at the international level.""Kamran said there was nothing wrong with players wanting to earn money from foreign leagues. ""But I think as a professional you have to balance your schedule and ensure that while you earn money you also improve yourself as a player for your country,"" he added.Akmal said Babar is struggling for form due to some technical flaws.""He is unsure of himself and his off-stump early on and has this tendency to leave his leg stump exposed.

Brief Scores:

BENGALURU: Had fans been asked to pick a dream XI at the start of the opening day of the Duleep Trophy match, they would most likely have passed up 19-year-old Musheer Khan , especially when there were the likes of Rishabh Pant, Sarfaraz Khan and Yashasvi Jaiswal to choose from.But those seasoned hands came a cropper under cloudy skies at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, trudging back to the pavilion with little to show which left India B at the bottom of a crater.That was until 19-year-old Musheer (105 batting; 227b; 10x4; 2x6) turned showstopper, making an impressive Duleep debut. Musheer, in the company of Navdeep Saini (29 batting), took the fight to India A with their unbroken 108-run association for the eighth wicket.By the time Musheer made his way out to the crease, the clouds were beginning to lift and he made hay while the sun was shining. India B were 94/7 at one stage, but by stumps they had reached 202/7.Musheer made the most of a lifeline offered to him when Avesh Khan grassed a return catch when the batter was on 67. Patience was Musheer's watch word. He scored just six runs from his first 52 deliveries. His first boundary came off the 66th delivery.It was only in the 50th over of the day that Musheer began to open up by dispatching Kuldeep Yadav for consecutive boundaries. The former India U-19 player brought up his fifty in 118 deliveries and upped the ante when he started to approach his third first-class century in seven outings.Musheer's Mumbai teammate Tanush Kotian was at the receiving end. A slog sweep through deep square-leg signalled his first maximum of the game. Three balls later, he danced into the 90s with a six over deep midwicket. Musheer brought up his century in 205 balls.Earlier, sent into bat, India B openers Jaiswal (30) and Abhimanyu Easwaran (13) looked to see through the tricky opening hour and were largely successful until Easwaran decided to throw away his wicket. Chasing a wide Avesh delivery, Easwaran miscued it to wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel, who almost flew in front of KL Rahul at first slip to latch on to the catch.Jaiswal, after a slow start, warmed up with a couple of boundaries off Khaleel Ahmed (2/39), before he fell to a short ball, trying to cut but ended up holing it to substitute Shaswat Rawat at backward point.This brought the Khan brothers to the crease. At lunch, Sarfaraz (9 off 28) and Musheer (6 off 52) ensured there were no further casualties with 65 runs coming off 30 overs. Third over after lunch, Avesh angled in a delivery which caught Sarfaraz on the pad. The second session, saw the India B bowlers tightening their bowling with Akash Deep (2/28) claiming the prized wickets of Pant and Nitish Reddy off consecutive deliveries.India B 202/7 in 79 overs (Musheer Khan 105*, Yashasvi Jaiswal 30; Khaleel Ahmed 2/39, Akash Deep 2/28, Avesh Khan 2/42) vs India A",19-year-old Musheer Khan makes impressive Duleep debut for India B.

Then Saini bhai gave me a lot of confidence saying he will play whether it is two balls or six balls in an over, and just keep faith in him.""He was also able to match my thinking and approach while batting. But generally, I was trying to defend the first three or four balls and then take a single,"" he elaborated.A notable aspect of Musheer's innings was his adept handling of Kuldeep Yadav. Five of his ten boundaries came off the left-arm wrist spinner, including two successive shots down the V. Conversations with senior players like Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant played a crucial role in his preparation.""This is the second time I am playing Kuldeep bhai. We have some experienced players in our side like Shubman bhai and Rishabh bhai who told me which of Kuldeep bhai's balls will be effective and off which ones I can score runs. But once I got set, batting became easy on this wicket,"" said Musheer.The 19-year-old Mumbaikar also termed the opportunity to play in Duleep Trophy as a fine learning experience.""This is a good learning experience for me as there are a lot of senior players in my team and in opposition.""I am observing the way they think, their confidence and how they prepare for a practice session and a match,"" he added.","India B batsman Musheer Khan scores unbeaten century on opening day of Duleep Trophy match. 19-year-old helped India B to 202-7 in overcast weather at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.

Her time with the USWNT, which began in 2009, has been defined by deep camaraderie, unwavering support among teammates, and a collective fight for greater recognition and investment in women's sports.Her on-field accomplishments are equally impressive. Morgan was instrumental in securing two FIFA Women's World Cup titles for the USWNT, in 2015 and 2019, and played a key role in the team's gold medal victory at the 2012 London Olympics.She departs the international stage as a true legend, having earned two US Soccer Female Player of the Year awards (2012, 2018) and etched her name in the record books.""I grew up on this team, it was so much more than soccer,"" Morgan told the USA football website.

NEW DELHI: The Ballon d'Or , first awarded to Stanley Matthews in 1956, remains the most coveted individual prize in football. Over the years, legends like Lionel Messi Cristiano Ronaldo , Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Zinedine Zidane have lifted this iconic trophy.However, the voting process for the Ballon d'Or has evolved, particularly since the end of the FIFA and France Football collaboration between 2010 and 2015.The voting criteria have also undergone changes as of 2022. Previously, journalists considered a player's performance from January to December of the previous year, as well as their overall career.Now, the focus is on the individual's performance across a single European season, spanning from August to July. Additionally, factors such as team success, player behavior, and fair play throughout the season are taken into account.This shift in the voting process aims to provide a more accurate assessment of a player's impact during a specific timeframe.By narrowing the evaluation period to a single season and incorporating additional criteria, the Ballon d'Or seeks to recognize the most deserving footballer based on their recent performances and overall contribution to their team's success.A panel of journalists from the top 100 FIFA-ranked nations for men’s football and the top 50 for women’s football cast the votes.Journalists rank their top five players. Points are awarded as follows:- 1st place: 6 points- 2nd place: 4 points- 3rd place: 3 points- 4th place: 2 points- 5th place: 1 pointVoting is based on players’ performance over a single European season (August to July), team success, player behaviour, and fair play, since 2022.France Football, the organizers of the Ballon d'Or, implemented several modifications for the 2022 edition, one of which involved the selection of voters .Previously, a media representative from each of over 180 countries was chosen to receive a ballot, ensuring the Ballon d'Or's status as a truly international award. These representatives were responsible for selecting their top five choices for the men's award, and France Football then tallied the votes to determine the ultimate rankings.Beginning with the 2022 edition, France Football decided to restrict the field of nations that had a media member with a ballot.The organizers limited the list to the top 100 nations from the FIFA men's world ranking for the men's award and the top 50 nations from the women's world ranking for the women's award.The purpose of this change was to guarantee that only nations with a well-established football culture and regular access to and coverage of major leagues and competitions worldwide were given a say in determining the winner of this esteemed award.This year's list of 30 nominees for the Ballon d'Or, to be presented on Oct. 28, surprisingly omitted Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, marking the first time since 2003 that neither player made the cut. Messi, the record eight-time winner and current holder of the trophy, recently left European soccer to join Inter Miami, while Ronaldo moved to Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia. Notably Cristiano Ronaldo has won 5 Ballon d'Or.Despite Messi's continued high-level performance and his role in Argentina's Copa America victory in July, he will not defend his title this year.The nominations feature a new generation of talent, including Vinicius Junior , Rodri, Jude Bellingham , Kylian Mbappé, Erling Haaland, and Harry Kane . Emerging teenage star Lamine Yamal of Spain also earned a nomination.The favourites to win the Ballon d'Or this year include Real Madrid's Vinicius Junior and Bellingham, as well as Manchester City's Rodri. Haaland, who was runner-up to Messi last year, is also a strong contender.The prestigious Ballon d'Or award, established by the renowned France Football magazine, has been honoring the world's finest soccer players for decades. As the sport continues to develop and fresh, promising athletes rise to prominence, this esteemed accolade persists in acknowledging the cream of the crop in the realm of football.The Ballon d'Or remains a symbol of excellence, celebrating the extraordinary achievements and skills of those who have left an indelible mark on the beautiful game.","Voting is based on players’ performance over a single European season (August to July), team success, player behaviour, and fair play, since 2022.

Buddy Battle: Sinner will start as the hot favourite against Draper at US Open,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/buddy-battle-sinner-will-start-as-the-hot-favourite-against-draper-at-us-open/articleshow/113111465.cms,"After taking out

Sinner

meets 'good friend'

Draper

in semis

Jannik Sinner was asked to pick an emergency contact from the Tour at a media activity for players recently. The world No.1's answer matched the pace of his returns.""I'm good friends with Jack, so I'll go with Jack Draper ,"" the 23-year-old said.Sinner and Draper - friends and occasional doubles partners - will clash in the US Open semifinals on Friday.The top-seeded Italian and the 25th-ranked Briton, some four months apart in age, have stood across the net from each other just once in the pros, three years ago at The Queen's Club tournament in London. Draper, ranked No. 309 at the time, beat Sinner, the world No. 23, to claim his first Tour-level win. The 22-year-old lefty pushed past a struggling Alex de Minaur 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 to reach his maiden Grand Slam semi-final on Wednesday.A few hours later, Sinner survived a roller-coaster quarterfinal against the 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev 6-2, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4 to power into his third major semifinal of the season.Sinner, the Australian Open champion, has now reached the semi-finals at all four Slams. Draper, who has grappled with a series of injuries early in his career, started the year ranked No.61 and is presently at his career best ranking. The Sutton-born pro was asked about his friendship with Sinner when accusations of favouritism following the announcement of the positive tests were swirling around the Italian.Draper and Sinner first met across the net in doubles at an ITF junior event. The Briton directed most shots at Sinner, who was seen as the 'weak link' on court. ""From there to watching his progress - winning the Bergamo Challenger (2019) to getting to the top 20 when all of us were 300, 400 in the world,"" Draper said, adding that the friendship found footing around the locker room. ""It started with sending messages to each other when we're having bad moments or good moments,"" Draper said.""It was a real good thing that we played doubles in Montreal. I loved being on court with him. It was strange being on court with someone that good. We played great doubles, and hopefully I get to play with him again. As a person, he's incredibly kind, genuine, funny, and that's more important than being the great player he is."" Friendship seems to be the theme of the US Open men's semifinals with the 26-year-old Americans Taylor Fritz and Frances Tiafoe also facing off in the last four. They are teammates and long-time friends. Sinner, whose play reflects the steel of his mentality, has no recollection of the doubles match against Draper in the juniors. ""I do remember seeing him from outside. Obviously lefty, there are fewer lefties (on Tour). His ball striking was always very, very good,"" Sinner said. ""In Montreal we got to know each other even more. It's a great friendship.""Draper, who hasn't lost a set so far, got his leg strapped midway through the quarterfinal, but dismissed injury worries with his play in the second half of the match. ""I watched the quarterfinal, he's hitting very, very strong. He's all-round a very good player,"" Sinner said of Draper's form. ""Also, it's the semis of a Grand Slam, it is going to be a tough match."" Even when the two men on either side of the net are great friends.","Jannik Sinner and Jack Draper will meet in the US Open semifinals on Friday. The world No.1 and the 25th-ranked Briton first met in doubles at an ITF junior event.
