captain talks to TOI on why India will move on quickly from the retirements of Kohli, Rohit and Jadeja in the shortest format...

Excerpts from an exclusive chat...

How do you see the next generation taking Indian cricket forward?

Who are the players from the India squad that you'll keep an eye on in Zimbabwe?

What are your expectations from Zimbabwe?

As the head coach of RCB, you've seen Virat Kohli from close quarters. Did you have an inkling he was going to retire from T20Is?

According to a survey, the T20 World Cup is gaining in popularity, even among players, and is on course to becoming the most important ICC event...

We had an IPL where 250-plus scores were achieved with regularity, and then the T20 World Cup where bowlers held sway...

(Watch India tour of Zimbabwe (5-match T20I series, July 7 onwards 4 PM IST) live on Sony Sports Ten 5 channels)

NEW DELHI: After their T20 World Cup triumph, India are back in action with a T20I series against a feisty Zimbabwe side. Nearly all the main team players have been rested from the India squad for this trip, while three heavyweights in Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja have retired from the format.Andy Flower , former Zimbabwe captain and current RCB head coach, spoke to TOI about what to expect from the five-game series.This India-Zimbabwe series is going to be really interesting. It's a very strong side the Indian selectors have put out. All these guys have not only shown a lot of talent in the IPL but also have the attitude required to play international cricket. There are readymade replacements for the guys who've retired, even though they are genuinely great cricketers. The strong domestic structure in India means there will always be readymade replacements. It's certainly nothing to be scared of. India will keep producing these greats. There is always someone ready to come in. Whenever some of the great cricketers have retired, you think they won't be and cannot be replaced. But people move on very quickly. All eyes adjust and focus on the next talent that comes along.If I put my IPL coaching hat on, then I'll have to keep a keen watch on the players. (Yashasvi) Jaiswal didn't play a single match in the T20 World Cup but he is an incredible option. Shubman Gill , by his standards, had a quiet IPL but he looks a very intelligent player. He plays in a similar way to Virat Kohli. I'm looking forward to Abhishek Sharma performing. I really like the look of Dhruv Jurel. Watching him in the Test series against England, he did brilliantly. Riyan Parag has the swagger that you need in international cricket.Their biggest player is Sikandar Raza even though he is 38 years old. He has been quite a late bloomer. I want to see how Blessing Muzarabani, a very tall, right-arm fast medium bowler, performs. Muzarabani with his bounce can trouble the Indian batters.I hadn't thought about it (Kohli's retirement). I was a little surprised. I really enjoyed working with Virat in the IPL last season. I have utmost respect for him, obviously as a player but also the way he supported Faf du Plessis and myself and Mo Bopat, the director of cricket. He is a brilliant role model. He is an outstanding professional sportsperson. He looks after himself really well. He is disciplined without being robotic. He laughs and has fun, has a cheeky sense of humour and takes the mickey out of people. He always mixes in with team gatherings and he is very approachable. He has a very good cricket brain and can think out of the box too.I'm surprised. I think the 50-over World Cup, because it's played every four years, holds more importance. I think there's a danger in playing a T20 World Cup every two years... it becomes commonplace. I wouldn't like anything called the 'World Cup' to be a commonplace. I like the rarity of a World Cup. But I also do feel that T20 World Cups help in growing the game globally. Two of the best stories to come out of the recent World Cup would be Afghanistan and the USA.The next IPL may see big scores again. I'm not sure what'll be done about the 'Impact Player' rule. It wasn't a favourite in the dressing room. The tempo and the power game is going to continue in the IPL. In the World Cup, some of the small scores were mainly due to the pitches on offer. The ICC will need to be careful about the surfaces that are being provided for marquee tournaments like the World Cup. In cricket, there should always be a healthy balance between the bat and ball.","Andy Flower, former Zimbabwe captain and current RCB head coach, spoke to TOI about what to expect from the five-game series.

In fact, we all badminton players watched the T20 World Cup final live on TV and celebrated enthusiastically. We are happy and proud about their sensational win against South Africa in the final. Similarly, we had also achieved something remarkable a couple of years ago, but the state government did not even felicitate me, leave apart giving any cash rewards. Before 2022, the Indian badminton team had never even reached the semifinals but we created history by winning the title,"" said the 27-year-old, a recipient of Khel Ratna Award.The Maharashtra government announced a cash prize of Rs 11 crore for the T20 World Cup-winning Indian team on Friday.Chirag and Satwik were the first Indian men's doubles pair to reach world No. 1 ranking a few months ago.

They will face the Netherlands, who overcame Turkey in the other quarter-final match.The game in Duesseldorf was largely uneventful for the first 75 minutes until Breel Embolo gave Switzerland the lead by sliding in at the back post to convert Dan Ndoye 's deflected cross.However, England responded quickly, with Bukayo Saka scoring a fine goal from wide on the right, finding the far corner of the net to level the score just five minutes later.Despite a close call from substitute Xherdan Shaqiri, who hit the woodwork directly from a corner late in extra time, the match remained tied and proceeded to a penalty shootout.England converted all of their penalties, while Switzerland's Manuel Akanji was the only player to miss, with his attempt saved by Jordan Pickford.Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka, Ivan Toney, and Trent Alexander-Arnold all scored their penalties to send England through to the semi-finals, helping to ease the pain of their shootout loss to Italy in the Euro 2020 final.""We are not going to stop fighting, we are in another semi-final and we'll see where we can get to,"" said Southgate, who marked the victory in his 100th game in charge with a dance in front of the England fans.""Every now and then you think surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job.

The Swiss team has managed to reach the quarter-finals on five separate occasions, encompassing both the World Cup and the European Championships.

1st T20I: Bowlers shine as unfancied Zimbabwe stun India by 13 runs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-zimbabwe/1st-t20i-bowlers-shine-as-unfancied-zimbabwe-stun-india-by-13-runs/articleshow/111541579.cms,"NEW DELHI: A spirited Zimbabwe stunned a youthful India by 13 runs in the series opener in Harare on Saturday, registering their first win against cricketing powerhouse in eight years.Pulling of an upset of gigantic proportions, minnows Zimbabwe, who had failed to qualify for the recently concluded T20 World Cup, handed India them first T20I defeat of the year.Despite restricting Zimbabwe to just 115 for nine, India was bowled out for 102 in 19.5 overs, thanks to a determined effort by the Zimbabwean bowlers, led by Tendai Chatara (3/16) and skipper Sikandar Raza (3/25).India, having recently won the T20 World Cup with a different squad, were expected to easily handle the Zimbabwean but failed to do so, folding for their fifth joint-lowest T20I total.India's bowlers, led by leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (4/13), performed commendably on a pitch with some extra bounce and carry. Off-spinner Washington Sundar (2/11) also played a pivotal role as Zimbabwe struggled to build meaningful partnerships.Zimbabwe began their innings briskly, reaching 40 for two in the Powerplay. However, soon after that their batting frailties soon emerged.Following Kaia’s early dismissal, Wessly Madhevere (21 off 22 balls) and Brian Benett (22 off 15 balls) added 34 runs quickly before Benett was outfoxed by Bishnoi's googly. Bishnoi repeating the trick later claimed the wickets of Madhevere, Blessing Muzarabani, and Luke Jongwe, reducing Zimbabwe to 74 for three.Zimbabwe's middle and lower-order batters seemed to lose their way with their innings punctuated by runouts and soft dismissals. One such moment saw Jonathan Campbell, son of former Zimbabwe captain Alastair Campbell, involved in a mix-up that led to his dismissal. Campbell pushed an Avesh Khan delivery to the covers and set off for a single but changed his mind as his partner Dion Myers crossed the crease, eventually forcing Campbell to walk back.Despite the setbacks, Zimbabwe’s innings was buoyed by Clive Madande’s 29 not out off 25 balls, pushing their total past the 100-run mark. This resilient effort proved critical, as those extra runs became decisive.India's chase started poorly, faltering in the Powerplay itself. Abhishek Sharma , one of the three debutants alongside Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel , fell without scoring in the very first over. Sharma's cross-batted attempt off Brian Benett was caught in the outfield by Wellington Masakadza.Ruturaj Gaikwad (7) was next, succumbing to a slightly bouncier delivery from Blessing Muzarabani, which was edged to Innocent Kaia at first slip.Tendai Chatara then delivered a double blow, removing Parag (2) and Rinku Singh (0) within three balls in the fifth over. Parag’s attempt to loft over mid-off went to substitute Brandon Mavuta while Rinku Singh fell to a short-pitched delivery.Skipper Shubman Gill briefly steadied India with a sensible knock of 31 off 23 balls, including five boundaries.However, Raza soon disrupted his composure, bowling him out with a skidding delivery that breached Gill’s defense. With India at 84 for eight and soon 86 for nine, the chase seemed all but over.Avesh Khan (16 off 12) and Washington Sundar (27 off 34) added 23 runs for the eighth wicket, offering some hope, but Avesh's dismissal—caught by Raza at long-off off Wellington Masakadza’s full-toss—ended any prospects of recovery. India needed 16 runs in the final over, but could muster only two, as Zimbabwe celebrated a famous victory.Bishnoi’s career-best performance of 4/13 was a highlight for India’s bowling attack, which had otherwise managed to keep Zimbabwe largely under control.Bishnoi received significant support from Washington Sundar’s two wickets. Zimbabwe’s dissolution from a somewhat promising position of 74 for three to 115 for nine was primarily due to these two spinners, alongside the pace attack's contributions.The Indian team will need to regroup quickly with the second match of the series set for Sunday.The defeat calls for introspection, primarily concerning their batting approach under pressure. Despite the disappointment, the Indian bowlers showed promise and effectiveness, an area they would be keen to capitalize on in the upcoming clashes.","Zimbabwe stun India by 13 runs in T20 series opener in Harare.

Zimbabwe struggled to form meaningful partnerships after being asked to bat on a pitch that provided good bounce and carry.Zimbabwe started their innings briskly, reaching 40 for 2 in the Power Play segment, although the batters were not always convincing.Innocent Kaia was the first to go, dragging a Mukesh Kumar delivery onto his stumps.Wessly Madhevere and Brian Bennett then added 34 runs in quick time, highlighted by a 17-run over off left-arm pacer Khaleel Ahmed, where Bennett hit two consecutive boundaries.However, Bishnoi's dismissal of Bennett in the sixth over changed the trajectory of the innings. Bennett was unable to read Bishnoi's googly, a fate that also befell Madhevere, Blessing Muzarabani, and Luke Jongwe later in the innings. Zimbabwe crawled to 74 for 3 with the help of skipper Sikandar Raza's patient 17 off 19 balls, but then lost six wickets for 41 runs.Jonathan Campbell, son of former Zimbabwe skipper Alastair Campbell, exemplified Zimbabwe's panic when he pushed an Avesh Khan delivery to the covers and called for a single, only to change his mind and stay back, which resulted in Dion Myers being run out.The experienced Raza was Zimbabwe's last hope and briefly raised it by smashing Avesh Khan for a six over the bowler's head. However, the extra bounce generated by Avesh soon led to Raza’s dismissal, as his mis-timed pull landed in the hands of Bishnoi in the deep.Washington Sundar further dented Zimbabwe's innings by taking two wickets in consecutive balls, dismissing Myers for 23 and Wellington Maskadza for a duck. These wickets also marked Sundar completing 100 wickets in T20 matches.Clive Madande's cameo of 29 not out off 25 balls helped Zimbabwe to surpass the 100-run mark but did little to rescue the innings.Bishnoi's spell and Sundar's timely strikes ensured that Zimbabwe could never recover from their early losses, ultimately posting a modest total for India to chase.","Indian bowlers, led by leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi, delivered a dominant performance to restrict Zimbabwe to 115 for 9 in the first T20I of the five- match series.

Despite scoring 122 runs in four games, Azam has had to face severe criticism due to his moderate strike rate of just 101.66.Speaking to Cricket Pakistan, former Pakistani cricketer Mushtaq Ahmed drew a comparison between Indian cricket stalwart Virat Kohli and Azam while defending the latter's batting approach.He said, ""That (taking time) is his strength.

Cristiano Ronaldo , the Portuguese superstar, comforted his tearful teammate Pepe following their heartbreaking defeat to France in the quarterfinals of the European Championship in Hamburg on Friday. The loss came via a penalty shootout, marking a painful exit from what could potentially be their last major international tournament together.Pepe, performing admirably even at the age of 41, wept on Ronaldo's shoulder after Protugal's defeat.Ronaldo had also wept earlier in the tournament, after he couldn't convert the penalty against Slovenia in the extra time of their last-16 match -- a sight similar to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, when Ronaldo left the field in tears following Portugal 's defeat against Morocco in the quarters.On Friday, disappointment and regret writ large on the legend's face.The next major tournament, the 2026 World Cup, will be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. By then, Ronaldo will be 41 years old, raising questions about his ability to continue playing at the highest level, where he holds the men's record for international goals (130) and appearances (212).But he has now gone eight consecutive games without scoring in major tournaments. This includes all five of Portugal's matches atEuro 2024 and their final three games at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Although he successfully converted his penalty in the shootout against France, it wasn't enough to secure victory.“I won't say it publicly,"" Pepe replied when asked by TV station Canal 11 what Ronaldo said to him. ""But we feel it a lot. Contrary to what many people think, we feel it a lot. We feel the frustration of not winning a game, of being eliminated in such a big competition as the European Championship, knowing that we had a lot of quality to go through. That's the pain we feel.”Cristiano Ronaldo concludes his European Championship journey with an unparalleled 14 goals, remaining the tournament's all-time leading scorer, which is five goals more than Michel Platini, as mentioned in an AP report.Ronaldo's longevity and consistency are unmatched, as he stands alone as the sole player to participate in six European Championship tournaments.","Portugal lost to France on penalties in the quarterfinals of the European Championship.

However, in the sixth round, Venezuela's Wilker Angel had his penalty saved by Canadian goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.This set the stage for Ismael Kone, who stepped up and confidently scored the winning penalty to send Canada into the last-four stage.Canada will face world champions Argentina in the semifinals on Tuesday in New Jersey, with the winner advancing to the July 14 final. The match will be a rematch of the tournament opener, which saw Argentina secure a 2-0 victory.Canada became the fourth CONCACAF team to reach the Copa America semifinals, following in the footsteps of Mexico, Honduras and the United States.Despite scoring only one goal in their three group-stage matches, Canada started the match against Venezuela with unexpected intensity, and their efforts were rewarded in the 13th minute when Jacob Shaffelburg converted a cross from Jonathan David.After scoring, Shaffelburg held up the jersey of teammate Tajon Buchanan, who suffered a broken leg in training this week.Jesse Marsch's team squandered several opportunities to increase their lead in the first half, with Shaffelburg testing goalkeeper Rafael Romo from the edge of the area and David sending an effort wide of the post after finding himself through one-on-one.Venezuela pushed for a goal and enjoyed more possession but were mostly restricted to speculative crosses and long-range shots, with all-time leading goal-scorer Salomon Rondon twice forcing saves from Crepeau.In the second half, Canada's Cyle Larin fired over the bar from close range in the 52nd minute, while Venezuela's Jose Martinez sent a rebound high over the bar two minutes later.Venezuela finally equalized in the 64th minute through Rondon, who spotted Canada's Crepeau off his line and produced an audacious lob that sailed over the scrambling goalkeeper into the empty net. It was the former Everton and Newcastle United striker's 44th goal for Venezuela.Canada responded well to the equalizer, with substitute Liam Millar having an effort from a tight angle saved in the 67th minute and Tani Oluwaseyi sending two shots over the crossbar in the span of four minutes.

This match is likely to be remembered as Cristiano Ronaldo 's final appearance in the tournament.France converted all their penalties, setting up a semi-final clash with Spain.Portugal's Joao Felix was the only player to miss, hitting the post with his team's third attempt.The shoot-out triumph was a welcome change for France, who had previously suffered penalty heartbreaks in major tournaments. They lost the 2022 World Cup final to Argentina and were eliminated from the last Euros by Switzerland in the round of 16, both via penalties. Additionally, they were defeated by Italy in the 2006 World Cup final, which was also held in Germany.Kylian Mbappe, who had missed the decisive penalty against Switzerland, was substituted by Bradley Barcola during extra time and did not participate in the shoot-out. Barcola, along with Ousmane Dembele, Youssouf Fofana, and Jules Kounde, successfully converted their spot-kicks for France.""I am proud of my players. Even if we are not doing everything perfectly we don't give up,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps.""Once again we are in the semi-finals. I will savour this a little even if we have another game coming up.""Mbappe struggled to find his rhythm throughout the match, as he continues to adapt to playing with a protective mask covering his recently fractured nose, an injury sustained during France's initial encounter against Austria.Despite the setback, the young forward will have another opportunity to showcase his talents in the upcoming semi-final. On the other hand, Ronaldo, at the age of 39, seems to have made his final appearance in the European Championship.This tournament marked Ronaldo's sixth European Championship, but he was unable to contribute to his record-breaking tally of 14 goals in the competition, having failed to find the back of the net in all five of Portugal's matches in Germany.Although Ronaldo successfully converted his penalty, which was Portugal's first, Roberto Martinez's squad has been eliminated after failing to score in over six hours of play. They advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating Slovenia on penalties following a goalless draw in the round of 16, but this time, they fell short in what turned out to be a lackluster match in Hamburg.""In the same way that it was maybe cruel for Slovenia in the last 16, today it was cruel for us. That's football ,"" Bernardo Silva told CNN.France and Portugal, both underperforming in the tournament, faced off in a match that lacked intensity but had moments of excitement in the second half.Portugal started to threaten with midfield runners getting into the box, as Bruno Fernandes and Vitinha tested Mike Maignan, who was determined to maintain his clean sheet in open play. Ronaldo nearly scored from close range, but Maignan reacted quickly to deny him.France countered with Kolo Muani and Kounde combining, but Ruben Dias made a crucial interception.Deschamps brought on Dembele, who immediately set up a golden opportunity for Camavinga, which the midfielder missed. The game drifted towards extra time, where Ronaldo missed a good chance from Francisco Conceicao's cutback.Mbappe, France's captain, watched the end of extra time from the bench as Maignan denied Nuno Mendes at the very end of 120 minutes, leading to a penalty shoot-out.The shoot-out took place at the Portugal end of the Volksparkstadion, with Maignan not making any saves but not needing to. Despite Diogo Costa's heroics in the previous round, saving three Slovenia penalties, he could not stop any this time.","France beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties in Euro 2024 quarter-final match.

NEW DELHI: Portugal and France are set to clash in the European Championship quarterfinals on Friday, with the match featuring a showdown between soccer superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé . The victor will advance to the semi-finals, facing either Spain or tournament host Germany . The game is scheduled to kick off at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT) in Hamburg.Despite being pre-tournament favourites, both teams have struggled to impress. Portugal has failed to score in its last two matches, losing 2-0 to Georgia and drawing 0-0 with Slovenia before prevailing in a penalty shootout. Similarly, no French player has scored from open play at Euro 2024 , with their goals coming from two own-goals and a penalty by Mbappé.Ronaldo, appearing in his record sixth European Championship, broke down in tears after missing a penalty in extra time against Slovenia. At 39 years old, he has yet to score in the tournament, but if he does, he would become the oldest goal scorer in the competition's history. Meanwhile, Mbappé will continue to wear a protective mask due to a broken nose sustained in France's group opener against Austria. Coach Didier Deschamps suggested that Mbappé might need to wear the mask for months.The match holds historical significance, taking place exactly 18 years after the nations' meeting in the 2006 World Cup semifinals, where Zinedine Zidane scored the winning penalty. Ronaldo played the entire match, while the player of the match was Lilian Thuram, whose son, Marcus, is expected to feature for France in Hamburg.France will be without suspended midfielder Adrien Rabiot, likely prompting Antoine Griezmann to drop back into central midfield, with Ousmane Dembele potentially joining the forward line. Portugal coach Roberto Martinez has a full squad available, with no suspensions or injuries. Both Mbappé and Ronaldo, along with several of their teammates, risk missing the semifinals if they receive another booking.France has been defensively solid, conceding only one goal at Euro 2024 – a retaken penalty by Poland's Robert Lewandowski. Mbappé, at 25 years old, has scored 48 goals for France, while Ronaldo holds the men's record with 130 international goals.This marks the teams' third consecutive meeting at a European Championship, with a 2-2 draw in the group stage in 2021 (Ronaldo scored two penalties) and Portugal's 1-0 victory in the 2016 final.Ronaldo, set to make a record 212th appearance for Portugal, has taken 20 shots without scoring at Euro 2024.The UEFA European Championship 2024 quaterfinals between Portugal and France is set for July 5, Friday.The UEFA Euro 2024 fixture will be held at Stuttgart Arena in Stuttgart, Germany.

sons

emulating their illustrious fathers, who themselves shone for their national teams...

Lillian & Marcus Thuram

Sergio & Francisco Conceicao

Danny & Daley

Blind

Enrico & Federico Chiesa

Peter & Kasper

Schmeichel

Gheorghe & Ianis Hagi

Lillian Thuram is a former French defender who won the 1998 World Cup and also the 2000 Euro. He scored 2 goals in the 1998 semifinal against Croatia. Marcus Thuram, who is leading the line with France captain Kylian Mbappe , is still a work in progress.""I'm proud to wear the Thuram name on my back,"" said Marcus.Francisco Conceicao has already shown glimpses of his lineage when he scored a last-minute goal against Czech Republic and helped Portugal win the game. Old-timers watching the youngster were reminded of a similar looking right winger who was part of Portugal's Golden Generation. Sergio Conceicao, Francisco's father, even has a Euro hat-trick against his name vs Germany in the 2000 edition.In true Dutch and Ajax tradition, Daley Blind is a true disciple of Total Football just as his father Danny was. A long-serving Ajax faithful, Danny was the defensive anchor in a terrific Dutch and Ajaz generation of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Son Daley is an equally unflappable presence in the heart of the Dutch midfield.Enrico Chiesa was a former striker in the 1990s for a team that was always more famous for its defenders. Enrico made his presence felt at Euro 96 with his runs with Pierluigi Casiraghi before fizzling out. With Federico spearheading Italy's title charge at the last Euro, you could say the son has already surpassed his dad's legacy. This time, an unimaginative Italy gave way to Switzerland in the Round of 16.For Kasper Schmeichel, Denmark captain, it was his third Euro. A top keeper, Kasper is yet to reach the heights that his father Peter did with Denmark in 1992 when they won the Euro.Ianis Hagi, the Romanian midfielder, is the son of the great Gheorghe Hagi. The Maradona of the Carpathians as Hagi Sr is called is inarguably Romania's greatest. Ianis has shown similar flashes of intelligence and skill that made his father so famous, though even he knows he has huge, huge boots to fill.","Lillian Thuram is a former French defender who won the 1998 World Cup and also the 2000 Euro.

NEW DELHI: Despite Lionel Messi 's uncharacteristic penalty miss, Emiliano Martinez 's exceptional saves ensured Argentina's progression in the Copa America 2024.Martinez's heroic performance in the penalty shootout was the defining moment as Argentina overcame a resilient Ecuador to secure a spot in the semi-finals.The match itself was a closely contested affair, with Ecuador displaying a commendable performance against the defending champions.They created several promising opportunities in the first half, with Moises Caicedo and Jeremy Sarmiento testing Martinez's reflexes. Argentina gradually gained control and took the lead through Lisandro Martinez 's powerful header from a Messi corner.Ecuador's determination was rewarded in stoppage time when Kevin Rodriguez's glancing header forced the match into a penalty shootout. Despite Messi's uncharacteristic miss, Martinez's brilliance between the posts proved decisive, as he denied Angel Mena and Alan Minda with superb diving saves.Martinez's heroics in high-pressure situations have become a hallmark of his performances for Argentina. His penalty shootout heroics in the 2021 Copa America semi-final against Colombia and the 2022 World Cup final against France cemented his reputation as a formidable presence in such situations.Ecuador's performance, however, deserves praise. Felix Sanchez's team displayed tactical discipline and created enough chances to have won the game in regulation time. Their midfield trio of Moises Caicedo, Jeremy Sarmiento, and Kendry Paez caused problems for Argentina's defence, while Enner Valencia's presence up front kept the backline on their toes.As Argentina progress to the next stage, notably the semi-final, they will face the winner of the Venezuela-Canada match, with the prospect of another stern test on the horizon.",Argentina beat Ecuador to reach the Copa America 2024 semi-finals.

It is always better to have one more day. Yesterday we had good feelings and we'll take this day to define the team based on the response we get today,"" Scaloni told the reporters in the latest press conference, as quoted by AFP.The team will hold a training session on Wednesday, and Scaloni plans to make a decision regarding Messi's involvement after assessing his response during the session.Scaloni emphasized the importance of giving Messi an additional day to recover, acknowledging that it is always better to have more time.""We'll try to get him in and then, if he's not (ready), we'll look for the best solution for the team. I'll talk to him today. I think it's fair that he takes his time and trains as much as possible,"" he said.Ecuador's coach, Felix Sanchez , expects Argentina's gameplan to remain largely unchanged, regardless of Messi's involvement. He recognizes Messi's ability to make a difference but believes that Argentina's approach and tactics are well-established under Scaloni's guidance.""We know we are playing a high level team, Lionel Messi is the player that makes the difference and we have played against them with him and without him on the field,"" Sanchez stated.Should Messi be deemed unfit to start, Scaloni has the option of deploying Julian Alvarez and Lautaro Martinez as a strike partnership. Lautaro Martinez has been in impressive form, leading the tournament's scoring charts with four goals from three games, including a brace against Peru. Alvarez, on the other hand, found the back of the net in Argentina's opening match against Canada.","Messi missed Argentina's final group-stage match against Peru due to a sore right hamstring.

However, her performance took a drastic turn for the worse in the subsequent sets.Putintseva capitalized on Swiatek's sudden decline, breaking the Polish player's serve twice in both the second and third sets.This remarkable turnaround propelled Putintseva into the fourth round, where she will face Jelena Ostapenko .Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam champion, including four titles on the red clay at the French Open most recently last month - and one on the hard courts at the US Open, saw her 21-match winning streak come to an end.Despite her dominance on other surfaces, Wimbledon's grass courts have consistently posed the greatest challenge for the 23-year-old Polish player throughout her professional career, although she did secure the junior trophy as a teenager.Swiatek's best performance at Wimbledon to date was reaching the quarterfinals last year, where she was defeated. In 2022, her impressive 37-match unbeaten run was halted by Alize Cornet in the third round at the All England Club. Despite expressing her desire to improve on grass, Swiatek made the decision to withdraw from the sole tuneup event that was initially on her schedule prior to Wimbledon.Putintseva, currently ranked 35th, is riding an eight-match winning streak on grass, which includes a title victory in Birmingham before arriving in London.Remarkably, this marks the first time in her 10 appearances at Wimbledon that the 29-year-old from Kazakhstan has progressed beyond the second round. Her best performance at any Grand Slam tournament has been reaching the quarterfinals twice at the French Open and once at the US Open.The outcome of this match was particularly surprising given that Swiatek had not only emerged victorious in all four of their previous encounters but had also won every set they had played against each other.","Yulia Putintseva defeats world's top-ranked player Iga Swiatek 3-6, 6-1,. 6-2 at Wimbledon.
