This key moment significantly contributed to RCB's downfall, leading to their eventual exit from the tournament.Former Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan and ex-England skipper Kevin Pietersen did not hold back their criticism.Taking to X, Pathan questioned Maxwell's shot selection, posting, ""What was Maxwell doing?""His sentiment was echoed by Pietersen, who, while commentating, remarked, ""What on earth was that from Glenn Maxwell?

IPL 2024: Rajasthan Royals tame Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Eliminator,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2024-rajasthan-royals-tame-royal-challengers-bengaluru-in-eliminator/articleshow/110347967.cms,"Ashwin, Parag, Powell star as Rajasthan knock out RCB; set up second qualifier against SRH

AHMEDABAD: Rajasthan Royals batter Riyan Parag (36 off 26 balls; 2x4, 2x6) added another chapter to his evolution as a cricketer on Wednesday. Even when he lost his captain Sanju Samson to a reckless stroke and Dhruv Jurel was involved in a contentious run-out, Parag maintained his composure.Shimron Hetmyer and Rovman Powell too came to the party to take RR, who were chasing a 173-run target, past RCB by four wickets here on Wednesday.RCB's six-match winning streak ended in the Eliminator while RR will now play Sunrisers Hyderabad in the second qualifier in Chennai on Friday.The over that changed the tide in RR's favour was the 16th by Cameron Green, in which Parag hit him for a six inside out over extra cover before deftly placing him past short third man for a four. Hetmyer's maximum meant the over yielded 17 runs. This was followed by a Yash Dayal over, in which 11 runs were scored.Despite Siraj dismissing Parag with a yorker and Hetmyer being brilliantly caught by Faf Du Plessis in the 18th over, Powell, who grabbed four catches in the first innings, took them over the line with an over to spare.Chasing 173 set by RCB, RR had a sedate two overs in which they scored only six runs. Yashasvi Jaiswal (45 off 30b, 8x4) then got going, hitting 16 off a Yash Dayal over. Tom Kohler-Cadmore (20 off 15b; 4x4) then hit two boundaries off a Mohammed Siraj over. The introduction of Lockie Ferguson paid dividends as he castled the English opener with a slower yorker. Jaiswal was caught behind off Green in the 9th over.Samson was stumped in the next over and this brought Jurel and Parag together. The duo added 26 before the former was run out by some athletic piece of fielding by Virat Kohli. Parag and Hetmyer then added 45 in 25 balls to tilt the match in RR's favour.Earlier, RR bowlers stepped up, and aided by good catching, restricted RCB to 172/8. Opting to field, the Powerplay was a contest of two halves. If it was Australian left-arm pacer Mitchell Starc who shone with his swing bowling on Tuesday, it was the turn of New Zealand pacer Trent Boult to deliver the goods today.Boult didn't uproot the stumps like Starc, but delivered a dream opening spell (3-0-6-1). Denied scoring opportunities by Boult, Kohli and Du Plessis attacked the other bowlers. Kohli began with a flick off Sandeep Sharma, who was then belted down the ground for a six by Du Plessis.In a bid to break the shackles against Boult, the RCB captain danced down the wicket and slammed a short ball towards deep midwicket only to be spectacularly caught by a diving Rovman Powell.Kohli (33 off 24b; 3x4, 1x6) looked to target Yuzvendra Chahal in his first over. An attempt to slog sweep the leg spinner ended in the hands of substitute fielder Donovan Ferreira at deep mid-wicket.Cameron Green (27 off 21b; 2x4, 1x6) then smashed Chahal for a maximum over the leg side boundary and followed it up with a four over long off. Ashwin then dismissed Green and Maxwell off consecutive balls to peg back RCB.Rajat Patidar (34 off 22b; 2x4, 2x6) and Mahipal Lomror smashed sixes off Chahal before the former hit another maximum off Khan. Khan, though, had the last laugh, having Patidar caught at mid-off by Riyan Parag.Dinesh Karthik (11 off 12b; 1x4) survived a close LBW call off his first ball after DRS overturned an on field decision. However, he failed to inject momentum into the innings and was caught by Jaiswal at cover off Khan. Despite Mahipal Lomror's cameo (32 off 17b; 2x4, 2x6) , RCB never got the push towards the death overs and ended with 172.",RCB's six-match winning streak ended in the Eliminator.

We didn't put par scores and we lost Buttler, and Hetmyer was injured. Today's win was important. We were a bit rusty chasing it, but this win will give us some confidence. In the first half, I felt my body wasn't moving too well for the first half of the season. I had an abdomen injury as well. I am aging as well. To come into the tournament from Test cricket was difficult, I needed some time to get that bowling rhythm. But once you have committed to your franchise, you want to go through with the season.""""I think we hit the right lengths, the way Boult was bowling, he got a bit of swing and seam movement. In the second innings, I don't think there was a lot of dew. I think there were some exceptional shots from our boys to get that chase. I think our greatest strength is the exuberance of youth and the experience we have got to support that. Now that Hettie (Shimron Hetmyer) is back in, and Rovman (Powell) got a few boundaries today as well. We've got Keshav sitting outside.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals managed to halt Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's juggernaut in the Indian Premier League , securing a hard-fought four-wicket victory in the Eliminator in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.The RR bowlers produced an all-round effort, stopping RCB to 172 for 8. However, the their batters encountered difficulties during the middle overs in chase, allowing RCB to claw back in the match, which remained evenly poised for a significant portion of the second half.Despite the challenges, the inaugural IPL champions ultimately reached the target with an over to spare, finishing at 174 for 6, thanks to Rovman Powell's composed unbeaten 16, which provided the necessary impetus in a tense conclusion.As he has done several times before this season, Riyan Parag (36 off 26) showcased deep resolve in an adverse situation to help Rajasthan stay alive in the tournament. It was Royals' first win after four losses and an abandoned game.2008 winners Royals face Sunrisers Hyderabad in Chennai on Friday for a place in the IPL final.The returning Shimron Hetmyer also played his part to perfection, scoring a crucial 26 off 14 balls.In a contest wherein fortunes swung from one side to another, RR remained ahead with impactful performances throughout even though Mohammed Siraj (2/33) raised late hopes for RCB with wickets of Parag and Hetmyer in the 18th over,With 13 needed off last two overs, Powell found two fours off Lockie Ferguson to seal the deal in favour of his side.Earlier, it was Yashasvi Jaiswal (45 off 30) who gave them the impetus at the top.Off to an unconvincing start with his initial runs coming off the outside edge, Jaiswal grew in confidence when Yash Dayal fed him a few deliveries to capitalise on and the RR opener cracked four fours in the third over to break the shackles.At the other end, Tom Kohler-Cadmore (20) also hit a couple of fours against Siraj and while getting a lifeline from Glenn Maxwell, who spilled a sitter at deep square leg off Dayal.With RR's acceleration rapidly shaving runs off the target, RCB needed a breakthrough and Lockie Ferguson provided the first success when he foxed Kohler-Cadmore with a slow yorker which crashed into the stumps.The gradual progression of Jaiswal's innings saw the batter finding his rhythm, but the extreme heat sapped him out completely having faced a mere 29 balls.In between the ninth and the 10th over, Jaiswal received on-field treatment and got back up only to play a loose shot — an attempted ramp off Cameron Green but only gloved it to the ‘keeper.Soon after, Karn Sharma dealt a body blow by having Sanju Samson (17) stumped.With their tails up, RCB continued making inroads with Dhruv Jurel (8) being run out after a brilliant effort from Virat Kohli and Cameron Green.

NEW DELHI: Having played both with and against Virat Kohli for years, South African great AB de Villiers has observed firsthand how the Indian star handles criticism.In the early part of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the legendary Sunil Gavaskar was among those who questioned Kohli's approach. In response, the champion batter delivered a series of high-scoring performances at an impressive strike rate, showcasing his ability to thrive under pressure and silence his critics.""Yeah, I enjoyed that,"" he said when asked about the constant debate over Kohli's strike rate over the course of the season.""I thought it was... really bad for someone like that for a hero and a role model of the country to get so much criticism around that. But the way I know him, I just knew and that's exactly what I mentioned on my show. I said, guys, you have no idea what happens to this guy when he catches criticism.""The many years I've played against him, I used to tell the players in the team room, you do not say one word to Virat on the pitch because he will come out and he will score a big 100 if you try and chirp him.""So maybe it was a blessing in disguise, getting a bit of criticism, because stuff like that motivates him so much. And maybe someone should come out just before this game tonight and say something bad to him. I'm praying for that,"" he said ahead of the Eliminator against Rajasthan Royals.Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) have made the IPL playoffs in remarkable fashion. After securing only one win out of their first eight games, they staged a stunning comeback with six consecutive victories to clinch a play-off spot.De Villiers highlighted Kohli's crucial role in this turnaround. ""When the team is down and out, a player like Kohli can play a huge role in lifting the spirits, and that's exactly what he did,"" he said.He noted that Kohli's intensity never wavered, even during the team's losing streak, demonstrating his unwavering commitment and leadership.""It just shows the kind of care that he has for the team and the desire to ultimately go and win a trophy. And when you're down and out like that with one out of eight wins, to still see that as a teammate, from a teammate's point of view, to see that in one of your senior players who's achieved everything in cricket. I mean, he's one of the greats of all time.""And you see someone like that and celebrating on the field after we've done just one out of eight. That's got to be incredibly motivational, inspirational to say the least.""And I think he played a huge role in lifting that team and getting them back on track purely by his attitude and by his fielding prowess and the way he threw himself around on the field, the run-outs he got, the celebrations, the tapping on the shoulders of some of the young players and celebrating other people's success. That ultimately is a selfless act,"" he added.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) have made the IPL playoffs in remarkable fashion.

This left the commentary box in splits.Raina announced his retirement from international cricket alongside MS Dhoni in 2020 and retired from IPL after the 2021 season when CSK won their fourth title. Since retirement, Raina has been active in commentary.Recently, Raina shared a moment with former India teammate Virat Kohli during an interaction on JioCinema at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru ahead of an IPL 2024 match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and CSK. This meeting also recalled a pivotal moment in Kohli's early career during the 2008 Emerging Players Tournament in Australia.Initially left out of the playing XI by coach Pravin Amre, Kohli was recommended by Raina after seeing his potential in the nets.Kohli recounted, ""Raina saw me playing in the nets and asked Amre sir why I wasn't playing. Raina insisted I should be played, so I got a chance to open against New Zealand and scored 120 not out. This probably convinced Dilip Vengsarkar sir, the selector.

RCB cancelled practice session due to heatwave: GCA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rcb-cancelled-practice-session-due-to-heatwave-gca/articleshow/110335248.cms,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Cricket Association on Tuesday denied reports that Royal Challengers Bengaluru cancelled their only practice session before the IPL 2024 Eliminator against the Rajasthan Royals due to security reasons.On Monday night, the Gujarat Police arrested four men from the Ahmedabad airport on suspicion of terror activities. The police reportedly recovered arms, suspicious videos and text messages after searching the hideout of the four accused.The development prompted a report in a Bengali daily that the RCB cancelled their practice session after a probable threat to Virat Kohli 's security, but the GCA claimed that RCB took this step due to prevailing heatwave in the city.""There was no terror threat. We had made provision for both the Rajasthan Royals and RCB to practice at the Gujarat College ground. RCB were supposed to practice from 2 to 5pm, before they changed it to 3-6pm, as the light is good till 6.30pm in the summer in Ahmedabad. However, the Rajasthan Royals practiced from 3.30 to 6.30pm at the Gujarat College ground with their full squad.RCB skipped their practice session due to the prevailing heat wave in the city.

However, as I said earlier, the RCB avoided the practice session because of the heatwave,"" Patel added.There was speculation that the pre-match press conference before the Eliminator was canned due to the terror threat, but a BCCI source rubbished it. ""There was never a presser scheduled before this match, as there was already the first qualifier (between Kolkata Knight Riders and Hyderabad Sunrisers) being played yesterday at the Narendra Modi Stadium here. In any case, it's not unusual for teams to not have practice sessions at this late stage of the tournament, as they try and remain fresh for the match after a long campaign,"" he said.Scripting a comeback for the ages, RCB have won six matches on the bounce to storm into the playoffs.

"The meaning of Maidaan, Muslim heroes in current-day India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/the-meaning-of-maidaan-muslim-heroes-in-current-day-india/articleshow/110335122.cms,"“Football hota kyaa hai, miyaan?” Tulsidas Balaram would ask, voice feeble yet indignant over a telephone line crackling with static. It was in those lonely days of the lockdown that we would talk, conversations echoing in the stillness of an arrested outside world, with him often repeating the rhetorical question as if he was reminding himself of the simple truths of his times.Balaram had just been bereaved in a sense. Chuni Goswami following PK Banerjee to the maidaan in the skies within 40 days of each other four years ago, would leave him, then 83, as the last of the Golden Trio of Indian football . The passing of the twin icons of a rich and varied Kolkata cultural landscape evoked spontaneous grief and a wave of nostalgia not often seen in Indian sport.Yet, it didn’t seem to have sunk in with Indian football’s eternal loner. Balaram was still happier talking about Rahim-saab, India’s father-figure coach, a Hyderabadi, who discovered him as a poor but wildly talented youngster in a Secunderabad village, recalling with child-like wonder about a sport that had yet to know globalization and about a life steeped in the socialist, working-class ethos of 1950s India. Because he would continue, “Gola lo, gola do. Bas. Football is a very simple game, yaar.”Maidaan, the biopic of Syed Abdul Rahim , Indian football’s most-storied coach, released earlier this month, reminds us of that gentler, tolerant India. Despite being simplistic in its interpretation -- the filmmaker avoids showing the Pakistani hockey team famously cheering for India in the 1962 final -- the film couldn’t be more timely. For it, nevertheless raises a crucial question for today’s India: What is it to be a Muslim leader of an Indian national sports team.The 1962 Asian Games gold medal victory is the undisputed high noon of Indian football. Crucially also, in 1962, India had barely lived 15 years as an independent nation -- everyone above 24-25 years old then would have had a distinct memory of Partition and the fear it spawned among them even if they had not been victims. The scars would have been still raw and widespread across a young nation.Yet, despite the violence and the bloody exodus, the spark of hope and the desire to forge a plural, multicultural India burnt bright. The leaders of the day recognised the importance of inclusion and the need to assuage fears. In a precious nugget, with India on the cusp of independence, the Partition looming, in 1946, Nehru, seeking to portray an image of secular India, is understood to have intervened to push for Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi to be captain of the Indian cricket team. The political action is both a salute to sport as a symbol of popular culture and to the fact that he could identify that Muslims were a little anxious about their future following the violence of Partition.Legend has it that in the 1920s, the affluent Rana family spotted on Lahore streets a young boy with exceptional cricketing abilities. When it was discovered that his impoverished Brahmin family could not afford his cricketing dreams, he was swiftly ‘adopted’ by the curious Ranas. The Hindu lad growing up in a Muslim household would go on to become independent India’s first cricket captain. We all knew of Lala Amaranth, we are today in danger of forgetting the deep pluralistic influences in how Lala – and for that matter, Balaram -- was shaped.Rahim’s great team – a Sikh, Bengalis, Hyderabadis, a Keralite, a Tamilian, a Goan and a couple of Kannadigas, even a Dehradun local of Nepalese origin – was a microcosm of a fledgling India, with all its curiosities, doubts and hopes and where everyone remembered to have the other’s back. The syncretic ethos of that team and the times speaks to us about a syncretism that is eroding at a rapid pace today.Mohd Shami, a proven match-winner for India is today obscenely trolled if he has a poor moment in the field and India loses, questions asked of his Indian-ness just because the cricketer happens to be Muslim, an accusation that is not hurled at Rahim every time his team loses. In the film too when the establishment cravenly conspires to oust Rahim, it is never on basis of his religion but on the mistaken idea that his teams have a poor Bengali representation.Somewhere between the true story of SA Rahim and the real-life trolling of Shami, lies Chak De! India, a fictional take on the trial and eventual redemption of Kabir Khan . It takes a more nuanced look at what it means to be a Muslim player, worse a Muslim player who misses a goal, and lives bearing that cross. It portrays the hurt of a man whose religion is blamed for his one misstep on the field, and his cathartic personal salvation.In 2007, Chak! De symbolized a particular kind of popular culture emerging to challenge the threats that were already beginning to show, Muslims being told to go to Pakistan at the slightest pretext was being normalized. The cinematic story of Kabir Khan was an attempt to paper over the increasing wedge between communities.Resurrecting that kind of a film, over 15 years since it was first made and swiftly attained cult status, would have seemed a challenge today, a Muslim being allowed to prove his patriotism would seem unlikely in a time where bigotry is in full-frontal attack and an entire community is not only being excluded, they are also being demonized.In any kind of political action, exclusion of any group of people becomes a moral issue. The offline trolling and ostracization that Kabir Khan had to face is today seen in so many ways, real and virtual, off screen and on. A slew of production-slick propaganda films in recent years have outrightly projected distorted truths and further deepened faultlines, where demonising the Muslim is the chief narrative and sole purpose of making the films.Now, here you have a film where you go back in time to dig out a true sporting story but are forced to exhume a true Muslim hero in the process. It turns on its head the credo of the films of the day where the message is forcibly clear: You can’t trust a Muslim.Despite cinematic licence allowing for the odd inaccuracy in the film, there is no larger distortion possible in Rahim’s story or to the 1962 victory, and that immediately makes for tricky navigation for today’s trolls – you have to hail a film where the Tricolour flies high and proud giving wing to nationalism, but you also are confronted with the strange dilemma of watching a Muslim lead us to it all. This delicious confusion is perhaps the real victory of the film.Because in telling us about Rahim, a Muslim guiding light, helming arguably India’s greatest-ever football team, maybe in Maidaan, we may have reminded ourselves where the many real-life Kabir Khans of our times reside in our midst, and how inclusion is like a football match. Like Balaram, that sworn Rahim disciple, would always remind us, “It’s very simple, yaar.”","Maidaan, the biopic of Syed Abdul Rahim, released earlier this month, reminds us of that gentler, tolerant India.

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal , the 14-time French Open champion, has been struggling with fitness issues as he approaches the end of his illustrious career. However, Novak Djokovic , the world number one, believes that Nadal remains the favorite to win the upcoming French Open.Djokovic, who is currently preparing for the tournament at the Geneva Open , acknowledged that Nadal faces increasing competition from younger players.Nevertheless, he emphasized that as long as the Spaniard is in the draw, he cannot be discounted.The Serbian star's comments highlight the immense respect and admiration he has for Nadal's achievements and abilities on the clay courts of Roland Garros .""This year is more open,"" French Open defending champion Djokovic told reporters at the Parc des Eaux-Vives grounds in Geneva.""Casper Ruud is surely one of the five players who are candidates to win. You have Alexander Zverev, Andrey Rublev, Stefanos Tsitsipas -- all the players who won a major tournament on this surface this year.""But when you talk about Roland-Garros and Nadal is there, he is always the biggest favourite for me.""After everything he has done on the courts at Roland-Garros, it's normal, respectfully, to put him as the biggest favourite.""Obviously it's a little different with his level of play. But it's Roland-Garros, and it's Nadal.""After that, maybe me, if I feel good, if I play well. At Roland-Garros, and all the Grand Slams, I am a bit of a different player.""Djokovic, on the cusp of his 37th birthday on Wednesday, made a last-minute decision to participate in the Geneva tournament by accepting a wild card entry.His aim is to reverse a concerning decline in his performance as he prepares to defend his title at the French Open, which commences next week.The Swiss clay court event, featuring a compact draw of 28 players, acts as the ultimate preparation for the prestigious Grand Slam tournament.Djokovic, who holds an impressive record of 24 Grand Slam titles, is facing an unusual situation this year. He will enter the French Open without having secured a single title in the season, a first since 2018. However, a victory in Geneva could change that narrative.While time has caught up with 37-year-old Nadal, Djokovic said he was hungry to keep playing at the top.""I'm searching for my highest possible level,"" he said.""It's not an obligation. It's truly my desire, my feeling, my passion, my love for tennis. That's the most important. I'm seeking to stay connected with that feeling.""Djokovic said he knew Geneva well as he has cousins in the Swiss city, though he has never played at the Geneva Tennis Club before.""At this moment, there is no better practice for me than match play. So I feel like I need more matches,"" he said.""That's the way for me to try to find the kind of form that I need for Roland-Garros.""Djokovic was at the Stade de Geneve on Monday to witness Young Boys winning a 17th Swiss football championship with a 1-0 victory over hosts Servette -- a team the Serb has a long-standing fondness for.Djokovic said one of his cousins was set to marry a Servette player -- French midfielder Timothe Cognat, according to Swiss media.Djokovic's best friend, and best man at his wedding, was defender Neven Markovic, who played for Servette from 2013 to 2015.""That's why I'm supporting the club,"" Djokovic said, jovially adding that Markovic could perhaps best be categorised as a ""very physical player"".""I'm not a football expert -- but he's a crazy guy,"" he said.",Novak Djokovic believes Rafael Nadal is the favorite to win the French Open. The world number one is currently preparing for the tournament at the Geneva Open.

Andy Murray comeback ends in Geneva defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/andy-murray-comeback-ends-in-geneva-defeat/articleshow/110306458.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: The highly anticipated possibility of another match between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic vanished on Tuesday as Murray exited the Geneva Open , marking his comeback from an ankle injury.Murray, playing on a wild card, was trailing 7-5, 4-1 against Yannick Hanfmann when a thunderstorm interrupted play at Parc des Eaux-Vives on Monday. Resuming on Tuesday, the German world number 85 swiftly concluded the match, taking the second set 6-2 in just over 10 minutes.Since Friday's draw, tennis enthusiasts had hoped for what could have been the final encounter between two members of the legendary Big Four—Djokovic, Murray, Rafael Nadal, and the retired Roger Federer—who have dominated men’s tennis for the past two decades.Instead, Hanfmann will face world number one Djokovic in the second round on Wednesday.Currently ranked 75th, the 37-year-old Murray, who plays with a metal hip, has indicated he may retire from competitive tennis within a few months. Nadal, similarly beset by injuries, is also nearing the end of his career and is uncertain about participating in the upcoming French Open .The Geneva match marked Murray’s first tour-level appearance since he injured tendons in his left ankle in Miami in March. The 28-man Swiss clay court tournament is a crucial preparation event for the French Open, the year’s second Grand Slam.Djokovic, who turns 37 on Wednesday, entered Geneva with a wild card to address a concerning slump in form ahead of defending his French Open title next week. The 24-time Grand Slam champion risks arriving in Paris without a title this season for the first time since 2018 unless he wins in Geneva.The Geneva draw also features Casper Ruud, the Norwegian world number seven, and other top 20 players such as Taylor Fritz , Ben Shelton, and Sebastian Baez .Murray and Djokovic last faced each other in the 2017 Doha final, where the Serbian emerged victorious.Murray, a former world number one and three-time Grand Slam champion, won the US Open in 2012 and Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016, with 11 Grand Slam final appearances. He also secured Olympic singles titles in 2012 and 2016.","Novak Djokovic will face Yannick Hanfmann in the second round of Geneva Open.

Rafael Nadal returns to Roland Garros to practice amid doubts over his fitness and future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/rafael-nadal-returns-to-roland-garros-to-practice-amid-doubts-over-his-fitness-and-future/articleshow/110288615.cms,"(Inputs from AP)

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal , the 14-time French Open champion, returned to Roland Garros to practice and assess his readiness for the upcoming tournament.The 37-year-old Spaniard arrived in the late afternoon with his coach, Carlos Moya, and a few sparring partners at the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, which was open to the public.Approximately 6,000 fans were present at the stadium, enthusiastically cheering as Nadal stepped onto the court.The practice session lasted around an hour and a half, after which Nadal signed several autographs before exiting through a doorway leading to the locker rooms.The training session allowed Nadal to familiarize himself with the red clay at Roland Garros, as he hasn't played a match there in two years, and to evaluate his physical condition. Nadal has been recovering from a hip injury that required surgery and has caused him to miss most of the 2023 season, as well as dealing with issues related to a hip muscle and an abdominal muscle.Nadal's recent loss to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open, with a score of 6-1, 6-3, left him uncertain about his readiness for the French Open. ""Let's see what's going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week,"" Nadal said in Rome. ""If I feel ready, I (am) going to try to be there and fight for the things that I have been fighting (for) the last 15 years, (even) if now (that) seems impossible.""As of Monday, Nadal had not yet announced his decision regarding his participation in the French Open. This is expected to be his final season on tour, making this potentially his last appearance at a tournament he has won more times than any other tennis player has won any Grand Slam title. Nadal won the French Open in 2022, securing his 22nd major championship overall, which is second only to Novak Djokovic 's 24. He missed the French Open last year due to his hip injury.","Rafael Nadal returns to Roland Garros to practice and assess his readiness for the French Open.

AITA adds Ramkumar in the mix for Bopanna’s Olympic partner choice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/aita-adds-ramkumar-in-the-mix-for-bopannas-olympic-partner-choice/articleshow/110280365.cms,"PUNE: The question of who would be Rohan Bopanna’s partner at the Paris Olympics got curiouser with the All India Tennis Association recommending Ramkumar Ramanathan ’s name out of turn for the TOPS programme.The latest list of tennis players to receive funding from the government towards preparation for the Paris Games comprises Bopanna (World No. 4 in doubles), Sumit Nagal (No.94 in singles) and Sriram Balaji (82 in doubles), besides Ramkumar (149 in doubles).It is reliably learnt that the Australian Open doubles champion Bopanna had suggested, at the AITA ’s instance in January, to include the two highest-ranked players for the purpose of TOPS funding and it would have been too early to identify a partner as such.Yuki Bhambri (ranked 60 at the end of January and currently 54) and Balaji (78 then), would have been the straightforward choice, with Ramkumar ranked outside the top-200.AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar said the 29-year-old Chennai lad’s name had been recommended keeping in mind his past success and service to the country as well as keeping the options open.“How do we know? Tomorrow Rohan might say he wants to play with Ram,” he said.Dhupar clarified that the AITA had forwarded a bunch of names, including that of Bhambri, to the Sports Authority of India (SAI).“We only recommend, the decision (as to whom to support) is with SAI. They directly deal with the players as to how much money each one gets,” he said.SAI did not respond to a detailed questionnaire on the issue despite repeated requests.‘FINAL DECISION WITH SELECTION COMMITTEE’Dhupar said the final decision as to who would be Bopanna’s partner will rest with the national selection committee.“The practice always has been that the player, who is confirmed by the ITF, will be asked about his choice and it will be discussed by the national selection committee. But it is the selection committee that takes the final call,” he said.Bopanna, who rose to World No. 1 after triumphing in Melbourne in the company of Matthew Ebden for his maiden Grand Slam success, chose to keep his cards close to the chest.“Once I go to Paris in the next couple of days, I will have a discussion with (coach) Scott (Davidoff) and then decide,” the 43-year-old Bopanna told TOI from Bengaluru.Yet, the choice could come down to Bhambri and Balaji considering they have been competing at a much higher level compared to the rest.“Yuki won (an ATP Tour title) in Munich and Bala won a 175 Challenger (beating Bhambri/Cabral and Erler/Miedler combinations on the way). Basically they are playing the ATP 250s,” Bopanna said.“Whoever the partner is, we will combine after Wimbledon (in the lead up to the Olympics). Playing on grass doesn’t make sense since it (tennis at the Paris Games) will be on clay,” he added.","AITA recommends Ramkumar Ramanathan’s name out of turn for TOPS programme. Sumit Nagal, Sriram Balaji and Rohan Bopanna also on list of tennis players to receive funding from the government towards preparation for Paris Games.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110280356,imgsize-144252,width-400,resizemode-4/110280356.jpg"
