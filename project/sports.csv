New continent, same result. T20 may be a batters’ game, but in New York, bowlers were the Apple of our eyes today. What a thrilling match! Great atmosphere and a wonderful exhibition of our great game in America. Well played, India.""India, after being bowled out for a modest 119 in 19 overs, faced a challenging task to defend their total. Pakistan's Mohammad Rizwan managed a steady 31 runs, but it was Bumrah's exceptional spell that turned the tide in India's favor. His figures of 3-14 in four overs, including key wickets of Pakistan captain Babar Azam (13) and Rizwan, were instrumental in restricting Pakistan to 113/7.The match witnessed a record attendance of 34,028, the highest for an international cricket match in the USA, providing an exhilarating contest that kept the crowd on the edge of their seats.Bumrah's critical breakthroughs came at crucial moments. He dismissed Babar Azam early and then broke the back of Pakistan's chase by removing Rizwan in the 15th over when Pakistan was 80/4. Given the ball for the penultimate over with Pakistan needing 21 to win, Bumrah conceded just three runs and took the wicket of Iftikhar Ahmed with his final ball, leaving Pakistan requiring an improbable 18 from the final over.Arshdeep Singh added to the drama by dismissing Imad Wasim with the first ball of the final over. Despite a valiant effort from Naseem Shah, who hit consecutive fours, India held their nerve to seal their second win of the tournament.Tendulkar's presence and his enthusiastic support added to the significance of the event. His praise for the bowlers and the overall atmosphere underscored the growing appeal and competitive spirit of cricket in the United States.","India beat Pakistan by six runs in T20 World Cup match in New York.

NEW DELHI: Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah shared his long-held admiration for bowling and his disinterest in high-scoring run-fests following India's nail-biting six-run victory over Pakistan in their ICC T20 World Cup clash.Bumrah's stellar performance, featuring a miserly three-wicket haul, played a crucial role in India's defense of their modest total, keeping their World Cup hopes alive with two group stage games remaining.In a packed Nassau County Stadium , Bumrah's precise bowling applied relentless pressure on the Pakistani batters, while Rishabh Pant 's counter-attacking knock bolstered India's position. The match, witnessed by a record crowd, highlighted Bumrah's skill and strategic approach to bowling.During the post-match press conference, Bumrah expressed his satisfaction with the recognition the bowlers received for their efforts. He highlighted India's preference for batting and how the recent Indian Premier League season was heavily tilted towards the batters.""We are very happy that we did not come here with that baggage (of IPL being batter friendly) and when we are getting help here, we were trying to use it. I have played a lot of cricket in my young years—when the bat and ball challenge is good it is more interesting to watch the match. When it is bat vs bat, I switch off the TV. I have been a fan of bowling since childhood. When there is a challenge between bat and ball, that is the game I like. No complaints. I am very happy,"" Bumrah said.Reflecting on the victory, Bumrah emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced approach between controlling the run flow and taking wickets, especially in conditions where seam and swing had diminished. He discussed the need to avoid desperation for a ""magic ball"" and instead focus on accuracy and utilizing the large boundaries to their advantage.""Even when there is help, you can be desperate, and you can try to go fuller and try to pull that magic delivery. I tried not to do that but when we came, the swing and seam had reduced. So, we had to be accurate because if we go for magic deliveries and try to be too desperate, run-making becomes easy and they know the target. So, we had to be very mindful of not overdoing it and yes add up the pressure, use the big boundaries, try to use things to our advantage. That is what we were doing. So, in that we created pressure and everybody got wickets,"" he explained.Bumrah also opened up about his recovery from injuries last year and his journey back to top form, delivering remarkable performances in the 50-over World Cup, IPL, and now the T20 World Cup. He emphasized his focus on controlling the controllable and staying present, despite external pressures and noise.""I try to stay in the present and focus on what I have to do. Because if I look at the outside noise, if I look at people and pressure and emotion take over, then things do not really work for me. So, I was trying to do that, trying to create my own bubble, and trying to focus on that and try to put my best foot forward,"" Bumrah added.He appreciated the support from the largely Indian and Asian crowd at the Nassau County Stadium, which made the team feel at home and boosted their energy levels.""A lot of emotion does come in and it does not feel like we are not playing in India because the support that we get, wherever we go, we get a lot of support and fans come in large numbers. So that does help with the energy part of the setup that we have. So yeah, very happy with the support and we were happy that we were able to give them a win as well,"" he said.",Jasprit Bumrah shares his admiration for bowling and disinterest in high-scoring run-fests.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan coach Gary Kirsten defended the playing surface at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium following the team's narrow six-run defeat to India in a low-scoring T20 World Cup match.Despite India's modest total of 119, their lowest ever against Pakistan in a T20 game, Pakistan fell short in their chase, sparking discussions about the pitch conditions.The venue, featuring a 'drop in' square laid a month before the tournament, has seen all five games produce low scores, raising concerns about the pitch's quality. After India's previous win over Ireland, former Zimbabwe international and ex-England team director Andy Flower labeled the pitch ""dangerous"" due to its uneven bounce.However, Kirsten downplayed these criticisms, suggesting that the pitch, while challenging, was not hazardous. ""I think it wasn't dangerous, I mean the odd one rose up, but not many. Generally, it kept a little bit lower, it was difficult to score from both batting sides and also a fairly slow outfield so it was never going to be a big total,"" he stated.Kirsten acknowledged that a score of 140 would have been competitive, indicating that Pakistan had a strong chance to win after restricting India to 119. ""I would have said 140 would have been a really good score on that pitch, so India didn't get that and so I thought we had the game,"" added the South African.He also emphasized that low-scoring games could be equally entertaining and offered a different kind of contest compared to the high-scoring encounters typical of T20 cricket.""We knew it was going to be tight, but you know sometimes it's fun seeing games like that as well, it's not always about sixes and hitting, getting 260 and 240's, you can actually have a really entertaining game on a 120 chase, so I don't think it's bad for the game,"" Kirsten explained.In response to the criticism, the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) admitted that the pitches at the venue had not met the expected standards and committed to improving them for the remaining matches.Three games remain at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, with the final match scheduled for Wednesday, when India will face co-hosts USA.",Pakistan coach Gary Kirsten defends the pitch at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium. Pakistan lost to India by six runs in a low-scoring T20 World Cup match.

The six-run win in New York's initiation to serious top-flight cricket was truly the spectacle that the sport was so desperately waiting for.Down, out and virtually nailed into the coffin, the bravehearts in blue rose from the ashes as India's entry into Super-8s looks well assured. Lehra do played in full blast as the quaint corner of Long Island turned into a stadium of light.The toss went against India, a spectacular collapse led to them being dismissed for 119, and when Pakistan score read 80-4 in the 15th over, the game looked all but gone.But that's when India's greatest white-ball matchwinner of all time showed his magic. Jasprit Bumrah pitched the ball in the right area and Mohammed Rizwan, who had battled on to 31 till then, played a poor shot to get bowled. The celebration told the story, the Indian bowlers knew they were back in the game.Everyone chipped in after that, with Axar giving two off the 16th and Hardik Pandya removing Shadab Khan off a short ball in the 17th, as the Pakistan wheels started coming off spectacularly.It all boiled down to the 19th over with Pakistan needing 21 and Bumrah back in action. The champion chose to bowl back of the length as Ifthikar Ahmed and Imad Wasim just couldn't get it going. And when Ifthikar departed in the last ball of Bumrah's spell, a blue wave engulfed the stadium.Eighteen off the last over was way beyond Pakistan's reach as Arshdeep, who had scored a vital few runs with the bat as well, did just enough to take India home.Earlier, with the score reading 89-3 in the 12th over, the game looked fairly under control. Rishabh Pant (42 off 31 balls), in two gutsy partnerships with Axar Patel and Suryakumar Yadav, seemed to have weathered the early storm.But with the sun coming out and the pitch drying out just a bit, the two-paced nature of the track was slowly coming to the fore. And it was this slight advantage that the Pakistan bowlers utilized brilliantly.Haris Rauf , who had looked immensely ordinary till then, removed Surya, the batter failing to connect his bread-and-butter inside-out shot over mid-off, the pitch playing its part.It sparked off a collapse where India lost seven for 28, a kind of a batting debacle that the Indian fans haven’t witnessed in a while.Shivam Dube is woefully out of form since his inclusion in the Indian team for the T20 World Cup and he looked a fish out of water on a difficult track, lobbing a simple return catch to Naseem Shah .But the key moment of the game belonged to a man whose comeback has been nothing short of a fairytale.Mohammed Amir has gone through a lot, but his desire to play never left him. He has fought back to the squad, bowled a poor Super Over against United States, but on the big day against India, he was quite brilliant in his second spell.Looking to take the ball away from the left-hander, Amir induced a false shot off Pant that brought the downfall of the gutsy Delhi boy. Amir followed it up with Ravindra Jadeja’s wicket in the very next delivery, the ball stopping again, as the southpaw just lobbed it into the hands of a cover fielder.The damage had truly been done and the Pakistan pacers did enough to keep to 119, which was 30 below-par on this pitch.But it didn't matter in the end.",India beat Pakistan by six runs in their T20 World Cup opener in New York. India bowled out Pakistan for 119 in their 20 overs. Arshdeep scored 18 runs off the last over to take India home.

NEW DELHI: When asked if the IPL auction crosses his mind, Saurabh Netravalkar simply laughs on the other end of the phone before emphatically stating, ""No,"" in a resonant baritone.Also See: IND vs PAK Live Netravalkar played a pivotal role in newcomers' USA's remarkable victory over former champions Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on Thursday.""It is just one match and we have done well.The focus should be on the next game and frankly speaking, all of us in the United States of America cricket team, are trying to come to terms with our achievements.""It is yet to sink in and things you are talking about, if it happens organically, it will happen. We are still trying to digest what happened,"" the former India U-19 left-arm pacer, who made the difference with a brilliant Super Over against Pakistan, told PTI in an exclusive interview on Friday.An alumnus of prestigious Cornell University and a senior software engineer at Oracle , Netravalkar adeptly balanced academics and cricket.""I have never felt the pressure. When you love something, it is never a job for you. So when I am out there on the field, I love bowling and trying to out-think a batter. When I am coding , I love doing that and hence it never feels like work,"" the left-arm seamer, who has suddenly become the talk of the town, couldn't have put it more lucidly.""Actually, we just flew down from Dallas to New York. I will be honest that it has been quite overwhelming. I wish I could personally thank each and everyone for their lovely messages. I feel blessed,"" one could sense the gratitude in his voice.What was the strategy for the Super Over, and when did he find out he would be bowling?""It wasn't pre-decided and only after the regulation 20 overs did skipper (Monank Patel) and coach (Stuart Law) informed me about it. I am thankful to them for showing faith in me.""He then gave an insight into the US strategy.""The plan was simple that I will try and bowl wide yorkers to the right handers and try to keep it out of his range as the boundary on that side was bigger. First ball the batter shifted and didn't get a wide and second ball, he stayed rooted and connected, and then, I got a couple of wides, as I was trying for wide lines.""But I must say that 18 runs helped and all those extra runs that Harmeet (Singh) and Aaron (Jones) ran, helped. Basically, if you are defending around 20, all you need is three good balls, and the job is done. It is one of the best matches I have played.""However, Netravalkar would matter-of-factly state that while opportunities in professional cricket are improving in the US, his primary source of income remains his day job at Oracle.""The best part is that I have got very supportive bosses at Oracle and I am allowed to work remotely when I am on tour, playing for the United States.""So on match days, I am excused from work but then there are scheduled project meetings which warrants my presence and then I work my practice schedule accordingly. I would also thank US Cricket board as they also are flexible if I have meetings lined up.""His is a fascinating story.""I can tell you that when I play local matches or club games in the United States, I have often logged in for a meeting at the lunch break and people have been very accommodating.""At Oracle, they all know by now I play cricket and everyone is happy to support. I work in team Oracle text and I am primarily a coder, who works on SQL and C (programming languages),"" he said.What are the prospects of a full-time cricket career in the United States?""Well, if you have a Major League Contracts, those are good and you can have a full-time cricket career.""Minor League Cricket is also seeing an upswing but another avenue is some weekend 'Pop-Up' tournaments, basically played from Friday to Sunday in Houston, Florida where you can actually earn well.""Come June 12, and Netravalkar will be facing the Indian team and he is quite emotional about it.""I know all of them and Surya (Yadav) and myself have played together for Mumbai U15s, U-17, U-19s. It is so good to see what he has achieved and it will be nice to catch up with them. Playing against India would be truly emotional.""","Saurabh Netravalkar played a pivotal role in USA's remarkable victory over former champions Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Scotland significantly improved their prospects of advancing to the second round of the T20 World Cup by convincingly defeating Oman by seven wickets in North Sound, Antigua, on Sunday, propelling them to the summit of Group B.Brandon McMullen 's remarkable unbeaten innings of 61 runs from only 31 balls propelled Scotland to victory with almost seven overs to spare. The Scots chased down Oman's total of 150-7 with ease, finishing at 153-3 off just 13.1 overs.""Very chuffed to get the win for the team,"" said McMullen, who clinched the win with a four one of nine boundaries in his swashbuckling batting display that also included two sixes.""The priority was to win and get the points but at drinks we said we should get this done.""McMullen and the Scotland team are set to face Australia in their final group game, carrying a wave of confidence after a strong start to the tournament.""We are confident going into the Australia game, always trying to raise the bar. That's the plan going forward,"" McMullen said.Scotland's run chase began smoothly, with George Munsey contributing 41 runs before being caught by Shakeel Ahmed off the bowling of Mehran Khan. Michael Jones added 16 runs to the scoreboard before McMullen took charge of the game.McMullen's impressive innings steered Scotland towards victory, supported by Matthew Cross, who remained unbeaten on 15 runs from just eight balls, including two powerful sixes.In contrast, Oman captain Aqib Ilyas expressed disappointment over his team's inability to set a more competitive total and their missed opportunities during Scotland's innings. Oman, after winning the toss, opted to bat first at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound.""175 could have been a good score, but we had too many dot balls on a flat track,"" Aqib said. ""In the batting we have to improve. 150 was par but we dropped too many chances.""Catches, if you take them, puts pressure on the other team. This is cricket, sometimes you are at the top, sometimes you are down.""Aqib's decision to bat first initially seemed promising, as opener Pratik Athavale set the tone with a well-made 54 off 40 balls, supported by Naseem Khushi (10) and Aqib Ilyas (16).However, the momentum was disrupted when Zeeshan Maqsood fell cheaply for three runs, followed by Khalid Kail's run out with just 10 more runs added, leaving Oman struggling at 71-4 after 8.5 overs.Ayaan Khan played a crucial role in stabilizing the innings with an unbeaten 41 off 39 deliveries, receiving support from Mehran Khan, who contributed 13 runs.Among the Scottish bowlers, Safyaan Sharif stood out with two wickets, albeit conceding 40 runs. Brad Wheal delivered an economical spell, claiming 1 wicket for 19 runs off his four overs, while spinner Mark Watt took one wicket conceding 25 runs in his four overs.",Scotland beat Oman by seven wickets to top Group B of T20 World Cup in Antigua.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan skipper Babar Azam remarked that the 59 dot balls conceded during their chase were the turning point in their T20 World Cup game against India in New York on Sunday.“We bowled well. In the batting, we lost back-to-back wickets and consumed too many dot balls. Again, we weren't up to the mark in the first six,"" Babar said after the match.When asked about the strategy, Babar mentioned that it was about playing normal cricket.“Tactics were simple to play normally. Just strike rotation and the odd boundary. But in that period, we had too many dot balls. Can't expect much from tail-enders.”Babar had a contrarian view on the surface, differing from many who felt the ball wasn't coming onto the bat.“Pitch looked decent. The ball was coming on nicely. It was a little bit slow, and some balls had extra bounce.”For Pakistan to progress to the Super Eight stage , they'll need to secure convincing victories against Canada and Ireland while also hoping that the USA doesn't defeat either Ireland or India.“Have to win the last two matches. Will sit and discuss our mistakes but looking forward to the last two matches.”","Pakistan lost back-to-back wickets and consumed too many dot balls, says Babar Azam.

NEW DELHI: India suffered a significant batting collapse, losing their last 7 wickets for a mere 30 runs, leaving them disappointed with their performance against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup match in New York on Sunday.Losing the toss put India's openers in a challenging position from the start.

Although Axar couldn't capitalize on his start, Pant continued to play risky shots and maintained a steady pace.India had a solid foundation at the halfway point, but Suryakumar Yadav's dismissal at the score of 89 in the 12th over triggered a collapse, with wickets falling at regular intervals.India's last hope, Hardik Pandya, failed to make a significant contribution, resulting in India posting a modest total of 119 runs in 19 overs.Pakistan's pace attack, led by Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah, has delivered a stellar performance, living up to the expectations of their captain, Babar Azam.

KOLKATA: With his hands on the hip, Sunil Chhetri stood a little distance away from the pack of his teammates in the middle of the park. He stood motionless, as if dazed, for a few seconds, his eyes blank and without expression.

A few minutes ago, Chinese referee Fu Ming had blown the whistle to seal India's goalless draw with Kuwait in their second-round fixture of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, thus ringing the curtain on Chhetri's 19-year-old career in the Blue Tigers jersey.

Suddenly the Salt Lake Stadium stands roared into ""Chhetri, Chhteri"" chants, stirring the 39-year-old out of his trance as he was given a standing ovation He began a lap of honour around the ground. Then he broke down in tears as his teammates, coach Igor Stimac and his coaching staff members lined up to give him the guard of honour. After plethora of hugs and handshakes, he slowly walked down the tunnel, out of everyone's sight and into a new life, leaving behind a legacy Indian football has hardly experienced.

The build-up to Thursday's match was all about Chhetri's send-off. Before the kick-off, the famed Blue Pilgrims stand behind the goalpost unfurled a giant tifo, showing Chhetri holding the earth, a la Hercules. India failed to turn the occasion more memorable and meaningful for Chhetri following the stalemate but that tifo perhaps represents what Chhetri has stood for in Indian football in nearly two decades since making his senior de but against Pakistan in 2005.

He will be remembered as the defining player of his generation, someone who has transcended his sport more than any other, a reference point in Indian football in the true sense of the term.

Unlike IM Vijayan, he might not have an eye for the spectacular. Unlike Bhaichung Bhutia, he might not be a typical fox in the box. Chhetri's game has always been a fable of discipline, dedication and determination.

His goals were cheeky, audacious and brilliant - scoring from midfield to embarrassing the goalkeeper with a Panenka penalty. He made people fall in love with the game.

In a later post-match felicitation, organized by the Indian Football Association, he returned to the ground to receive accolades from the Big 3 clubs - East Bengal , Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting as well as the state government. A few former players like Vijayan, Mehtab Hossain, Alvito D'Cunha and Rahim Nabi then gave him a tight embrace one by one.

as India fluff their lines in must-win tie against Kuwait

KOLKATA: Goodbye Sunil Chhetri. But not a welcome yet for India to a dream place in the third round of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers .India failed to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac 's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. As the tearful Chhetri left the international football stage after 151 caps and 94 goals and failing to make an impact in Thursday's game, India's chances of qualifying to the next round now hang in balance.With 5 points from as many matches, and both Afghanistan (4 points from 4 games) and Kuwait (4 points from 5 games) lurking close by, the Blue Tigers now have to beat the already qualified Qatar in their own den in the final Group A fixture next Tuesday to keep hopes alive.A top-two finish in the group is the prerequisite not only for opening the door for brushing shoulders with Asia's best in the third round of World Cup qualifiers, but also guaranteeing a berth in the next edition of Asian Cup .With stakes so high, it felt like a juncture match for Igor Stimac's side. Chhetri's farewell - which drew an official attendance of 58,921 in the stands - further elevated the sense of the occasion.But India never looked in sync with the challenge in question, dishing out another frustrating performance nearly three months after losing 1-2 to Afghanistan in Guwahati and making their job more difficult now.In fact, had Gurpreet Singh Sandhu not effected a string of saves, it could have been quite embarrassing for Chhetri and his team.Stimac started with a new and bold defensive set-up, giving FC Goa left-back Jay Gupta his debut in Blue Tigers jersey and pairing up Rahul Bheke with Anwar Ali in the heart of defence in absence of injured Sandesh Jhingan.But if the Croatian coach's 4-2-3-1 formation was meant to gain early ascendancy, it failed to instil the sort of organisation and obduracy that he would have expected to characterise his backline. The result was a streak of nervy moments invading the home team's play.The match was just four minutes old when Bheke failed to intercept a pass, allowing Mohammad Abdulah to stare at the goal with a world of time and space. But Kuwait's No. 9 ended up hitting straight at Gurpreet.Relieved and reprieved, India tried to make a statement, Liston Colaco seeing his cutback cleared by Kuwait defender Hasan Alanezi for a corner and Chhetri skying an attempt way over the bar.Just when India appeared to have started to establish a more recognisable rhythm, Kuwait shook the hosts out of a false dawn, threatening to upset the applecart.",India fail to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: England's manager Gareth Southgate has decided not to include left defender Harry Maguire and midfielder Jack Grealish in the 26-man squad for the upcoming European Championship. This decision comes as part of the team's strategic preparation for the tournament.Maguire, with a substantial experience of 63 international caps and a key player for Manchester United , was notably absent from the list due to selection criteria that also saw Manchester City 's Grealish, who has 36 caps for England, left out. Despite their considerable contributions to their respective clubs, their exclusion highlights the competitive nature of the selection process and the depth of talent available to the national team.The squad announced by Southgate features a robust attacking lineup, including Jude Bellingham , whose recent success with Real Madrid in the Champions League has been remarkable, and Harry Kane of Bayern Munich. Phil Foden , recognized for his exceptional season with Manchester City, and Bukayo Saka from Arsenal, are also among the key players expected to lead England's offensive efforts. These selections underscore the blend of youth and experience within the team, aiming to capitalize on dynamic and impactful performances.Injuries have played a role in shaping the defensive selections for the squad.Despite Maguire's exclusion, his Manchester United teammate Luke Shaw has been included, although he is currently managing injury concerns and did not participate in the team's training session ahead of the friendly match against Iceland at Wembley. This indicates the strategic considerations made by Southgate in balancing current form, fitness levels, and the potential impact of players on the team's performance.Additionally, the squad features 12 players who are yet to gain experience in major international tournaments, including Lewis Dunk, Joe Gomez, Marc Guehi, Ezri Konsa, and others. This inclusion is indicative of England's forward-looking approach, aiming to integrate emerging talents and provide them with the platform to gain valuable experience at the highest level of competition.Other players not making the squad this time are James Maddison, Jarrad Branthwaite, James Trafford, Curtis Jones, and Jarrell Quansah, highlighting the depth of talent available and the tough decisions involved in squad selection.England are set to commence their Euro 2024 campaign against Serbia on June 16, with the squad selections reflecting a strategic mix of experience, current form, and potential, as they aim to navigate the challenges of the tournament.Dean Henderson, Jordan Pickford, Aaron RamsdaleLewis Dunk, Joe Gomez, Marc Guehi, Ezri Konsa, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Kieran Trippier, Kyle WalkerTrent Alexander-Arnold, Conor Gallagher, Kobbie Mainoo, Declan Rice, Adam WhartonJude Bellingham, Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze, Phil Foden, Anthony Gordon, Harry Kane, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka, Ivan Toney, Ollie Watkins","England manager Gareth Southgate has named his 26-man squad for Euro 2024.

India failed to capitalize on a freekick in the 28th minute, despite Poojary's impressive run and nutmeg.At the halfway mark, Thapa sent a fantastic ball into the box, which Kuwait cleared to deny Sahal Abdul Samad. The rebound fell to Liston Colaco, who fired a low strike into the side netting from a narrow angle.In the second half, Igor Stimac made changes to India's attacking lineup, introducing Rahim Ali, Brandon Fernandes, and Chheri. However, the desired result was not achieved, as Rahim failed to convert his chances.Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute when they were denied a penalty claim, leading to a confrontation between players and bench.Replays suggested a foul, but the referee deemed otherwise. Tempers flared up after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, resulting in a mini-brawl and yellow cards for both Edmund and Sultan Alenezi.Despite the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' poor delivery meant India's last hope for a win disappeared in the added seven minutes.Stimac handed left-back Gupta his international debut in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Chhetri as the sole striker.

Iga Swiatek serves a warning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/iga-swiatek-serves-a-warning/articleshow/110853628.cms,"PARIS: Iga Swiatek , the queen of clay, who on Saturday claimed her fourth Roland Garros title, turned her attention to the grass court season, which is just round the corner.The World No.1 briefly considered doing her pre-season on grass in the hope that it would be easier to adapt to the surface when she got on it six months later. Tomasz Wiktorowski , the Pole’s coach, who knows a thing or two about playing on grass, nipped the idea in the bud.The 23-year-old, who had her best result at the All-England Club last year, making the quarterfinals, played a tournament before The Championships.""I feel like every year it's easier for me to adapt to grass,"" she said. ""I need to continue the work that I've been doing. It's been easier, especially with my coach (Tomasz Wiktorowski) who worked with Radwanska. They had great results on grass and he kind of feels grass well.""The Pole, who has had a physically challenging clay-court swing, is unsure if she’ll play a warm-up event before Wimbledon this year.""Last year was the first time I played a tournament before Wimbledon,"" she said. ""To play some matches before Wimbledon is good, but on the other hand, I played basically almost every match in Stuttgart, Madrid, Rome and here. We need to take care of my body, as well. We'll see what the plans are.""""The biggest progress on grass I can make right now is using my serves, which has been better,"" Swiatek said, adding, ""Also I don't expect a lot. The balls are different. Overall tennis is different on grass.""Swiatek's work on her serve in the pre-season has reflected glowingly in statistics in the first half of the year.In the lead-up to the French Open , she had won a whopping 83.6 percent of her service games, saving 71.4 percent of break-points. The world No.1 then upped the ante at Roland Garros, winning 85 percent of her service games.The Pole will arrive at the All-England Club in two weeks' time armed with those statistics.""I think playing Wimbledon every year, preparing for two weeks before that, makes me progress anyway,"" she said of the surface. ""Every year when I go there, it becomes easier to transition, easier to adapt.""Swiatek has plans for the serve, which is more of a weapon on grass, than any other surface in the sport.""It will be good to use the progress I have made on my serve on grass,"" she said.It sounded like a warning.",World No.1 Iga Swiatek is looking forward to the grass court season.

The third seed held in a tricky seventh game to take the final into the decider.The 27-year-old, on a 12-match winning streak coming into the final, started the decider confidently, but a sixth doublefault in the third game opened the door for Alcaraz, who took the lead. The Spaniard then produced the game of the final, coming back from 0-40 in an 11-minute exchange in the fourth, saving four breakpoints and finishing with a dropshot that was as gentle as it was deadly.

He’ll have a chance to do that on Sunday.Carlitos or ‘Little Carlos’ would run home after school this time of the year to turn on the television and watch the French Open . The clay court championship is one of Alcaraz’ earliest memories of tennis .“I have watched a lot of matches. Rafa Nadal dominating this tournament for 14-15 years. It's unbelievable,” he said. “I wanted to put my name on that list of Spanish players who have won this tournament. Not only Rafa, but also Juan Carlos Ferrero, Carlos Moya, Alberto Costa… I want to put my name on that list, as well.”Alcaraz, who on Friday became the youngest player to reach Grand Slam finals on all three surfaces -- grass, hard court, and clay – was tooled to excel on all surfaces.Not that the 21-year-old is checking records at this point, more likely that he’s walking around the Eiffel Tower, looking at the iconic five-ring logo of the Olympic Games which was unveiled on Friday.“That is something that I don't want to think about before the final,” he said. “But obviously that means I'm playing good tennis on every surface.”“If I want to be one of the best players in the world, I have to be a good player on every surface, like -- Roger (Federer), Novak (Djokovic), Rafa, Nadal and Andy Murray. The best players in the world have had success on every surface.”The Spaniard might’ve grown up playing on clay, but he enjoys playing on hardcourts the most.“I consider myself the kind of player who can adapt very well his style in every surface. I grew up playing on clay, but I feel more comfortable playing on hard court. I just wanted to be a good player in every surface.”On Sunday, in his third major final, Alcaraz will look to stop the fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev .The 27-year-old German made his first major final in 2020 in New York, four years later, he’s in with a second chance.Zverev leads the head-to-head 5-4, but the Spaniard finished on top in their last meeting in Indian Wells. At the Australian Open in January, Zverev came through in four sets.“Sascha is playing great tennis on clay. Big serve, big shots, really solid,” Alcaraz said. “It's going to be a really interesting final. So I'll try to take the good things that I did in the previous matches and try to improve the bad things that I did against him.”.Zverev, at 27, very much the senior pro in the mix, is ready to swing. “If not now then when?” he asked.“We have had very tough battles in the past,” the German said. “It is going to be a difficult match.

On a perfect spring evening in Paris, when the sun was sharp and the wind chilly, the world No.1 went down on Court Philippe Chatrier to celebrate, the dirt stuck on her knees. It was a squeaky-clean performance otherwise.Swiatek, who later bounced around the court, which must now seem like her backyard, climbed up to her box, reaching for her family and team. As the players waited for the presentation ceremony, the Pole held up four fingers, and recorded the moment on her phone. The four-time French Open champion was misty-eyed.On the other side of the court, Jasmine Paolini was steady in her seat. The Italian, who had never been past the second round here until this year, was putting the 6-2, 6-1 result in perspective.Paolini, aged 28 and ranked 15, is a 5 ft 4’ bundle of joy. She might not have had the weapons to trouble Swiatek, whose game is geared for clay, but the Italian has enjoyed an inspirational run here, showing what hard work and effort could do.“Congratulations Jasmine for an amazing tournament. I’m really impressed with how you’ve been playing, I think you can do so much, especially on clay...” said Swiatek, who has now won 21 straight matches at Roland-Garros, was richer by €2,400,000 on Saturday.“I want to thank my team, my family, without them I wouldn’t be here,” Swiatek said. “I love this place, I wait every year to come back here. I was almost out of the tournament in the second round (against Naoimi Osaka) so thank you for cheering me. This has been a really emotional tournament.”Paolini, who will play the doubles final on Saturday, said, “Congratulations Iga, I think to play you here is the toughest challenge in this sport. I want to thank my team, my family and everyone for believing in me. These have been the best days of my life. It has been a very intense 15 days. Today was tough, but I’m really proud of myself. Merci Boku, Paris.”Paolini, who took home €1,200,000, will make her Top-10 debut on Monday at No.7.On another surface, one that’s faster perhaps and slicker perhaps, the player field has a chance against Swiatek, but on the slow shale of Roland Garros, the 23-year-old won’t allow even a window of opportunity. She uses her topspin to flatten the challenge of her opponents. Not only can the Pole outstay, she can also outhit and outrun. A potent cocktail to go up against.The head-to-head record of the finalists best reflected the rise and rise of Swiatek.The 23-year won the only previous WTA main draw meeting against Paolini at the 2022 US Open first round. They also faced each other in an ITF clay court event in 2018 in Prague, when Swiatek was ranked No.342 and Paolini No.182. Swiatek was 17 then and dropped just three games in that outing.","Iga Swiatek beats Jasmine Paolini 6-2, 6-1 to win French Open. Pole has now won 21 straight matches at Roland Garros.
