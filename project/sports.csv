CHENNAI: When the IPL started, Shivam Dube 's name wasn't getting too much traction for a place in the T20 World Cup squad.But with the IPL at its halfway stage, the Chennai Super Kings player has been able to create a buzz. Starting off the tournament as CSK's designated spin-hitter in the middle-order, the tall left-hander has shown that he can be dangerous against medium-pace as well.In the eight games he has played so far, Dube has smashed 311 runs at a strike rate of 169.94, kick starting the discussion on whether he should board the flight to USA and West Indies in June.But at the end of the day, it is a 15-man squad and there aren't too many slots available. Though Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya hasn't done anything in the IPL with bat or ball, it is unlikely that the selection committee will dare to drop him for the World Cup.The fact that Dube hasn't bowled at all in the IPL so far - courtesy the 'impact player' rule - has left the selectors in the dark about the allrounder's current bowling form.CSK coachStephen Fleming , though, said that Dube is bowling at the nets and keeping himself ready. ""He is working hard on his bowling in practice. With the impact sub rule in place, he's not getting the chance during the match, but that doesn't mean he isn't putting in the hard yards,"" Fleming said.Former national selector Devang Gandhi, who was the coach of Delhi during the last domestic season, thinks that even if Dube doesn't bowl in IPL, he has the capability of pushing in a couple of overs if required in T20s.""He has been in magnificent batting form and I have seen him bowl in Ranji Trophy . He won't do a bad job if he is asked to bowl those couple of overs for India,"" Gandhi told TOI.While bowling is an add-on, it is Dube's ability to generate easy power and clear the fence that has been one of the talking points of this IPL. His long levers have allowed him to launch into big shots and teams have been wary of using spinners against him. The medium-pacers, too, have come in for some rough treatment as Lucknow Super Giants quickies Mohsin Khan and Yash Thakur found out on Tuesday during the course of the left-hander's 27-ball 66.""The good thing about Dube this season is that he is lot more comfortable against quicker bowlers. He has worked on his game against pace and has really been a consistent performer for us so far,"" Fleming said.That said, Dube's fight for a spot in the Indian squad can be with Kolkata Knight Riders' Rinku Singh , who has done well for India whenever he has got a chance. While his chances in the IPL have been less, the left-hander has shown how good a finisher he can be. Add to that, Rinku is a superb fielder and the Indian team management has invested in him as a T20 player.""It is a difficult choice no doubt, but the fact that Dube can be the extra bowling option can tilt the balance in his favour. And on pitches in the West Indies where the ball may just stop a bit and spinners play a significant role, a player like Dube can be a real game-changer,"" Gandhi said.","Shivam Dube has smashed 311 runs at a strike rate of 169.94 in the IPL so far.

But this is a smallish ground, we spoke about the same when we went out to chase. Execution becomes very important, if there's a set batter or a finisher, you'll have to execute well.

NEW DELHI: Veteran paceman Mohit Sharma 's IPL campaign took an unfortunate turn as he etched his name into the record books for the wrong reason, becoming the most expensive bowler in the history of IPL.Despite his experience, Mohit endured a tough outing, conceding runs at an alarming rate that surpassed all previous records. The unwanted milestone serves as a stark reminder of the unforgiving nature of T20 cricket, where fortunes can change in the blink of an eye.Mohit had conceded 42 runs in his three overs after the end of the 18th over, but the final nail in the coffin was put up by Delhi Capitals skipper Rishab Pant , who hammered the Gujarat Titans pacer for 31 runs that included a lone four and 4 thunderous sixes.Mohit went past Basil Thampi of Sunrisers Hyderabad, who leaked 70 runs while playing against RCB in 2018, to create this unwanted record.Pant started off with a double on the first ball, while the second one was wide. But after that, Pant launched himself as he hit a six, followed by a four, and then a hat-trick of sixes to make short work of the GT paceman.Pant and Axar Patel orchestrated a remarkable turnaround, propelling their team to a formidable total of 224 for 4 against GT in Delhi. Facing early adversity at 44 for 3 in 6 overs, Pant and Axar mounted a sensational fightback, forging a scintillating century partnership of 113 runs in just 68 balls for the fourth wicket.Pant's aggressive onslaught yielded an unbeaten 88 off a mere 43 deliveries, laced with five boundaries and an astonishing eight towering sixes. Complimenting him, Axar blazed his way to a brisk 66 from 43 balls, adorned with five fours and four sixes, leaving the opposition in awe of their explosive batting prowess.Tristan Stubbs ' late seven-ball 26-run cameo and Pant's pyrotechnics towards the end took DC beyond the 200-run mark.While Mohit's performance may have been disappointing, it underscores the competitive intensity of the tournament and the challenges faced by players striving for success in the world's premier T20 league.","Mohit Sharma becomes most expensive bowler in IPL history.

Liverpool, who have played one fewer match than Arsenal, face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.""We have made our people very proud, it is a big derby for us and I know what it means,"" said Arteta.The Arsenal manager acknowledged his team's strong start but noted their failure to convert all their chances and some sloppiness in certain areas. However, he praised their second-half performance, citing improved discipline and ruthless finishing.Chelsea suffered a significant setback before the match even began, as their key player Cole Palmer was ruled out due to illness. Palmer has been involved in nearly half of Chelsea's Premier League goals this season, and his absence was keenly felt by the visitors.Despite an unbeaten run of eight league games prior to their FA Cup semi-final loss to Manchester City, Chelsea were outclassed by an Arsenal side eager to reassert their title credentials following a home defeat to Aston Villa.Mauricio Pochettino expressed his disappointment with the result and his team's performance, stating, ""Today we didn't compete against a team fighting for the Premier League. We need to be aware we need to compete in a different way.""Arsenal started the match with incredible intensity, taking the lead within five minutes through Trossard, who has proven to be a more effective signing than Chelsea's January acquisition of Mykhailo Mudryk. Chelsea goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic made several impressive saves to keep his team in the game before halftime, but Arsenal's relentless pressure eventually paid off.White's curling effort from a corner doubled Arsenal's lead early in the second half, and Havertz, who has found consistent form under Arteta, scored twice to put the game out of reach. White's attempted cross, which flew into the top corner, capped off a night to forget for Chelsea, who remained in ninth place, three points behind the European qualification spots.Arsenal's next challenge is a daunting away fixture against Tottenham in the north London derby on Sunday.

It was Ahmed Jahouh, with his third assist of the season, who sent in a cross in front of goal from a corner and the dependable Carlos Delgado was there to meet it with his body and send the ball in.The equaliser got Sergio Lobera ‚Äôs team more pumped as Roy Krishna , Amey Ranawade and Isak Vanlalruatfela kept piling pressure on the Bagan defence with runs down the middle and the flanks. The Shield winners, too, kept pushing for another goal but the Delgado and Fall-led Odisha defence kept the dangers at bay.On the other hand, Odisha‚Äôs chief playmaker Jahouh fell to Habas‚Äôs plan of not being given the space for his long balls and his frustration led to a yellow card in the 23rd minute.But it was Juggernauts‚Äô custodian Amrinder who became the provider in the 39th minute and sent a long ball ahead of the half line. Odisha‚Äôs top scorer, Krishna, received the ball with a header and on finding Subhasish Bose a bit out of position, beat Hector Yuste with his pace to send the ball in with a clinical finish between the legs of Vishal Kaith rushing from the goal and become the joint-top scorer in the league.Petratos and Manvir had chances to level the score soon after but the home side went into the break with a one-goal lead.Lobera‚Äôs men came back with new vigour after the change of ends but could only create half chances as Odisha held fort at the back.The second half, however, was put in the spotlight for the wrong reason as both teams saw themselves go down by a player to red cards.Armando Sadiku, who received a yellow for an outburst of frustration in the first half, got shown the red card for an aerial tackle on Jahouh in the 67th minute. Seven minutes later, it was Delgado who received the marching orders for a second yellow shown for what appeared to be a harsh penalty for an unintentional handball just outside the box.With both teams a man down, the coaches resorted to more cautious approach with a slew of substitutions and the best attacking chance after that went to Bagan who saw the ball hit the crossbar after a goalmouth melee.The scoreline, however, stayed 2-1 in Odisha‚Äôs favour ahead of Sunday‚Äôs second leg in Kolkata.",Odisha FC maintained their unbeaten streak at home as they got the better of Shield winners Mohun Bagan Super Giants 2-1 in the first leg of their ISL semifinal in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday.

But he's right at the same time. I experienced this at the time when I was playing for Milan. He doesn't understand. I understand the situation because I'm originally from Africa. You see where he's coming from, Brazil, where it's completely different, the approach. So it's not surprising that he has made the noise. Because it's not about him, it's about the La Liga .""We have the power to change things, but we are not doing enough. Samuel Eto'o had the same issue at his time. So Vinicius is also part of these players who will suffer because the administrative people are not willing to hit harder. Otherwise, we are happy about his growth,"" he said.""Vinicius is 24. I think he has improved. Remember when he came? Four years ago. He didn't have the ability to finish. You see now his clinical assist and finishing."" Immediately his French soul took over and he referred to Dembele. ""The stats are very poor. Two goals or three goals, but he has great potential.""The one player who is living up to potential is Bellingham . With Euro 2024 round the corner, Desailly feels the Real Madrid star will influence Gareth Southgate's forever underachieving bunch rather positively.""I don't think that he was outstanding last night, but he's been key for his team. (Carlo) Ancelotti could have substituted him. But he took Vinicius out because he knew Bellingham had the legs to defend and to position himself and identify the correct moment to find the killer goal. He is just a good player for now. You try to compare him with Zidane. It's difficult for us to accept that. The use of the ball is different with Zidane and Bellingham. Jude is a bit more straightforward on acceleration. Zizou was more pattern-weaving, ballet-like. But the potential of the talent is quite similar.""With his experience of English football while playing for Chelsea, Desailly is cheekily penetrative in his assessment.""Quality kills the quality. That is England's problem. The Dutch were having this kind of problem too. They all have a high expertise, they all have their own belief every time. It was difficult for them to unite all together at the same moment to perform. So England might have to improve on this aspect because the talent is there. So let's see how the coach is going to be able to adjust and make the choice.""Desailly was born in Accra, Ghana but moved to France with his mother when he was just four.","Marcel Desailly believes Jude Bellingham is living up to his potential. DesAilly believes Real Madrid star Vinicius is a bit too touchy. The former captain of France believes England need to improve their quality. Desaille was born in Accra, Ghana but moved to France with his mother aged four.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109517489,imgsize-32426,width-400,resizemode-4/109517489.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Jude Bellingham 's dramatic late winner in the El Clasico clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona on Sunday has virtually sealed the La Liga title for Los Blancos. The 19-year-old English midfielder's stoppage-time strike secured a 3-2 victory for Real Madrid, extending their lead at the top of the table to a commanding 11 points with just six matches remaining.The match was a thrilling encounter, with both teams displaying resilience and determination.Barcelona took the lead twice, through Andreas Christensen and Fermin Lopez, but Real Madrid fought back on both occasions, equalizing through Vinicius Junior and Lucas Vazquez . It was Bellingham's decisive goal in the dying moments that ultimately settled the contest in Real Madrid's favour.Bellingham's performance in his debut season in Spain has been nothing short of remarkable. With 21 goals across all competitions, he has emerged as Real Madrid's top scorer, showcasing his prowess and maturity beyond his years. His brace in the reverse Clasico fixture against Barcelona in October further underscored his ability to rise to the occasion in high-stakes matches.The victory at the Santiago Bernabeu was a testament to Real Madrid's grit and determination, qualities they have consistently displayed throughout the season. Their ability to bounce back from setbacks, as they did against Manchester City in the Champions League, has been a hallmark of their campaign.Lucas Vazquez, who played a pivotal role in all three of Real Madrid's goals, praised the team's resilience and acknowledged the significance of the win in their pursuit of the La Liga title. ""We've had a very good season, we're on a very good path, now we just have to polish it off and we'll go for everything,"" he told Real Madrid TV.For Barcelona, the defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, especially after their impressive performance following their Champions League exit at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain. Head coach Xavi expressed his frustration with the lack of goal-line technology in La Liga, which denied them a potential goal when Lamine Yamal's flick appeared to have crossed the line.Despite the setback, Barcelona showcased their fighting spirit and determination, with youngsters like Yamal and Pau Cubarsi impressing against the seasoned Real Madrid side. The future looks promising for the Catalan club, but for now, they must focus on securing their position in the league and preparing for the next campaign.Real Madrid find themselves in a commanding position, thanks in no small part to the exploits of Jude Bellingham.

Despite initially cruising to a commanding 3-0 lead against their second-tier opponents, with goals from Scott McTominay , Harry Maguire , and Bruno Fernandes , United's vulnerability in recent weeks was evident as Coventry mounted a stunning comeback.Second-half strikes from Ellis Simms and Callum O'Hare injected new life into the contest, before Haji Wright's 95th-minute penalty leveled the scores, completing a remarkable turnaround.Coventry supporters, buoyed by their team's resurgence, taunted Ten Hag with chants of ""you're getting sacked in the morning,"" adding to the drama of the occasion.In an enthralling period of extra time, both teams struck the woodwork, but it was United who ultimately held their nerve, prevailing in the penalty shootout.Rasmus Hojlund 's decisive spot-kick sealed a dramatic victory for Manchester United, ensuring their progression to yet anotherFA Cup final amidst a season filled with twists and turns.""We put ourselves in a difficult position and should have killed it earlier but we didn't,"" said United captain Fernandes. ""We have to do so much better.""Coventry manager Mark Robins famously played a key part in United's FA Cup final win in 1990, a victory that launched two decades of success under Alex Ferguson.But his team's push to reach the Championship play-offs has faded in recent weeks and they travelled to Wembley as underdogs despite United's stuttering season.United, 12-time winners of the competition, settled early and took the lead in the 23rd minute after a fine move down the right.Alejandro Garnacho fed the overlapping Diogo Dalot, whose cross went under the hands of the diving Bradley Collins and was tapped in by McTominay from close range.Manchester United, 12-time winners of the competition, asserted their dominance early on, taking the lead in the 23rd minute through a fine move down the right flank.

Despite Coventry's spirited display, Fernandes added a third goal for United in the 58th minute, his shot deflecting off defender Bobby Thomas and finding the net.Coventry, however, refused to back down, pulling a goal back through Ellis Simms in the 71st minute and reducing the deficit further when Callum O'Hare's shot deflected off Aaron Wan-Bissaka and past Andre Onana in the 79th minute.As the match intensified, Coventry was awarded a penalty for a handball by Wan-Bissaka, which Haji Wright converted to level the scores and force extra time.In the additional periods, both teams came close to clinching victory, with Fernandes hitting the crossbar for United and Simms striking the woodwork for Coventry. The Championship side thought they had secured a late winner, but VAR ruled out the goal for offside.The match ultimately went to a penalty shootout, where Manchester United prevailed 4-2, with Rasmus Hojlund scoring the decisive spot-kick to send them through to the final against Manchester City.","Manchester United beat Coventry City 4-2 in FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool reignited their Premier League title pursuit with a commanding 3-1 victory over Fulham on Sunday, drawing level on points with table-toppers Arsenal .While Manchester City still hold the fate of the title in their grasp, trailing the top two by just one point with a game in hand, both Liverpool and Arsenal have intensified the pressure on Pep Guardiola's side.This resurgence comes after both teams bounced back from unexpected defeats in the previous weekend.Jurgen Klopp expressed before the match at Craven Cottage that the comeback of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota from injury provided his team with ""a chance"" to reinvigorate their pursuit in the title race.Both were on target, either side of Ryan Gravenberch's first Premier League goal.Klopp took the brave decision to rest a series of first-team regulars among five changes to the side that won 1-0, but failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit against Atalanta in the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday.Mohamed Salah, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and Ibrahima Konate dropped the bench.Alexander-Arnold was one of the few shining lights in Bergamo and was restored for his first Premier League start in over two months.The England international showed the quality the Reds have been missing when he curled in a stunning free-kick to open the scoring on 32 minutes.Liverpool failed to hold onto the lead until half-time as the defensive lapses that have cost them in recent weeks reappeared.Timothy Castagne swept home a loose ball into the far corner after Rodrigo Muniz's header was blocked.Klopp had his stellar cast of substitutes warming up after a sluggish start to the second period.But one wayward pass from Alex Iwobi cost Fulham.Harvey Elliott intercepted on his return to Craven Cottage and teed up Gravenberch to curl in from the edge of the area.Jota then made the points safe with his 100th goal in English football when his low effort had too much power for Bernd Leno 18 minutes from time.Two more away trips at local rivals Everton and West Ham await Liverpool in the next six days.But with just five more games of the Klopp era to come, they remain at least in the hunt to give the German a glorious goodbye to his transformative time at Anfield.","Liverpool beat Fulham 3-1 to draw level on points with table-toppers Arsenal.

BENGALURU: Sumit Nagal 's latest hairdo is short fade.

Nagal, who spent a few days with family and friends while getting his visa sorted, heads back to Europe this week to kick-off a three-week training block at the Nensel academy in Peine, Germany, before returning to his beloved clay courts.The timing of Nagal's training block - when the clay court swing is in full blast in Europe - raised injury worries.The 26-year-old brushed aside concerns with an insouciant shrug, insisting it's a good time for a training block. Nagal explained that he has played from March to March, including in the off-season in December. Ranked 138 at the time, Nagal played the Tennis Premier League , hoping the money would give him the financial freedom to schedule his 2024 season.Nagal will look at his net game and serve, which he noted has been on and off in the last weeks, besides build on his fitness in his time away from the Tour.The Indian is aiming to get a tournament in, perhaps in Lyon, before arriving at Roland Garros.Nagal has enjoyed an inspirational run in the first four months of the year, climbing almost 60 rungs in the ranking, especially coming into his own on clay.Nagal describes his relationship with clay in one word 'smooth', like a sharp cup of espresso. It awakens the competitor in him.""The more time I have, the better I am at chasing down the ball,"" he told TOI.Nagal learnt his tennis on the clay courts of Paschim Vihar in West Delhi as an eight-year-old.""It was probably fast,"" he said of those courts. ""I don't think we have slow clay courts in India. Clay courts are different everywhere, the clay courts in France are very different to Germany, Germany and Austria are similar, they are heavy, wet. France is a little bit hard and fast. Italy has a mix of both, but more on the faster side.""While the tennis world has played on the Nadal, Nagal surname, the Indian gave the legendary Spaniard a verbal salute.""What Rafa has done on clay is just insane,"" he said. ""His game is ridiculous, he moves incredibly, you just cannot hit past him and with that forehand jumping over your head for three or four hours‚Ä¶ It's crazy.""The career he has followed with great personal interest, however, is that of the 25-year-old world No.6 Casper Ruud .""I've learnt a lot from watching Ruud,"" Nagal said. ""I have seen him from his junior days, playing under-14, under-16. The way he has developed his game, is very good.''""I feel like I can play a similar game to him. Serve smart, use a big forehand and have a solid backhand. And use the backhand smartly to get the ball to your forehand side. He has been playing at that level for a long time and I think that's the next step for me, to keep playing at this level, keep playing the ATP Tour level .""Nagal isn't surprised with his form of the first four months of the year, where he scored two top-50 wins and took a set off the world No.7 Holger Rune in Monte Carlo.""I know I can play top-50 tennis and keep improving,"" he said. ""When you lose there are a lot of things you feel you could've done better, but I don't think I lost a match (in the last few months) because of energy or focus.

That's obviously what I work towards, to try and get better and to win tournaments. So, nice to win my second Tour title, almost 10 or 11 months from now (after the first), and to do it on different surfaces, very very happy with that,"" Bhambri said following his victory in the company of French Albano Olivetti on Sunday.The pair defeated the German wildcard combination of Andreas Mies, a two-time doubles Grand Slam winner, and Jan-Lennard Struff, a four-time titleist, 7-6, 7-6.""I hope me and Albano can continue improving and continue getting better with more clay court events and the French Open coming up.""Coach Balachandran Manikkath, who has been working with Bhambri as part of the ""Doubles Dream of India"" programme, provided some insights on the adjustments the Delhi lad has made in his game for the slowest of the three surfaces.""Yuki has been working on playing on clay since Marrakech (ATP 250 event in Morocco). It is obviously different from hard and certain adjustments have to be made with serves, returns, volleys, smash, etc,"" Balachandran said.""He has done a tremendous job as the results show this week. On slow, wet clay courts he is able to hold serve comfortably and his returns are good, volleying is solid.""This win with Olivetti will help confidence on both sides.

So nothing changes there except that both are moving up the rankings.""Bhambri's ranking rose a career-high 54 on Monday while Olivetti moved up to a personal best 45.The rankings at the end of the French Open will determine the entries for the tennis competition at the Olympics , which will be held at the Roland Garros as well.Doubles star Rohan Bopanna is sitting pretty well at World No. 2 at the moment, which gives him a direct entry and a partner of his choice subject to the latter's ranking being in the top-300 ‚Äì in either singles or doubles.""Olympics is not in my control. The selection committee or the AITA decides the team, so I'm focused on trying to improve my ranking, improve my game and just continue on the Tour,"" Bhambri said.""Whether I like to play the Olympics, I absolutely would.

The Olympics is the biggest stage but, again, this is not in my hands.""Returning to what is in his control, Bhambri said the Munich triumph would not change his preference for hard.""Hardcourt is always going to be my preference. Just for the sole purpose that it requires less adjustment for me because I've played on it all my life,"" he said.""So, no matter how many titles I am gonna win on clay or grass, hardcourt is going to be the preference.""It (doubles) is a bit different compared to singles. Doubles is less movement, which makes it a bit easier but there's still technical aspects of doubles, which in general doesn't involve so much side to side movement.""There is a lot of serving and volleying, and returning fast points. So you have to be good at that, regardless of any surface if you want to succeed in doubles.""Given the necessities of the modern game where entries into big tournaments breaks and makes partnerships, Bhambri, who decided to focus on doubles only two seasons back, has become adept at playing on both sides of the court.""Yuki plays ad court with Olivetti. He played deuce with Robin Hasse in Dubai and reached semis. In Madrid last week he played deuce with Arel Behar too,"" Balachandran said.""Now he is comfortable playing on either side. Just that he has played more on ad court, and people recognise him as an ad court player. That will change soon as he plays on either side with different partners.""Known for avoiding late hours, playing on the Tour has also brought a bit of change to Bhambri's personal side.""Well, I've been part of the Tour for a long time now. So I know most of them. Of course, I miss partying with with Roger (Federer) and Rafa (Nadal), enjoying nights out with them. Since they are not much around on the Tour, it's not the same,"" he said.""Maybe the next generation I can hang out with more, stay out late and socialize with them more ‚Äì the Alcaraz's and the Kyrgios's of the tour.""",Yuki Bhambri won his second Tour title with a win at the BMW Open in Munich. The 31-year-old has won his first two titles on the doubles Tour on grass and clay.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one and two-time Grand Slam champion Garbine Muguruza announced her retirement from tennis on Saturday, following a hiatus of over a year without competing.Speaking at a press conference during the Laureus Awards, the 30-year-old reflected on her illustrious career, stating, ""The time has come to say goodbye. It has been a long and beautiful journey, but I feel that the moment to retire has arrived.""Muguruza's decision marks the end of a remarkable tenure in professional tennis, during which she achieved significant milestones and left an indelible mark on the sport.""It's a decision that I've been taking little by little.""Muguruza's last official match was at the Lyon Open in January 2023, marking her temporary departure from the sport. Following this event, she refrained from competing, leading to her eventual retirement announcement.""When I stopped competing, I returned home and I welcomed the break with open arms,"" said Muguruza who ends her career with 10 singles titles.""Every day that went by I felt better and I didn't miss the discipline and the difficulty of the life I had before, so it has been a progressive thing.""Muguruza's WTA main-draw debut occurred in 2012, marking the beginning of her professional journey. Her breakthrough on the Grand Slam stage came in 2015 when she reached her first final at Wimbledon , where she faced Serena Williams but was unable to clinch the title.However, she swiftly bounced back, securing her maiden Grand Slam victory at the French Open in 2016 by defeating Serena Williams. The following year, Muguruza continued her success by triumphing over Venus Williams to claim the Wimbledon title.These victories solidified her place in tennis history, as her French Open win made her the first Spanish woman to win a Grand Slam since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998, while her Wimbledon triumph made her the first Spanish female champion at the All England Club since Conchita Martinez in 1994.Martinez's influence played a significant role in Muguruza's success, as she coached her to the Wimbledon title. In a fitting turn of events, just two months after her Wimbledon triumph, Muguruza ascended to the number one ranking in the world, cementing her status as one of tennis's elite players.",Garbine Muguruza announces her retirement from tennis on Saturday.

Captain's role doesn't make much difference: AITA secretary Dhupar on India's BJK Cup performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/captains-role-doesnt-make-much-difference-aita-secretary-dhupar-on-indias-bjk-cup-performance/articleshow/109410678.cms,"PUNE: The Indian women's failure to qualify for the Billie Jean King Cup Playoffs has brought the focus on captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule but the All India Tennis Association believes the players have to step up.""The girls did well. I think after winning the first (singles) match against New Zealand, we should have won the tie,"" said AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar on Thursday.India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week.Winning the tie would have placed the team second in final standings, thereby securing them a spot in the Playoffs in November.""We are remaining in Group 1, but I was expecting to qualify,"" said Dhupar but then switched to highlighting the association's efforts in hosting tournaments through the season to help players gain ranking points.""The association has done everything. The girls have had the opportunity to get a lot of points, and we had organised a camp in China.""And they were all playing well. Ankita had just won a tournament (in doubles) in Japan just the week before.""Dhupar, however, brushed aside the questionable team combinations fielded by the captain and the coach.After entering Sahaja Yamalapalli in singles and pairing Rutuja Bhosale with Prarthana Thombare against the strong Chinese team, the team's think-tank opted to put Rutuja in singles and hand Ankita the additional duty of doubles for the remaining three ties.It proved to be disastrous as it left Ankita with little time to recover with only a 30-minute gap between second singles and the decisive doubles matches. Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective. ""If I were the coach or the captain, and if I find my No. 1 player not performing, I would put my No. 3 or any other player in,"" Bal, a former Davis Cup player, said.""Try something different, think out of the box. It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players. The captain, the coach and the support staff are appointed by the executive committee of the AITA,"" he said.Both captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule did not respond to request for a comment.",India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week.
