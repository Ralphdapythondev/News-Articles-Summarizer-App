'Umran Malik is a classic case': Former India bowling coach on why the fast bowler faded away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/umran-malik-is-a-classic-case-former-india-bowling-coach-on-why-the-fast-bowler-faded-away/articleshow/112881313.cms,"NEW DELHI: Young fast bowler Umran Malik rose to fame with a remarkable IPL season for Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2022, thanks to his blistering pace and ability to consistently bowl over 150 km/h. His performances earned him a spot in the Indian white-ball squad , where he played 10 ODIs and 8 T20Is, taking 24 wickets within just over a year.Despite this early promise, Malik has not featured for India in more than a year, raising questions about the decline of the once-promising fast bowler.Former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey believes that Malik's rapid rise without substantial red-ball cricket experience is a significant factor in his current predicament.According to Mhambrey, Malik's swift ascent to the national team via the IPL is typical of a bowler who lacks the grounding that comes from playing longer formats. With only 12 First-Class matches under his belt, Malik has struggled to maintain his place in the national lineup.""Umran is a classic case of someone who has not played enough red-ball cricket,"" Mhambrey told The Indian Express. ""He came into reckoning through the IPL. That's 24 balls in a game. Sometimes you don't even get to bowl 24 balls. The amount of pressure in bowling 24 balls is not like the red ball. I feel this (T20) is not a format to judge a prospect.""Mhambrey emphasizes the importance of First-Class cricket for developing a bowler's skills and endurance. He explains that while the IPL offers a platform for showcasing talent, it doesn't replicate the mental and physical demands of longer formats.""For all the perks that come with bowling in the IPL, it has its repercussions as well,"" Mhambrey continued. ""We made sure that he played Ranji Trophy and red-ball cricket. The moment you play one season, you understand your bowling. Physically, you will be tested in different phases of the game. Sometimes you will have to be on the ground for six sessions. And to be able to bowl with that intensity when the last session is coming up, you will be physically and mentally challenged. And you need to go through that.""Mhambrey's insights highlight a crucial element in Umran Malik's development: the need for experience and endurance that comes only from playing red-ball cricket. Without this foundation, Malik has found it challenging to adjust to the rigors of international cricket, leading to his exclusion from the team.",Former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey believes Umran Malik's rapid rise to the national team is due to a lack of red-ball cricket experience. Malik rose to fame with a remarkable IPL season for Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2022. He has not featured for India in more than a year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112881328,imgsize-27888,width-400,resizemode-4/112881328.jpg"

Zaheer Khan

as mentor

Excerpts...

Are you retaining

KL Rahul

?

SG:

In case he is retained, will he stay as the captain?

SG:

A lot has been said about your chat with Rahul after the 10-wkt loss to SRH. What had transpired?

SG:

ECB

has expressed keenness to have IPL team owners on board for The Hundred. Are you interested?

SG:

ECB has indicated they will not give control to the IPL owners...

SG:

Zaheer, your take on the Impact Sub rule in the IPL...

ZK:

Zaheer, you have experience as a top-class player as well as managing players. How do you see your new role as mentor of LSG?

ZK:

Are you fine with mega auctions every few years which can disturb the team balance?

SG:

KOLKATA: Lucknow Super Giants unveiled former India pacer Zaheer Khan as their mentor for the coming season here on Wednesday.""As a mentor, it will be my responsibility to build the culture of cricket at LSG ,"" Zaheer said. Team owner Sanjiv Goenka said, ""I needed somebody with a habit of winning and Zaheer comes with that mindset.""Goenka and Zaheer took time out to speak to TOI on various issues.Do you expect us to talk about retention policy three months in advance? I mean, which team is going to disclose who they are retaining? I don't think it would be right to expect us to share that. Having said that, Rahul has been a very integral and important part of the Super Giants family.As far as I am personally concerned, he is part of my family. ZK: At this stage all we can say is that Rahul is a top man and he has been part of Lucknow Super Giants since the inception, something that is very special. We recognise his contribution.At this stage, I am not willing to discuss retention or anything related to that.In an interview, Justin Langer (coach) has shared exactly what had happened. That's what it was, what is the point in repeating it (Langer had referred to the incident as a storm in an espresso cup).We are certainly examining the prospect and whether we are interested or not depends on the terms and conditions and that we don't know until the tender documents are out.If you are not going to give control, then what are we getting? We don't know yet.I look at the positive side of it. I feel a genuine allrounder can never be stopped. He will still have his value in gold. But what is nice about this rule is that it's allowing one more uncapped Indian player to showcase his talent. You have seen in the past two years that enough number of such players have got the opportunity because of this rule and they shone. The future looks bright for them, something you'll see in the mega-auction when they go for decent money.I believe that as a mentor, it will be my responsibility to cultivate and nurture the cricketing culture, which is already being established. I am perceiving this team as an incredibly consistent unit, regularly reaching the playoffs. Over the course of eighteen years of IPL, we have witnessed the immense challenges faced by numerous teams, but the ability to consistently achieve this feat speaks volumes about the robust processes already in place. For me, it's about elevating the team.Yes, I am okay with the mega auction.","Lucknow Super Giants unveiled former India pacer Zaheer Khan as their mentor for the coming season here on Wednesday.

Is he the next Usain Bolt? 14-year-old Divine Iheme shatters 100m world record for his age group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/athletics/is-he-the-next-usain-bolt-14-year-old-divine-iheme-shatters-world-100m-record-for-his-age-group/articleshow/112880818.cms,"Who is Divine Iheme?

It might be too early to crown Divine Iheme as the next Usain Bolt , but the 14-year-old sprinting sensation from Great Britain is certainly making waves in the athletics world. With his recent performances, Iheme has brought back memories of Bolt's electrifying runs, signaling the arrival of a potential future star.Divine Iheme obliterated the world 100m record for his age group, clocking an extraordinary 10.30 seconds at the Lee Valley athletics meet on August 26.This stunning achievement surpasses the previous record of 10.51 seconds, set by Jamaica’s Sachin Dennis, and places Iheme in the global spotlight as one of the most promising young athletes.Known as 'Lightning Divine,' Iheme was already recognized as the fastest 14-year-old over 100m in the UK, having set a personal best of 10.56 seconds at the England Athletics Under-15 and Under-17 Open Championships last month.His 10.30-second sprint at Lee Valley not only smashed the previous world best but also placed him third on the European under-18 all-time list. Only Great Britain’s Teddy Wilson (10.26) and France’s Jeff Erius (10.27) have recorded faster times in the under-18 category.If Iheme continues his rapid progress, he could potentially challenge the legendary Usain Bolt's 100m world record of 9.58 seconds in the future.Born on January 1, 2009, to Nigerian parents Innocent and Nkiruku Iheme, Divine has grown up in a highly supportive sporting environment. His mother, Nkiruku, who also coaches him, founded the PWD Athletic Academy in Oxfordshire, where the family resides and Divine trains. Both of his parents have a rich athletic background, having represented Nigeria at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.Despite his rapid rise, Divine remains humble and attributes his success to natural talent. He has closely studied the techniques of legendary sprinters like Usain Bolt and Allyson Felix but insists on maintaining his unique style.""I’ve watched quite a lot of Usain Bolt’s races and Allyson Felix’s 200m, 400m, and relays,"" Iheme shared with Sky Sports. ""Probably the first race I watched was his 200m world record, the 19.19, and I was inspired to pursue the dream. In my opinion, I think my running style is unique and natural. I don’t try to model it from anyone. It’s just a God-given talent.""As Iheme continues to break records and attract attention with his extraordinary performances, he is being touted as a future track star for Great Britain.

"Jay Shah elected ICC chief unopposed, emphasises on gobalisation of cricket",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/jay-shah-elected-icc-chief-unopposed-emphasises-on-gobalisation-of-cricket/articleshow/112852075.cms,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Indian cricket board’s incumbent secretary Jay Shah on Tuesday became the youngest independent chairman of the International Cricket Council ( ICC ). Shah, 35, was elected unopposed after current chairman Greg Barclay refused to seek a third term.He is the fifth Indian – after Jagmohan Dalmiya, Sharad Pawar, N Srinivasan and Shashank Manohar – to be elected to this high-profile position.“I am humbled by the nomination as the ICC chair,” Shah said. He will have to quit as BCCI secretary before taking up the ICC job.Shah, who also serves as president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), will assume office at the ICC headquarters in Dubai on December 1. An ICC chairman is eligible for three terms of two years each, and Barclay, a New Zealand-based attorney, has completed four years.ICC had announced that elections for the chairman’s post would only occur if multiple candidates were nominated. However, with Jay Shah being the sole nominee, the election process was straightforward.Shah’s popularity among the ICC’s more than 100 member nations was evident at the ICC’s annual conference in Colombo in July.“Shah’s election marks a new chapter for the ICC as it seeks to expand the game’s reach and continue its evolution on the global stage,” the council stated in its release.BCCI will now have to look for Shah’s replacement since the board’s constitution doesn’t permit a person to hold two posts. He is into his second term as BCCI secretary after being first elected in October 2019. According to the BCCI Constitution, Shah was supposed to go into a mandatory cooling-off period in the BCCI next year.Shah, who is currently heading the ICC’s Finance and Commercial Affairs Committee (F&CAC), said globalisation of the game, keeping the inclusion of cricket in LA Olympics 2028 in mind, would be his priority.“I am committed to working closely with the ICC team and our member nations to further globalise cricket. The inclusion of our sport in the Olympics at LA 2028 represents a significant inflection point for the growth of cricket, and I am confident that it will drive the sport forward in unprecedented ways,” he said.Shah also pointed to the need to find a way to sustain all formats of the game.“We stand at a critical juncture where it is increasingly important to balance the coexistence of multiple formats, promote the adoption of advanced technologies, and introduce our marquee events to new global markets. Our goal is to make cricket more inclusive and popular than ever before,” he claimed.As far as the BCCI is concerned, a candidate to replace Shah can be finalised by November after thorough discussion. From the current set of office-bearers, treasurer Ashish Shelar is seen as a strong candidate ahead of joint secretary Devajit Saikia.It will be interesting to see if Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman Arun Dhumal, who served as BCCI treasurer in the previous term, is considered for the role. It will be a tricky challenge with the mega IPL auction looming. There is speculation over Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) president Rohan Jaitley being a potential candidate.It remains to be seen if the board decides to elect someone new for the post or elevates one of its existing office-bearers.“These calls are taken when all board members meet with other important stakeholders in Indian cricket. Things change at the last moment in BCCI. Nothing can be said till then,” a senior BCCI functionary told TOI.Son of India’s home minister Amit Shah, Jay has been in cricket administration since 2009 when he was part of a district body in Gujarat before assuming the role of joint secretary in Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) in 2013. He first assumed BCCI office, along with Sourav Ganguly as president, at a time when the board came through rocky waters after being run by the Supreme Court’s appointed Committee of Administrators for nearly three years.His experience of being an administrator at GCA, where he oversaw the making of the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, came in handy when the board had to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic up front in his tenure as BCCI secretary.Hosting a successful IPL in UAE in 2020 and the ICC T20 World Cup in the same country in 2021 came as a major shot in his arm. Another highlight of his BCCI tenure was the 2022 IPL media rights auction, which saw astronomical bids reflecting the growing global appeal of Indian cricket. Shah spearheaded the negotiations, resulting in a recordbreaking deal worth Rs 48,390 crores for a five-year period.In the last year, Shah has been instrumental in the growth of women’s cricket in India as BCCI brought in pay parity for its international cricketers besides raising the match fees of both men and women domestic cricketers. He played a key role in the launch of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in 2022.Shah was also instrumental in building the new National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore on a large piece of land acquired by the BCCI in 2008.

Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva eyes Test Championship points against England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/sri-lanka-captain-dhananjaya-de-silva-eyes-test-championship-points-against-england/articleshow/112874851.cms,"Nissanka and Kumara recalled

Sri Lanka team for second Test:

NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka Dhananjaya de Silva is optimistic about his team's chances of improving their position in the World Test Championship ( WTC ) standings. The upcoming Test match at Lord's presents an opportunity for Sri Lanka to secure their first-ever victory in the five-day format at the iconic venue.Despite a valiant effort in the first Test at Old Trafford, Sri Lanka suffered a narrow five-wicket defeat.To keep their hopes alive in the three-match series, the tourists must emerge victorious at Lord's, a ground where they have drawn six and lost two of their eight previous encounters.A win would level the series at 1-1, setting the stage for a decisive final Test at the Oval next month.De Silva is mindful of Sri Lanka's current standing in the WTC table, where they occupy the fifth position, just below England. A strong performance in the remaining matches could potentially propel them higher in the rankings.""It is all about getting a Test win,"" he told a pre-match press conference at Lord's on Wednesday, as quoted by AFP. ""It will mean a lot for the country. But more importantly we need to get points in the World Test Championship.""We are more confident heading into this game. We were confident at Old Trafford as well but we failed to deliver. We have to be clear with our plans and execute them well.""Sri Lanka have altered their lineup with a pair of modifications.Pathum Nissanka, who has thrived in ODIs this year but hasn't featured in a Test since 2022, takes the place of Kusal Mendis in the upper order. Meanwhile, right-arm fast bowler Lahiru Kumara has been brought in to replace left-arm seamer Vishwa Fernando.""Overall, Pathum is the best batter in the country at the moment,"" said De Silva. ""He has a good mindset and he has a good technique.""Dinesh Chandimal, who scored a resilient 79 in the second innings at Old Trafford, has been included in the squad despite a painful thumb injury sustained while batting against fast bowler Mark Wood. However, he may not take up wicketkeeping duties, with Nishan Madushka on standby to step in behind the stumps.England will be missing the injured Wood for the Lord's Test, but De Silva noted that new-ball specialist Chris Woakes has been a more challenging opponent for Sri Lanka's batsmen.""I am not concerned about the speed,"" the 32-year-old middle-order batsman explained. ""Speed is not troubling us. It is the line and length that's troubling us. Chris Woakes is able to bowl 20 to 30 balls at one area and that's what is troubling us.""One Sri Lanka batsman arriving at Lord's in top form is Kamindu Mendis.The left-hander notched his third century in just four Tests with a brilliant 113 at Old Trafford, giving him an impressive average of 92.16 as he prepares to fulfill a childhood dream by playing at Lord's.""It was a dream to play at Lord's when I was a boy,"" said the 25-year-old Mendis. ""I'm excited to play here.""Dimuth Karunaratne, Nishan Madushka (wkt), Pathum Nissanka, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Dhananjaya De Silva (capt), Kamindu Mendis, Prabath Jayasuriya, Asitha Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, Milan Rathnayake","Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva is optimistic about his team's chances of improving their position in the World Test Championship standings.

And I'm not looking too far into the future because sometimes you can get stuck in thinking about what's going to happen. I've had scored a lot of runs in the last one year in all formats. I've just been trying to continue doing what I've been doing the last one year on every given opportunity…taking every opportunity as a new day,"" Karun said, as quoted by PTI.Seven years have passed since Nair last represented India, but recent performances suggest a resurgence. His time with Vidarbha in domestic cricket and Northamptonshire in English county cricket has yielded promising results.Nair's stint with Northamptonshire proved particularly fruitful.In 2023, he amassed 249 runs in three matches at an impressive average of 83, including a century against eventual champions Surrey. This year, he continued his solid form, accumulating 487 runs in seven matches at an average of 49, highlighted by another century against Glamorgan.While not astronomical figures, these consistent performances have instilled a renewed sense of confidence in the batsman.Beyond the runs, Nair opened up on the invaluable experience gained from playing in English conditions, adding, ""You are playing with a different ball there – literally. Everyone knows for Indian batsmen to go and score runs in England…to play the moving ball is tough. So, I've learnt a lot more about myself as a batsman and finding ways to score runs and believing in yourself. There are so many things that I've learnt in England that, you know, maybe I had it in me but I didn't realise all this while.""The move to Vidarbha from Karnataka for the last domestic season proved another turning point. Frustrated by limited opportunities in his home state, Nair found a welcoming environment in Vidarbha. He responded with 690 runs in 10 matches, including two centuries, playing a pivotal role in their journey to the Ranji Trophy semifinals.While a return to the Indian team remains a driving force, Nair intends to achieve immediate goals, noting, ""Yes, of course. Everyone plays this game to go out there and represent your country and that's my only aim now -- to play Test cricket again, which I think, I'm very confident that I can. I know that I'm good enough.""Nevertheless, he is focused on leading the Mysore Warriors to victory in the ongoing KSCA Maharaja T20 tournament .

TOI was the first to report, on March 31, that a memorial will be built at the Shivaji Park for Achrekar.The idea to build a memorial for Achrekar at the Shivaji Park was initiated, and continuously followed up by one of Achrekar's students, Sunil Ramachandran , who is the former captain of the Kamat memorial Cricket Club and is presently the assistant general secretary of the Shivaji Park Gymkhana. ""It was possible because of the guidance and support of (MNS chief) Raj Thackeray ,"" Sunil Ramachandran, the Ex-Captain of Kamat memorial Cricket Club and Asst. Gen.

So this memorial will be a fitting tribute to him. He was devoted to cricket and young cricketers. He was like a Godfather for his students, providing them with all the facilities. Even though we were just middle-class people, he would hardly charge anything from his students, and would in fact waive off the coaching fees of poor kids. he would even buy school books for his students, many of whom he got admitted to the Shardashram Vidyamandir school from the Municipalty school. His aim was to make his student into a good human being, and not just a good cricketer. of course, he had a great eye for talent. 'Sir' was a god-gifted coach.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru spinner Karn Sharma recently shared insights on former skipper Virat Kohli ’s leadership during a conversation on Manjot Kalra’s YouTube channel.Reflecting on his Test debut against Australia in Adelaide in 2014, Karn, now 36, highlighted how Kohli's approach as captain left an indelible mark on the team.Kohli, who took over the captaincy from MS Dhoni in the middle of the Test series, immediately set the tone with an aggressive mindset that would come to define his tenure.“Making my Test debut against Australia in Australia will always remain special. Very few people get that type of start. The dressing room atmosphere was quite good. Ravi Shastri, the coach, was there. We were chasing over 300 runs in that match and Virat said 'no draw. We are going to chase it down.' That injected a lot of positivity among players in the dressing room,” Karn recalled, emphasizing the fearless attitude Kohli brought to the team.The leggie noted that this bold approach was a departure from the norm and something that left a lasting impression on the players.“It was a different approach. Different captains have different approaches, but ever since he said we are chasing over 300 in the fourth innings of a Test – which was very tough in Australian conditions – it sent a wonderful indication to the players in the dressing room that your captain has different plans,"" he added.This moment, Sharma believes, encapsulated Kohli's unyielding spirit, a trait that has become synonymous with his leadership. Despite the challenges, Kohli's demeanour never wavered, even when the runs didn’t come easily.“He didn't get runs, but to be honest, it never looked as if he was out of form. He always gave that impression that everything is fine.

The third season of the DP World International League T20 is all set to run from January 11 to February 9, 2025.The month-long tournament will feature 34 matches at the three UAE cricket venues – Dubai, Sharjah and Abu Dhabi.During his visit to Mumbai, White spoke to TOI in an exclusive interview on a variety of topics:I think firstly, if we go from Season 1 to Season 2, I came on board on the 1st of September last year. So, I came in quite late and our immediate focus was to increase the crowds because I think in Season 1, the crowds were low. So pleasingly, we got a 300% increase in the crowds, so we had 200,000 people for last year, including 25,000 at the final. So, that was a positive. But for Season 3, a big focus for us is working more closely with our commercial partners. In particular, our broadcaster (Zee Entertainment) and we have already had a month or so, we've been in discussions about planning and working in more collaboration to ensure that collectively. With the forecast to end with the franchise team so that we can grow the league. So I think that's a big focus for us is to take more of a collective approach to grow there. So, we're doing that now and we'll get into more detail about that soon, but I'm just trying to giving you an umbrella picture and then from a cricket point of view, you've seen the retentions with that, and on the 15th of September, we will announce the new signings. And I'm pleased to say that we've got a lot of good signings, majority of those high-profile players have international T20 experience and IPL experience. So, we'll announce that on the 15th of September so I think we're in a pretty good place.Yep. I think that there's been some inquiries in that direction. But that's only happened in the last 24 hours. So I haven't got anything to report on that, but there's certainly interest. But we've no idea of whether he's going to carry on playing cricket of that standard or not, but as soon as we heard the news, we were making some enquiries, but we've had no more information so far. We are just trying to investigate whether he has retired fully from cricket or not. I'm not going to hide that there is an interest, of course.This year, we've been restricted. The window has been very much restricted by the ICC Champions Trophy because the Champions Trophy starts 10 days after the conclusion of ILT20. And the reason we moved it back a week was because of because of the Champions Trophy and primarily because of the possibility the possibility, not the certainty, that Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) could be used or the UAE could be used as a backup for the Champions Trophy, if not all of the Champions Trophy is played in Pakistan, so no decisions have been made. But it is an alternative if all of the matches are not played in Pakistan.So, in terms of the future, ideally my personal view is that to have an independent window for ourselves would be perfect and it's something that we're investigating in the future. And it might push out a little bit further into February-March. There's a possibility. And if that happened, then it would be that DP World ILT20 would conclude before the commencement of IPL, but there could be a possibility that it could have a window where there's not much overlap at all.I think we've got to make it clear that this an international style of tournament of a high profile. Shikhar Dhawan is different, he is still international quality. We don't want it to be a legends tournament. It is not a legends tournament. This is a high-standard international team, nine international players, all of current IPL or international class, majority of them or promising young players coming through. So, it's not a retirement tournament at all. This is high-level tournament. In fact, after the right first two seasons of our league, some people who have played with us have been taken into the IPL later. Two really interesting examples are (Australian opener) Jake Fraser MCGurk, who played in last year, went on to IPL and the latest one is (England wicketkeeper-batsman) Jamie Smith.He made a Test hundred (against Sri Lanka) just the other day. He played in it (ILT20) last year as well. So whilst we want current internationals or IPL players, it also is an opportunity for aspirant players to come through promising players to make their name. So, it's a great opportunity. Some young UAE players have really stepped up and played well. It's a great opportunity for the established and promising players. I really want to stress that this is a high-quality tournament of current international and IPL players.No, I've been 12 years as CEO of New Zealand Cricket. I've dealt with the BCCI and a lot of the Indians. I'm used to dealing with Indian companies and it's great fun. We are very fortunate to have three very high-profile IPL teams as owners, in addition to having the Glazer family (Desert Vipers) who are one of the team owners.Now, what we're looking to do is consolidate and really ensure that the franchise teams become sustainable, economically established and that they develop their own fan base. I think that's very important over the next few years. So, it's just short-term and logically that you think long-term that there's a natural potential for expansion, but not in the short term.So what we've talked about and planned for next year is, 34 games in 30 days is a lot, and especially when you've got a confined area of Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. But we want to focus on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, when the big crowds can come. But it's very important that it presents well on TV, the league. We never want it to look like empty stadiums. So what we've done in Dubai is that for the opening game, it will be a big crowd. A big opening and then after that we take the top tier, we cover with the players images and things. So the bottom tier, because it's a big stadium, of around 25,000 people. So we'll always have it. It will always look good on TV which is really important.We have 60,000 registered players in our cricket board. These are the official players, not the casual, street cricketers. A lot of lot of people play cricket in the labour camps and things and you know we got a really interesting, diverse population with Indian, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Afghanistan, Australians, South Africans and England as well. So that's really important and we're using ILT20 to promote cricket in the UAE as well. And it's a key part of our high-performance program. So for the UAE cricket team, I think, last year they qualified for the Asia Cup T20 for the first time in many years and I think that was on the back of ILT20 where a number of UAE players did really well. So, it's playing a key role in the high performance of the UAE, because we're unique. We are not a full-member country like Australia, South Africa and England, where they've got big leagues. It's (developing local players) is very important for us.It's been fun, interesting and challenging. But I think from a global perspective, I think that the potential in UAE is massive and I think that in yearsto come, I think the way the world cricket is going in the future, I think you know you can have an annual ICC event which is critical. And why is that critical? Because it helps fund them the member boards. I think that's really important for the future and funding of the game. Then, of course, you've got the IPL. I think underneath that there's going to be another three to five big leagues, which will establish over time, and I think they will be based on economics and having an economically stable environment. The beauty of the UAE is that we've got a big, strong economic environment. A lot of wealth in the UAE. And also a great time zone. We have proximity to India, a cricket powerhouse, and we're very lucky to have a great long-term telecast agreement with Zee. It gives us real stability as does our agreement. With DP World, we get the conference, so that gives us stability and it gives us a great platform to move on. And on top of that, the fact that we can have nine overseas players really gives us that international flavour.Well, that's a balance, isn't it? You know, it's a balance that the international game is going to sort out. But you know what, cricketers have never had it better. If you're a player, you've never had a time where you can play international cricket and where you can play in these T20 leagues. That's fantastic for the players.Now, even New Zealand Cricket has got player contracts which factor in player participation in these T20 leagues. NZC, your ex-employers, have devised this contract called casual contract. Someone like Devon Conway has signed itI think that in the next two to three years, there's going to be a lot of change as the game evolves. But like I said before, I think you can have that annual ICC event which is really important for the global game, because that money funds the boards.","The third season of the DP World International League T20 is set to run from January 11 to February 9, 2025.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian fast bowler Zaheer Khan has taken on the position of team mentor for the Lucknow Super Giants . He expressed his excitement about this new role, stating, it's the start of something ""very, very special.""The Lucknow Super Giants have had a mixed performance in the IPL since their debut in 2022. With Gautam Gambhir as their previous team mentor, they managed to reach the playoffs in their first two seasons.However, following Gambhir's exit, the team faced challenges and ended up in a disappointing seventh place this season.""LSG are a relatively young franchise in IPL, but it has not been looked upon like that, the building blocks are pretty much in place,"" Zaheer said, as quoted by Kolkata, at the media interaction at the RPSG Group Headquarters in Kolkata.""They have made a lot of progress. The consistency with reaching playoffs, which is so tough in this fiercely-contested competition, is something that gives me a lot of confidence when I'm looking at coming and contributing to the franchise's success.""We have similar stances on many things when it comes to cricket, where LSG should go in future, what kind of cricketing values, the brand of cricket the team should look to play.""The appointment marks the return of the 45-year-old left-arm pacer to the IPL after a two-year hiatus, following his stint with five-time champions Mumbai Indians from 2018 to 2022.Zaheer will step into the role left vacant by Gambhir, who rejoined his former franchise, Kolkata Knight Riders, last year and led them to the IPL title before taking over as head coach of the Indian team.Expectations are high for the former India star, who has expressed his commitment to doing whatever it takes for the franchise.""The process is something that will be required and which will be my responsibility. I will make sure that the process, that is required for each individual to express themselves fully to bring a lot of victories to the franchise, is in place.""I will be closely looking at the decision-making for LSG to go to the next level. Hopefully this season is going to be the special one and the beginning of something very, very special for this franchise,"" Zaheer added.At Mumbai Indians, Zaheer held the position of director of cricket before transitioning to head of global development.Currently, LSG lacks a bowling coach following the departure of South African fast bowler Morne Morkel, who has joined Gambhir's coaching staff with the Indian team.""Do you need a bowling coach when I'm here? I will do everything that the team needs,"" Zaheer said.According to reports, Zaheer will take on additional responsibilities during the off-season, including scouting and contributing to the player development program.Prior to his coaching career, Zaheer represented three IPL franchises: Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, and Delhi Daredevils.Over 10 seasons, Zaheer appeared in 100 matches for these teams, claiming 102 wickets at an economy rate of 7.58.Zaheer's last appearance in the IPL came in 2017 when he led the Delhi Daredevils as their captain. Following that season, he announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.Sanjiv Goenka, the owner of the LSG team, praised Zaheer's relentless pursuit of excellence and his unwavering determination to succeed.""His ability to keep winning, keep having this strong hunger for success is something that attracted me towards getting him as part of the LSG franchise,"" Goenka said.""A couple of weeks ago, I realised that he was not with not any cricketing franchise, so I called him up, we spoke, we agreed and he is here.""So, it's as short and as quick as it gets. We are very excited to have him on board. We do believe he will do wonders for future of LSG,"" he added.Asked about the fitness of pace sensation Mayak Yadav, Goenka said: ""He's with NCA, it's not for me to comment on his fitness.

Champions League 2024/25: How new UCL format promises more of almost everything storied clubs wanted from UEFA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/champions-league/top-stories/champions-league-2024/25-how-new-ucl-format-promises-more-of-almost-everything-storied-clubs-wanted-from-uefa/articleshow/112836716.cms,"NEW DELHI: The UEFA Champions League , also considered the pinnacle of European club football , has introduced a significant format overhaul for the current season, marking the most substantial changes since 2003.This transformation aims to cater to the desires of Europe's elite clubs for more games, increased competition, and, consequently, a substantial rise in prize money.The revised structure now features a 36-team league phase, replacing the traditional group stage, and introduces a minimum of eight matches for each team, up from six, with the competition extending into January for the first time.Financially, the stakes have never been higher, with a prize money pool that has surged by at least 25% to a minimum of 2.5 billion euros.This increase not only reflects the expanded format but also the growing commercial appeal of the competition.The new league phase alone will host 144 total games, a significant jump from the 96 in the previous group stage format, promising more high-stakes football for fans around the globe.The reimagined format eliminates the previous group-stage setup of 32 teams divided into eight groups of four.Instead, it introduces a single-standings league where each of the 36 teams plays eight games against different opponents. This structure ensures a broader range of matchups and aims to enhance competitive balance and sporting interest by increasing the number of meaningful matches.The top eight teams in the standings will advance directly to the pre-quarterfinals, while those ranked ninth to 24th will enter a new knockout playoff round, leaving the bottom 12 teams eliminated.The allocation of the four additional spots in the competition has been strategically designed to reward performance and promote inclusivity.Two places have been awarded to the national leagues of Italy and Germany, reflecting their clubs' strong performances in UEFA competitions in the previous season.Meanwhile, France's Ligue 1 , being the fifth-ranked national league, secures a third direct entry, and an additional place has been allocated to the champions' path for national champions from lower-ranked countries, enhancing their representation in the tournament.The draw for the competition is conducted using a seeding system based on the UEFA club coefficient, ensuring a mix of teams from different leagues and performance levels.This system, coupled with a sophisticated software program, determines the match schedule, aiming to avoid city clashes and ensuring a diverse and engaging lineup of fixtures.The revamped Champions League format represents a bold step by UEFA to invigorate the competition, offering more games, increased financial rewards, and a more inclusive structure.While it addresses the desires of Europe's footballing elite for enhanced competition and commercial benefits, it also raises concerns about player welfare and the sustainability of an ever-expanding football calendar.","UEFA Champions League has introduced a significant format overhaul for the current season.

It can get us a chance to play with the elite women’s clubs in Asia and it’s through games like that we can assess our true place among the top continental teams,” the coach added.Chhetri also played down the injury that Pyari Xaxa sustained during the game but said the final call will be taken only after more examination.",Odisha FC Women beat Singapore's Lion City Sailors 4-1 in their first game of the preliminary stage of the AFC Women's Champions League.

It would be nice for us to have some impact, because I don’t think our sport is going in the right direction,” said Swiatek ahead of her second-round match at US Open on Thursday.Players across the board, including Mackie McDonald and Elina Svitolina , echo Swiatek's sentiments.“The tours are not united enough to collaborate without egos and money getting involved. The players are absolutely getting crushed in so many ways — physically, mentally, financially,” said Mackie McDonald, while Svitolina opined, “You want to play more, because you want to be high in the rankings and you want to win tournaments, but also you need to take care of your mental health and your physical (condition).”The WTA Tour 's recent rule change, increasing mandatory participation in events, has further intensified these concerns.The increase in combined two-week tournaments for men and women below the Grand Slam level is also drawing criticism, as it limits recovery time and preparation opportunities.Players like Holger Rune feel compelled to compete despite injuries due to the packed schedule.“We want to be ready and play the best tournaments, but the schedule is so tight. It’s probably the tightest sports schedule that there is, I think. There’s December, when we’re supposed to be off. And then there’s exhibition events and everything. It’s almost ongoing, 24/7,” added Rune.Donna Vekic , despite a career-best season, emphasizes the toll the schedule takes on players' health, noting the lack of a proper off-season for rest and recuperation.“The schedule is absolutely brutal. When you compare it to other sports that have an actual offseason — we have, what, a month, a month and a half? You don't even have time to relax, get rest, before you have to start training again. I’m not sure it will change, but it's very unhealthy,” noted Vekic.While the WTA acknowledges the demanding schedule, their response emphasizes the predictability the new system offers and the potential for future adjustments.However, the players' concerns about the lack of player input in decision-making processes and the potential long-term health consequences remain a significant point of contention.",Top tennis players are voicing growing concerns about the sport's demanding schedule.

The world of professional tennis is not only about athletic prowess but also significant financial rewards. The top-paid tennis players in the world have mastered the sport on the court and cultivated lucrative endorsement deals and business ventures off the court.These athletes, who represent a mix of emerging talent and seasoned champions, command substantial earnings through tournament victories and commercial partnerships.Their global influence extends beyond the game, making them some of the most recognizable and well-compensated figures in sports. Here's a look at the highest earners in tennis today.As a rising star in the tennis world, Carlos Alcaraz has drawn early comparisons to fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal, particularly for his prowess on clay courts. This year, the parallels deepened as the two faced off in a Netflix exhibition in March, teamed up for doubles at the Paris Olympics in July, and Alcaraz claimed Nadal’s French Open title in June.Alcaraz, who also secured an Olympic silver in singles and is now ranked third globally, is the favourite to win the U.S. Open, which would mark his third major title this year. Netflix is already planning a docuseries about him for release next year.Novak Djokovic had a historic year, becoming the ATP Tour’s year-end No. 1 player for an unprecedented eighth time and the oldest No. 1 in the tour's history. He extended his record for most weeks at No. 1 to 428 and added an Olympic gold medal to his résumé, earning a $218,000 bonus from Serbia. Currently ranked No. 2, Djokovic split from his long time agent but still has lucrative endorsements with brands like Asics, Head, Hublot, and Lacoste.He also launched ""Sila,"" a line of electrolyte hydration cubes with his sponsor Waterdrop, and co-founded the Professional Tennis Players Association, which recently secured access to over 1,500 airport lounges for its members. A Djokovic museum in Belgrade is also under discussion.Coco Gauff’s breakthrough year included winning the U.S. Open singles title in 2023 and the French Open doubles title, solidifying her status as a rising star. Ranked third in women’s singles and 15th in doubles, Gauff has 11 long-term partnerships, including recent deals with Carol’s Daughter, Naked Brand juices, and Fanatics. She also launched a fashion collection with American Eagle. Gauff was one of Team USA’s flag-bearers at the Paris Olympics alongside LeBron James and will appear on a limited-edition Wheaties box.Iga Swiatek claimed her fourth French Open title in June and a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, adding nearly $11.7 million in prize money over the past year. She expressed concerns about the demanding schedule in women’s tennis, despite the impressive earnings. Off the court, Swiatek expanded her portfolio with partnerships with Lego and Lancôme.Jannik Sinner’s year was a mix of highs and lows. He won the Australian Open, becoming the first Italian man to win a Grand Slam in 48 years, and reached No. 1 in the singles rankings in June. However, a positive steroid test, later attributed to contamination, forced him to forfeit his Indian Wells earnings. Despite these challenges, Sinner’s endorsements with La Roche-Posay, De Cecco pasta, Gucci, Lavazza coffee, and Rolex remain strong.Rafael Nadal’s future in tennis remains uncertain as he nears retirement, having withdrawn from the U.S. Open this month. Despite playing only six ATP Tour events in 19 months, Nadal’s long standing relationships with sponsors like Kia and new deals with Infosys and Playtomic have kept his earnings high. Nadal’s role as an ambassador for the Saudi Arabian tennis federation has also been lucrative, though controversial.Daniil Medvedev, with one Grand Slam win at the 2021 U.S. Open and five other major finals appearances, continues to be a top contender. He broke records for the most sets played and time spent on court during the 2023 Australian Open.Medvedev is set to compete in Saudi Arabia’s 6 Kings Slam, alongside tennis giants like Alcaraz and Djokovic. He’s also a prominent figure in the gaming world, with endorsements from HyperX, EA Sports, and Ubisoft, and is part of the ownership group of esports organisation M80.Naomi Osaka returned to tennis in January after injuries and childbirth sidelined her from September 2022. Despite dropping to No. 85 in singles rankings, her candid discussions about postpartum struggles have resonated with fans and sponsors alike.Osaka has new partnerships with Etsy, Maybelline, Meta AI, and ZICO Coconut Water, and her media company Hana Kuma is expanding into brand campaigns for LPGA Tour golfers and developing an adult anime series, where Osaka will also serve as a voice actor and executive producer.Casper Ruud added his 12th ATP Tour title in Geneva this year, demonstrating his versatility across surfaces. Despite health setbacks, Ruud remains a formidable player and the only man under 25 with over 100 career victories on both hard courts and clay. His sponsorships include Fleming watches, Handelsbanken, and Renault, alongside several existing deals.Aryna Sabalenka started the year with a second consecutive Australian Open title but missed Wimbledon due to a shoulder injury and skipped the Olympics to recover. However, she rebounded by winning the Cincinnati Open and climbing back to No. 2 in the singles rankings. Sabalenka has also secured new endorsements with Oakberry açaí bowls and Master & Dynamic headphones.","Top-paid tennis players in the world have mastered the sport on the court and cultivated lucrative endorsement deals and business ventures off the court.
