Five-time champions Mumbai Indians are all but out of the race to IPL 2024 playoffs. Going through one of their worst seasons in IPL history, Hardik Pandya & Co. faced their eighth defeat in 11 matches, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders by 24 runs on their home ground, Wankhede Stadium , on Friday.The defeat, which was MI's first against KKR at the Wankhede in 12 years, once again brought Hardik 's captaincy in focus.""This was such a good team on paper but was not managed well. The questions that were being raised about Hardik Pandya's captaincy were absolutely correct,"" said former India pacer Irfan Pathan, analysing the game in a video on social media.KKR put up 169 on the board, thanks to a half-century by Venkatesh Iyer (70 off 52 balls) and an equally crucial 31-ball 42 by Manish Pandey, despite MI having the visitors on the ropes at 57/5 in just the seventh over.""When you had KKR's five wickets for just 57 runs, there was no need to give Naman Dhir three overs in a row. You should have got your main bowlers on, but you had your sixth bowler deliver three overs. That allowed Venkatesh Iyer and Manish Pandey to put a partnership together....Where you could have bowled KKR out for 150, they went on to make 170, and that turned out to be the difference,"" added Pathan, raising questions on captain Hardik's decisions on the field.Mitchell Starc , the most expensive player in IPL history, finally did justice to his price tag with match-winning figures of 4/33 as Mumbai folded up for 145 in 18.5 overs despite Suryakumar Yadav's 35-ball 56. Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine and Andre Russell took two wickets each.""KKR now looks like a 'khatarnak' (dangerous) team after Mitchell Starc's return to form. They had just one weak link in fast bowling, which was Mitchell Starc's bowling. The way he bowled to Tim David must be appreciated,"" analysed Irfan.The win took KKR to No. 2 on the points table with seven wins in 10 matches.Coming back to MI captaincy, which had changed hands from Rohit Sharma to Hardik before the start of this season, Irfan said MI is not playing as a unit under Hardik's captaincy.""In cricket, captaincy has a huge effect and it's very important to manage, which did not happen. Mumbai Indians isn't looking like a team that is playing as a unit, and this aspect needs to be looked at going forward for Mumbai Indians. Players need to respect the captain and also accept him appreciably, this is very important. That, I think, could not be seen on the field,"" the former cricketer cum commentator said.""Whatever the reason is, they have to think about it and improve.""",Mumbai Indians lose to Kolkata Knight Riders by 24 runs at Wankhede Stadium.

NEW DELHI: Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan got a three-year ban from the stadium for getting embroiled in an argument with security staff, the last time Kolkata Knight Riders won a match against Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede before Friday.And ending the 12-year drought after the infamous win, KKR finally breached Fort Wankhede -- for the first time since 2012 -- and put the hosts almost out of the reckoning of the playoffs race.As the Knights successfully defended 169, the team came together to break the jinx at the venue, putting a smile of the faces of principal owner Shah Rukh and mentor Gautam Gambhir.KKR's bowling unit fired in unison to win a battle of attrition against five-time champions.While the batters were guilty of not working out their game plan on the go in the first half to be bowled out for just 169 with Venkatesh Iyer contributing 70, Mumbai Indians' underperforming batters stood no chance on a tricky wicket which demanded both application and patience. They were all-out for 145 in 18.5 overs with IPL 's biggest buy ever Mitchell Starc (4/33) leading the way with his four-for.As KKR registered their 7th win of the season, taking another big leap towards playoffs and pushing Mumbai out of the knock-outs contention, several record were broken and rewritten in the game between the two heavyweights.First win for KKR in 12 years at Wankhede - only previous win over MI at Wankhede came back in 2012, with Sunil Narine returning 4/15 from 3.1 overs in a 32-run win.: 11: 2: 9The match was just the fourth instance in 33 head-to-head matches in which MI got bowled out against KKR.The game was also just the fourth in IPL where both teams got all-out, Nagpur, 2010, Kolkata, 2017, Mumbai (Wankhede), 2018, Mumbai (Wankhede), 2024MI pacer Jasprit Bumrah continued his IPL dominance with record-extending three-fer- Jasprit Bumrah (131 innings)- Yuzvendra Chahal (154 innings)- Lasith Malinga (122 innings)- Amit Mishra (162 innings)It was the fifth loss for MI while chasing this IPL season: 6: 1 (vs RCB): 5","First win for KKR in 12 years at Wankhede - only previous win over MI came back in 2012, with Sunil Narine returning 4/15 from 3.1 overs in a 32-run win.

NEW DELHI: Former India skipper Sourav Ganguly reassured Rinku Singh not to be disheartened by his exclusion from India's T20 World Cup squad, emphasizing that it was a tactical decision by the team management.Ganguly explained that India opted for an ""extra spinner"" considering the spinning conditions expected in the West Indies, which might have impacted the selection process.Rinku, known for his explosive batting and finishing skills with a strike rate of over 176 in 15 T20Is and as a key player for Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, was likely edged out due to this strategic choice.""It's West Indies. The wickets may be slow and assist spin so they (selectors) wanted to go with another spinner. Maybe because of that Rinku didn't get an opportunity but it's just the beginning for Rinku,"" Ganguly said at the Trophy unveiling ceremony of the Bengal Pro T20 League .Ganguly anticipated that India and Australia would dominate the tournament similar to how they did in the 50-over World Cup last year. India will kick off their group stage matches in the USA, commencing their campaign against Ireland on June 5.The tournament will then transition to the Caribbean countries for the Super Eight onwards.""India and Australia the two best teams of the tournament. I'm sure they will do the same thing in the USA and the West Indies,"" Ganguly said.On the Indian squad, Ganguly said: ""It's a fabulous squad, they are all match winners. All 15 are good enough to be selected, I'm sure Rohit (Sharma) and Rahul (Dravid) will pick the best.""Meanwhile all the eight franchises and their marquee players in the Bengal Pro T20 League were also announced.

Runs continue to come off his bat in the ongoing Indian Premier League and the BCCI selectors had no second thoughts about including his name in India's T20 World Cup squad. Those two facts highlight that even in the twilight of his career, you discount Virat Kohli at your own peril.There was a lot of talk about his strike rate in T20 cricket before the announcement of India's squad for the T20 World Cup to be held this June, but all the cricket experts had him in their 15-member line-ups, which also firmly reflected in the official Indian squad that was revealed earlier this week.Irfan Pathan, former India pacer cum commentator, went a step ahead to predict that when time comes for a stiff chase during the T20 World Cup, it will be Virat Kohli who will be standing there till the end.""Jab waqt aata hai, yehi player akela khada hota hai, Virat Kohli (when it's required, he is the player who stands alone),"" said Pathan while talking on Star Sports (see video below).""Believe me, there will be a point during the T20 World Cup when there will be need, and the guy you will find chasing it till the end will be him, Virat Kohli.""Virat has already touched the figure of 500 runs in this IPL , which includes a century and four fifties, at a strike rate of 147.49, which can't be considered poor.To further stress on Kohli's proven track record while chasing, which also earned him the nickname 'chase master', Pathan mentioned the India vs Pakistan match in Melbourne during the T20 World Cup where Kohli famously hit Haris Rauf for two sixes to bring India back into contention.Virat's 53-ball 82 not out took India to a famous four-wicket win.""Pick all the big matches, especially when chasing, you won't find a bigger player than him in T20 cricket. He has a calculative mind. (He is like) 'You keep talking about strike rate, I will keep talking about chasing runs and the target.'

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football legend Ronaldo has reached an agreement to sell his majority stake in Cruzeiro , the club where he began his senior career, as announced by the Brazilian Serie A team on Monday.The 47-year-old, who acquired a 90% stake in the club for $70 million through his company Tara Sports Brasil in 2021, has agreed to sell the shares to BPW Sports company.The financial details of the transaction have not been disclosed.During his tenure, Ronaldo successfully cleared the club's $195 million debt and played a crucial role in their return to the top flight in 2022 after spending three seasons in Serie B. Despite this achievement, recent poor performances led to criticism and calls for his departure from some fans.In a statement, the club said, ""Ronaldo and BPW Sports signed an agreement to acquire all the shares of Tara Sports Brasil, the company that owns 90% of Cruzeiro SAF.""The statement also praised Ronaldo's administration for bringing a new perspective to the club, implementing professional management, and establishing a governance structure aligned with international best practices. The club's credibility was restored, attracting significant partners and sponsors, with record-breaking contracts.Ronaldo, who won the World Cup with Brazil in 1994 and 2002, will remain a member of Cruzeiro's board of directors, pending approval of the deal by Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense. The former striker made his professional debut with Cruzeiro at the age of 16 in 1993 before going on to become one of the world's best strikers.At a news conference, Ronaldo expressed mixed feelings about the decision, stating, ""A mix of feelings hit me today, but above all, the feeling of fulfilment. It's impossible not to remember when I took on the great challenge of buying Cruzeiro.""He acknowledged the challenges faced during his tenure and expressed satisfaction in handing over the club in a better situation than when he took over.""We've faced many challenges, the majority of which we've overcome. We've stumbled along the way, but today I can say that I'm handing Cruzeiro over with a sense of having done my duty, given that the club's situation was very precarious,"" said the former striker.In addition to selling his stake in Cruzeiro, Ronaldo is also expected to sell his 51% stake in Spanish second-tier side Real Valladolid , as he told reporters, ""Valladolid is next.""","Brazilian football legend Ronaldo has reached an agreement to sell his majority stake in Cruzeiro.

NEW DELHI: Renowned Inter Miami star and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi took a break from his football duties to attend the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics on Monday night.Accompanied by his teammates Jordi Alba , Sergio Busquets , and Luis Suarez , who also played with him at Barcelona, Messi arrived at the arena just before tip-off.The group, with some wearing Heat attire and Busquets donning a Heat hoodie, entered through the players' parking garage and were escorted via a VIP entrance to their suite seats above the lower level.Although Messi had previously visited the arena for at least one other event, this marked his first arranged attendance at a Heat game since relocating to Miami last year.Inter Miami have been performing exceptionally well in the Major League Soccer (MLS) this season, boasting a 6-2-3 record and currently leading the Eastern Conference with the highest points tally in the league.Messi's contributions have been instrumental, with two goals and an assist in Inter Miami's recent 4-1 victory over New England on Saturday. He has achieved the remarkable feat of having multiple goal contributions in five consecutive matches, a first for any MLS player.Throughout his illustrious career, Messi has amassed over 800 goals for both club and country, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in soccer history.His crowning achievement came in 2022 when he led Argentina to the World Cup title, scoring twice in the final against France. The match ended in a thrilling 3-3 draw, with Argentina ultimately triumphing 4-2 on penalty kicks.","Lionel Messi attended the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics.

ISL: Mumbai see off Goa to set up final showdown with Bagan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mumbai-see-off-goa-to-set-up-final-showdown-with-bagan/articleshow/109703553.cms,"MUMBAI: Jorge Pereyra Diaz wanted to lap up every second of it. The Argentinian striker had just given Mumbai the lead in the second leg of their Indian Super League semifinal against FC Goa , putting the Islanders 4-2 ahead on aggregate, and he was in the mood to celebrate.Joining him were thousands of Mumbai City fans who made sure their delight was heard around the 7000-capacity Mumbai Football Arena.They had to wait until the 69th minute for that joyous moment, and it was to get even better seven minutes from the end of regulation time.This time it was Lallianzuala Chhangte who timed his run perfectly from inside his half to latch on to a sublime assist from Vikram Partap Singh, neatly take it past Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, and tap the ball into the net to make it 2-0. For the second time in five days, Goa were left crestfallen.They had been looking good to arrive here with a 2-0 lead from their first leg at Fatorda last Wednesday. But in a matter of six crazy minutes in the closing stages of that game, the Gaurs watched in agony as Chhangte and Vikram turned that lead into a 3-2 win in favour of the Islanders.Despite that slap in the face, Manolo Marquez's side, backed by around 250 travelling fans, would have come to Mumbai encouraged by their form on the road, having scored in their last nine away games. It's another matter that they were up against the league's meanest defence, and the latter eventually won.Mumbai's 2-0 victory on Monday and a 5-2 win on aggregate has earned them the right to take on Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Saturday's final. Petr Kratky's side will look at it as a chance to avenge their narrow defeat to the Kolkata giants a fortnight ago on the last day of the league stage which saw Bagan thwart Mumbai's hopes of becoming the first team to defend the League Winners Shield.For now though, the Islanders will cherish a win they had to work extremely hard for, against an opponent who has challenged them each time they have met this season.They may have endured a nightmare finish to the first leg of this semifinal but Goa managed to make a positive start here, looking clearly to their American winger Noah Sadaoui to launch attacks down the left channel.After his tremendous impact as a second half substitute in Fatorda, where he produced two sublime assists for the goals that contributed to Mumbai's jaw-dropping comeback, Jayesh Rane was duly rewarded with a starting spot on this occasion. But the midfielder struggled to get his teeth into the game for most of the first half.The home side soon settled and would come the closest to scoring in the opening 45 minutes when they struck the post twice, first through a Tiri header off a corner, and later when Chhangte wasn't able to curl his left-footed effort enough.In his pre-match press conference, Marquez had admitted that the Gaurs could well find themselves in a situation where they would have to take increased risks. That moment arrived in the second half when Mumbai captain Rahul Bheke saw his header off Yoel van Nieff's corner cleared off the goal line by Goa defender Nim Dorjee Tamang. But Pereyra Diaz was there, as he usually is, perfectly placed, to poke the ball home.Vikram has scored eight times for the Islanders in the league this season, including a hat-trick against NorthEast United in March, but the forward showed how well he can create opportunities too, releasing Chhangte with a delightful pass around Goa's defence, as Mumbai's number 7 got the home support going again with a fine finish.There are likely to be questions raised about the relevance of the ISL playoffs going forward, with the format now really holding no significance apart from the prize money on offer. What there can be little doubt about though, is the two best teams over the course of the 2023-24 campaign will clash for the trophy at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday!","Mumbai City beat FC Goa 4-2 on aggregate to reach Indian Super League final.

Premier League clubs take step towards spending cap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-clubs-take-step-towards-spending-cap/articleshow/109702643.cms,"(With Reuters inputs)

Premier League clubs have taken a significant stride towards introducing a spending cap, with a vote on Monday endorsing the completion of economic and legal assessments necessary for such a model.Reports from British media indicate that the proposed model will be presented to clubs ahead of a final vote at the league's Annual General Meeting, potentially in June.If approved, it would supplant the existing Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR) starting from the 2025-26 season.The introduction of a spending cap aims to curb excessive spending by clubs, thus mitigating the risk of super-rich teams monopolizing the league. Concerns over the widening gap between financially endowed clubs and their counterparts have underscored the necessity for such measures.Discussed at a Premier League shareholders' meeting, the proposed cap would be tied to the revenue of the lowest-earning club in the league, primarily derived from television rights.Implementation could be as early as the 2025-26 season, marking a proactive step by the league to promote financial fairness and competitive balance among its member clubs.""We will obviously wait to see further details of these specific proposals but we have always been clear that we would oppose any measure that would place a 'hard' cap on player wages,"" the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said.""There is an established process in place to ensure that proposals like this, which would directly impact our members, have to be properly consulted on,"" the statement added.Media reports indicate that 16 Premier League clubs have voted in favor of the league exploring the implementation of a salary cap. However, notable clubs such as Chelsea abstained from the vote, while Manchester City , Manchester United, and Aston Villa dissented.Manchester City's dissent is particularly noteworthy as the club faces over 100 charges of allegedly breaching the league's financial regulations. Despite the allegations, the club has maintained its innocence.The urgency for financial reform in the league has been highlighted by recent penalties imposed on clubs like Everton and Nottingham Forest for breaching the Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Everton faced a deduction of points, while Forest appealed a similar penalty.In April, Premier League clubs had initially agreed to introduce new financial regulations for the upcoming season, opting for squad cost ratio rules to replace the PSR. If adopted at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in June, the new rules could limit clubs to spending 85% of their revenue on transfers, wages, and agents' fees.Although the PSR will remain in place for the next season with a transition period in 2024-25, points deductions will continue to be a part of the league's disciplinary measures even under the new regulations.","Premier League clubs have taken a significant stride towards introducing a spending cap.

""I wasn't really thinking about what happened last year. But repeating this result is a great thing.""I'll have a chance to play a nice match in two days. So it's really exciting.

NEW DELHI: Amelie Mauresmo , the tournament director of Roland Garros , indicated on Thursday that former world number one Rafael Nadal is unlikely to receive a seed at the upcoming French Open next month.Nadal himself expressed uncertainty on Wednesday regarding his participation in this year's tournament, despite his remarkable record of winning the French Open a record 14 times.At 37 years old, Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, has seen a significant drop in his ranking, currently standing at 512, following an extended absence due to a hip flexor injury that kept him sidelined for almost a year.Although he has secured a place in the main draw of the French Open via his protected ranking, this ranking does not guarantee seeding, as seeding is determined by the top 32 ranked players.Without a seed, Nadal could potentially face formidable opponents in the early stages of the tournament.Traditionally, Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam event that did not strictly adhere to the ATP and WTA rankings, instead considering a player's past performances on grass courts when determining seeding. However, this approach faced criticism from players, including Nadal, leading to its abandonment in 2020.Asked about Nadal being seeded at this year's French Open, Mauresmo told reporters: ""Right now it's not a topic...""Wimbledon did it for a very, very, very long time, and it certainly brought some advantages but we also saw all the disadvantages it could bring. For the moment, it's not on the table.""We're keeping our fingers crossed for him above all, for us too obviously. We're keeping a close eye on what's happening for him on court. We're in touch with his team. Whether there's a tribute depends very much on him. We'll follow his wishes.""Nadal is in action against 16-year-old American Darwin Blanch in the Madrid Open later on Thursday.",Rafael Nadal unlikely to receive a seed at the upcoming French Open. Tournament director Amelie Mauresmo says it is not on the table. Nadal has won the French Open a record 14 times.

Rafael Nadal will only play French Open if he can 'compete well',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/rafael-nadal-will-only-play-french-open-if-he-can-compete-well/articleshow/109568477.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal declared on Wednesday that he'll only participate in the upcoming French Open if he feels ""capable enough to compete well.""The 14-time Roland Garros champion acknowledged that if the event commenced today, he wouldn't be ready to take part. However, he pledged to persevere in his efforts to secure the opportunity to play at his most triumphant tournament for one final time.""I don't know what's going to happen in the next three weeks.I will keep fighting and doing the things I believe I have to do so I can try to play in Paris, and if I can play, I play, if I can't, I can't,"" the former world number one told reporters at the Madrid Open on Wednesday.""I will not play in Paris if I am the way I am now. If Paris were today, I wouldn't take to the court. That's the reality. I will only play in Paris if I feel capable enough to compete well.""Nadal made his tennis comeback in Brisbane in January after nearly a year of sidelined recovery from a psoas injury. However, his return was cut short due to a muscle issue sustained in Australia, limiting him to just five matches this season.Last week, he began his clay campaign in Barcelona, exiting in the second round. Now, he is poised to take on 16-year-old American Darwin Blanch in his Madrid opener on Thursday.""I don't think I'm ready to play at my 100 percent but I'm prepared to go out and play tomorrow. It's important for me to play one last time here in Madrid, for me it means a lot,"" said the 37-year-old Nadal.As he attempts to resume his 'Last Dance' in Madrid and say goodbye to one of his favourite tournaments on court, rather than on the sidelines, the 22-time major champion admits his farewell tour hasn't been as enjoyable as he would have hoped.""A few weeks ago, I didn't know if I will be able to play again on the professional tour, so today I am playing,"" he added.""It's not perfect, of course not perfect, but at least I am playing and I can enjoy again, especially in the few tournaments that are so emotional for me. I'm able to enjoy the fact that I can say probably good-bye on court.""Nadal says he's hitting the ball well when he is able to be on court but ""it's about more body limitations. I went through a lot of things last year and a half, two years"".""So body feelings are not enough good to feel myself playing with freedom enough in terms of body issues. That's not allowing me to compete the way that I would like to compete.""","Rafael Nadal says he'll only participate in the upcoming French Open if he feels ""capable enough to compete well"" The 14-time Roland Garros champion acknowledged that if the event commenced today, he wouldn't be ready to take part.

I'm enjoying being on the tennis court: Sumit Nagal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/im-enjoying-being-on-the-tennis-court-sumit-nagal/articleshow/109560007.cms,"Nagal's mid-season training block is about building on the gains of the last four months

BENGALURU: Sumit Nagal 's latest hairdo is short fade. It's as sharp as his tennis game.The India No.1, who climbed to a career-high 80 in the world on Monday last, took care of the style element on his arrival in Delhi. Nagal, who spent a few days with family and friends while getting his visa sorted, heads back to Europe this week to kick-off a three-week training block at the Nensel academy in Peine, Germany, before returning to his beloved clay courts.The timing of Nagal's training block - when the clay court swing is in full blast in Europe - raised injury worries.The 26-year-old brushed aside concerns with an insouciant shrug, insisting it's a good time for a training block. Nagal explained that he has played from March to March, including in the off-season in December. Ranked 138 at the time, Nagal played the Tennis Premier League , hoping the money would give him the financial freedom to schedule his 2024 season.Nagal will look at his net game and serve, which he noted has been on and off in the last weeks, besides build on his fitness in his time away from the Tour.The Indian is aiming to get a tournament in, perhaps in Lyon, before arriving at Roland Garros.Nagal has enjoyed an inspirational run in the first four months of the year, climbing almost 60 rungs in the ranking, especially coming into his own on clay.Nagal describes his relationship with clay in one word 'smooth', like a sharp cup of espresso. It awakens the competitor in him.""The more time I have, the better I am at chasing down the ball,"" he told TOI.Nagal learnt his tennis on the clay courts of Paschim Vihar in West Delhi as an eight-year-old.""It was probably fast,"" he said of those courts. ""I don't think we have slow clay courts in India. Clay courts are different everywhere, the clay courts in France are very different to Germany, Germany and Austria are similar, they are heavy, wet. France is a little bit hard and fast. Italy has a mix of both, but more on the faster side.""While the tennis world has played on the Nadal, Nagal surname, the Indian gave the legendary Spaniard a verbal salute.""What Rafa has done on clay is just insane,"" he said. ""His game is ridiculous, he moves incredibly, you just cannot hit past him and with that forehand jumping over your head for three or four hours… It's crazy.""The career he has followed with great personal interest, however, is that of the 25-year-old world No.6 Casper Ruud .""I've learnt a lot from watching Ruud,"" Nagal said. ""I have seen him from his junior days, playing under-14, under-16. The way he has developed his game, is very good.''""I feel like I can play a similar game to him. Serve smart, use a big forehand and have a solid backhand. And use the backhand smartly to get the ball to your forehand side. He has been playing at that level for a long time and I think that's the next step for me, to keep playing at this level, keep playing the ATP Tour level .""Nagal isn't surprised with his form of the first four months of the year, where he scored two top-50 wins and took a set off the world No.7 Holger Rune in Monte Carlo.""I know I can play top-50 tennis and keep improving,"" he said. ""When you lose there are a lot of things you feel you could've done better, but I don't think I lost a match (in the last few months) because of energy or focus. I have matured as a competitor.""The Indian is in a whole different headspace these days. ""I am enjoying being on the tennis court ,"" he said. ""I'm enjoying playing matches, enjoying fighting.""","India No.1 Sumit Nagal heads back to Europe this week for a three-week training block. The 26-year-old will train at the Nensel academy in Peine, Germany, before returning to his beloved clay courts.

That's obviously what I work towards, to try and get better and to win tournaments. So, nice to win my second Tour title, almost 10 or 11 months from now (after the first), and to do it on different surfaces, very very happy with that,"" Bhambri said following his victory in the company of French Albano Olivetti on Sunday.The pair defeated the German wildcard combination of Andreas Mies, a two-time doubles Grand Slam winner, and Jan-Lennard Struff, a four-time titleist, 7-6, 7-6.""I hope me and Albano can continue improving and continue getting better with more clay court events and the French Open coming up.""Coach Balachandran Manikkath, who has been working with Bhambri as part of the ""Doubles Dream of India"" programme, provided some insights on the adjustments the Delhi lad has made in his game for the slowest of the three surfaces.""Yuki has been working on playing on clay since Marrakech (ATP 250 event in Morocco). It is obviously different from hard and certain adjustments have to be made with serves, returns, volleys, smash, etc,"" Balachandran said.""He has done a tremendous job as the results show this week. On slow, wet clay courts he is able to hold serve comfortably and his returns are good, volleying is solid.""This win with Olivetti will help confidence on both sides. They are already fixed to play the clay season all the way up to French (Open). So nothing changes there except that both are moving up the rankings.""Bhambri's ranking rose a career-high 54 on Monday while Olivetti moved up to a personal best 45.The rankings at the end of the French Open will determine the entries for the tennis competition at the Olympics , which will be held at the Roland Garros as well.Doubles star Rohan Bopanna is sitting pretty well at World No. 2 at the moment, which gives him a direct entry and a partner of his choice subject to the latter's ranking being in the top-300 – in either singles or doubles.""Olympics is not in my control. The selection committee or the AITA decides the team, so I'm focused on trying to improve my ranking, improve my game and just continue on the Tour,"" Bhambri said.""Whether I like to play the Olympics, I absolutely would. It's every Indian's dream to represent the country and I'm no different. The Olympics is the biggest stage but, again, this is not in my hands.""Returning to what is in his control, Bhambri said the Munich triumph would not change his preference for hard.""Hardcourt is always going to be my preference. Just for the sole purpose that it requires less adjustment for me because I've played on it all my life,"" he said.""So, no matter how many titles I am gonna win on clay or grass, hardcourt is going to be the preference.""It (doubles) is a bit different compared to singles. Doubles is less movement, which makes it a bit easier but there's still technical aspects of doubles, which in general doesn't involve so much side to side movement.""There is a lot of serving and volleying, and returning fast points. So you have to be good at that, regardless of any surface if you want to succeed in doubles.""Given the necessities of the modern game where entries into big tournaments breaks and makes partnerships, Bhambri, who decided to focus on doubles only two seasons back, has become adept at playing on both sides of the court.""Yuki plays ad court with Olivetti. He played deuce with Robin Hasse in Dubai and reached semis. In Madrid last week he played deuce with Arel Behar too,"" Balachandran said.""Now he is comfortable playing on either side. Just that he has played more on ad court, and people recognise him as an ad court player. That will change soon as he plays on either side with different partners.""Known for avoiding late hours, playing on the Tour has also brought a bit of change to Bhambri's personal side.""Well, I've been part of the Tour for a long time now. So I know most of them. Of course, I miss partying with with Roger (Federer) and Rafa (Nadal), enjoying nights out with them. Since they are not much around on the Tour, it's not the same,"" he said.""Maybe the next generation I can hang out with more, stay out late and socialize with them more – the Alcaraz's and the Kyrgios's of the tour.""",Yuki Bhambri won his second Tour title with a win at the BMW Open in Munich. The 31-year-old has won his first two titles on the doubles Tour on grass and clay.
