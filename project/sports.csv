KL Rahul-Goenka episode a storm in an espresso cup: Justin Langer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/kl-rahul-goenka-episode-a-storm-in-an-espresso-cup-justin-langer/articleshow/110094103.cms,"(LSG) head coach Justin Langer talks about the changing dynamics of the game, the all-encompassing role of the modern coach and how real stardom is still an elusive quest for the typical

cricketer..

.

Recently in the eye of what he termed “a storm in an espresso cup,” Justin Langer, head coach of the LSG, seemed in awe of cricket’s evolution from a one-coach-one-physio endeavour in his early playing days to the heaving 90-man entourages of the IPL today.

Sitting back in his chair at a plush city hotel and gesticulating with his eyes and hands while speaking, Langer’s train of thought veered from past to present and onward to the future.

The one-time foot soldier of the formidable Australian team of the 1990s is one of the sharpest cricketing brains around, and he was excitedly pouring his thoughts out on the game. The TOI Sports team just happened to be present.

Read on…

This is your first coaching stint in the IPL. How difficult is it to be a coach these days, especially in such high-profile franchises?

When you’re a player, you have control. You take absolute responsibility for your performance.

The only thing that's out of your control is selection, or what the media writes or what people think of you. You focus only on watching the ball. If you make runs, the only currency of value is runs. If you make runs, you get selected. If you get selected, you get a contract.

I went straight from playing to coaching – as an assistant coach, which is the best coach job in the world. You work about two hours a day, everyone's your best friend, and you’ve got no accountability.

Then you become head coach, oh man, then you work about 16 hours a day. No one likes you. And you’ve got 100% accountability!

I took a break from coaching for two and a half years for the first time in my life (after the

Australia

stint). I had do my writing, my speaking, I did my board roles. I had complete control. It's like being a batsman, again, there's freedom in that.

And then I came back into coaching. And you realise again that you've got your hands tied.

In football, the coach has control over the match. Whereas in cricket, the captain does everything on the field, right? So, you manage your people, you make them feel happy, you make them ready to play, you help them with peak performance, you help the superstar and the kid who's just coming in.

You’ve to mentor them and coach them differently. But you must understand they are all different people – some introverts, some extroverts.

You have got to learn how to manage. So as head coach, you are purely a man manager. You have to manage them well so that they perform on the field. And that's tough.

Coaching staff in teams have ballooned since your playing days…

When I started playing with the Australian cricket team, Bob Simpson was the coach. When I started playing professional cricket, we used to train on a Wednesday afternoon, we all had full-time jobs.

We had one coach who was part time, and I think we had a physio, and you only got paid if you made the first 11.

Now there are coaches everywhere. Things have changed. It’s a 12-month business. We have three different formats of the game which guys play all year round. Now they play in different franchises, they play international cricket. Yes, times have changed. But there's still a role for an assignment, right? We call it professionalism.

We try to look after people well.

Let’s face it. There wasn't an IPL when Ian Chappell was around. There were no franchises. There were no broadcast rights. If we expect the players to be high-performing individuals, then they expect high-performing services and that comes in the form of coaches and physiotherapists and doctors and people who throw balls all day.

I worked full time in a bank, or in a stock broking firm until I was 28 years old.

Then Middlesex rang me and asked if I wanted to go and play. I played three years at Middlesex and then I became a full-time cricketer.

In franchise cricket, the money rolls in fast. Superstars are made very easily. Do you think ego then becomes a big issue for players?

In the Australian team I played in, we had Matthew Hayden, Shane Warne, Glen McGrath, Ricky Ponting. They were superstar players because of their performance, not because of how much money they made.

One of the challenges we have today is that we still judge players on the performance, not on how much money they get paid.

There's so much money in the game. But you still have to be a high performer. MS

is MS Dhoni not because he's made a lot of money.

My point is that Dhoni, Rohit Sharma,

Virat Kohli

and

KL Rahul

are incredibly wealthy, but they are superstars because of the way they perform. Dhoni won a

and was one of the greatest finishers of the game.

People will never forget those performances.

In India, with 1.4 billion cricket-loving people, you could pick five teams which can beat most countries. There's so much talent. I’m blown away. So my point is, I also see how much pressure these young players are under because I they all want to be a Dhoni, they all want to be a Virat Kohli or Rahul or Rohit. But they’ve got a long journey to get to that point. The only way they can survive here is by performing and performing and performing.

There is a perception players’ heads get turned by so much money floating around, with so many brands chasing you…

When I went to the IPL mini-auction, I saw several players going unsold. There are lot more heartbreaks than success. For the ones who make it, there is a lot of money in the game. That’s just the joys of the money from broadcast rights. But the ones who make it must be very good cricketers. They're the cream rising to the top.

Yeah, they might be getting the brands, and they might be doing the rounds of social media. But if they don't perform, they get destroyed. They either get dropped or get destroyed by social media. So, the pressure, in some way, balances it all out.

When I played my third Test, the great Allan Border gave me some amazing advice. I still give it to the players today. He was wearing expensive, branded shoes and I asked him if he could help me get a shoe sponsorship.

He told me, you make all the runs in the world, you become the best batsman and you will get all the shoes, or the sunglasses or the fame or the money you could ever imagine. Focus on that. Nothing's changed.

Shane Warne turned up for the first session with Bob Simpson – peroxide hair, earring, a mobile phone in one hand and a packet of cigarettes in the other. These guys were like, who’s this young upstart? But he was real. And he performed so well he was great.

All these kids now say Shane loved fast cars, loved women, loved smoking cigarettes. But he was brilliant. He made a lot of mistakes off the field, but he was a great performer. We miss him.

If we look at the greatest cricket teams of the past, there’s always an inherently strong sense of team bonding. How do you create that in a franchise environment, with so many different players from all over?

It’s a challenge when you're here only for 10 weeks.

This is why I really admire Chennai. They have a solid foundation, the same Stephen Fleming’s (head coach) been there since Day One, I think. I respect that. They've won five times. Let's face it, Lucknow Super Giants is a very young franchise. It's still a work in progress.

I imagine what we're all striving for is when players come to their franchise, it's like coming home.

Tom Moody told me IPL is like the Olympics, you've never seen anything like it.

From my experience of four years with the Australian team, I can say building an international team it is exhausting. It is tough. If you don't perform, the whole country lets you know about it. And that is exhausting, right?

The hardest thing about being head coach in Australia is selection. If you a player from one state, the other state complains. International cricket is not like franchise cricket.

We only play six months of the year, but you have the full pre-season.

You build up the family, you build up the culture and you build up all these inputs over 12 months. It is very tiring.

How does Australia invariably rise to the occasion in World Cups?

When you play cricket for Australia, the expectation is you're going to win because we win. That might sound very simplistic, but this is the Aussie mindset.

In IPL, there is so much pressure to win. Then there's pressure just to be in the team.

When we started winning, then suddenly there was this load of expectations. You could feel the pressure building.

In contrast, we Australians just go with the flow, stay relaxed. It's about having fun. And they know they've got so much talent on the park. They just go about their business. They are used to winning. They are used to doing it their way. It is like, we don't take it too seriously, even though we take it very seriously.

It's almost like a paradox. That's the secret.

When you walk into the Australian dressing room, it’s like being in a nightclub 24/7, I'm not joking. It was so much fun. We had so much respect for each other, and it was so much fun. And that's the difference.

If the pressure builds, you’ll never perform at your best. And I know that as a player. The harder you try, the worse it gets. And in big games, if things tighten up, you're dead.

But if you just stay relaxed…. my heroes were the West Indies, the early West Indies team I watched while growing up. Like Viv Richards, they just seemed so chilled out all the time. They knew they were talented.

How do you handle the fear of failure?

I'm sure individuals think about the fear of failure. I lived with it until I was 28 years old. And it is paralysing, the fear of failure. It can drive you, but living in a world of fear of failure is a dangerous world.

We are human beings. I remember seeing Steve Waugh suffer that. He was a run machine but had got a duck. He was going through a small run of failures. I remember he got out just before stumps in Johannesburg and got in the bus after that — he had his collar up, had his cap down and wore sunglasses. I went and sat with him. I said, ‘How’re you feeling, captain?’ He goes, ‘Pretty rubbish.’ So, even the greats have doubts and insecurities.

That's being human, right?

How important is it to take care of the mental health of players who are always such pressure?

There is more acceptance now. I respected Glenn Maxwell for coming out a couple of years ago and say he had mental-health issues. I see guys like

Will Pucovski

. He is a supreme talent, but he's got issues. He suffered from concussion. Yeah, so the concussion is one thing, but that is also linked with some mental-health issues.

We are human, we all are on a spectrum of mental health. And it’s just about dealing with that. It is about man management, knowing that everyone has to look after their mental health every single day of their lives. That's one thing about being a coach, you got to keep observing all the time. And you can see it in their body language, you can see it in the way they perform, you can see about in their actions, you can see it in all these things.

As the head coach, you got to be like a father, like a school teacher, be a psychologist, be a mentor. All these things rolled up in one. In IPL, the team entourage comprises 90 people. You have to deal with 50 people who are all trying to do the same thing. And they're all on their own journeys in life to get to winning. That is a huge challenge.

What impact will this season’s IPL have on the upcoming World Cup? Teams are scoring heavily this season…

I'm fascinated by the impact-player rule.

That's had an effect. I'm on the MCC world cricket committee and one important thing we talk about is the cricket pitches. You want Test cricket to survive, get the pitches right.

Like it’s a contest between bat and ball in Australia. The ball swings around and bounces. Awesome. You come to India and the ball spins, contest between bat and ball. You can't leave the screen because the batsman could get out any ball. It is addictive.

At the upcoming World Cup, it will all depend on what the pitches are like. I can't imagine that the wickets in the West Indies are going to be that flat, maybe Barbados. I've got no idea what's going to happen in America because they're drop-in pitches.

My belief has always been that we should never forget about the defensive side of

T20 cricket

. You look at the teams doing really well in this in this IPL, like KKR and Rajasthan Royals.

They have good bowlers and so are performing well. Never forget the defensive side of the game. LSG has suffered because a lot of our bowlers dropped out before the league began.

So, when it comes to the World Cup, often the teams with the best bowling attacks will have the best chance to win.

Who are your favourites for the T20 WC?

If you if you look at the trend of World Cups, it's often the same group of teams on paper. There's a lot of very good teams.

India will obviously be strong. Australia on paper look scarily strong. New Zealand always are the underdogs. They love playing for their country, so they are strong. It is tough to predict at the start of the season who's going to win. There might be some injuries. It is impossible to predict.

The Indian coach’s position is up for grabs. Will you apply?

(After a laugh and a long pause) Well, I am curious. I've never ever thought about it.

I have deep respect for any international coach because I understand the pressure, but coaching the Indian team would be an extraordinary role. From what I've seen with the amount of talent I've seen in this country, it would be fascinating.

What is it like to face a fast bowler, say like Shoaib Akhtar?

If you are facing fast bowlers, you’ve got to have physical courage. The second thing is, if you see the ball come out of the bowler’s hand, it's like slow motion.

All I tried to do was getting my stance right and have proper balance. If you can see the ball released out of the bowler’s fingers, then everything will be okay. It’s then very hard to get out.

You see the ball release because you have hit so many cricket balls. It doesn't matter how quick it is. But if your stance is just a little bit out and you start falling across or you're moving at release of the ball, it is like living in a fast-forward movie cartoon.

And that's when you get hit on the body and then it's not fun.

Do you miss the Pakistan team of the past – tough and competitive?

Yeah, just as we miss a competitive West Indies team. I grew up watching the great West Indies team. You want to see them strong, and you want to see all the other countries strong. We talk about this in the MCC world cricket committee meeting regularly. How do we keep sustaining the health of the other countries? It’s important to have West Indies strong, as important to keep Pakistan strong and as important to keep New Zealand and Sri Lanka strong because that is important for the health of world cricket.",LSG head coach Justin Langer talks about the changing dynamics of the game. Langer was a key member of the formidable Australian team of the 1990s. He talks about how the role of a coach has changed from a one-coach-one-physio endeavour to a 90-man entourages.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110099050,imgsize-44010,width-400,resizemode-4/110099050.jpg"

BENGALURU: Over the past two weeks, performances, stars and luck have aligned perfectly for Royal Challengers Bengaluru , who have won five consecutive matches to stay afloat in the Indian Premier League . A 47-run win against Delhi Capitals on Sunday helped them jump to the fifth position on the points table, with their final match - a big-ticket home contest against Chennai Super Kings next weekend being decisive.On Sunday it seemed even the weather in Bengaluru wanted to play its part in RCB's run of luck. While heavy rain lashed many parts of the city before the match, the cloud cover did not open above the M Chinnaswamy stadium until a couple of hours after RCB had sealed their win.Faf du Plessis and his men's campaign has been divided into two parts. In the first, where they lost seven of their outings, RCB had just one close contest-losing by a solitary run to Kolkata Knight Riders . Most of the matches in this phase was highlighted by erratic bowling, misfiring batters, their massive investments at the auction backfiring and team strategies which were baffling.But the tide turned on April 25, when their bowlers defended 206 for a 35-run victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad . The win also marked the return to form of Cameron Green (2/23 in four overs), their Rs 17.5-crore indulgence during the transfer window. On Sunday, Green, the man of the match again, played a pivotal role with an unbeaten 24-ball 32 and four over during which he went for a measly 19 runs and picked up a wicket.After the halfway mark, the coaching staff headed by Andy Flower, a man with a T20 winning reputation, have been able to turn the assembly of stars and domestic players into a team which performs in unison. While Virat Kohli , with 661 runs, has continued with his purple patch, Rajat Patidar, who has been pushed down the batting order, has adjusted to his middle-order role. Resting an awfully out of form Glenn Maxwell has freed up a foreigner slot which has been used wisely. On that count Will Jacks has been a good value-add.With no spinner of pedigree in the line-up Karn Sharma was an option, while 33-year-old Swapnil Singh hadn't inspired confidence. But in the 2.0 version of the Bengaluru-based franchise, the left-arm spinner has opened bowling with confidence.Summing up his team's journey, Green later said, ""This year there has been so many high scores.""Elaborating further, skipper Du Plessis said, ""The first of the season, things didn't quite come together. Now, from a batting and bowling perspective we have been able to put it together. A lot of work has gone behind the scenes, and we are getting it right and I feel there is a lot more variety in our bowling now. Yash (Dayal) and Lockie (Ferguson) have been exceptional the last few games. We want to play a style of cricket which is bold and put some performances together and keep going.""Although RCB's qualification hinges on a big win against CSK and the performance of Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants, their comeback will be the biggest positive for the team this season.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru have won five consecutive matches to stay afloat in the Indian Premier League.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants assistant coach Lance Klusener on Monday downplayed the recent public outburst by team owner Sanjiv Goenka directed at their captain KL Rahul .Klusener referred to the incident as a 'storm in a tea cup' and expressed no concern over what he considered a 'robust discussion between two cricket lovers.The Goenka public outburst took place after LSG suffered a massive defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad last Wednesday.Social media platforms were buzzing with discussions about Goenka's animated conversation with Rahul, which appeared to be a reprimand for the team's performance.There have been speculations about Rahul's future as LSG skipper also, but Klusener said there has been ""certainly no discussions around"" the matter.""I don't see any problem with some robust discussion between two cricket lovers. So for us, I guess it's just a storm in a teacup. We love a robust discussion. I think that's how teams get better. So, it's not a big thing for us,"" the South African said during the pre-match press conference.Opening the batting, Rahul has scored 460 runs but his strike-rate reads 136.09, and it has put pressure on the LSG middle-order comprising Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran.Klusener, however, backed the senior batter.""KL has got his own unique style which has made him a fantastic player and respected around the world. I think this IPL has been exceptionally tough for him because we've kept losing wickets at stages which hasn't allowed him to kick on where he likes. He probably feels like he's always having to rebuild.""I think as a batting unit around KL, we haven't been as good as we should. It's just been extremely tough conditions for him. That's something we've chatted about as well -- we've just kept losing wickets at tough times.""However, Klusener said a big knock from Rahul was just around the corner.""Then batters coming in, seem to have to be rebuilding the whole time and not just coming into a platform. So, I think by KL's standards, he probably would have liked to have kicked on in a few more games.""Probably (he) would have liked to have at least one or two hundreds that haven't worked out for him. But there's still a couple of games left. He's in a good space. So, we've got our fingers crossed again for him,"" he said.LSG bowling unit was at the receiving end of a brutal onslaught from SRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, who racked up a record 167 in 9.4 overs.""By the bowling unit's high standards, they didn't execute as well as they would have liked to on that surface and then you mix in two players who played absolutely beautifully and quite often that ends in a poor result for the team that doesn't bring their best skills,"" Klusener said.""It was just a mix of some exceptionally hard batting and I don't think we executed our skills as well as we should have and you mix that together, it doesn't normally end well.""LSG are currently at the seventh spot with 12 points, making the remaining two games a must-win contest to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.""I think we've been just a little bit inconsistent by our own high standards. We just need to deal with the fact of where we are now and make sure that we become consistent.""As a team, we want to win the IPL, we probably need to win five in a row, which I think RCB has just done five in a row.""So that's just proved that for us it's absolutely possible, but that's just the big picture.

Chennai prevailed in the low-scoring match thanks to skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad ’s 41-ball 42 not out in his team's successful chase.Pacers Simarjeet Singh and Tushar Deshpande had shared five wickets to restrict Rajasthan to 141-5 on a slow-paced wicket.Chennai chased that down in 18.2 overs, finishing on 145-5, to seal its first win over the Rajasthan Royals in five games.With its seventh win in 13 games, Chennai climbed to third in the IPL table on 14 points, the same as Sunrisers Hyderabad but ahead on net run-rate .Rajasthan is still second with 16 points from 12 games after its third straight loss and needs a solitary win in the remaining two games to confirm its last-four spot .CSK has a chance to reach 16 points and qualify directly by winning their upcoming match against RCB. If CSK loses against RCB then they'll have to make sure that RCB does not chase the target within 18.1 overs or win the match by 18 runs or more.LSG and GT can secure a direct entry into the playoffs with 16 points if they win their next two matches, provided RCB defeats CSK and SRH loses its remaining matches. However, any loss will make it challenging for them to bounce back due to their negative run rate.SRH, with fourteen points and two matches remaining, can solidify their playoff berth thanks to their superior run rate. If SRH loses both matches, it opens up a chance for both CSK and RCB to qualify for the playoffs provided RCB defeats CSK.","Defending champion Chennai Super Kings remain in contention for the playoffs after beating Rajasthan Royals by five wickets.

At the big stage, he will be fine,"" said Ganguly.Rohit in the ongoing season, has scored 349 runs in 13 innings at an average of 29.08, with a century and strike rate of 145.41.

As a group, we are pretty confident. England is always our biggest series... We want to put up a good fight, put on a good show.

He spent the past two weeks with bowling coach Jade Dernbach working on his ""balance at the crease"" and discovered his prodigious reverse swing.""I felt good. It has been a tough couple of weeks for me, trying to work on some things, but it is always good to get rewards for some hard work. As a fast bowler, you always want to see the stumps flying around. I am building with Surrey. [I want to] get myself in good physical shape, the right mental space, and then when it gets to the West Indies tour, I will build on that.""""I have no retirement time in sight. I think I can go as long as I want, but obviously it is all on performances. The older you get, you need to have performance to stay in the team. I have been doing well, but I just want to keep helping the youngsters so they are in a good space, mentally and physically.

"Virat Kohli shows intent in strike rate, spin game in second half of IPL 2024",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/virat-kohli-shows-intent-in-strike-rate-spin-game-in-second-half-of-ipl-2024/articleshow/110091478.cms,"(With inputs from ANI)

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru star Virat Kohli consistently showcased his prowess in this IPL as a T20 player, despite the contrasting opinions of fans, cricket pundits, and former players.His incredible performances serve as a positive reinforcement for Team India in anticipation of the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup 2024.The ICC's cricketing extravaganza, scheduled to commence from June 1, will be jointly hosted by the West Indies and the USA.Kohli's solid form in the IPL instills confidence in the Indian team's prospects as they prepare to compete on the global stage.Continuing his fine run with the bat and indicating that he can hit big from ball one if needed, Virat played a solid knock of 27 in just 13 balls against Delhi Capitals (DC) on Sunday. His knock had a four and three massive sixes and a strike rate of over 207. A huge part of this knock was his back-and-forth with compatriot and pacer Ishant Sharma, someone who has been around Virat since his academy days. Both exchanged jokes, shared laughs and tried to get one-up on each other before a fine delivery by Ishant was nicked by Virat straight into the hands of wicketkeeper Abhishek Porel.In the ongoing season, Virat is the Orange Cap holder for most runs, making 661 runs at an average of 66.10 and a strike rate of 155.16, with a century and five fifties. His best score is 113*. RCB , who has made a remarkable comeback in the tournament with five successive wins after a horrid win-loss record of 1-6 in the first half, will need Virat to be at his best against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their final league game at Bengaluru on May 18 for a chance at playoffs.Often being questioned on his strike rate, Virat has swung back at his critics in his signature fashion, ditching boundaries in favour of huge sixes and passing verbal jabs at naysayers during post-inning or match presentations.In the first six games of the tournament, Virat scored well at a healthy strike rate. He made 319 runs in his first six innings in 225 balls at a strike rate of 141.77. 29 fours and 12 sixes came from Virat's bat, marking a ratio of 5.4 balls per boundary. He was forced to play the anchor and attacker at the same time as other batters around him struggled for form and rhythm. Virat scored a century and two fifties in these six innings.The switch flipped in Virat's batting when they were tasked with chasing 288 runs against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in their seventh game. Though RCB faced a 25-run loss despite a valiant effort, Virat scored 42 in 20 balls, with six fours and two sixes. His strike rate was 210.00.Since that SRH game, fans have experienced a different Virat. In these next seven innings, Virat scored 342 runs in just 201 balls, with a strike rate going up to a massive 170.14. 27 fours and 21 sixes have come from his bat in these seven innings starting from that SRH game. The balls per boundary ratio has also come down, with 4.1 balls taken to smash one.An unnoticed positive of Virat's remarkable run is his six-hitting. He has smashed a total of 33 sixes so far, the second-highest by a batter next to SRH's Abhishek Sharma (35 sixes). Virat has more sixes than Sunil Narine (32), Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen and Riyan Parag (31), Australian sensation Jake Fraser McGurk and Shivam Dube (28), Rajat Patidar (27) and Rishabh Pant (25).This is the only second time Virat has crossed 30 sixes in a single season of IPL, with his highest peak coming in 2016, when he smashed 38 sixes in 16 games. He has one more league game atleast to add more to his tally.Since that Sunrisers game, Virat's strike rate against spin, something considered his weakness, has also gone up. In his first six IPL 2024 innings, Virat scored 128 runs in 98 balls against spin, with only four boundaries and seven sixes coming from his bat. He played 28 dot balls against spin and his SR against spin was 130.61.However, that SRH inning during the chase of 287 runs, sparked a change in his spin game as well. From that knock onwards, Virat has smashed 132 runs in 90 balls against spin, with 11 fours and six sixes coming from his bat. His strike rate also increased to 146.66 against spin and he played 26 dots against the moving ball.Virat's overall strike rate against spin in this IPL is 138.29, with 260 runs hit in 188 balls against spin. He has smashed 13 sixes against spin and 15 boundaries. He has played 54 dot balls against spinners.In the past five seasons, Virat's overall SR against spin has been: 113.46, 108.08, 100.00, 108.91 and 130.14. His strike rate against spin was at its best in the 2016 season, where he struck at 152.30 and 2015 season, where he scored his runs at 151.21 against spin bowling.Following his match-winning knock of 92 in just 47 balls against Punjab Kings recently on May 9, Virat had spoken about being more attacking in his approach, bringing out slog sweeps against spinners after a long-time and the idea of self-improvement.""For me, it is still quality over quantity (on his runs and numbers). More so now, at this stage of my career, heading into 36. The understanding of my game over so many years allows me to practice less, and still stay mentally switched on. And some added challenges in terms of improving your own game. Certain aspects of the game, you want to get better at. It's an ever-evolving process. I am not a guy who wants to sit around saying 'this is the way I play' and not improve on the things I need to,"" said Kohli.Kohli further explained about his slog-sweep shot against the spinners.""I brought out the slog-sweep to the spinners. It was me mentally putting myself in that situation. I did not practice that at all. I know I can hit it because I have played that shot a lot in the past. So I just felt like I needed to take a bit more risk and for me, that shot was something that I used to hit regularly back in the days. That shot is now allowing me to hit off the backfoot as well. I am always looking to expose that side of the field against the spin. It's been a massive factor for me in the IPL,"" the right-hand batter added.""It just takes a bit more conviction and put out that thought that props up 'what if I get out?'. I have been managing to stay ahead of that thought. And that has allowed me to keep my strike rate up in the middle overs and scoring for my team as well,"" the Delhi-born player concluded.This refreshed approach of Virat in T20 cricket, especially against spinners, could just be what India needs on slow surfaces of the Caribbean and it would be interesting if Virat would carry forward his form to the World Cup.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru star Virat Kohli continues fine run with the bat. Virat scored 27 in just 13 balls against Delhi Capitals (DC) on Sunday. Kohli is the Orange Cap holder for most runs, making 661 runs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110091419,imgsize-89448,width-400,resizemode-4/110091419.jpg"
'Parents overawed with success of IPL': Former India captain urges young players to target playing Test cricket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/parents-overawed-with-success-of-ipl-former-india-captain-urges-young-players-to-target-playing-test-cricket/articleshow/110091279.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former India captain and chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar emphasized the importance of aspiring youngsters setting their sights on playing and excelling in Test cricket . According to him, achieving success in the traditional format brings genuine honour to players.Vengsarkar pointed out that in today's times, parents might be tempted by the fame and financial rewards associated with success in T20 leagues.However, he stressed that the primary focus of young players should remain on excelling in red-ball cricket. Mastering this format not only brings true recognition but also lays a solid foundation for success in other formats of the game.""Parents are overawed with the success of IPL , its teams and players,"" Vengsarkar said in Mumbai at an event to launch cricket coach Jwala Singh 's book, titled Pathway to Cricketing Excellence and Beyond.Vengsarkar, who also served as a former chief selector and is credited for bringing Virat Kohli into the national team, emphasised that while parents may lean towards training their children to become batters, it's crucial to recognise the equal importance of bowlers regardless of the format.""The bowlers also have a big role to play not just in the IPL but also Test cricket, they can be match-winners. Try to play Test cricket for your country, if you are a good Test cricketer you can play other formats of the game,"" he said.""You will be rated only by what you have done for the country in Test cricket. IPL is a good format, it is good entertainment and it also meets the finances, which is also very important but Test match cricket is the ultimate,"" Vengsarkar added.Jwala, renowned for mentoring India batter Yashasvi Jaiswal from a young age, emphasised the pivotal role of parents and the significance of having the right coaches in a player's development journey.""When you play any sport there are three pillars, one is the player, and the second is the parents and third is the coach. It has to be a combined effort of all three and that is what this book is about,"" Jwala said while giving insights into his book which he has co-authored with Sreekar Mothukuri.""The parents, today, they watch the IPL and so much media (attention) and the (overall) outcome, they think their child would become a cricketer and he will earn a lot of money and fame. But that is not the way to play a sport,"" added Jwala, who has also coached India batter Prithvi Shaw .The coach said if a child is passionate enough, he should be given a certain number of years to harness it.""If any of the parents are thinking that, it is absolutely wrong. If a child has passion (for the sport) and it continues for (a number of) years, that is how it will work out,"" he added.",Dilip Vengsarkar says aspiring youngsters should set their sights on Test cricket.

NEW DELHI: Aston Villa staged a remarkable comeback against Liverpool in a thrilling 3-3 draw on Monday night, thanks to two late goals from substitute Jhon Duran . The result leaves Villa on the brink of securing a Champions League spot for next season.The match started disastrously for Villa, with goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez conceding a bizarre own-goal just 62 seconds into the game.However, Villa equalized through Youri Tielemans in the 11th minute, only for Liverpool to regain the lead through Cody Gakpo and extend it further with Jarell Quansah's first Premier League goal.Despite the setback, Villa refused to give up, and Duran's introduction proved to be a game-changer.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe , playing his final home game for Paris Saint-Germain , scored in a surprising 3-1 loss to Toulouse on the night PSG received the Ligue 1 trophy.Despite Mbappe's early goal, his 44th of the season across all competitions, Toulouse quickly equalized through Thijs Dallinga. PSG fielded a heavily rotated side following their Champions League semi-final exit to Borussia Dortmund , with Mbappe being the sole player to retain his place.Yann Gboho's stunning strike put Toulouse ahead in the second half, and Frank Magri sealed the victory in added time, handing PSG only their second league defeat this season and first in 27 matches since September.Mbappe, who confirmed his departure from PSG when his contract expires at the end of the season, is expected to join Real Madrid next. He leaves PSG as the club's all-time leading scorer with 256 goals since joining from Monaco in 2017 for a fee of 180 million euros ($194 million).PSG had already secured a record-extending 12th French title and their 10th in 12 years before the match against Toulouse. The celebrations following the game were intended to focus on their title triumph rather than serving as a specific tribute to Mbappe. PSG can still complete a domestic treble by winning the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25, having already claimed the Champions Trophy, France's equivalent of the Super Cup.In other Ligue 1 action, Monaco secured second place and direct qualification for next season's Champions League with a 2-0 victory at Montpellier.

However, their victory at Old Trafford was far from convincing, as they battled stifling heat and a determined United side.United's injury woes and defensive vulnerabilities were exposed once again, with Casemiro's error leading to Trossard's decisive goal. The absence of key players like Bruno Fernandes only added to their struggles.Despite a spirited second-half display from United, Arsenal held firm defensively, securing their sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United clinched their first Women's FA Cup title with a commanding 4-0 triumph over Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Sunday. Under the guidance of manager Marc Skinner , the team avenged their defeat in last year's final to Chelsea by putting on a dominant display.The match saw United assert their authority, with midfielder Ella Toone breaking the deadlock on the stroke of halftime with a spectacular strike.After the break, Rachel Williams extended their lead with a well-timed header, followed by two goals from Spanish forward Lucia Garcia , sealing a comprehensive victory.This triumph marks a significant milestone for Manchester United's women's team, who have steadily progressed since their reformation in 2018. Winning their first major trophy will undoubtedly serve as a source of pride and motivation for the players and staff alike as they continue to make strides in women's football.""Wembley is always special. Last year we spoke as a group and said 'one day that will be ours' and today's the day so I'm buzzing,"" said goalkeeper Mary Earps.The atmosphere at Wembley Stadium was electric on a sunny day, with a staggering 76,082 fans in attendance, including Manchester United's co-owner Avram Glazer and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. Despite the anticipation, the first half of the match produced few noteworthy chances, with the breakthrough coming in the second minute of stoppage time.It was England's Ella Toone who seized the moment, driving the ball forward and unleashing a powerful strike from outside the area that found the top corner of the net. This stunning goal gave Manchester United a crucial lead heading into halftime.Tottenham, appearing in their first-ever FA Cup final, struggled to pose any attacking threat throughout the match, failing to register a single shot on target. Their hopes were further dashed after the break as United's Rachel Williams, a former Spurs player who had previously won the FA Cup with Birmingham City, rose high to head in a free kick, extending United's lead.Spanish forward Lucia Garcia capitalized on a mistake from Tottenham goalkeeper Becky Spencer, intercepting a poor pass and slotting the ball into the net to make it 3-0 in the 57th minute. Garcia then secured her brace, and United's victory, with another goal in the 74th minute, this time via a deflection.This triumph comes as a bright spot in Manchester United's challenging season, where they have struggled in the league standings, currently sitting fifth. Winning the Women's FA Cup represents a significant achievement for the club and underscores their progress since reforming the women's team in 2018.""We don't like to admit it but it does mask over the issues we've had,"" goalscorer Williams, 36, told the BBC. ""We have had some ups and downs this year. That's for Marc (Skinner) and the backroom staff to be like 'right, this is what we have to do in the summer'.""We are going to have change things next year.

Lionel Messi plays through injury scare in Inter Miami's 3-2 MLS victory over Montreal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/lionel-messi-plays-through-injury-scare-in-inter-miamis-3-2-mls-victory-over-montreal/articleshow/110048085.cms,"(Inputs from AP)

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi played the full 90 minutes in Inter Miami's 3-2 victory over Montreal on Saturday night, despite a brief injury scare in the first half. Benjamin Cremaschi scored the decisive goal in the 59th minute, helping Inter Miami secure their fifth straight Major League Soccer win after overcoming a two-goal deficit.Luis Suarez and Matías Rojas also found the back of the net for Inter Miami, while Jules-Anthony Vilsaint and Bryce Duke scored for Montreal (3-5-3).Inter Miami (8-2-3) stretched their unbeaten run to seven matches (5-0-2), even though Messi failed to score or assist for the first time in his nine MLS appearances this season. The team has a 7-0-2 record in those nine games, with one of their losses coming against Montreal in March when Messi was not playing.Messi experienced a concerning moment towards the end of the first half when he was fouled by George Campbell . The impact of the challenge caused Messi to fall to the ground, visibly in pain and clutching his left knee.Inter Miami's medical staff attended to Messi on the field, and after about two minutes, he got up and walked to the sideline. He was not substituted, allowing him to return to the game shortly after.Remarkably, the match dynamics shifted following Messi's injury scare.

Messi had two chances to extend the lead in the final minutes but narrowly missed both.The match attracted a sellout crowd of 19,619 spectators, with Montreal selling out its 15,000 season tickets for the first time since joining MLS in 2012, largely due to Messi's arrival in the league last summer.

Kylian Mbappe announces his departure from Paris Saint-Germain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/kylian-mbappe-announces-his-departure-from-paris-saint-germain/articleshow/110026031.cms,"(Inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe confirmed on Friday his decision to depart from Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) at the conclusion of the current season. The French champions, who signed Mbappe from Monaco in 2017 for a staggering 180 million euros ($194 million), are expected to bid farewell to their star player as he likely moves to Real Madrid .""I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain.I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks,"" Mbappe, 25, said in a video posted on social media. ""I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.""PSG, owned by Qatar, have already clinched their 10th Ligue 1 title in the past 12 seasons and will be presented with the trophy following Sunday's match against Toulouse, their final home game of the campaign. However, the team's Champions League aspirations were dashed by Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals, with a 1-0 home defeat sealing a surprising 2-0 aggregate loss. Consequently, Mbappe will not have the opportunity to bid farewell in the Champions League final at Wembley on June 1, and his seven-year tenure at PSG will conclude without having secured Europe's most prestigious club competition.Mbappe had privately informed PSG of his intention to leave when his contract expires at the end of the season back in February. Although he had not publicly confirmed his departure or his next destination, it is widely believed that he will join Real Madrid. Spanish media reports have suggested that Mbappe has already signed an agreement to join LaLiga champions in July once his PSG contract concludes.""It's a lot of emotions, many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club, one of the best in the world,"" said Mbappe.""It allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure, to grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history, some of the greatest champions,"" he added. ""It's hard and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that... but I think I needed this, a new challenge, after seven years.""Mbappe's arrival in Paris as a teenager in 2017 came after he had helped Monaco secure the league title. His transfer fee, initially on loan before becoming permanent, remains the second-largest in football history, coming just weeks after PSG paid a world-record 222 million euros to acquire Neymar from Barcelona.Despite the Qatari takeover in 2011 and the subsequent dominance of French football, PSG have struggled to achieve European success, even with the addition of Lionel Messi to their lineup for two seasons. The closest they came was the 2020 Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich, where PSG academy graduate Kingsley Coman scored the winning goal against his former club.Mbappe, who has scored 43 goals in all competitions this season, including 26 in Ligue 1, will aim to add to his club-record tally of 255 goals for PSG and secure another medal in the French Cup final on May 25. During his seven years at his hometown team, Mbappe has won six Ligue 1 titles, three French Cups, and the now-defunct League Cup twice.Following Sunday's game, PSG will conclude their league campaign with away matches at Nice and relegation-threatened Metz before Mbappe's final appearance for the club in the Cup final in Lille.Mbappe's relationship with PSG boss Luis Enrique has come under scrutiny since he informed the club of his plans to leave earlier this year. The club had initially frozen him out at the start of the campaign, pressuring him to either sign a new deal or agree to be sold rather than simply running down the final year of his contract.",Kylian Mbappe confirms he will leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season.

NEW DELHI: Iga Swiatek secured a victory over Angelique Kerber with a scoreline of 7-5, 6-3, setting the stage for a quarter-final showdown against Madison Keys at the Rome Open on Monday.Despite facing resistance, Swiatek, the world number one, remains unbeaten in sets and is favored to clinch her third Foro Italico crown before defending her French Open title later this month.The Polish star's journey to the quarter-finals wasn't without its challenges, particularly against former world number one Kerber. Despite Kerber's spirited efforts, Swiatek managed to claim the first set after a tough battle and then rallied from behind in the second set to emerge victorious.Swiatek's next opponent, Madison Keys, also encountered an unusual disruption during her match against Sorana Cirstea. Activists from Ultima Generazione interrupted the match, causing a 30-minute suspension. Despite the disruption, Keys secured a convincing 6-2, 6-1 win to advance to the next round.The activists, wearing orange vests, created chaos by throwing liquid and confetti onto the court where Keys was playing, as well as court 12, where a men's doubles match was underway. Their actions led to delays in the proceedings, with tournament officials working to restore order amidst the disturbance.""Obviously it's not the greatest feeling when you're on court, your first reaction is kind of your own safety,"" said Keys.""I think maybe banning cementing glue from bags would be a start.""It's obviously something that's becoming more of an occurence and something that tournaments are going to have to figure out how to stop.""Daniil Medvedev will continue his title defence against Serbian qualifier Hamad Medjedovic with the men's tournament wide open following a series of big-name exits, the latest being fourth seed Andrey Rublev .Rome is missing the world's top three men following Novak Djokovic's early elimination on Saturday, with Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz both withdrawing ahead of the event.And Russian Rublev, fresh from claiming the Madrid title, suffered a shock third-round defeat by French qualifier Alexandre Muller, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.Sixth seed and reigning Monte Carlo champion Stefanos Tsitsipas is still in the fray after beating Briton Cameron Norrie in straight sets 6-2, 7-6 (7/1).Naomi Osaka 's return to the Rome Open was ended at the last 16 by China's Zheng Qinwen who breezed past her four-time Grand Slam winning opponent 6-2, 6-4 to set up a last-eight clash with third seed Coco Gauff.Japan's Osaka, who has never won a title on clay, was playing at the Foro Italico for the first time in three years after taking a break from the tour to have her first child and is ranked at 173 in the world.""I think I'm happy with my performance in Rome.

After a half-hour stoppage to clean the court, Keys completed her win over Romania's Cirstea 6-2, 6-1.There were also protestors in the stands with a tournament spokesman telling AFP that at least one person had tried to glue their feet to the floor in order to slow their removal.""Obviously it's not the greatest feeling when you're on court, your first reaction is kind of your own safety,"" said Keys.""I think maybe banning cementing glue from bags would be a start.""It's obviously something that's becoming more of an occurence and something that tournaments are going to have to figure out how to stop.""Daniil Medvedev will continue his title defence against Serbian qualifier Hamad Medjedovic, with the men's tournament wide open following Sunday's exit of top seed and six-time Rome winner Novak Djokovic.Rome is missing the world's top three men following Djokovic's early elimination, with Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz both withdrawing ahead of the event.And one of Medvedev's key rivals, Rublev was also heading home.Rublev had come to Rome fresh from claiming the Madrid title but his winning streak was stopped at seven matches.Sixth seed and reigning Monte Carlo champion Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Briton Cameron Norrie in straight sets 6-2, 7-6 (7/1).Later Iga Swiatek continues her bid for a third Rome title against Angelique Kerber, while Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka will face Elina Svitolina for the first time since their handshake row at last year's French Open.World number one Swiatek is yet to drop a set and is red-hot favourite to make the quarter-finals past unseeded German Kerber, who at 331 is the lowest-ranked player ever to reach the last 16 in this tournament.Three-time French Open champion Swiatek arrived in Rome off the back of a thrilling triumph in Madrid, her third WTA 1000 title of the season after also winning at Indian Wells and Doha.Belarusian second seed Sabalenka was accused by Ukraine's Svitolina of inflaming tensions surrounding the Russia-Ukraine war after the Roland Garros quarter-final between the pair in 2023.Sabalenka waited at the net for a handshake after beating Svitolina, even though Svitolina had already insisted she was not going to offer one, as all Ukraine players refused to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian rivals in protest at the ongoing war.(With inputs from AFP)",Naomi Osaka beaten by China's Zheng Qinwen in Rome Open round of 16.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic expressed concern over his unexpected third-round loss to Alejandro Tabilo at the Rome Open on Sunday, just two days after being struck on the head by a bottle, which he claimed caused nausea and dizziness.Tabilo, ranked 32nd in the world, secured his first victory against a top-10 player with a 6-2, 6-3 win, ending Djokovic's quest for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title in just over an hour.The 24-time Grand Slam champion suggested that his lacklustre performance on a court where he has won six titles might have been a result of the blow he suffered while interacting with fans on Friday night.Despite initially making light of the incident by wearing a cycling crash helmet to training on Saturday morning, Djokovic admitted to feeling different during the match. ""I don't know, to be honest. I have to check that. Training was different. I was going for kind of easy training yesterday. I didn't feel anything, but I also didn't feel the same. Today under high stress, it was quite bad -- not in terms of pain, but in terms of this balance. Just no coordination. Completely different player from what it was two nights ago,"" Djokovic stated after the match.With the French Open approaching, where Djokovic is the defending champion, he expressed concern not only about the after-effects of the bottle incident but also his current form. The last time he arrived at Roland Garros without a title that season was in 2018, when his first honor of the campaign came at Wimbledon. Djokovic acknowledged that ""everything needs to be better in order for me to have at least a chance to win"" a 25th Grand Slam.In other matches, third seed Alexander Zverev defeated home hope Luciano Darderi 7-6 (7/3), 6-2, while Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka set up a clash with Elina Svitolina in the women's last 16.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic expressed his dismay at his unexpected third-round exit from the Rome Open , describing it as ""concerning."" The defeat came just two days after he was struck on the head by a bottle, an incident that left him experiencing symptoms of nausea and dizziness.Djokovic's bid for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title came to an abrupt end at the hands of Alejandro Tabilo , a Chilean player ranked 32nd in the world.Tabilo's victory marked his first win over a top-10 opponent, as he defeated Djokovic convincingly with a scoreline of 6-2, 6-3.The 24-time Grand Slam champion attributed his subdued performance to the blow he sustained while greeting fans after his second-round win.Despite initially downplaying the incident and even wearing a cycling crash helmet to training the following morning, Djokovic acknowledged that the effects of the injury may have contributed to his underwhelming performance on the court.The unexpected loss in Rome serves as a setback for Djokovic, particularly as he had enjoyed success at the tournament in the past, having won six titles there.The incident highlights the physical toll that even seemingly minor injuries can have on professional athletes, underscoring the importance of health and safety in sports.""I don't know, to be honest. I have to check that. Training was different. I was going for kind of easy training yesterday. I didn't feel anything, but I also didn't feel the same,"" Djokovic told reporters.""Today under high stress, it was quite bad -- not in terms of pain, but in terms of this balance. Just no coordination. Completely different player from what it was two nights ago.""Djokovic also said that he would have scans to ""see what's going on"" before the French Open in Paris, where he will head not just worried by the after-effects of the bottle incident but also his form.The last time Djokovic got to Roland Garros without a title to his name that season was in 2018, when his first honour of the campaign came at Wimbledon.With the French Open getting underway in two weeks and where he is the defending champion, Djokovic admitted that ""everything needs to be better in order for me to have at least a chance to win"" a 25th Grand Slam.""The way I felt on the court today was just completely like a different player entered into my shoes,"" added Djokovic. ""It's a bit concerning.""With Djokovic's unexpected early elimination from the Rome Open, the landscape of the last major men's tournament before Roland Garros has become wide open. The absence of the top-ranked player leaves an opportunity for other contenders to make their mark.In the day's final match on center court, third seed Alexander Zverev is set to face off against Luciano Darderi, a home hope ranked 54th in the world. This match presents an intriguing battle between an established top player and a rising talent, with both players eager to make their presence felt in the tournament.Meanwhile, Tabilo's impressive victory over Djokovic has captured attention, as he demonstrated exceptional skill and composure against his superstar opponent. Tabilo's performance, marked by 22 winners, only four unforced errors, and no break points faced, solidifies his status as a formidable contender in the tournament.""Honestly in no moment was I like, Okay, I can win this,"" said a delighted Tabilo.""I was playing incredible tennis. Just wanted to keep that level... The whole match I was just trying to take it point by point, not think about the score. Every point was like the start of the match.""Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka cruised into the last 16 of the women's tournament with a straight-sets victory over Dayana Yastremska, 6-4, 6-2.Second seed Sabalenka claimed her first win in four matches against Ukrainian Yastremska to set up a clash in the next round with Elina Svitolina, a two-time winner at the Foro Italico, who comfortably beat Anna Kalinskaya 6-3, 6-3.The 26-year-old Belarusian made short work of Yastremska, dispatching her opponent in one hour and 28 minutes without dropping a service game and never looking in trouble.Sabalenka, who has never won in Rome but is a two-time champion on the Madrid clay, looks in good shape to at least match her 2022 run to the semi-finals.""Every time I was losing here, I was so sad,"" she told reporters.""I felt like I lost on the Grand Slam because it was one of the dream tournaments for me to win.""Earlier fifth seed Maria Sakkari lined up a probable last-16 clash with Victoria Azarenka who beat 80th-ranked Egyptian Mayar Sherif 6-2, 6-7 (6/8), 6-3.","Novak Djokovic loses to Alejandro Tabilo 6-2, 6-3 in third round of Rome Open.

This loss, against a player ranked 32nd in the world, marked Djokovic's bid for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title.Tabilo's victory was particularly noteworthy as it marked his first win over a top-10 opponent.Djokovic's subdued performance raised questions, especially since he had recently endured an accidental blow to the head by a bottle, just two days prior, following his second-round win over Corentin Moutet.Despite light-hearted responses such as wearing a cycling crash helmet during practice, his performance suggested lingering effects from the incident.Djokovic's elimination is a setback for him just before Roland Garros, the next major tournament. Additionally, the absence of notable players like Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz has disappointed fans.The absence of Italian favorites Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Musetti, along with Djokovic's clay-court rival Rafael Nadal's early exit in the second round, has further dampened the event's atmosphere.Tabilo's victory was well-deserved, with the Chilean dominating from the start, quickly securing a 4-0 lead in the first set and displaying an array of impressive shots.

Rafael Nadal suffered a disappointing exit from the Rome Open on Saturday, bowing out in the second round with a 6-1, 6-3 loss to Poland's Hubert Hurkacz .This defeat to the seventh seed raises questions about whether the clay-court maestro will participate in the upcoming French Open, where he boasts a record 14 titles.Nadal has emphasized that his decision to compete at Roland Garros hinges on his sense of competitiveness, particularly given his recent string of injury setbacks.Currently ranked 305th in the world, Nadal remains cautious about committing to the prestigious tournament.And the manner of his elimination in his first ever encounter with 27-year-old Hurkacz was a step backwards after reaching the last 16 in Madrid.Nadal held his own in the first two games in the first set, which took 26 minutes to complete, but then fell away as errors handed Hurkacz points.The 37-year-old twice gave away breaks of serve with miscued drop shots in the first set which Hurkacz closed out in 49 minutes as he blew through five straight games.And the match was as good as done when Hurkacz, who did not drop a single service game, broke Nadal in the third game of the second set to set up a famous victory.That level of dominance over Nadal on clay, much less a court where he has won a record 10 titles, would have been unimaginable a few short years ago.But Hurkacz will face Tomas Etcheverry in the third round after likely ending Nadal's love affair with Rome as the 22-time Grand Slam winner looks set to call time on his career at the end of the season.","Rafael Nadal loses 6-1, 6-3 to Hubert Hurkacz in the second round of the Rome Open.

However, as he was signing autographs for fans while exiting the centre court at the Foro Italico , Djokovic was struck by a hard plastic water bottle on the back of his head, leaving him in agony and crouched on the ground.Security staff led the 24-time Grand Slam winner from the arena, covering him as he made his way into the stands. It remains unclear from the video footage whether the bottle was deliberately launched from the stands or accidentally fell onto Djokovic's head.Watch:However, giving an update on his situation, Djokovic wrote on X, ""Thank you for the messages of concern. This was an accident and I am fine resting at the hotel with an ice pack. See you all on Sunday. ""His next opponent will be Chile's Alejandro Tabilo. The Serb, who turns 37 shortly before the French Open, is using the Rome tournament to prepare for Roland Garros and has a strong chance of adding to his impressive collection of titles at the Foro Italico, where onlyRafael Nadal has won more with 10.The Rome tournament, running until May 19, is missing some of its biggest stars, with Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz withdrawing from the men's draw before the start.Meanwhile, clay court icon Nadal had a challenging start in the first round against qualifier Zizou Bergs on Thursday and is on the opposite side of the draw to Djokovic, making a potential meeting between the two rivals unlikely unless they both reach the final.Third seed Alexander Zverev , one of Djokovic's potential threats, easily advanced to the third round with a 6-0, 6-4 win over Australia's Aleksandar Vukic. Similarly, Djokovic found his rhythm after a brief challenge from the flamboyant Moutet, winning seven consecutive games from 3-1 down in the first set to take control of the match.A moment of levity occurred when Moutet's phone went off during an absorbing opening game of the second set, which lasted nine minutes and saw the Frenchman save four break points before conceding, allowing Djokovic to cruise to victory.","Novak Djokovic beats France's Corentin Moutet 6-3, 6-1 at the Rome Open.
