Team India coach hunt: BCCI keeps options open with Gautam Gambhir topping the probables list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/team-india-coach-hunt-bcci-keeps-options-open-with-gautam-gambhir-topping-the-probables-list/articleshow/110317112.cms,"NEW DELHI: The job to find the new head coach for the senior men's team seems to have become more challenging for the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) than it was first thought to be.TOI understands that the board has kept its options open even as the deadline for the applications is less than a week away.Going by sources, Gautam Gambhir (coach of KKR ), Stephen Fleming (coach of Chennai Super Kings ), Justin Langer (coach of Lucknow Super Giants) and Mahela Jayawardene (global performance head of Mumbai Indians) have got BCCI interested.Reports suggest that the board's operations team has been trying to speak to potential candidates and check if they are interested in the job. It is learnt that Gujarat Titans' coach Ashish Nehra - whose name had earlier cropped up - isn't sure about doing a full-time job across formats.It is not going to be a straightforward call. To entice strong candidates for the job has become difficult because of competition from IPL The commitment to travel with the team for 10 months a year till the next ODI World Cup in 2027 is a big issue. All the aforesaid names have lucrative jobs with IPL franchises.The only one not committed to an IPL job is current NCA head VVS Laxman . While it is understood that Laxman has shown reluctance to take up the job, the board has not ruled him out yet. Interestingly, Laxman had refused the job after the 2023 ODI World Cup and subsequentlyRahul Dravid was asked to continue at least till the T20 WC next month.Sources told TOI that Gambhir is currently on top of BCCI's wish list. ""There has been no formal communication with the potential candidates. All these coaches are biding their time and weighing options. But it seems Gambhir's stocks have risen. It is likely that the board officials will speak with Gambhir in Ahmedabad where he is with KKR for the IPL playoffs,"" a BCCI source said on Tuesday.It is learnt that Gambhir and senior players in the Indian team have been getting along quite well of late. ""If people are talking about Gambhir's friction with Virat Kohli, it can be confirmed that the two have always got along well off the field. Even after the bust-up during an IPL match last year, the two were made to sit down and sort out any issue if they indeed had one,"" the source added.After Anil Kumble was appointed head coach for a year over Ravi Shastri in 2016, the board never really had to choose between candidates.Shastri was a unanimous choice between 2017-21 with then skipper Kohli's backing. Dravid was elevated from NCA head in 2021 after the BCCI officials convinced him after a long discussion during the 2021 T20 World Cup in Dubai.In the current scenario, BCCI seems to be unsure about its options. One can hope for some concrete discussions and development by the end of this week.","Gautam Gambhir, Stephen Fleming, Justin Langer and Mahela Jayawardene have got BCCI interested.

IPL Eliminator: Struggling Rajasthan Royals take on revitalized Royal Challengers Bengaluru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-eliminator-struggling-rajasthan-royals-take-on-revitalized-royal-challengers-bengaluru/articleshow/110317868.cms,"Miracle men meet self-destructors

AHMEDABAD: Having taken contrasting paths to reach the Eliminator of IPL 2024, Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) take the field at the Narendra Modi Stadium here on Wednesday to keep their campaign alive. The league stage record matters little in a knockout match and RCB look like a team with the momentum.RR won eight of their first nine matches and looked good to top the table before a string of four defeats and a no-result saw them being leapfrogged by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Sunrisers Hyderabad.RCB took an altogether different route. After winning just one of their first eight matches, they won six on the bounce to clinch the fourth place and make the playoffs.With their confidence sky-high, RCB will again bank on Purple Cap holder Virat Kohli for runs. Captain Faf Du Plessis , who has aggregated 421 runs, is also back in form and striking at a rate of 163.81.The middle-order comprising Rajat Patidar, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik , Mahipal Lomror and Glenn Maxwell have come to the party at the right time. While Patidar and Green have done the bulk of the scoring in the middle overs, Karthik, Lomror and Maxwell are tasked with upping the momentum in the death overs.In Trent Boult and Sandeep Sharma, however, RR have two pacers who can swing the ball early and pose questions to Kohli and Co. Leg spinner Yuzvendra Chahal (17 wickets) is the top wicket-taker for RR. Veteran off-spinner Ravinchandran Ashwin (7 wickets) has been less effective but has kept a check on run rate by going at 8.61 runs an over.Tall South African left-arm pacer Nandre Burger is an option on the Ahmedabad track but it remains to be seen if RR exercise that option by including him in the playing XI or using him as an impact player. Pacer Avesh Khan (13 wickets) has been used by RR in the middle and death overs effectively. Rajasthan's batting looks a little uncertain with the exit of England batter Jos Buttler.With opener Yashasvi Jaiswal 's form (348 runs) blowing hot and cold, the batting responsibilities have been shared by captain Sanju Samson (504 runs) and in-form Riyan Parag (531). West Indian Rovman Powell and middle order Dhruv Jurel haven't exactly set the house on fire with their batting contributions but remain a vital cog in RR's playing unit.Ridiculed in the first half of the season for its inability to defend totals or stop teams from setting daunting targets, RCB's bowling attack has been incisive in the last six matches. They have been backed by inspirational fielding, examples of which can be found in Kohli's direct hits to run opposition batters out and Du Plessis' catch to send Mitchell Santner back in the last match.The pacer duo of Mohammed Siraj (13 wickets) and Yash Dayal (15 wickets) have started hitting the right lengths and made it difficult to score in the powerplay. They have been backed by pacer Lockie Ferguson, left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh, leg spinner Karn Sharma and all-rounders Maxwell and Green.","Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) take the field at the Narendra Modi Stadium here on Wednesday.

KKR vs SRH Qualifier 1 highlights: Kolkata Knight Riders enter fourth IPL final with thumping win over Sunrisers Hyderabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/kolkata-knight-riders-enter-fourth-ipl-final-with-thumping-win-over-sunrisers-hyderabad/articleshow/110311963.cms,"(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Mitchell Starc propelled the Kolkata Knight Riders into the IPL final with a dominant performance against Sunrisers Hyderabad, securing an eight-wicket victory in Qualifier 1 on Tuesday.Starc's sensational opening spell claimed three wickets in the powerplay, dismantling SRH's formidable batting lineup. SRH was eventually bowled out for just 159 in 19.3 overs, with Rahul Tripathi contributing a crucial 55, while Heinrich Klaasen (32) and Pat Cummins (30) offered some resistance.On a placid wicket in scorching conditions, SRH's efforts fizzled out as KKR chased down the modest 160-run target in just 13.4 overs. Captain Shreyas Iyer (58 not out off 24) and Venkatesh Iyer (51 not out off 28) led the charge, ensuring a comfortable win.KKR will now compete in their fourth IPL final in Chennai on Sunday.SRH, who had pipped Rajasthan Royals on the final day of the league stage to finish second in the points table, will now proceed to Chennai to have another crack at making the summit clash with the Qualifier 2 to be played on May 24.The Pat Cummins-led side will face the winner of the Eliminator between Rajasthan Royals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru here on Wednesday.In his first game this season, Rahmanullah Gurbaz (23) played his role to perfection with two crucial grabs behind the wicket and a quickfire 14-ball 23 at the top laced with two sixes and as many fours.Chasing a below-par target, KKR raised their fifty in no time.Sunil Narine (21) perished shortly after the powerplay which brought the pair of Shreyas and Venkatesh together. They put on 97 runs for the third wicket to complete a comprehensive victory.Shreyas also had luck on his side as a paddle sweep off Viyaskanth Vijaykanth ricocheted off SRH keeper Heinrich Klaasen who went for the catch in the 10th over.But with short midwicket fielder Rahul Tripathi running in hard for it as well, Klaasen could not hold onto the ball despite having it in his grasp while nearly avoiding a collision.Soon after, the day went from bad to worse for SRH and Head who spilled a regulation catch off T Natarajan in the 11th over which gave the KKR skipper another lifeline.If Shreyas was content nurdling the ball around while putting the odd ball away for boundaries, Venkatesh outmatched his skipper with a rapid half-century which was completed off 28 balls.However, Shreyas overtook his younger partner to wrap up the game with a flurry of boundaries. Venkatesh, on his part, remained unbeaten on 51 off 28 balls with four sixes and five fours.Earlier, the lanky Australian speedster Starc reaped benefits of utilising his core skill of bowling quick and swinging the ball. He rattled the stumps of SRH marauder Head on the second ball of the contest to set the tone in KKR's favour.IPL's third highest run-getter Head was all over the place when he went for a wild heave against his compatriot, who got the ball nipping slightly away after pitching and knocking down the off and middle stumps to dismiss the batter for his second consecutive duck.Starc also bounced out Nitish Reddy (9) and had Shahbaz Ahmed (0) chopping one onto his wickets to put KKR in firm control inside the powerplay.With Head removed from the equation early, SRH pinned their hopes on Abhishek Sharma but the left-hander too was confined to having an unsuccessful outing.Abhishek, who has immaculately picked gaps and unleashed spectacular shots more often than not this season, played one meekly towards cover where Andre Russell timed his leap to perfection and used both his hands to complete the dismissal, off Vaibhav Arora.",Mitchell Starc takes three wickets as Kolkata Knight Riders reach IPL final. Sunrisers Hyderabad bowled out for just 159 in 19.3 overs. Captain Shreyas Iyer and Venkatesh Iyer lead KKR to comfortable win.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110312028,imgsize-56970,width-400,resizemode-4/110312028.jpg"

He knows how to manage and build a team. I really rate him high when it comes to the auction. However, there will be no auction for the Indian team,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.""Gautam Gambhir - the coach, Very strong personality. When there is a transition, a new captain is coming, then yes. However, if the team has a lot of seniors already, I will be a little wary because Gauti's style of working is almost like a strict father. When the father is strict, the children have to be a little careful,"" Chopra added.""When you have very senior players in the team, you are looking for a big brother who keeps his hand on their shoulders and doesn't try to impose himself. With Gautam that's not going to happen. It's very simple with him. My way or the highway. When it's 'my way' then every time, especially when seniors are there, things may not always fall your way. You can do that with young players. That is what I feel,"" Chopra said.Gambhir recently opened up on his outspoken attitude and pointed out it's in his nature to be aggressive.""I'm not breaking any rules. I want to be as aggressive as I can be. And what's wrong with that?,"" Gambhir said.""That's my nature.

NEW DELHI: Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru all-rounder Shane Watson issued a heartfelt apology to the franchise's fans for his performance in the 2016 IPL final in an event at the Presidency University in Bengaluru.Watson, who played for RCB in the 2016 and 2017 seasons after a successful stint with Rajasthan Royals from 2008 to 2015, reflected on the crucial match that saw RCB narrowly miss out on the IPL title.RCB had a remarkable turnaround in the second half of the 2016 season, making it to the playoffs and ultimately the final. However, their hopes were dashed by Sunrisers Hyderabad in the summit clash, where RCB's bowlers struggled, allowing SRH to post a formidable 208/7 in 20 overs.Watson was notably off his game, conceding 61 runs in his four overs without taking a wicket. His woes continued with the bat, where he managed only 11 runs off 9 balls, contributing to RCB's narrow 8-run defeat.""To all the RCB fans here tonight, I need to profusely apologize,"" Watson said.""The reason why I need to profusely apologize to RCB fans is because of the 2016 IPL final at the Chinnaswamy Stadium . I was prepared as well as I could be. I was hoping to perform my very best, but I had one of the worst performances when it comes to the bowling perspective in the final. And I most probably cost RCB winning that IPL.""Despite the disappointment in the final, Watson had an impressive season with the ball, finishing with 20 wickets at an average of under 25 in 16 matches. His overall contribution to RCB's campaign that year was significant, but the final performance left a lasting mark on him and the fans.Watson's candid apology highlights the pressure and emotional investment players have in the game, and his acknowledgment of the fans' disappointment shows his respect and dedication to the sport and its supporters.Also See: KKR vs SRH Live Score","Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru all-rounder Shane Watson apologizes to fans.

'Mumbai Indians did not...': Harbhajan Singh explains why Hardik Pandya failed as captain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/mumbai-indians-did-not-harbhajan-singh-explains-why-hardik-pandya-failed-as-captain/articleshow/110293917.cms,"|

NEW DELHI: The Mumbai Indians ' ( MI ) decision to reinstate all-rounder Hardik Pandya as captain backfired, according to former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh , who added that the team did not perform as a cohesive unit.For the five-time winners MI, the current Indian Premier League ( IPL ) season was one to forget. After a two-year tenure with Gujarat Titans (GT), where Pandya led the team to the title in their first season in 2022, MI brought Pandya back.However, the all-rounder and the team faced intense reaction on social media when Rohit Sharma was replaced as captain.With four wins, ten losses, and eight points, MI ended at the bottom of the standings and Pandya was jeered in stadiums around India during their matches. Pandya, who was instrumental in the team's success from 2015 to 21, was unable to produce game-winning efforts.Regarding MI's choice to reinstate Pandya, Harbhajan told ANI that it was a mistake that caused the team to become disunified. Additionally, he believed that a year later, this choice may have been made. But he asserted that Hardik is not at fault.""MI has a big team. I have played for it. The management is great and runs the team well. But this decision has backfired. Maybe the thinking was to look for the future. It seems that it did not sit well with the team as they did not look united. It was bound to happen. It pains me to see such a big team, an old team of mine face such poor results. Maybe the timing of the decision was not right. It could have been better had this decision been taken an year later. It is not Hardik's fault, he was captaining really well in GT. The duty of the senior players is to keep players united no matter who is the captain. Captains come and go. They did not play like a team,"" said Harbhajan to ANI.Pandya amassed 216 runs at an average of 18.00 and a strike rate of 143.04 in 14 games, with a career-high score of 46. In addition, he claimed 11 wickets at a dismal 35.18 average and a 10.75 economy rate.Fans, however, will anticipate seeing a different Pandya in the blue jersey for India when the ICC T20 World Cup begins on June 1 in the USA and the West Indies. Vice-captain Pandya, who is an all-rounder with a strong record in white-ball international cricket and a penchant to perform well under pressure, will be an important component of Rohit's Team India.India is paired with co-hosts the United States of America, Ireland, Canada, and bitter rivals Pakistan in Group A of the ICC competition.India's T20 World Cup campaign will kick off on June 5 against Ireland at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. Then, on June 9, the team will play their main match against Pakistan at the same stadium. India's next matches are against the USA on June 12 and Canada on June 15, respectively.(With ANI inputs)","MI's decision to reinstate all-rounder Hardik Pandya as captain backfired, says Harbhajan Singh.

We were very hungry to turn it around: Faf du Plessis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/we-were-very-hungry-to-turn-it-around-faf-du-plessis/articleshow/110286730.cms,"In an exclusive interview with TOI,

skipper

reveals the work that went into transforming the team from also-rans to title contenders

Excerpts:

What's the pressure of leading a fancied team which is yet to win an

title?

The start of the season was like a horror show for RCB. What is it that you think the team lacked?

How did you address the elephant in the room?

How did the support staff led by Mo Bobat and Andy Flower help?

Can you take us through the turnaround?

How did you deal with the players who were going through a lean phase?

If someone had said a few weeks back that you could mount a comeback like this without an all-rounder like Maxwell, would you have believed it?

The break seems to have done Maxwell a world of good…

Your thoughts on your bowlers' comeback?

So, the strategic move of dropping Siraj for a match worked well?

As a leader, when the chips are down, how do you keep the boat afloat?

You are nearing 40, what keeps you going, especially your electric presence as a fielder?

Irrespective of what happens in the Eliminator, how proud are you of this team?

BENGALURU: At the halfway mark of the Indian Premier League, few would have wagered on Royal Challengers Bengaluru making the playoffs of the world's most glamorous T20 tournament. Yet, RCB scripted one of the most stunning turnarounds by winning all their last six league matches to cement their place in the top-four.Pilloried for the team's performance in the first half, captain Faf du Plessis, a veteran of international and franchise cricket , remained stoic. He accepted defeat with grace, acknowledged his team's shortcomings, but also emphasised that giving up wasn't an option.With the Eliminator against former champions Rajasthan Royals in Ahmedabad looming, the 39-year-old du Plessis believes the job is still only half done. In an exclusive interview with TOI, his first this season, the South African spoke at length about his team's journey this season.Captaincy comes with a bit more than what's on your plate. I've been doing it for such a long time, I see that as an opportunity more than pressure. You're never going to get away from the fact that there's pressure, whether you're captaining a big franchise like RCB or a country like South Africa. But I've always loved doing it and I've enjoyed this experience. The last three years at RCB have been awesome for me to almost find a new purpose after captaining the Proteas. I've loved every minute.When you start a tournament, you do everything you can to make sure that you are prepared. And we did certainly do that. I feel like we ticked every single box. But you need some other things to fall into place. You need form, which always plays a big part at the beginning of a competition. You also need a bit of luck as injuries and stuff like that also play a role.There were a few guys in the team looking to find their best form. If you take from a batting perspective, it was only probably Virat (Kohli) at that stage who was in good form and scoring runs. There's always another guy or a third guy that's still scoring the runs and, in our case, we didn't have that. I was searching for runs, so were Rajat (Patidar), Maxi ( Glenn Maxwell ) and (Cameron) Greenie. So as a whole batting unit, we were just looking to find our best form. From a bowling perspective, guys like (Mohammed) Siraj were looking to find form. Siraj came into the competition having played a lot of red-ball cricket.When you lose a couple of games, then your confidence starts taking a little bit of a hit. And with the standard of the IPL being so high, you as an individual and as a team need to make sure that you're as close to your best to be able to perform as a team.In the middle of the season, I felt we needed to do some things better in terms of learning from our mistakes, not doing the same things over and over again. So, we changed our reviewing of games. We looked at our first few games from an analytical point of view. We made sure that we looked at the data, the numbers and the style of play that was successful at that stage. We looked at the best teams and analysed where we were. We were very clear in what we needed to do to become better. Form was the issue we wanted to fix and looking back, once that was worked out, it ensured a change of our fortunes. The confidence started coming back in the group and everyone started pulling in performances. It obviously turned into a miraculous turnaround where every single member in the team feels like they're contributing well.Andy and Mo were excellent. They were calm and optimistic that we were going to get it right.We were very hungry to turn it around and felt like we weren't far away from it. We just needed one game to get that confidence through the group. And once we had that first victory, it was like there was a shift in everyone's mindset and everyone was like, Ok, right, this is what we've been waiting for a very long time. And you look back six games ago now and you go, the cricket that we've played in the last six games has been nothing short of extraordinary.I'm a big believer in that we're not machines and so you're not always going to perform. I try to take the pressure off the performance element and just look at the person. You need to make sure that you put that person in an environment where he feels like he can bring out the best version of himself. There's also a level of trust that goes with that. I think if a player feels that he's backed and he's trusted, he will come good. I care for the guys in the group. So hopefully, they can see that.At the beginning of the tournament, if someone told me that Green, Maxwell, myself, Patidar, Siraj would be not performing in the first four games, I would have said that's not possible. There's no way I would have believed that. But obviously, guys came in at that stage, someone like Will Jacks had a real impact for us.We all know that Maxi is an unbelievable cricketer. Sometimes, form is not on your side and you fight so hard to try and get it back. Especially in a competition like this, you tend to go deeper into trying too hard and then it goes the other way. He had a nice break where he could just slowly find his mojo again off the field and start focusing on stripping it down to the basics of his game again and train in a way where there's no pressure on a game the next day. He's got a lot of experience, so he knows how to get there. I'm very optimistic that the backend of the tournament is where we're going to see Maxi thrive. He's obviously a guy who's been in big matches before and he's always been a guy who stands up in big games.Unbelievable. There's always so much (negative) talk about RCB bowlers, which I don't believe in it. Since coming into this team, there's not one thing here that works separately. It's us as a team. So, there's never going to be the bowlers or the batters who are to blame.In the beginning, the bowlers were struggling a bit. And then you need big characters who stand up. Yash Dayal this year has been tremendous. He's been consistent, carrying the bowling attack almost right through. And then it was like this wildfire that just spread confidence through the group. All the bowlers started to fire. We've bowled teams out two or three times, which in today's era, it's almost unheard of. The ability to get wickets for us has been a huge reason why we've done so well.Credit to Siraj's character. There was a point in the season where we felt that it was the right thing for him just to try someone else. And Siraj, as any big player would be in that position, was probably not expecting that. But for us, it was a brave call. And in hindsight, I think that was a good decision because what happened was one game on the bench and he came back absolutely firing with a point to prove. He's been excellent since then.Experience. That takes you through some difficult times when you're a little bit older. I've gone through the worst and the best. And in that, I've learned that it's important to stay the same in your highs and lows. So, whether you've got great success of winning the IPL or massive failures of crashing out of a tournament, I think what people look for is that calmness and consistency.Credit to the team owners as well for the way they handled situations. It was Game 7 or Game 8, I told them thank you for being so calm and positive. It's easy to be friendly and positive and upbeat and optimistic when a team is doing well. But you really measure whether it's a person's leadership or a group's leadership when things are going the opposite way.Being at the age of where I am, your mind plays probably the biggest factor in what you want to try and achieve. My mind still loves the game of cricket. I still want to try and get better. I still want to learn from the game. I don't feel I'm at that point where I'm just in cruise control. I really put a lot of work into my fitness and my body. I train differently from what I did when I was younger.I'm very proud. When we were one out of eight, I didn't hear one ounce of negativity from any of the players or staff. Everyone was still the same - caring and hoping for the best for each other. Everyone wants to win. Everyone wants to play and do well. But I tend to look at the other side of things. How can you make sure that you can create a good environment where people are enjoying their cricket and having fun? I'm having a great time with a great group of guys, who I am extremely proud of.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru have won all their last six league matches.

But that wasn't right. You just shouldn't expect sliding tackles,"" his former coach Jan Everse told public broadcaster NOS.""Silky"" and ""cultured"" are words often used to describe his playing style, and PEC Zwolle still employ the ""Arne Slot Pass"", said former team-mate Bram van Polen.The Arne Slot Pass is a slight deflection from a forward with his back to goal which splits the defence and releases a winger running off the ball.When Slot's name became linked to the Anfield job, Liverpool fans, looking for clues to their future boss' style, widely shared a rousing team talk he gave Feyenoord players after an historic victory at Ajax.""The reason why we are where we are today is because you work your ass off every single day. And that's the reason you could beat this team in their own stadium, without our fans being here,"" he told the dressing room.""But it's only a win. It's a big win, but we have a bigger goal this season than winning for the first time in 17 years in Amsterdam,"" Slot said to cheers from the team.Liverpool were not the first Premier League club to show interest in Slot. He was heavily linked with Tottenham during their troubled search to replace Antonio Conte in May 2023.As Spurs were reportedly about to seal the deal, Slot abruptly walked out, signing a new contract instead with Rotterdam-based Feyenoord.""The decisive factor was playing in the Champions League... the fact that I am having a great time privately and being able to build on the past two seasons,"" said the Dutchman at the time.Feyenoord's Champions League campaign got off to a strong start with a 2-0 home win against Celtic, but two defeats against Atletico Madrid sealed their fate, and they finished third in Group E.The British press have already dubbed Slot the ""Dutch Pep Guardiola"" for the high-pressing attacking style much beloved by Feyenoord fans.In several interviews, he has cited Guardiola as his role model, telling the Algemeen Dagblad (AD) last year: ""Players always look very good under him. And the same players seem worse with managers before and after him.""Slot certainly admires the legendary Spanish coach of Manchester City but will now face the task of trying to stop him from winning a record-extending fifth consecutive Premier League title next season.As a coach, Slot is known for a fierce work ethic, driving to Feyenoord's camp before dawn, watching every training session, and obsessively studying future opponents.""I say to Feyenoord: you have to ensure that you create four times as many chances as your opponent and work twice as hard,"" Slot told the AD.""In all the matches that we have won this season, we see in the data that we have run 20 or 30 percent more than the opposition. Matches we didn't win: only three or six percent more.""""Every training, every meeting must be spot on,"" he said.This has led to results for Feyenoord, seen as a team with physically fit players who work hard for each other and often score late goals.Slot appears to have cultivated this work ethic as a manager, rather than when he was a player.""He wants his boys to be fit... he didn't have that before. I don't know if he has ever seen the inside of a weights room,"" said former team-mate Van Polen.",Arne Slot was confirmed as Liverpool manager on Monday.

However, Novak Djokovic , the world number one, believes that Nadal remains the favorite to win the upcoming French Open.Djokovic, who is currently preparing for the tournament at the Geneva Open , acknowledged that Nadal faces increasing competition from younger players.Nevertheless, he emphasized that as long as the Spaniard is in the draw, he cannot be discounted.The Serbian star's comments highlight the immense respect and admiration he has for Nadal's achievements and abilities on the clay courts of Roland Garros .""This year is more open,"" French Open defending champion Djokovic told reporters at the Parc des Eaux-Vives grounds in Geneva.""Casper Ruud is surely one of the five players who are candidates to win. You have Alexander Zverev, Andrey Rublev, Stefanos Tsitsipas -- all the players who won a major tournament on this surface this year.""But when you talk about Roland-Garros and Nadal is there, he is always the biggest favourite for me.""After everything he has done on the courts at Roland-Garros, it's normal, respectfully, to put him as the biggest favourite.""Obviously it's a little different with his level of play. But it's Roland-Garros, and it's Nadal.""After that, maybe me, if I feel good, if I play well. At Roland-Garros, and all the Grand Slams, I am a bit of a different player.""Djokovic, on the cusp of his 37th birthday on Wednesday, made a last-minute decision to participate in the Geneva tournament by accepting a wild card entry.His aim is to reverse a concerning decline in his performance as he prepares to defend his title at the French Open, which commences next week.The Swiss clay court event, featuring a compact draw of 28 players, acts as the ultimate preparation for the prestigious Grand Slam tournament.Djokovic, who holds an impressive record of 24 Grand Slam titles, is facing an unusual situation this year. He will enter the French Open without having secured a single title in the season, a first since 2018. However, a victory in Geneva could change that narrative.While time has caught up with 37-year-old Nadal, Djokovic said he was hungry to keep playing at the top.""I'm searching for my highest possible level,"" he said.""It's not an obligation. It's truly my desire, my feeling, my passion, my love for tennis. That's the most important. I'm seeking to stay connected with that feeling.""Djokovic said he knew Geneva well as he has cousins in the Swiss city, though he has never played at the Geneva Tennis Club before.""At this moment, there is no better practice for me than match play. So I feel like I need more matches,"" he said.""That's the way for me to try to find the kind of form that I need for Roland-Garros.""Djokovic was at the Stade de Geneve on Monday to witness Young Boys winning a 17th Swiss football championship with a 1-0 victory over hosts Servette -- a team the Serb has a long-standing fondness for.Djokovic said one of his cousins was set to marry a Servette player -- French midfielder Timothe Cognat, according to Swiss media.Djokovic's best friend, and best man at his wedding, was defender Neven Markovic, who played for Servette from 2013 to 2015.""That's why I'm supporting the club,"" Djokovic said, jovially adding that Markovic could perhaps best be categorised as a ""very physical player"".""I'm not a football expert -- but he's a crazy guy,"" he said.",Novak Djokovic believes Rafael Nadal is the favorite to win the French Open. The world number one is currently preparing for the tournament at the Geneva Open.

Andy Murray comeback ends in Geneva defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/andy-murray-comeback-ends-in-geneva-defeat/articleshow/110306458.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: The highly anticipated possibility of another match between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic vanished on Tuesday as Murray exited the Geneva Open , marking his comeback from an ankle injury.Murray, playing on a wild card, was trailing 7-5, 4-1 against Yannick Hanfmann when a thunderstorm interrupted play at Parc des Eaux-Vives on Monday. Resuming on Tuesday, the German world number 85 swiftly concluded the match, taking the second set 6-2 in just over 10 minutes.Since Friday's draw, tennis enthusiasts had hoped for what could have been the final encounter between two members of the legendary Big Four—Djokovic, Murray, Rafael Nadal, and the retired Roger Federer—who have dominated men’s tennis for the past two decades.Instead, Hanfmann will face world number one Djokovic in the second round on Wednesday.Currently ranked 75th, the 37-year-old Murray, who plays with a metal hip, has indicated he may retire from competitive tennis within a few months. Nadal, similarly beset by injuries, is also nearing the end of his career and is uncertain about participating in the upcoming French Open .The Geneva match marked Murray’s first tour-level appearance since he injured tendons in his left ankle in Miami in March. The 28-man Swiss clay court tournament is a crucial preparation event for the French Open, the year’s second Grand Slam.Djokovic, who turns 37 on Wednesday, entered Geneva with a wild card to address a concerning slump in form ahead of defending his French Open title next week. The 24-time Grand Slam champion risks arriving in Paris without a title this season for the first time since 2018 unless he wins in Geneva.The Geneva draw also features Casper Ruud, the Norwegian world number seven, and other top 20 players such as Taylor Fritz , Ben Shelton, and Sebastian Baez .Murray and Djokovic last faced each other in the 2017 Doha final, where the Serbian emerged victorious.Murray, a former world number one and three-time Grand Slam champion, won the US Open in 2012 and Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016, with 11 Grand Slam final appearances. He also secured Olympic singles titles in 2012 and 2016.","Novak Djokovic will face Yannick Hanfmann in the second round of Geneva Open.

Rafael Nadal returns to Roland Garros to practice amid doubts over his fitness and future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/rafael-nadal-returns-to-roland-garros-to-practice-amid-doubts-over-his-fitness-and-future/articleshow/110288615.cms,"(Inputs from AP)

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal , the 14-time French Open champion, returned to Roland Garros to practice and assess his readiness for the upcoming tournament.The 37-year-old Spaniard arrived in the late afternoon with his coach, Carlos Moya, and a few sparring partners at the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, which was open to the public.Approximately 6,000 fans were present at the stadium, enthusiastically cheering as Nadal stepped onto the court.The practice session lasted around an hour and a half, after which Nadal signed several autographs before exiting through a doorway leading to the locker rooms.The training session allowed Nadal to familiarize himself with the red clay at Roland Garros, as he hasn't played a match there in two years, and to evaluate his physical condition. Nadal has been recovering from a hip injury that required surgery and has caused him to miss most of the 2023 season, as well as dealing with issues related to a hip muscle and an abdominal muscle.Nadal's recent loss to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open, with a score of 6-1, 6-3, left him uncertain about his readiness for the French Open. ""Let's see what's going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week,"" Nadal said in Rome. ""If I feel ready, I (am) going to try to be there and fight for the things that I have been fighting (for) the last 15 years, (even) if now (that) seems impossible.""As of Monday, Nadal had not yet announced his decision regarding his participation in the French Open. This is expected to be his final season on tour, making this potentially his last appearance at a tournament he has won more times than any other tennis player has won any Grand Slam title. Nadal won the French Open in 2022, securing his 22nd major championship overall, which is second only to Novak Djokovic 's 24. He missed the French Open last year due to his hip injury.","Rafael Nadal returns to Roland Garros to practice and assess his readiness for the French Open.

AITA adds Ramkumar in the mix for Bopanna’s Olympic partner choice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/aita-adds-ramkumar-in-the-mix-for-bopannas-olympic-partner-choice/articleshow/110280365.cms,"PUNE: The question of who would be Rohan Bopanna’s partner at the Paris Olympics got curiouser with the All India Tennis Association recommending Ramkumar Ramanathan ’s name out of turn for the TOPS programme.The latest list of tennis players to receive funding from the government towards preparation for the Paris Games comprises Bopanna (World No. 4 in doubles), Sumit Nagal (No.94 in singles) and Sriram Balaji (82 in doubles), besides Ramkumar (149 in doubles).It is reliably learnt that the Australian Open doubles champion Bopanna had suggested, at the AITA ’s instance in January, to include the two highest-ranked players for the purpose of TOPS funding and it would have been too early to identify a partner as such.Yuki Bhambri (ranked 60 at the end of January and currently 54) and Balaji (78 then), would have been the straightforward choice, with Ramkumar ranked outside the top-200.AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar said the 29-year-old Chennai lad’s name had been recommended keeping in mind his past success and service to the country as well as keeping the options open.“How do we know? Tomorrow Rohan might say he wants to play with Ram,” he said.Dhupar clarified that the AITA had forwarded a bunch of names, including that of Bhambri, to the Sports Authority of India (SAI).“We only recommend, the decision (as to whom to support) is with SAI. They directly deal with the players as to how much money each one gets,” he said.SAI did not respond to a detailed questionnaire on the issue despite repeated requests.‘FINAL DECISION WITH SELECTION COMMITTEE’Dhupar said the final decision as to who would be Bopanna’s partner will rest with the national selection committee.“The practice always has been that the player, who is confirmed by the ITF, will be asked about his choice and it will be discussed by the national selection committee. But it is the selection committee that takes the final call,” he said.Bopanna, who rose to World No. 1 after triumphing in Melbourne in the company of Matthew Ebden for his maiden Grand Slam success, chose to keep his cards close to the chest.“Once I go to Paris in the next couple of days, I will have a discussion with (coach) Scott (Davidoff) and then decide,” the 43-year-old Bopanna told TOI from Bengaluru.Yet, the choice could come down to Bhambri and Balaji considering they have been competing at a much higher level compared to the rest.“Yuki won (an ATP Tour title) in Munich and Bala won a 175 Challenger (beating Bhambri/Cabral and Erler/Miedler combinations on the way). Basically they are playing the ATP 250s,” Bopanna said.“Whoever the partner is, we will combine after Wimbledon (in the lead up to the Olympics). Playing on grass doesn’t make sense since it (tennis at the Paris Games) will be on clay,” he added.","AITA recommends Ramkumar Ramanathan’s name out of turn for TOPS programme. Sumit Nagal, Sriram Balaji and Rohan Bopanna also on list of tennis players to receive funding from the government towards preparation for Paris Games.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110280356,imgsize-144252,width-400,resizemode-4/110280356.jpg"
Rohan Bopanna to pair with either Balaji or Yuki Bhambri at Paris Games,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/rohan-bopanna-to-pair-with-either-balaji-or-yuki-bhambri-at-paris-games/articleshow/110274314.cms,"(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: India's top doubles player, Rohan Bopanna , will choose either N Sriram Balaji or Yuki Bhambri as his partner for the Paris Olympics , with the All India Tennis Association (AITA) likely to approve his choice, although the selection committee will discuss the combinations.Ranked fourth in the world, the 44-year-old Bopanna, being a top-10 player, is allowed to choose his partner according to the rules.The men's doubles draw at the Paris Games will feature 32 teams, with each nation allowed a maximum of two teams.The qualification criteria permit top-10 players to select partners ranked within the top 300 on the ATP and WTA ranking charts.The rankings as of June 10, after the conclusion of the French Open, will be considered for qualifications.According to AITA sources, Bopanna has recommended Balaji and Bhambri to the national federation for inclusion in the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) as his potential partners for the Paris Olympics.""Usually, it's the player's choice (to pick his partner). The selection committee will ask him about his choice and discuss that. Whoever Rohan wants to play with, will be considered positively,"" AITA Secretary General Anil Dhupar told PTI when asked if the national federation will allow Bopanna to play with the partner of his choice or impose its own choice on him.Both Balaji and Bhambri have got some decent results on clay in lead up to the Roland Garros, where the action will unfold during the Summer Olympics from July 27.Balaji won the Cagliari Challenger event with German partner Andre Begemann apart from reaching the semifinals at Francavilla al Mare in Italy.Bhambri won the ATP 250 event in Munich with French player Albano Olivetti in April and reached the semifinals of the Bordeaux Challenger -- the only event he competed this month.The nominations for Olympics or other multi-sporting events have often created controversy in Indian tennis. In 2012, a huge controversy had erupted when both Mahesh Bhupathi and Bopanna had refused to pair with Leander Paes, who was forced to play with Vishnu Vardhan.Sania Mirza was then asked to pair with Paes in the mixed doubles event and the top woman player of the country had chastised the AITA for using her as bait to placate Paes.In the 2018 Asian Games, Paes had pulled out of the continental event just two days before the start of tennis competition, saying he was not given a specialist player to pair with. AITA had nominated Bopanna and Divij Sharan as a team, leaving Paes with no option but to pair with one of the singles players in the squad.It will be Bopanna's last shot at wining an Olympic medal, having come close to a bronze medal with Sania Mirza in the mixed event of the 2016 Rio Games.In the singles, Sumit Nagal will need a good run at the French Open to boost his ranking. He is placed 94 as of Monday.In a draw of 64, the organisers will accept 56 direct entries and out of six ITF places, three men's quotas have been awarded to winners of continental events -- Asian Games, African Games and Pan-American Games.","Rohan Bopanna will choose either N Sriram Balaji or Yuki Bhambri as his partner for the Paris Olympics.
