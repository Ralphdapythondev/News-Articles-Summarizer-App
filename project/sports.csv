'If your body supports you... ': Saina Nehwal on PV Sindhu's chances at 2028 Los Angeles Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/saina-nehwal-on-pv-sindhus-chances-at-2028-los-angeles-olympics/articleshow/112454286.cms,"FOURTH-PLACE FINISH 'PAINFUL'

NEW DELHI: Among Indian athletes, badminton queen PV Sindhu was a prominent medal contender heading into the Paris Olympics. Having previously won a silver at the Rio Games and a bronze at the Tokyo Games, Sindhu was expected to secure a podium finish and become the first Indian athlete to win three individual Olympic medals.However, things didn’t go as planned.The 29-year-old shuttler reached the Round of 16 but was defeated by China’s He Bingjiao in straight games, 21-19, 21-14.Will Sindhu make a strong comeback at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028? She will be 33 when the Games commence.India’s 2012 London Olympics bronze medalist Saina Nehwal believes Sindhu’s future performance will largely depend on her fitness.""Sindhu played well. Bingjiao was a little better. It’s not just about the desire or the will to play; it’s about how your body will support you as you grow older. If your body supports you, you can play for as long as you want,"" Nehwal told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Sindhu and Nehwal are the only Indian badminton players to have won Olympic medals (one silver and two bronze).Lakshya Sen came close to securing a medal in Paris but lost a tough bronze medal match against Malaysia’s Lee Zii Jia.""Sindhu and I performed well for many years and did our best to popularise badminton in India. We definitely see more young boys (like Lakshya Sen) coming up and doing well. However, progress on the girls' side is taking some time, but I believe we will see more players emerging in the future who can achieve success,"" Nehwal said.Despite India’s six medals in Paris, falling short of the Tokyo Games' tally of seven, many athletes came agonizingly close to winning medals.Shooter Manu Bhaker finished fourth in 25m Pistol, Arjun Babuta was fourth in 10m Air Rifle, archers Dhiraj and Ankita finished fourth in the mixed team event, Anant Jeet and Maheshwari were fourth in the skeet mixed team event, Lakshya Sen lost the bronze medal match, and Mirabai Chanu also finished fourth in weightlifting.Nehwal described these fourth-place finishes as 'painful' but praised Manu for winning two medals at the Paris Games.""Missing out on a medal is definitely disappointing, but as athletes, it's our job to get back to training and look forward to the next Olympics. I know it’s painful because you prepare for four years, and sometimes luck isn’t on your side. It’s definitely tough, but we have to work hard and try again,"" Nehwal said.""I met Manu in January this year, and she was quite sure she would win a medal this time. She achieved that, so hats off to her confidence and preparation. I can only congratulate her on the medals and hope she can add one more to her tally in future Olympics,"" she said.Nehwal also supported providing medal-winning athletes with government/corporate jobs for financial stability and security.""Support from corporates through job opportunities helps sustain budding talent in their careers, so they don’t have to worry about making a living. I’m proud to be employed by BPCL, which has a history of nurturing talent and has inducted over 200 sportspersons across various disciplines,"" Nehwal said.On BPCL's support for sportspersons, a company spokesperson added, ""Consistent with BPCL's philosophy of nurturing and encouraging our country's sporting talent, we have taken on board over 200 sportspersons across various disciplines over the years. Our support helps build their confidence and serves as a springboard for their aspirations.""",Sindhu was expected to become first Indian athlete to win three individual Olympic medals. The 29-year-old reached the Round of 16 but was defeated by China’s He Bingjiao. Nehwal described these fourth-place finishes as 'painful' but praised Manu for winning two medals.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112454310,imgsize-53534,width-400,resizemode-4/112454310.jpg"
"6 medals, 0 gold: India's haul sub-par at Paris Olympics but it's not all gloom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/6-medals-0-gold-indias-haul-sub-par-at-paris-olympics-but-its-not-all-gloom/articleshow/112454424.cms,"84 nations won medals in Paris, India at No. 71

As curtains fell on Paris Olympics on Sunday, Indian fans were left with a mixed feeling over the country's performance. For a nation of 1.4bn people, our return of one silver and five bronze is very meagre. That the world's most populous country couldn't produce a single gold medal is hard to digest.However, if we look at India's showing in the past Summer Games, the Paris tally isn't too bad.Yes, we couldn't better our 2020 Tokyo haul of seven (one gold, two silver, four bronze) but we did much better than in Rio 2016, when our medal count was just two.The performance, especially in badminton, boxing and archery was disappointing, as medals were expected. Still, there is a flicker of hope -there were six fourth-place finishes. Besides, Vinesh Phogat 's disqualification meant India lost a gold or a silver.What may rankle is the fact that our elite athletes now get the facilities that they want - the best training, good exposure and medical support. While at the grassroots level, sport still craves for attention and support, the govt does make things easy for top athletes to train, prepare and perform.For preparing the contingent for Paris Olympics, the Union govt spent Rs 470 crore over the last three years. This is significantly more than what used to be the figure earlier.Looking at the break-up, the highest amount was spent on athletics (Rs 96.08 crore) followed by badminton (Rs 72.02 crore), boxing (Rs 60.93 crore) and shooting (Rs 60.42 crore). All 16 disciplines in which India participated in Paris got funds.But another number makes it look dismal - 84 countries won medals in Paris and India were placed at 71 in the table. Certainly, not flattering. Those who have a stake in Indian sport must feel the pinch.Abhinav Bindra , India's first individual Olympic gold medallist, called the Indian contingent's show 'commendable'. ""It's been a spirited performance. All our athletes have performed at a high level,"" he said.Encouraging words indeed. The problem is that while we improve, the world improves too. The powerhouse nations keep trying to get better and fringe countries keep producing surprise champions. The competition at this level is relentlessly high quality. The challenge is enormous.The likes of Manu Bhaker , Sarabjot Singh and Aman Sehrawat give optimism a youthful boost. More of their ilk are welcome.","India won one silver and five bronze at the Paris Olympics. 84 countries won medals in Paris, India at No. 71 in the table.

From Vinesh Phogat to Manu Bhaker: The roller-coaster ride at Paris Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/from-vinesh-phogat-to-manu-bhaker-the-roller-coaster-ride-at-paris-olympics/articleshow/112455142.cms,"From a worried Vinesh to Nadeem's travelling javelin to the twinkling eyes of Manu, it has been a roller-coaster ride

PARIS: It started with incessant rain on the night of July 26, right next to the gloriously lit Eiffel Tower. It was an opening ceremony like no other. You watched it on big screens as the athletes and officials cruised on boats on the river Seine, waving at the spectators standing in hordes at the riverside.Drenched to the bones in open stands, you watched Zinedine Zidane run into the Trocadero arena with the Olympic flame to deafening applause and hand it over to Rafael Nadal .The Olympic cauldron was finally lit with a burning arrow. It was a spectacle to remember.Then days went by in a blur. It was competition time. The real deal. You got sucked into it. The daily rides in the Metro were the same, the food at the Olympic venues was the same, at every venue! But the action inside every arena had its distinct flavour. It was an emotional roller-coaster ride.For me, the strongest image of Paris 2024, which ended on Sunday, was that of Vinesh Phogat sitting inside the Games Village, deep in thought, after entering the final of 50kg freestyle wrestling. She had fought bravely that day, had beaten the world champion on the way. But she was worried. Not about her American opponent in the final, but her weight. She was 2.7kg overweight and had to shed it overnight. The weigh-in was early morning and it was not going to be easy.She missed it by a mere 100g. That must have weighed like a ton on every Indian's mind. Vinesh was severely dehydrated, mentally a wreck. She has healed physically by now. The mind is another matter.The other image is that of Pakistan 's Nadeem Arshad 's javelin throw that travelled 92.97m at the Stade de France. And how it ended India's hopes of a gold medal repeat in the event. Neeraj Chopra , fighting a groin niggle, had a fantastic throw of 89.45m himself. But there was no way he was going to catch up. There will be another time when Neeraj undergoes surgery and returns to action fitter than he has been in years.Gold and silver. It is massive. The greatest sportsperson of India, ever? Yes, without doubt, and Neeraj is just 26.The train journeys to Chateauroux - 300km south of Paris - will certainly stay in memories - getting up at 4am to catch the train from Paris-Austerlitz and reaching the shooting ranges bleary-eyed. It was made worthwhile by the smiling, twinkling eyes of shooter Manu Bhaker who created history there. She won back-to-back bronze medals and came very close to winning another. No Indian has two medals in the same Games. She has raised the bar. She is just 22, so will surely be back for more.Manu's second medal came in the company of Sarabjot Singh in the mixed 10m air pistol event.Shooting gave us another bronze medal. Swapnil Kusale won it in the 50m rifle 3P event. While the buzz over Manu's two medals had not yet died down, Swapnil, 29, quietly went about his business and pleasantly surprised us all.The hockey bronze was special. They had won it in Tokyo and wanted it again. They won it by beating Spain 2-1. Ten of the team were part of the Tokyo bunch which had got India a hockey medal after 41 years. They knew how to win it.They lost a very close match to Germany in the semifinals. It could have gone either way. It could have broken their confidence. But for them, there was no time to look back. They said they wanted to win a medal for their 36-year-old goalkeeper PR Sreejesh who was playing his farewell match for India. They won it in style. It was after 52 years that India had won back-to-back hockey medals.On the penultimate day, 21-yearold wrestler Aman Sehrawat won us a bronze. It gave some solace after Vinesh's lost medal. Aman has had a difficult life, having lost both his parents by the age of 11. Wrestling saved him from going astray, gave him a purpose in life. He is giving back to the sport and the country. Those close to him say he rarely smiles. After the medal, post the press conference, while posing for a selfie, he smiled. It went straight to the heart.There were six fourth-place finishes for India at the Games: Arjun Babuta in men's 10m air rifle shooting; Dhiraj Bommadevara and Ankita Bhakat in mixed team archery; Mirabai Chanu in weightlifting; Anant Jeet Singh & Maheshwari Chauhan in mixed skeet event; Manu Bhaker in women's 25m pistol and Lakshya Sen in men's singles badminton. Six medals could have very well been 12. And such is the world of sport.Reflecting on India's performance one realized that the city had grown on you. You were reminded of those quick walks out of the competition arenas to enjoy food at the corner café. You were reminded of the volunteers here who made your workplace more comfortable.You were reminded of the croissants at the Chateauroux station, which simply melted in the mouth. You were also reminded of the smiling, welcoming faces of the Sri Lankan Tamils running the provisional store just next to your rented apartment in Belleville.It is time to go home now, with a bag full of memories. Au revoir Paris.","The Games have been an emotional roller-coaster ride for India. Vinesh Phogat, Nadeem Arshad and Swapnil Kusale have all impressed. Manu Bhaker and Amanhrawat have raised the bar for Indian athletes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112455120,imgsize-42542,width-400,resizemode-4/112455120.jpg"
'No rule more unfair for a player than...': Ravichandran Ashwin strongly opposes reintroduction of this IPL auction rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/no-rule-more-unfair-for-a-player-than-ravichandran-ashwin-strongly-opposes-reintroduction-of-this-ipl-auction-rule/articleshow/112453507.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has voiced strong criticism against the Right to Match (RTM) rule ahead of its potential reinstatement in the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) auction. The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is considering bringing back the RTM rule as they prepare for the IPL 2025 auction later this year. This possibility has ignited debates among players and franchise owners.Recently, the BCCI held a ""constructive dialogue"" with the owners of the ten IPL franchises to address various issues.As per an ANI report, among the topics discussed were the idea of holding mega auctions every five years instead of the current three-year cycle, the reintroduction of the RTM card, the availability of overseas players, and a cap on the number of player retention.Ashwin, speaking on his YouTube channel, criticized the RTM rule, arguing that it is unfair to players as it prevents them from receiving their true market value. According to Ashwin, the rule creates a scenario where the original team benefits at the expense of other bidding franchises and the player involved.""There is no rule more unfair for a player than RTM,"" Ashwin stated. ""The problem with RTM is that it does not give fair value to the player. For example, if a player's value has gone up during the auction due to competitive bidding, the original team can simply match the highest bid without contributing to the increase. This leaves the player without the opportunity to achieve their true market worth.""The RTM rule allows teams to reclaim a player who represented them in the previous season by matching the highest bid placed by another franchise. While this rule has been used in the past to retain valuable players, it was removed in the 2021 mega auction to provide new franchises such as Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants a broader pool of players to choose from.Ashwin emphasized that while the original team may be satisfied with the outcome, other franchises and the player himself may feel shortchanged by the process. He argued that this undermines the integrity of the auction and prevents players from getting their deserved compensation.""This leaves the player without the opportunity to achieve their true market worth,"" he reiterated, stressing that the rule benefits the original team disproportionately.The discussions between the BCCI and franchise owners are ongoing, and the final decision on the reinstatement of the RTM rule will significantly impact the dynamics of the upcoming IPL auction.",The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is considering bringing back the RTM rule as they prepare for the IPL 2025 auction later this year.

Instead, Usha believes that the responsibility falls on Phogat's coach and support staff.In a statement released on Sunday, the IOA stressed that the responsibility of weight management in sports like wrestling, weightlifting, boxing, and judo lies squarely with each athlete and their personal coaching team.The IOA made it clear that athletes and their coaches are accountable for ensuring that they meet the required weight categories in these sports, IANS reported.""The Indian Olympic Association president (IOA), PT Usha has clarified that the responsibility of weight management of athletes in sport like wrestling, weightlifting, boxing and judo is that of each athlete and his or her coach and not that of the IOA-appointed Chief Medical Officer Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala and his team.""Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala and his team were recruited by the IOA several months prior to the commencement of the Games, as explained by Usha. The main responsibility of Dr Pardiwala's team was to provide support in the recovery process and manage any injuries sustained by the athletes during and following their competitive events.Furthermore, the IOA medical team was put in place to offer assistance to athletes who lacked access to their own personal team of nutritionists and physiotherapists. This ensured that all athletes had the necessary support to maintain their health and well-being throughout the duration of the Games.""The IOA appointed a medical team a couple of months ago, primarily as a team that would assist in the recovery and injury management of athletes during and after their competition.

Manu Bhaker: India's History-maker At Paris Olympics 2024

It won't be easy to judge India's campaign at the Paris Olympics. Can we term it a successful one or not? Purely speaking about the number of medals won, India failed to match the tally from the last edition in Tokyo. It won six medals in this edition, in comparison to seven in Tokyo three years ago, which was the best medal haul for the country ever in its Olympic history.With the biggest contingent ever, 117 athletes, India went to Paris with the expectation of touching the double-digit medal tally for the first time.It was a long shot, but there was hope.India started well, with shooter Manu Bhaker winning a bronze in women's 10m air pistol on Day 2 of the competition on July 28. Two days later, Bhaker created history by becoming first Indian to win multiple medals at an Olympic edition, post independence, when she partnered with Sarabjot Singh for a bronze in mixed team 10m air pistol event on July 30.The hope for a double-digit medal tally was further ignited when Swapnil Kusale won India's first medal in rifle 3P event. Kusale struck bronze in men's 50m rifle three position on August 1. Three shooting medals was a great start after the sport drew blank in the last two editions in Rio and Tokyo.But India endured a long medal drought in the next seven days, which left India's hope of touching double digit figures in tatters. From there on, the race was to match the Tokyo success if not bettering it.It had a few medal prospects line-up for the last five days of action. Neeraj Chopra was there, the hockey team was still in, weightlifter Mirabai Chanu and wrestlers were also in contention.On the 11th day of the competition,Vinesh Phogat assured India a medal by becoming the first female Indian wrestler to enter the final. But it was followed by devastating news the very next day, when the grappler was disqualified for being 100g overweight for her 50 kg freestyle final. It was a big jolt for the country as a sure shot medal was wiped out. The IOA and the wrestler have filed an appeal for a silver medal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), whose verdict is now expected by August 13.A day before the Vinesh fiasco, the Indian hockey team lost its semi-final against Germany, leaving them to compete for bronze again. And to add more misery, India's lone weightlifter in Paris, Saikhom Mirabai Chanu, a Tokyo Olympic silver medallist, missed out on a medal by finishing fourth in the 49kg event.The next day, August 8, was a very important one for India as its biggest gold-medal prospect, defending champion Neeraj Chopra, was competing in the javelin throw final.The day started well for India. Before the big javelin final, the Indian hockey team beat Spain 2-1 to win successive bronze medals at the Games. It was the first back-to-back medals for the hockey team in 52 years.In the big javelin final, Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem outclassed the entire field with an Olympic record throw of 92.97m in his second attempt. Tokyo gold medalist Neeraj Chopra responded with a season best throw of 89.45m soon after Nadeem's monstrous attempt. But Neeraj failed to improve his mark and had to settle for a silver in the end.The two medals on August 8 took India's tally to five - one silver and four bronze.On the same day, young wrestler Aman Sehrawat lost his semifinal bout and his bronze match the next day was one of the few medal prospects left for the country at the Games. Sehrawat did not disappoint and won an emphatic bout to become the youngest Indian medalist at 21 on August 9.India's campaign ended on the penultimate day of the Paris Olympics, after wrestler Reetika Hooda went out of medal contention.So the final count for India is six medals - one silver and five bronze. Quite short from their initial ambition of a double-digit figure and a bit behind their best outing ever in Tokyo.So, was it a flop show for India or is there progress despite not improving the medal tally?Abhinav Bindra , India's first individual Olympic gold medallist, praised the Indian contingent for their commendable performance.""I think it's been a spirited performance. All our athletes have performed at a high level,"" Bindra told IANS, emphasizing the significance of their efforts. ""We may have six medals to show on our tally, but if you really go in-depth into performances, we have never had a Games where our athletes have been so competitive across disciplines, many of them have been close to medaling.""It's true, India had quite a few near misses in Paris. It had as many as six fourth place finishes in addition to Vinesh's disqualification. So, seven more medals were in touching distance for Indian athletes this time around. If only two of them had converted into medals, India would have had their best haul ever.So, Bindra is not wrong. Indian athletes have competed at a very high level across disciplines and were very close to medalling too. Hence, we can't call it a total disaster as there are quite a few improvements. But being the world's most populous country and with ever improving facilities for various sports, the number of medals expected and won by the Indian athletes at the Games are still far behind the world standards.","India failed to match the tally from the last edition in Tokyo.

NURSERY OF MEDALLISTS: Budding wrestlers train at the Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi on Saturday

""Ek mann mein tees thi

Yahan ki mitti mein kuch alag baat hai

It's 5 pm, dusk is settling in. Wrestlers from different age-groups are trickling in at the Chhatrasal Akhada for their evening training. They stay at the adjoining sports hostel. Coaches Jaibir Dahiya, Anil Mann and Pradeep Dahiya are waiting for them.Each one does the customary knee-touch of their gurus, before going for their warm-ups. The young boys are quite excited.There's a broad smile on each of them.A week ago, one among them had taken a flight to Paris. On Friday, he became an Olympic bronze medal winner for the country. No wonder, everyone at the wrestling academy on Saturday was talking about Aman Sehrawat. Chhatrasal Akhada isn't new to such highs.Three years ago, Chhatrasal trainees Ravi Dahiya (silver) and Bajrang Punia (bronze) won Olympic medals in Tokyo. India has eight Olympic medals in wrestling till now, 6 have come from Chhatrasal. It started with Sushil Kumar, who won bronze in 2008 Beijing & then followed with a silver in '12 London.Sushil Kumar, trained in this Chhatrasal Akhada, won bronze in 2008 Beijing and then followed with a silver in 2012 London. At the same London Games, Yogeshwar Dutt bagged a bronze for the country. It was Satpal Singh - also known as Guru Satpal among his wards - who is the founder of the academy and had trained the Sushil-Yogeshwar duo.Back in 1988, Satpal, along with two more wrestling coaches - Ramphal Mann, a.k.a. Guru Ramphal, and Pradeep Sharma - started the akhada on the premises ofChhatrasal Stadium in 1988. The stadium is in Model Town area of Delhi and is located somewhere between the Model Town and Azadpur metro stations. Over the years, the three coaches got help from another famed wrestling coach Virender Kumar in running the akhada.During his days as a wrestler, Satpal emerged as one of India's premier wrestlers, winning the national title 16 times. On the international stage, Satpal won silver at the 1974, 1978 and 1982 Commonwealth Games. At the Asian Games , he continuously upgraded the colour of his medal, winning bronze in Tehran 1974, silver in Bangkok 1978 and finally a gold in New Delhi 1982 in front of a home crowd. During this playing days, Satpal also represented India at two Olympic Games - Munich 1972 and Moscow 1980. But he failed to win a medal.(there was a pain in my heart of not winning an Olympic medal). That's why I started the akhada at the Chhatrasal Stadium. I wanted to churn out Olympic medallists for the country,"" Satpal tells TOI. ""Now we have produced not one, but six Olympic medallists.""When I went for the Olympics, I had never even seen a mat, practising on it was something totally different. The European countries, by that time, had been wrestling on mats for years. I wanted to change that. I wanted to give our young wrestlers an equal opportunity to fight at the international level. We got our first mat at the Chhatrasal Akhada in 1992. Sushil, who was a 15-year-old at that time, trained on the mat and won a gold at the World Cadet Games in 1998,"" Satpal, now 69, adds.There are budding wrestlers training at the Chhatrasal not only from Delhi, Haryana and its adjoining areas, but there are some who have come from as far as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. One of them, Dhanraj, who hails from Maharashtra, says, ""(There is something different here). That's why I have come here to train.""When you enter the premises of the akhada, there are giant-sized photos of Sushil, Ravi, Yogeshwar, Bajrang on the walls. The Chhatrasal Akhada is to wrestling what Sansarpur in Jalandhar, Punjab, is to hockey or what Azad Maidan in Mumbai is to cricket.The wrestling academy has now become a state-of-the-art facility where there is modernity in terms of equipment, but tradition is followed when it comes to the guru-shishya (master-pupil) relationship. There are many cadet-level, youth-level, and also senior-level wrestlers training at the same time, under the same roof, and their motivation is the same. ""I want to win an Olympic medal and make my country proud,"" says Mohit Dahiya, 15, who recently won at the Youth Asian championship level.""I want to emulate Sushil pehelwaan , Ravi pehelwaan, Aman pehelwaan. They are my heroes. I know if I train well and listen to my coach, then I can also win medals at the Olympic stage,"" adds 16-year-old Deepanshu. What makes the akhada so special? One of the present coaches, Jaibir Dahiya, who himself trained here in the 1990s under Satpal, Ramphal and Pradeep, says, ""When you train in the mud, you become really tough as a wrestler. That is where your foundation is made.""Training in mud helps budding wrestlers attain real strength. Movement in the mud is tough and therefore wrestlers need to use extra force. So, when they are put on the mat, they suddenly find themselves moving faster and are more agile. All because of the hours they put in mud,"" he adds. Nowadays, the akhada gets scores of applications. Many youngsters want to train under the coaches at the Chhatrasal. So how are the selections made?""It's trials. Only those who we think can have a future in wrestling are enrolled. Our training is very hard and rigorous, and we push the young ones to their limits. Our aim is to ensure medals for the country, that's why the preparation - right from a young age - is very robust,"" says Anil Mann, another coach, who used to be a trainee.There is a small temple outside the living quarters. Before their daily routine, wrestlers pray to Lord Hanuman - the favoured deity of the wrestling community - and ask for strength.Before we leave, coach Jaibir points towards five-six young wrestlers and says, ""These ones will win Olympic medals in future, I can guarantee you.""","Chhatrasal Akhada is a state-of-the-art facility where there is modern equipment in terms of equipment. India has eight Olympic medals in wrestling till now, 6 have come from the academy.

Kieron Pollard of Southern Brave delivered a match-winning performance by hitting Rashid Khan of Trent Rockets for five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday. His explosive batting helped Southern Brave to chase down a target of 127, achieving victory with just one ball to spare at the Rose Bowl in Southampton.Pollard's game-changing performance began when Brave needed 49 runs off the last 20 balls.Rashid Khan had been economical with figures of 1/10 from his first 15 deliveries, but Pollard dismantled his bowling in a single over.Pollard smashed the first two balls over cow corner and the long-off region, followed by a straight hit back over Rashid's head with the third ball. A powerful shot over deep mid-wicket came next, and Pollard topped off the over with a final six over long-off. This assault reduced the runs required to 19 off 15 balls.Despite being dismissed shortly after his blitz, Pollard’s rapid 45 off 23 balls had already shifted the momentum in Southern Brave's favor. The team ultimately won the contest by two wickets with just one ball remaining.Earlier in the game, Tom Banton top-scored for Trent Rockets with 30 runs, helping his team to post a competitive total of 126/8.Reflecting on his performance against Rashid Khan, Pollard acknowledged their shared history and familiarity with each other's play.""I've played a lot against him, and he's gotten me out many times. But I knew the lines and lengths he was likely to bowl,"" Pollard said.""I just backed myself - if he bowled short, I was going across; if he went full, I was going to hit straight. He bowled three fuller balls, and they were right in my arc. At that point, I couldn't hold back, I had to go for maximums. But Rashid is a world-class bowler; we've played a lot against each other,"" he added.Pollard's performance not only secured a crucial victory for Southern Brave but also underscored his reputation as one of the most formidable hitters in the sport.","Kieron Pollard hit five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday.

""Full credit must go to him though for the way he played. I just tried to stick to my plans and utilize different angles from the crease.""During the morning session, Tristan Stubbs led South Africa’s charge for quick runs with an aggressive 68 off 50 balls, featuring six fours and two sixes.

""In the end we just didn't have enough time, plus the elements got in the way of what could have been a really good competitive game of cricket.""West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite, who fell in the first over of the innings to an ambitious shot off Maharaj, expressed his belief that his team could have chased down the target.

The Sri Lankan spinners dominated the proceedings, exploiting the conducive conditions to their advantage.Out of the 30 Indian wickets that fell during the three-match series, an astonishing 27 were claimed by the hosts' spin bowlers, highlighting their effectiveness on the turning tracks.This series loss marks the first time in 27 years that India has been defeated by Sri Lanka in a bilateral ODI series.""It's been a tough pitch to play spin in this series, let's admit that first. Be it Virat Kohli, be it Rohit Sharma , or be it anyone else. With the slightly semi-new ball between overs about 8 to 30, it's been hard work (for batters).""It's nothing to worry about. Not too many pitches work that way, but it's been a tough pitch to play spinners. I'm not going to defend Virat Kohli here, but I can tell you that playing spin was very hard,"" said Karthik in a video on Cricbuzz, as quoted by IANS.Karthik also emphasized the positives for India from the series, which they can leverage in the future, particularly in the lead-up to the 2025 Champions Trophy.""The biggest positive is the fact that India played all-rounders and bravely attacked. So that is something I really like, that is one. Number two, Riyan Parag , in his limited opportunities, is showing what he can do with the ball, which is again a small plus for us.""""Other than that, I think Rohit's batting is itself. The way he starts in powerplay. He is making batting look too easy in the series. Batted beautifully. These were the positives for me from this series.Karthik discussed why Indian batters struggle when facing spin on slow pitches. ""When you first end up playing international cricket, you end up playing a lot more quality fast-bowling. But the truth is, when every team ends up playing three fast-bowlers, and at times, four of them with just one spinner or sometimes two, we play on slow turning pitches, which doesn't happen too often.""So, when you come from domestic cricket and go into international cricket, you focus on playing fast-bowling and hence, it is understandable of players losing their quality to play spin bowling over a period of time.""Karthik signed off by terming what should the IPL mega auction system ahead of 2025 season.""I feel four to five (retentions) is a good number, but one or two Right to Match is also a very good option. But one small change in the Right to Match option is, once the player is bid for and the right to match option is used, I think bidding can still go on.""If the team which has won the first bid believe they have something in their kitty to bid for that player, in that way, the player will get fair money, and the bidding has to happen between the team which has used the Right to match, and the team which has bid for him until then to get that player.""","Dinesh Karthik says there is no cause for concern about Virat Kohli's form. Former India wicketkeeper-batter says it's been a tough pitch to play spin in this series. India lost the series 2-0, the first time in 27 years that they have been beaten by Sri Lanka.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112445004,imgsize-46608,width-400,resizemode-4/112445004.jpg"

Arshad Ayub and Venkatapathy Raju were bowling. They were very good and me and Sachin had a long partnership,"" news agency PTI quoted Vengsarkar as saying.Vengsarkar added that Tendulkar’s performance on the turning track hinted at his potential for a successful career in cricket.“He was going so well on a turning track. I thought he was going to go places and that is what happened,” he said.Vengsarkar, the former chairman of selectors, also dug out a nugget from that famous Ranji Trophy final between Mumbai and Haryana in 1991.“There was this match in 1991 against Haryana — the Ranji Trophy final — and the way he batted…we were chasing 355 and we were 22 for three wickets (34/3).“The way he played in that innings was absolutely brilliant. We could have won the game had he stayed there a couple of overs more,” said Vengsarkar, who made a valiant 139 while Tendulkar scored 96.In one of the most memorable Ranji Trophy finals, the domestic giants Mumbai lost the final by a mere two runs against Kapil Dev-led Haryana.Vengsarkar also remembered that former India skipper Sourav Ganguly, who made his ODI debut in January 1992, was initially picked as a ‘fourth seamer' during the tour of Australia.“On that tour he was selected as the fourth seamer and he was asked to go to the nets. After two deliveries, he said ‘I am not a bowler and I want to bat'.“Ganguly was told that he was picked as the fourth seamer. But he did not get opportunities on that tour. After a few years, he was picked for the tour of England,” he said.Vengsarkar also praised former India skipper and T20 World Cup-winning coach Rahul Dravid for the gradual improvement he made as a player.“Every batsman must improvise. You cannot bat in the first gear all the time. You have to bat in the second, third and the fourth gear. As the years passed by, Rahul improved tremendously and was one of the best batsmen in the world,” Vengsarkar said.The Mumbaikar also recalled VVS Laxman's 281 against Australia in Kolkata in 2001 was ‘important' as it changed India's mentality.“It was very important because India won against Australia.

It was a really big opportunity for us to win that series. Some of our senior players were not there.""Dravid shared that several senior players, including Rohit Sharma , missed the series. Despite this, India managed to compete closely with the Proteas in both matches. However, South Africa ultimately limited India to low scores when it mattered most and comfortably chased down their targets.""Rohit Sharma was injured, and we didn't have some senior players in that series. But we were very close, and in both the Test matches--the second and the third test matches--in the third innings, we had a big opportunity. We could have set a decent score and won the game, but South Africa played well. They chased back in the fourth innings. So I would say that that was probably my lowest point in my coaching career--not being able to win that series in spite of being ahead,"" he added.Dravid had an impressive tenure as the coach of Team India , capping it off with an ICC T20 World Cup victory after a thrilling win over South Africa in June this year in Barbados.Prior to this, India finished as runners-up in the 50-over World Cup on home soil last year, after an impressive 10-match winning streak that ended with a loss to Australia. The team also secured the runner-up spot in the ICC World Test Championship, again to Australia, and claimed the 50-over Asia Cup title last year.","Rahul Dravid says defeat against South Africa in 2021-22 season was lowest point of his coaching career with the Men in Blue. South Africa staged a remarkable comeback in the following two Tests, clinching both matches by seven wickets. India finished as runners-up in 50-over World Cup on home soil last year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112430557,imgsize-42826,width-400,resizemode-4/112430557.jpg"

Indian players must play abroad, even if it's in lower division

NEW DELHI: Manolo Marquez , the newly appointed head coach of the Indian football team , described his new role as a 'dream come true' but emphasized that in the future, the national team should ideally be managed by an Indian.The 55-year-old Spaniard's tenure, effective from last month, will span three years, during which he will fulfill a dual role as both the head coach of FC Goa and the national team.Marquez, who will manage FC Goa during the 2024-25 season alongside his national team responsibilities, will transition to exclusively coaching the Indian team from 2025.""Apart from Spain, India is the country where I have spent the most number of years. Long time ago, I thought I would like to be a national team head coach and I am here. It is a dream come true,"" Marquez said while addressing his first press conference after his appointment as India head coach.""In the future, the national team coach has to be an Indian because he (Indian) will know better how the country works, knows the people of different parts of India. So, this has to be the target of Indian football in the coming years,"" he added.Marquez has been active in Indian football since 2020, having spent three successful seasons with Hyderabad FC. He also had a notable season with FC Goa, achieving a third-place finish in the Indian Super League (ISL ) this year. His upcoming international assignments include the three-team Intercontinental Cup, to be held in Hyderabad from September 3 to 9, featuring Syria and Mauritius alongside India.Following the Intercontinental Cup, Marquez will lead the team in the VFF Tri-Nation Series in Vietnam from October 9 to 15, competing against Lebanon and hosts Vietnam. Both tournaments will take place during the FIFA international match window, and the national camp for the Intercontinental Cup is scheduled to commence on August 30 or 31.Addressing concerns about potential conflicts of interest while serving as both India head coach and FC Goa manager, Marquez stated that this situation, although unusual, is not unprecedented.""It's not a normal situation, no doubt, but it's not the first time and won't be the last time regarding this situation.""I checked, in international level, there were big names earlier in same situation and in India, I am told there were many (such cases) earlier.""National team plays when there is no ISL. You won't have any doubt that we will work very hard for the national team.""Having failed to make it to the third round of the joint 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 Asian Cup qualifiers under Stimac, India are yet to qualify for the continental showpiece.

We will get 6-7 games before the Asian Cup qualifiers,"" Marquez said.""So, these two upcoming tournaments (Intercontinental Cup and VFF Tri-Nation Series) are important so that we can be in good seeding during the draw (for the Asian Cup qualifiers) in December this year.""""The best players will have to play at the best level, against stronger opponents. That is how you grow as a player. That is why more Indian players should play in the ISL. That is why my advice to Indian players is to play abroad even if it is lower division leagues.""They will learn more and improve more (by playing abroad). But the Indian players are comfortable playing in the ISL, in India but I want them to play abroad,"" Marquez said, adding that Indian football has improved in the last five years but can improve further.Marquez also said he will pick I-League players for the national team, if they have the requisite level.Asked what is lacking in an Indian player as seen in his five-year association with the country at club level, he said, ""It's the mentality of the players, we need to improve on this. We have to develop that we can do something, we have to be stronger in mentality.""If the mentality is right, we will get good results. I am optimistic that Indian football will improve step by step and reach the desired place.""",Manolo Marquez is the new head coach of the Indian football team.

It will also have some teams from foreign countries too.To fight the demon of age fraud, the organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament, offering a promising solution to address this issue effectively.During the opening press conference of the Subroto Cup, TimesofIndia.com raised concerns about age fraud. Answering, an Air Force Sports Control Board (AFSCB) spokesperson stated, ""All and every footballer (who will be participating in the Subroto Cup) is registered on the AIFF website. And each of them gets a unique code. We also want to avoid age fraud. As per the AIFF guidelines, a skeleton bone test will be done for the under-15 boys category. For the under-17 category, it will be normal medical. The skeleton bone test or the age-detection test will all be done under the guidelines of AIFF.""The skeleton bone test, commonly known as a bone age assessment, estimates a person's age, especially in children and adolescents, by analyzing their bones.This process typically involves taking an X-ray of the left hand and wrist, as this area contains bones that undergo predictable developmental changes with age. The X-ray is then compared to standard reference images, such as those in the Greulich-Pyle Atlas, to determine the bone's developmental stage, including the appearance of growth plates and the fusion of epiphyses.It is understood that 22 teams in the under-14 category were disqualified and did not participate in the Subroto Cup after failing the age-determination test last time. According to AIFF guidelines, if four or more players from a team are found to be over-aged, that team will be immediately disqualified and barred from the tournament.""Apart from that, all the players who have already registered through AIFF and CRS (central registration system), have their age verified. The people who are coming are less in numbers. So, in times to come, age fraud, which is prevalent in football, is likely to reduce,"" he ended on a positive note, sounding hopeful, as we all are, of a better future.","The Subroto Cup is an annual school football tournament held in India.
