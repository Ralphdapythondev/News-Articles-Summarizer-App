After four consecutive defeats, Mumbai Indians (MI) lifted the gloom in the dressing room in style as Suryakumar Yadav 's sensational century led the cheers in the home team's seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in their IPL match at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Monday.Chasing SRH's 173 for 8, MI were in a spot of bother at 31 for 3, but Surya launched a counter-attack to score 51-ball 102 not out, including 12 fours and 6 sixes, to deflated SRH bowling with his 360-degree batting.He added 143 runs in an unbeaten fourth-wicket partership with Tilak Varma (37 not out).Earlier in SRH innings, MI captain Hardik Pandya (3 for 31) and veteran legspinner Piyush Chawla (3 for 33) led the bowling charts with three wickets each to restrict the visitors, who could reach a competitive total only because of opener Travis Head's 48 off 30 balls and skipper Pat Cummins's 17-ball cameo of 35 not out.The commentators were in awe of Surya's T20 batting skills as he completed his century with a match-winning six off the second ball of the 17th over.""I have done this after a long time,"" said Surya at the post-match presentation. ""I fielded for 20 overs and batted for 18 overs, only tired.""Skipper Hardik said it was an ""unbelievable"" knock by Surya.""It's unbelievable! The best past of SKY is that he puts the bowlers under pressure. It's sheer confidence...He can change a game in a different way. Lucky to have him in our side,"" said Hardik after the match.While Mumbai's playoff hopes are only mathematically alive in the ongoing IPL, Surya's litmus test will be at the T20 World Cup in the US and West Indies, beginning June 2.If MI don't reach the playoffs, Surya will have time to rest as well as refocus for the big-ticket T20 tournament, where India will begin their campaign with the group game against Ireland on June 5 in New York, followed by the big match against Pakistan on June 9 at the same venue.Co-hosts USA and Canada are the other two teams in India's group.","Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets in IPL match.

NEW DELHI: Suryakumar Yadav 's exceptional century, combined with disciplined bowling, propelled Mumbai Indians to a seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL on Monday.Suryakumar's explosive innings of 102 not out from 51 balls marked his second IPL century, helping his team secure an emphatic win in just 17.2 overs. SRH had earlier recovered to post 173 for eight.The win moved Mumbai Indians up from the bottom of the points table to ninth place, while SRH, despite the loss, stayed in fourth place with 12 points from 11 games.Joining forces inside the powerplay with MI left reeling at 31 for three, the pair of Suryakumar and Tilak Varma (37 not out off 32) did a superb recovery job with 143-run unbeaten stand to script a comprehensive victory. Suryakumar's sensational knock included 12 fours and half a dozen sixes.For that matter, MI could have been reduced to 31/4 had a Bhuvneshwar Kumar delivery in the fifth over not pitched outside the leg stump with the veteran seamer pinning Varma in front of the wickets.Ishan Kishan (9) perished early once again while Naman Dhir (0) endured a nine-ball duck.With their backs against the wall, Suryakumar picked Marco Jansen to attack as he collected 22 runs off the seventh over with two sixes and two fours to begin his job.But shortly after he completed his fifty off 30 balls, Suryakumar was seen stretching and wincing in pain while looking to manage a strain, presumably to his groin — one of the reasons why he missed cricket for nearly four months from late last year.However, to his credit, the world No 1 T20 batter hung around till the end to take MI over the line as he finished the game with a flurry of boundaries — two sixes and as many fours off his last four balls.Apart from Suryakumar's struggles while batting, the decline in Rohit Sharma 's form also came to the fore with the India captain mistiming one to be dismissed for a mere four — his fourth score in single digits this IPL in last five outings.Earlier in the first half, Pandya struck form before the T20 World Cup while veteran Chawla also bagged three wickets as Mumbai Indians restricted Sunrisers Hyderabad for a below-par total.Pandya found rhythm and momentum to return 4-0-31-3 while Chawla (4-0-33-3) produced an impactful performance to trouble the SRH batters.However, to his credit, SRH skipper Pat Cummins chipped in with a 17-ball 35 (2x4s, 2x6s) late in the innings to take them past the 150-run mark.In complete contrast to last time these teams met earlier in this IPL when SRH hammered 277/3, their usually free-flowing batters struggled for momentum and lack of initiative meant they could never really trouble the Mumbai bowlers.Travis Head top scored with 48 while skipper Pat Cummins made a quick 17-ball 35 not out.","Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets in IPL.

NEW DELHI: Former head coach Ravi Shastri has identified two debutants, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shivam Dube , as pivotal to India's aspirations in the upcoming Men’s T20 World Cup 2024, to be held in the Caribbean and the USA in June.Both players have been included in India's 15-member squad for the tournament, with Shastri highlighting their potential to make a significant impact on the team's performance.Jaiswal showcased his exceptional batting prowess during the ICC World Test Championship series against England, amassing a record tally of runs, thereby earning his place in the T20 squad. Meanwhile, Dube's explosive batting displays in the ongoing IPL , where he has smashed 26 sixes in 11 matches, underscore his current form and the potential value he brings to the Indian team.As India gears up for the T20 World Cup campaign, the inclusion of Jaiswal and Dube adds depth and firepower to the squad, with Shastri expressing confidence in their ability to deliver match-winning performances on the global stage.""The two gentlemen you've got to watch out for, and both are left-handers, both playing their first World Cup,"" Shastri told ICC.""One is (Yashasvi) Jaiswal. We know a lot about him, he did extremely well against England, explosive at the top of the order, left-hander, he's young, he's fearless and he'll play shots.""Shastri went on to pick Dube as another player to watch out for from the Indian squad.""But there's someone in the middle order, please watch out for (him), because he is explosive, he's devastating and he's a match-winner. He hits sixes for fun, and when it comes to spin bowling, he can kill you,"" Shastri said.""He'll park a few balls out of Long Island into the small island, he's that kind of a player. He hits it big, he hits it long, and like I said, against spin, he could kill you.""Even against the fast bowlers, he's worked out his game, he's understood the way to play and I think he holds the key at that number five, number six position because if you're on the doldrums, you want someone to change it in 20-25 balls, he's the player to go to.""Dube's impressive performances in IPL 2024 have been characterised by his exceptional strike rate of 170.73, coupled with an impressive batting average of over 40. In 11 IPL matches this year, Dube has amassed a total of 350 runs, showcasing his ability to consistently contribute with the bat at a rapid pace.The left-hander was singled out for huge praise by Shastri, who thinks that Dube’s big-hitting could unlock big totals for India in the competition.""His strike rate, which will be close to 200 most of the time, will help India immensely in going forward, getting those 190s, 200s that are needed in big competitions, especially like the (T20) World Cup.""So enjoy it, watch out for this left-hander — he's big, he's strapping, and he hits a long ball.""","Ravi Shastri has identified two debutants, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shivam Dube, as pivotal to India's aspirations in the upcoming Men’s T20 World Cup 2024.

'Will send team to Pakistan only if...': BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla on India's Champions Trophy participation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/will-send-team-to-pakistan-only-if-bcci-vice-president-rajeev-shukla-on-indias-champions-trophy-participation/articleshow/109892040.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Rajeev Shukla , the vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ), has clarified that the Indian team's participation in the ICC Champions Trophy next year, scheduled to be held in Pakistan from February to March 2025, is contingent upon receiving approval from the central government.The statement comes amidst speculation regarding India's potential absence from the tournament.Tensions between India and Pakistan have significantly impacted cricketing relations between the two nations since 2008, following the Asia Cup. Bilateral series between India and Pakistan have been suspended since December 2012-January 2013, with ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup serving as the primary platforms for their cricketing encounters.The decision to send the Indian team to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy hinges on various factors, including the prevailing diplomatic and security situation between the two countries.Given the history of strained relations and security concerns, any decision regarding India's participation will be subject to careful consideration and consultation with relevant authorities.Speaking to the ANI, Shukla said, ""In the case of the Champion Trophy, we will do whatever the Government of India will tell us to do. We send our team only when the Government of India gives us permission. So we will go according to the decision of the Indian government .""Pakistan resorted to a hybrid strategy during the hosting of the Asia Cup last year due to logistical and security challenges, notably hosting all of India's matches, including potential encounters against Pakistan, in Sri Lanka. This decision was made in the interest of ensuring the smooth conduct of the tournament while accommodating security concerns and diplomatic sensitivities.Contrastingly, when it came to the possibility of adopting a similar hybrid approach for the ODI World Cup hosted by India the previous year, Pakistan did not seriously consider such a strategy.Instead, they participated in the tournament in India, playing all their matches at various venues across the country. Despite initial discussions regarding the feasibility of a hybrid approach, Pakistan ultimately competed in the tournament in India, albeit facing challenges in the group stages and being eliminated early on.It's worth noting that Pakistan holds the distinction of being the defending champions of the ICC Champions Trophy, with their triumph in the last edition held in 2017. As they gear up for future tournaments, Pakistan will undoubtedly aim to replicate their past success on the global stage.The Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has designated Lahore as the only location for India matches for the Champions Trophy that Pakistan has been awarded for the next year, as ESPNcricinfo reported earlier in May.According to ESPNcricinfo, PCB has locked three locations--Karachi, Lahore, and Rawalpindi--to host the two-week Champions Trophy. India's draft schedule calls for them to play all of their games at Lahore, which is also the location of the final.It is said that the idea of putting India in a single place was put forward to avoid potentially significant logistical and security issues related to their travel. Additionally, it gives Indian fans a comparatively easier choice to visit because it is headquartered in Lahore, which is near the Wagah border crossing between the two countries.PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi said earlier that the board had sent a draft schedule of the tournament, likely to be staged in mid-February next year, to the ICC. Discussions on it involving the eight participating members will take place, with the major sticking point likely to be whether the India team travels or not.","Rajeev Shukla, vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ), has clarified that the Indian team's participation in the ICC Champions Trophy next year is contingent upon approval from the central government.

NEW DELHI: Explosive Australian opener David Warner recently opened his unexpected exit from his former Indian Premier League team Sunrisers Hyderabad In an appearance on Ravichandran Ashwin's YouTube channel, Warner described his departure from SRH as 'bizarre'.After playing for Delhi Capitals from 2009-13 in the IPL, Warner was bought by SRH in 2014 and stayed with the franchise till 2021.However, despite winning the 2016 IPL with the franchise as a captain and scoring heaps of runs for the Orange Army, the Aussie experienced an unceremonious exit from the side, which came slowly.First, he was sacked as a captain midway through the 2021 season because of his poor form and frequent losses for SRH. New Zealand batter Kane Williamson replaced him as the captain after Warner lost five out of the first six games of the season.In the second half of the season, not only Warner was dropped, but also blocked by the franchise on social media. Sadness was visible on Warner's face, as he even carried drinks for his team during matches. SRH finished at the bottom with three wins and 11 losses. Warner also scored poorly, making just 195 runs in eight innings with two fifties at an average of 24.38 and a sub-par strike rate of just over 107, which is not associated with his more attacking gameplay.Speaking on Ashwin's channel, Warner said that the treatment from the team management and him being blocked from social media did hurt him because it was also a ""hurt for fans"", something Warner considered really important during his stint with the franchise.""It did hurt because it was a sense of like hurt for fans. The fans are the most important relationship you could have. The engagement with the fans that I had, with the team had was very good,"" Warner said.""I am not sure why I was blocked. But I did engage with a lot of fans on the social media side for SRH. I did feel it was my duty to engage with the fans, making sure they kept coming back. That is what is most important. But from the blocking point of view, I do not know. I have been sitting on it for about 5 years. It was bizarre. At the end of the day, I still have fans who come onto my page and talk to everyone. So it is great,"" he added.Warner's stint with SRH made him an IPL legend and possibly the best overseas player to have graced the league. In 95 matches, he scored 4,014 runs at an average of 49.56 and a strike rate of 142.59, with two centuries and 40 fifties. His best score was 126. He not only won an IPL title for his side in 2016 as a skipper, but also won the 'Orange Cap' honour for most runs in a season thrice, in 2015, 2017 and 2019, the most by any batter in league history.Warner was bought by DC ahead of IPL 2022 for Rs 6.25 crore. In 88 matches for DC, Warner has made 2,550 runs at an average of 31.88 and a strike rate of 135.64, with two centuries and 22 fifties. His best score is 109*. However, he has not won any IPL title with DC.In 2024 season, Warner has scored just 167 runs in seven games at an average of 23.85 and a strike rate of 135.77, with a knock of 52 as his solitary fifty.

It was Chhangte's night.In a team game, Mumbai City's No. 7 painted the Salt Lake Stadium's canvass with one of the finest individual performances this season, guiding his team to a remarkable 3-1 win over Mohun Bagan to lift the ISL championship title and denying Antonio Lopez Habas 's Shield winners an opportunity of doing a 'double' in the league.Chhangte, who finished the league with 10 goals - the maximum among domestic players - didn't score this time. But such was his elegant menace that he almost single-handedly brought crowd favourites Mohun Bagan to their knees. His acceleration, vision and endless determination were too much for the home team. He simply eviscerated the opponents.Mumbai City started with such intensity that Chhengte was denied by the woodwork twice in the first half. Yet, the fickle hand of football seemed to turn the script on its head in a stunning way when Jason Cummings put Mohun Bagan ahead in the 44th minute in what was the team's second shot on target at that time.But Petr Kratky 's Mumbai - having certainly learnt from their Shield-losing defeat here three weeks ago - continued to control the game with their passing and possession and always looked threatening on the break. The equalizer came in the 53rd minute through Jorge Pereyra Diaz .Mumbai soon lost Pereyra Diaz and Alberto Noguera to injury. But their substitutes Bipin Singh and Jakub Vojtus rose to the occasion, scoring in the 81st and 95th minute, respectively, giving Mumbai the deserved victory.While Mumbai players sang and danced with the cup, the result also put a question mark on Habas's strategy. They missed the usual creativity, and the likes of Manvir Singh, Liston Colaco and Dimitri Petratos were not given the license to set the tempo until the final 15 minutes when they decided to throw the kitchen sink in desperation.Mumbai started on the front foot, flourishing in Petr Kratky's pass-and-move doctrine and leaving Mohun Bagan all over the place. The imperious Chhangte - the winger with exceptional work rate - was the heartbeat of their relentless pressure on the Bagan box.Soon after Chhangte saw his lay-off across the goalline go begging, he came calling again, this time his looping shot hit the crosspiece.The woodwork came to Bagan's rescue again when, receiving the ball from Vikram Pratap Singh, Chhangte took aim at the goal, the ball coming back into play after hitting the far post.The storm was heavy but Bagan somehow managed to weather it for a while, and then added a twist to the tale out of nowhere.Two minutes after Liston Colaco fired Bagan's first shot on target in the match, the Bagan winger initiated another move just on the cusp of halftime, with his usual brisk pace down the left flank. Petratos, receiving the ball from him, unleashed a ferocious strike from the edge of the box. Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa could only manage to block it but Cummings --just like the semifinal second-leg clash against Odisha FC here six days ago --reacted the quickest to slam home the rebound.But Mumbai came back and stole the home team's thunder with a remarkable second-half performance.","Mumbai City FC beat Mohun Bagan 3-1 to lift ISL championship title. Lallianzuala Chhangte scored 10 league goals, the maximum among domestic players. Jason Cummings put Bagan ahead in 44th minute. Jorge Pereyra Diaz equalized for Mumbai in 53rd minute.

"Rafael Nadal seeding for French Open not being considered, says Mauresmo",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/rafael-nadal-seeding-for-french-open-not-being-considered-says-mauresmo/articleshow/109597412.cms,"(With Reuters inputs)

NEW DELHI: Amelie Mauresmo , the tournament director of Roland Garros , indicated on Thursday that former world number one Rafael Nadal is unlikely to receive a seed at the upcoming French Open next month.Nadal himself expressed uncertainty on Wednesday regarding his participation in this year's tournament, despite his remarkable record of winning the French Open a record 14 times.At 37 years old, Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, has seen a significant drop in his ranking, currently standing at 512, following an extended absence due to a hip flexor injury that kept him sidelined for almost a year.Although he has secured a place in the main draw of the French Open via his protected ranking, this ranking does not guarantee seeding, as seeding is determined by the top 32 ranked players.Without a seed, Nadal could potentially face formidable opponents in the early stages of the tournament.Traditionally, Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam event that did not strictly adhere to the ATP and WTA rankings, instead considering a player's past performances on grass courts when determining seeding. However, this approach faced criticism from players, including Nadal, leading to its abandonment in 2020.Asked about Nadal being seeded at this year's French Open, Mauresmo told reporters: ""Right now it's not a topic...""Wimbledon did it for a very, very, very long time, and it certainly brought some advantages but we also saw all the disadvantages it could bring. For the moment, it's not on the table.""We're keeping our fingers crossed for him above all, for us too obviously. We're keeping a close eye on what's happening for him on court. We're in touch with his team. Whether there's a tribute depends very much on him. We'll follow his wishes.""Nadal is in action against 16-year-old American Darwin Blanch in the Madrid Open later on Thursday.",Rafael Nadal unlikely to receive a seed at the upcoming French Open.
