'We are ready to take a bullet for our Men in Blue'

The sea looked bluer on the reclaimed-land side on Thursday evening. After their delayed departure from Barbados due to a hurricane, Rohit Sharma 's T20 World Cup winning Team India returned home to a different kind of storm with cricket-crazy Mumbaikars filling the stretch from Nariman Point to Wankhede stadium and making the open top bus carrying India's cricket heroes happily, gently and proudly cut through the surging sea of admirers, each eager for a glimpse of the champions.Hours before the team even landed in Mumbai from Delhi well past 5pm, after having met PM Modi in the morning on touching down in the national capital, tens of thousands of cricket fans had flooded the route from the NCPA gates ignoring the showers, winding their way towards Wankhede which had been thrown open for a late-evening felicitation.Some climbed trees, some tore through barricades, and everyone clicked away furiously on their cell phones as the team finally made its grand appearance atop a blue bus. Captain Rohit Sharma, flanked by Virat Kohli , Hardik Pandya , Suryakumar Yadav, and other teammates, held the trophy high, waving to the delirious masses. The air was electric with chants of 'Mumbaicha Raja, Rohit Sharma' and 'Boom Boom Bumrah'. As the parade inched forward, the frenzy left behind a scattering of shoes in its wake, evidence of the near-stampede excitement of the moment.After the bus reached Wankhede, the team did a lap of honour amid resounding applause, with Rohit dedicating the T20 WC title ""to the entire nation"".BCCI office-bearers felicitated the team and presented it with a cheque of Rs 125 crore. ""The huge turnout of fans shows they were as desperate for this T20 World Cup title as we were,"" said Rohit.""I am going to miss this love. What I saw on streets tonight, I won't forget it,"" said outgoing coachRahul Dravid .So jubilant were the crowds from late afternoon that nothing mattered to them except the excitement and anticipation of the team's parade though they found themselves, for quite some time, at the mercy of nature's whims. First, the sun baked them to a crisp. Then the skies opened up. Yet everyone stood patiently for over four hours and soaked it all in as part of the celebration, with intermittent roars of ""India! India!"" at full pelt.A gang of 20 friends, all clad in their own version of a Team India jersey, made the long journey from the western suburbs of Kandivli to the city's southernmost tip. As the train doors opened, they poured out onto the platform, waving the tricolour, blaring vuvuzelas and taking turns to chant the names of each one of their cricketing heroes.Among them was Rajendra Damle, 20, who tried to capture the emotion of the moment. ""It's hard to explain the feeling. It's just pure joy,"" he said, his eyes sparkling. ""They've won, but it feels like we've won. We're a part of this and want to celebrate with them.""Beside him, Kreena Vaghel, 18, nodded enthusiastically. ""It's also our chance to show them how much we respect and adore them,"" she added. Together, they joined the throngs along Marine Drive, ready to celebrate their heroes' victory as if it were their own.High schoolers Aditya, Agastya, Sanchay, and Jainit made the trek from Goregaon to join the crowd. ""Surya Kumar Yadav's catch was one of the best moments in the final,"" they chorused, still buzzing with the thrill of the win.""This victory has been healing for us after the November 2019 ODI World Cup final loss against Australia. We had to cheer for our men in blue."" Agastya could barely contain his enthusiasm. ""Excited to see Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, we'll be trailing them from NCPA to Wankhede. Rain or sun doesn't matter. We're ready to take a bullet for our men in blue.""Meenal Shah from Ghatkopar stood proudly amidst the crowd, holding up a picture collage featuring Ravindra Jadeja , Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid. The poster read: ""End of an Era: India won, but lost these diamonds… Please don't go."" It was a heartfelt plea that captured the sentiment of many, amid the celebratory atmosphere of the parade. ""I made this poster because I feel so emotionally attached,"" she explained. ""I can't bear the thought of their retirement from international T20s and India playing without them.""Meanwhile, N B Chittalwala from Mumbra, Thane, busy scouting for a good vantage point for his wife and two daughters, 13 and 4, reminisced, ""In 1983, my father took me to the airport to see the World Cup-winning team. Later, I was part of Dhoni's 2007 T20 winning parade, too. Now it's my turn to give my daughters the same experience.""Amid all the 'Rohit,' 'Dhoni' and 'Virat' t-shirt-sporting fans, Pradeep Gond from Kandivli took his fandom to the next level. His t-shirt read 'Akaay' on the back-the name of Virat Kohli's son. ""That's also my one-month old son's name,"" Pradeep said. ""I named him after what Virat named his son because I'm his biggest fan,"" he added.","Tens of thousands of cricket fans flooded the route from the NCPA gates ignoring the showers.

At that time, he had declared, ""it was only fair to carry the maestro Sachin Tendulkar on their shoulders after he carried the burden of Indian cricket for 21 years.""Fast forward to the present day, with Kohli now 35 and having recently announced his retirement from the shortest format, he found himself standing on the same revered pitch.""I hope we (Rohit and I) have carried the burden and no better to bring it (trophy) back here (Wankhede),"" said Kohli, who knew during the innings break of the final that this was his last game.""Halfway through the game I knew it it was time and let the next generation take over,""added Kohli, sharing a sentiment that he had voiced after the final as well.As the most junior player in the class of 2011, Virat Kohli witnessed the emotional outpouring from his senior teammates, Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh, and Yuvraj Singh.

If the ankle injury prematurely ending his ODI World Cup last year was not enough, the jeers he received at the Indian Premier League (IPL) before the T20 World Cup and personal troubles off the field damaged his spirits. But the allrounder and India's T20 vice-captain demonstrated exceptional resilience and determination to overcome adversity and turn the tables in a matter of three months.Pandya's return to Mumbai Indians (MI) replacing Rohit Sharma as skipper initially sparked anger among fans.The transition was not well-received, and Pandya faced the brunt of the fans' discontent. It had a detrimental effect on his personal game, besides five-time IPL champions MI enduring one of their poorest seasons.Additionally, there were unconfirmed reports of a separation from his wife, Natasa Stankovic, adding to the personal challenges he faced.When Pandya first led the Mumbai Indians side in Ahmedabad for their season opener, he was met with boos, heckles, and negativity from the fans. Even at his first home match at the Wankhede Stadium, the harshest response awaited him during the toss. The situation escalated to the point where commentator and former India and Mumbai cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar had to intervene, urging the crowd to ""behave"" during a toss against Rajasthan Royals.However, the tide turned dramatically with Pandya delivering India's T20 World Cup-winning over in the final against South Africa, ending with three wickets to lead India's bowling charts in the title clash.As Pandya landed at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursdya after India's victory parade through the Marine Drive in Mumbai, he was greeted by deafening cheers from a vast sea of fans filling the stadium. The past negativity had been replaced by overwhelming support and admiration for the resilient cricketer who had overcome so much to reach this point.""See you soon, Wankhede,"" wrote the World Cup champion as he posted his selfie with the trophy before the parade here.The stadium erupted with chants of 'Hardik… Hardik', echoing through the stands.As the team arrived at the airport, Pandya was among the first to emerge, proudly holding the trophy high on his shoulder. He led the way to his 'homeground', where thousands of fans had been waiting for hours to catch a glimpse of the coveted prize.Despite concerns about potential chaos and stampedes, the atmosphere remained celebratory as everyone came together to cheer for India's heroes. Pandya joined the open bus ride for a couple of hours before making his way to the Wankhede Stadium.Virat Kohli, during his speech, highlighted Suryakumar Yadav's crucial catch in the final over, which was off Pandya's bowling. The mention of this moment triggered thunderous cheers from the Wankhede crowd, who united in their appreciation for Pandya's performance, chanting 'Hardik… Hardik' in unison.""The biggest turnaround happened in terms of (when) he was included. We could bat deep and we had an extra bowling option. In last ODI World Cup final we missed him,"" a fan said, talking to PTI.""The biggest testament is Hardik's mental strength, he was booed in the (first game) here against CSK. But still he did not hit back, kept his head down and kept working.""All the hate he got was unwarranted. The owners took him in, he had nothing to do with it. There was no point booing him...Obviously, we did not qualify (for the IPL 2024 playoffs) but we are just here to celebrate him and smile all day,"" he added.""The problem with us MI fans is that we have very short memories. Now we are going to cheer ‘Mumbaicha Raja Hardik Hardik'. We will accept him as MI captain now,"" he said.“IPL is different from international cricket, it is purely entertainment cricket. I am happy for him, he scored runs and took wickets that too at the crucial times.

If you have a look at what this team did, they were champions in every different field. So while there was 'Player of the Tournament'Jasprit Bumrah , who absolutely totally deserved to be the 'Player of the Tournament', the main man running the show was Rohit Sharma.""So Rohit's captaincy is something that has to be admired because never once during tense situations did his body language go down. Yes, we have all got used to some of his grimaces and stuff like that, but that's okay...The way he handled the situation when it was not looking good for India, that is deserving of the highest praise.""Thus, Gavaskar's verdict was unequivocal.""That is why his captaincy was the standout Indian performance of the tournament for me.""He was further quizzed on where does he rank this World Cup win, considering he too has experienced it when India lifted a World Cup (ODI) for the first time in history, in 1983.""It's going to be pretty much at the top because of the expectations factor, the pressure of expectations that this team had over the last 17 years, ever since India won the first ever T20 World Cup in 2007,"" Gavaskar said.He added that with the introduction of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the expectations from the team at T20 World Cups only rose.""Then the IPL started in 2008, where India got to play so many T20 matches with and against some of the best players in the world. India were expected to win the T20 World Cup after that practically every single time,"" he said.That pressure understandably increased, especially after 2013 when India won the Champions Trophy. For 11 years after that, the team kept losing in the knockouts of the ICC tournaments, be it the ODIs, Tests or T20 World Cup, with the latest being the heartbreaking defeat in the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup against Australia.""This time around, the pressure was even more because the last couple of times, India got to the semifinals and the finals but were not able to win it. So the pressure was at its peak. Therefore, to come through that pressure and win is absolutely terrific,"" said Gavaskar.","Sunil Gavaskar says Rohit Sharma's captaincy was the standout Indian performance of the tournament.

Shortly thereafter, 19-year-old Josimar Alcocer extended the lead with a remarkable solo effort, concluding with a long-range shot that found the back of the net.Despite their early success, Costa Rica's chances of advancing were compromised early in the second half. Paraguay's Mathias Villasanti penetrated the defence to assist Ramon Sosa , who scored with a powerful shot into the top corner, marking his first goal for the national team. This goal reduced Costa Rica's lead and dampened their hopes of progressing.Towards the end of the match, Costa Rica faced a scare as Paraguay nearly equalized from a corner kick in added time. However, Costa Rican goalkeeperPatrick Sequeira showcased his reflexes with a crucial fingertip save, securing the victory for his team.Ultimately, Costa Rica's effort to overturn the goal difference and rely on other results to qualify was not realized, leading to their exit from the tournament.Their performance in this final match highlighted both their offensive capabilities and the challenges they faced throughout the group stage.Paraguay's departure followed a disappointing campaign, failing to win any of their matches.

Turkey adopted a 5-4-1 system and were content to let Austria control possession, looking to catch their opponents on the break. This strategy disrupted Austria's usual straightforward playing style.Despite missing their suspended captain Hakan Calhanoglou, Turkey's defensive strategy paid off as Austria failed to register any shots on target in the first half. After the break, Austria came out with renewed vigor and had a golden opportunity to equalize early in the second half when captain Marko Arnautovic was one-on-one with Turkey's keeper but saw his shot blocked.Instead, it was Demiral again who found the net, heading home in the 59th minute to double Turkey's lead.Austria pulled a goal back in the 66th minute when substitute Gregoritsch finished at the far post.

The US squad struggled to create significant chances and never seemed capable of seriously challenging the well-organized Uruguayans.""It's difficult to say right now, obviously the emotions are running high,"" a disappointed US captain Christian Pulisic was quoted as saying by AFP after the game. ""We had a good start and brought a lot of energy, but just didn't have enough quality. We just couldn't find a solution.""Hopes for the US dimmed early as news arrived that Panama had taken a 1-0 lead against Bolivia in Orlando within the first 30 minutes. The Americans' prospects brightened briefly in the second half when Bolivia equalized, making the score 1-1 and giving the US a potential path to qualification if they could hold Uruguay.However, those hopes were short-lived. Uruguay took the lead through Mathias Olivera in controversial circumstances in the 66th minute. Ronald Araujo’s powerful header from a Nicolas de la Cruz free-kick was parried by US goalkeeper Matt Turner, only for Olivera to score on the rebound. Replays suggested Olivera was offside when Araujo initially made contact, but after a lengthy VAR review, Peruvian referee Kevin Ortega allowed the goal to stand.The US's chances of advancing grew increasingly slim when Panama regained their lead with a goal from Eduardo Guerrero to make it 2-1.

LONDON: Daniil Medvedev was having a meltdown of sorts on Centre Court in his Wimbledon second-round match against the 102nd ranked Frenchman Alexandre Muller .The fifth seed was unhappy it seemed on several counts - including bounce and tactics - gesturing to his box, pointing at his French coaches Gilles Cervara and Gilles Simon and shadowing backhands.The Russian was beside himself.Medvedev - both maverick and mercurial - bizarrely raced to his courtside chair at 6-3 in the first set tie-break, thinking the set was done. The chair umpire repeatedly called the tie-break score '6-3', trying to get the player back on court. Medvedev, in the middle of a rant, finally heard the umpire and quickly returned to the middle.The world No.5, who trailed by a set and a break against Muller, managed to steady the boat on a day when whimsical weather continued to disrupt the schedule on outside courts, eventually coming through 6-7 (3), 7-6 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in 3-hours and 28-minutes, playing under the roof.The 28-year-old, who has a love affair going with Court No.1, which he amorously called 'very different' from Centre Court, which he thought was 'slower', though the ball 'bounced higher'. It might have something to do with the result of his semifinals 12 months ago, his only outing at the centerpiece of this venue, while he has never lost on Court No.1.""I didn't play the best match, but I won,"" Medvedev said of Wednesday's effort. ""For whatever reason Centre Court feels much slower, really slow bounce, not like grass where it is sliding. You need to get used to it. The more matches I play on it the more chances I have to play better and better. Definitely always happy to play on Centre Court, but more happy when I win.""Medvedev, who has struggled to back up his strong start to the year after making the final at Melbourne Park and then again at Indian Wells a month later, hasn't been able to go for more on his serve in the spring swing.Medvedev has worked his serve at practice.""I felt very good in Roland Garros with my serve, on grass, I would want it better,"" he said.

Daniil Medvedev survives Alexandre Muller scare to reach Wimbledon third round,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/daniil-medvedev-survives-alexandre-muller-scare-to-reach-wimbledon-third-round/articleshow/111466615.cms,"NEW DELHI: Fifth seed Daniil Medvedev overcame 102-ranked Alexandre Muller on Wednesday to advance to the third round of Wimbledon .Medvedev secured a 6-7(3), 7-6(4), 6-4, 7-5 victory in a match lasting over three-and-a-half hours.Despite early setbacks, including losing the first set to the Frenchman and saving a set point to avoid a 2-0 deficit, Medvedev found his rhythm and ultimately prevailed.Medvedev, who was the runner-up at the Australian Open, initially struggled on Centre Court. In their first tour-level meeting, Muller, ranked 102nd, took the first set in a tiebreak. Medvedev had to work hard to stave off a set point in the second set before leveling the match in another tiebreak. From there, Medvedev outlasted Muller in a hard-fought third set and clinched the match in the fourth set.The 28-year-old Russian, who reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year, faced a determined Muller. Despite needing a medical timeout for a left thigh issue before the fourth set, Muller kept pace with Medvedev.The Frenchman impressed the crowd with unconventional shots like underarm serves and tweeners but struggled with the grass surface, having won only three matches on it in his career.Medvedev adjusted his strategy after losing the first set, increasing his net attacks. This approach paid off as both players exchanged breaks in the second and third sets. Watched by compatriot and 2004 Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova from the Royal Box, Medvedev was not at his clinical best but managed to force Muller into crucial errors.One pivotal moment was when Muller failed a drop shot, handing Medvedev the third set. The fourth set seemed destined for a tiebreak until Muller gave up two match points on his serve, culminating in a double fault that granted Medvedev the win.""When you win, there is the next round to try and do better,"" the former world number one said on court.""For some reason it (the grass) feels really slow, I need to get used to it but the more matches I play on it the more chances I have to play better...
