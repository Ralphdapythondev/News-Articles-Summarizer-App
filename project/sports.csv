Kamran Nay Debut Main Century Bana Kar Babar Ko Happy Birthday Bol Diya | Basit Ali

A century on debut by Kamran Ghulam has substantiated the point that many former Pakistan players had been making in run-up to the Test series against England, and Basit Ali didn't miss the opportunity to get under the skin of Michael Vaughan who had termed dropping Babar Azam a ""stupid decision"".Coming in to bat at a shaky 19 for 2, Ghulam showcased his skills to tackle both pace and spin expertly while scoring 118 off 224 balls, including 11 fours and 1 six.Ghulam, who was awarded a debut for his consistent run in domestic cricket, added crucial 149 runs in partnership with opener Saim Ayub who scored 77.The 29-year-old Ghulam replaced Babar in the Pakistan Test squad after the former captain went through another poor outing. Along with Babar, fast bowlers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah, as well as wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmad were also dropped by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).""PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi will be very happy today. He had given a statement that 'there is no replacement at the moment'. But (selectors) Aaqib Javed & Co introduced a new kid and he made a century on debut,"" said former Pakistan batsman Basit while analysing the first day's play in a video on his YouTube channel.""The best thing about the knock was that he (Ghulam) came out to bat when the score was 19 for 2,"" he added.Following the PCB's decision to drop Babar, former England captain Michael Vaughan had tweeted: ""So Pakistan haven’t won in a while .. Go 1 nil down in the series and decide to drop the best player in @babarazam258.. I guess Pakistan cricket is full of surprises but this tops the lot .. absolutely stupid decision .. unless he has asked for a break !!!""Ahead of the toss on Tuesday, in conversation with another former England captain Nasser Hussain, PCB's ex-chairman and Pakistan's World Cup winner Ramiz Raja also believed that it was probably not right to drop Babar because ""he sells cricket"" for Pakistan.But Basit disagreed, saying that the decision to drop Babar and Ghulam's century has ""opened the door for domestic performers"".""...match shuru hone se pehle baat kar rahe the ke ji 'usko rest gala kiya hai, sponsor nahi aayenge' (they were saying before the match that it was wrong to rest Babar, sponsors won't come),"" said Basit. ""Kamran Ghulam ki tasveer dikha dena Michael Vaughan ko aur kehna main hoon na (show Ghulam's picture to Vaughan and tell him he is there).""""The bold decision taken by the selectors can lead to betterment (of Pakistan cricket). Like Rohit Sharma had said there (in India), give domestic cricket its due,"" he added.Opting to bat first on a pitch that was used for the first Test as well, Pakistan reached 259 for 5 at stumps with Mohammad Rizwan batting on 37 and Agha Salman on 5.Pakistan had lost the opening Test by an innings and 47 runs despite scoring more than 500 runs in their first innings.",Basit Ali says dropping Babar Azam was a'stupid decision' by Pakistan selectors. Kamran Ghulam scored a century on debut for Pakistan against England.

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the first Test versus New Zealand in Bengaluru, India captain Rohit Sharma provided an update on Mohammed Shami and revealed that the seamer, who has been away from cricket since November 2023, has developed ""swelling in his knee"" and it has ""put him back a little bit in his recovery"".""To be honest, right now it is very difficult for us to make a call on him whether he will be fit for this series or Australia series.He recently had a setback. He had a swelling in his knee, which was quite unusual while he was in the process of getting fit, getting close to 100%. That put him back a little bit in his recovery,"" said Rohit at the pre-match press-conference.The Indian skipper further added that they don't want to take an ""undercooked"" Shami to Australia for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and divulged that the medical team has already put a road map in place for him.""So he had to start again fresh. Right now, he is at NCA ( National Cricket Academy ). He is working with the physios, the doctors at NCA. We are keeping our fingers crossed. We want him to be fit. We want him to be 100% fit. More than anything else, we don't want to bring an undercooked Shami to Australia. That is not going to be the right decision for us.""It is quite tough for a fast bowler having missed so much of cricket. Then suddenly to come out and be at his best, it is not ideal. We want to give him enough time to recover and be 100% fit. The physios, the trainers, the doctors have set a road map for him. He is supposed to play a couple of games before he plays international cricket. We will see where he is at after this New Zealand series. Then take a call at what stage of Australia he will be fit for us,"" added Rohit.The development was first reported by The Times of India on October 2 and it also mentioned the high chances of the 34-year-old taking another ""six-eight weeks"" to regain fitness. The report created a stir in cricketing circles and Shami took to social media platforms terming it as ""baseless rumours"".He went on to add: ""Why these type of baseless rumors? I'm working hard and trying my level best to recover. Neither the BCCI nor me have mentioned that I am out of the Border Gavaskar series. I request the public to stop paying attention to such news from unofficial sources. Please stop and don't spread such fake fake fake & fake news, especially without my statement.""Minutes after Shami's posts, TimesofIndia.com reached out to a senior member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) who backed Shami's version and reiterated that the seamer's rehab is very much on track and he's likely to feature in the three Tests against New Zealand.Little over a week after all the drama, BCCI named the squad for the New Zealand Tests and Shami's name was missing. There was no official word from the Indian cricket board on the star's player's current situation as he continued to be away from competitive cricket since the 2023 World Cup final in November last year.A day after the squad announcement, the BCCI official insisted that Shami was very much on track for New Zealand series and it was only after some developments during his rehab that he wasn't included.""He was very much on track for New Zealand Tests as of that day. There were some developments during his rehab which tend to happen,"" added the official.Who exactly is not telling the truth?Shami said all is well, BCCI official said all is well but the Indian captain Rohit Sharma and TOI report on October 2 mention otherwise. It is further understood that Shami is not close to match fitness right now for the gruelling five Tests in Australia and the situation is very much 50-50.The seamer has been regularly posting rehab videos on social media but the bowling videos have now made way for a lot of gym work in the last few days.The first Test against Australia, scheduled to begin on November 22, is still over a month away but Shami is clearly in a race against time to regain match fitness before the high-profile series.","Mohammed Shami has been away from competitive cricket since November 2023.

NEW DELHI: Days after playing the three-T20Is vs Bangladesh, Sanju Samson has made himself for Kerala 's 2nd round of the Ranji Trophy starting October 18.Kerala take on Karnataka in an away fixture in Alur from Friday and the wicketkeeper-batter reached out to P Prasanth , chairman of senior selection committee, and confirmed his availability.""Yes, Sanju Samson reached out to me and confirmed his availability for the next game.He will be playing the match vs Karnataka in Alur,"" says Prasanth.Kerala won their opening game against Punjab by eight wickets and Samson's addition will be a big boost for the Sachin Baby-led unit. Baby was announced as captain before the start of the season and will continue to lead the side as the selectors feel it will give the squad much needed continuity.""For now, Sanju's availability for this game is confirmed. His future availability depends on his India commitments. So that's why Baby will continue to lead the side,"" adds Prasanth.Samson recently featured in the Duleep Trophy where he scored a century and a couple of impressive 40s for India D. He was behind the stumps with the big gloves in both the games but Prasanth isn't sure whether he would keep wickets for Kerala in the October 18 fixture.""That the coach and all will take the call along with Sanju. Whether he keeps or not is totally up to them,"" says Prasanth.Kerala are placed alongside Bengal, Bihar, Haryana, Karnataka Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in Group C of the ongoing Ranji Trophy, and a convincing win in the opening fixture would have done their confidence a world of good.Before the season, they roped in Baba Aparajith, who played for India U-19 in the past and has been a consistent performer for Tamil Nadu , as a professional and the all-rounder made vital contributions with both bat and ball.Sanju Samson , Sachin Baby , Mohammed Azharuddeen , Vishnu Vinod , KM Asif, Basil Thampi, Baba Aparajith, Jalaj Saxena, Aditya Sarwate, MD Nidheesh, Akshay Chandran, Fazil Fanoos, Vathsal Govind, Krishna Prasad, Rohan Kunnummal, Salman Nizar, Basil NP.",Kerala take on Karnataka in an away fixture in Alur from Friday.

NEW DELHI: What's India's greatest Test victory of all time? Every cricket fan has a personal favourite. Unlikely triumphs, wrenched out at Oval 1971, Port of Spain 1976, Kolkata 2001 , Brisbane 2021, and Kanpur 2024 too, for its audacity of imagination, are likely to figure in most lists.But for those of a certain vintage, India's nerve-jangling two-wicket win over Bobby Simpson 's Australia exactly 60 years ago-Oct 15, 1964 on Dussehra day-at Bombay's Brabourne Stadium ranks among the very best.""It was the most exciting Test seen in India since the 1948 (India vs West Indies in Bombay) one, some said the most exciting ever…Some Indians thought the Test compared with the tied Test (Australia vs West Indies in Brisbane, 1960),"" wrote Mihir Bose in his masterly chronicle, A History of Indian Cricket . The first line of The Times of India report summed up the national mood: ""Victory at last-And what a victory!""""It was a seesaw game,"" recalled Chandu Borde , regarded as the spine of India's middle-order in the 1960s. The pithy summary is precise. The Test, played on a freshly relaid pitch, wasn't about wildly fluctuating fortunes; it was a match of mini tremors and slow shifts. Nobody scored a century, nobody claimed a fiver in this Test won by collective enterprise and true grit.India had a bunch of notable performers. Captain MAK Pataudi entertained with 86 and 53. Vijay Manjrekar's 59 and 39 were vital. Leg-spinner BS Chandrashekhar, the other surviving member from the playing XI, scalped eight (4/50 and 4/73). And left-arm spinner Bapu Nadkarni's contributions with bat (34 & 0) and ball (2/65 and 4/33) were critical. But in the end, it was Borde and keeper KS Indrajitsinhji, who became heroes and were ""loaded with garlands"" and hoisted on shoulders by spectators.""The crowd rushed to the wicket, lifted and carried us to the pavilion,"" said Borde , now 90, on phone. He remained undefeated on 30 while forging a match-winning 32 run ninth-wicket stand with Indrajitsinhji. The keeper stonewalled the Aussie attack for 41 minutes contributing a priceless 3.In the post-match melee, someone filched Borde's brand new willow. ""One person took my bat and ran away. It was the bat I used to play in Lancashire (league). It was an English willow. That was stolen from me,"" Borde had told this reporter in 2020.The crowd's behaviour needs to be understood in the way the Test unfolded. Australia scored 320 batting first, India replying with 341. When the visitors were bowled out for 274 in their second knock, Pataudi's men-Dilip Sardesai, ML Jaisimha, Salim Durani , Hanumant Singh, among others-needed 254 to overhaul. India had never scored so many runs for a win in the fourth innings.All looked lost when six wickets fell for 122. Two of them were night watchmen, but even 50% of the target hadn't been reached yet. Then the improbable began to happen. Pataudi and Manjrekar put on 93 for the seventh wicket, before both fell within 10 runs of each other.Now it was left to Borde and Indrajitsinhji to take India home. ""There was a lot of tension on the ground. But I was okay on the pitch. And Indrajitsinhji gave me good support,"" said Borde.Every run was cheered. ""Though the faint-hearted could scarcely bear to look, Borde was playing his normal game. With seven runs wanted, offie (Tom) Veivers bowled an over-pitched ball which he off-drove for four, the next ball he drove wide of mid-on and India had won,"" wrote Edward Docker in ""History of Indian Cricket"".In 55 Tests, Borde scored 3,061 runs. He smashed five centuries, an unbeaten 177 against Pakistan in Madras being his highest. His leg-breaks fetched him 52 wickets. But it was the game changing cameo which earned him the adulation that every sportsperson dreams of.",Chandu Borde and KS Indrajitsinhji were hoisted on shoulders by spectators.

NEW DELHI: Former England skipper Nasser Hussain has launched a scathing critique of Pakistan cricket ’s management, arguing that the core issue lies not with players like Babar Azam Shaheen Afridi , or Naseem Shah, but with the instability and lack of forward planning within the system.Speaking on Sky Sports ahead of Pakistan’s second Test against England, Hussain underlined the constant changes in selectors, coaches, and captains as the root cause of the team’s struggles.“The issue is not Babar Azam, Shaheen Afridi, or Naseem Shah,” Hussain said. “The issue is behind the scenes in the way Pakistan cricket runs.”In his valiant attack on PCB 's structure, Hussain discussed how the lack of structure leads to reactionary decisions, such as Babar’s sudden exclusion after the first Test. “In the paper, I saw there were 26 different selectors; in another, it said 27. Nobody can keep count. How many have England had? Two or three, maybe. But if you keep changing selectors, coaches, captains—constantly shuffling leadership—it’s impossible to plan ahead. No successful business or sports team works that way. When you operate with short-term thinking, you show up unprepared, and by the time you lose the first Test, you’re already scrambling for solutions,” he further addedHe also pointed out that, while Pakistan face financial challenges compared to wealthier cricket boards, their internal issues compound the problem. “Their cricket and some of it, you give them a bit of leeway because of the way the finances of the world game have gone with the big three, and they're picking up the scraps like other nations are. So I really feel for Pakistan cricket and we mustn't be too harsh on them, but at times, they shoot themselves in the foot,” Hussain remarked.Reacting to Hussain’s remarks, former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram posted a cryptic message on X, saying, “I think finally boys are on to something here.”Pakistan are under pressure to bounce back in the second Test, which begins on Tuesday in Multan.The team has made four changes, including debuting batsman Kamran Ghulam and adding three spinners to take advantage of the re-used Multan pitch.Pakistan’s selection choices are seen as a desperate attempt to level the series after being humiliated by England in the first Test, where the visitors declared at a massive 823-7 and won by an innings and 47 runs.",Former England skipper Nasser Hussain criticizes Pakistan cricket's management.

The defeat led to the exclusion of Babar, wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed and fast bowlers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah from the squad for the second and third Test.Talking about the development on his YouTube channel, Basit said: ""Fakhar Zaman has been served show-cause notice, which means that coming days are not going to be good for him because of the mafia that sits in the PCB.""The 53-year-old former batsman went on to advise Zaman. ""I think Fakhar should talk to chairman Mohsin Naqvi. Otherwise, these guys will create problems for him,"" he said.Following Babar's exclusion from the Test squad, Zaman related the situation to Virat Kohli's lean phase and that India didn't drop their star batsman despite him losing his high-scoring touch.""It's concerning to hear suggestions about dropping Babar Azam. India didn't bench Virat Kohli during his rough stretch between 2020 and 2023, when he averaged 19.33, 28.21, and 26.50, respectively,"" Zaman wrote on X.""If we are considering sidelining our premier batsman, arguably the best Pakistan has ever produced, it could send a deeply negative message across the team. There is still time to avoid pressing the panic button; we should focus on safeguarding our key players rather than undermining them.""""Ladka toh boht bindaas hai, dil mein nahi rakhta baat, saaf bol deta hai (he is a brave guy, doesn't keep things inside, voices himself out clearly),"" said Basit about Zaman's comments.Zaman has been instructed to respond to the show cause notice by October 21, with his comments considered a breach of his player contract with the PCB.",Fakhar Zaman has been issued a show-cause notice by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

working hard to rediscover his game vs spin

BENGALURU: The noise surrounding Virat Kohli's struggle against spin has been mounting, only getting shriller as his ordinary numbers against tweakers has burgeoned. In the past 28 Test matches, Kohli has been dismissed by spinners on 21 occasions, with off-spinners doing the bulk of the damage.Like always, Kohli may have chosen to ignore the clatter, but given his penchant for detail and work ethic, he perhaps has been hard on himself. It showed on Monday at the M Chinnaswamy stadium when the former India skipper spent considerable time facing spinners in the nets. There were the odd deliveries where he second-guessed himself, but there were plenty of assured cuts and hoists over the infield, all of them executed with impeccable footwork.While making his mark in red-ball cricket as a youngster, Kohli found comfort at this venue. Back in 2012 against New Zealand, he clobbered a century (103) and an unconquered 51, runs that eventually proved crucial in India's five-wicket win.Staying with back stories, over the past eight years, Kohli has played against New Zealand in four home matches and, barring Trent Boult and Neil Wagner , none of the pacers managed to dismiss him. But he has faltered against the Kiwis' assembly line of spinners - Jeetan Patel, Ajaz Patel, Mitchell Santner and Rachin Ravindra .The recent series against Bangladesh again underscored Kohli's woes against spin. In four innings, he returned 99 runs and fell to off-spin twice. The tendency to play early or play against the spin has done him no favours.If ever Kohli needed a comfort zone, then this venue must offer that. This, after all, is his 'home' ground with Royal Challengers Bengaluru and the odds are that it could help him rediscover his mojo against spin.As Kohli looks to climb back among the runs, he's found a staunch supporter in head coach Gautam Gambhir . Speaking on his stuttering top-order bat, Gambhir said on Monday, ""You don't keep judging people after every game. It's not fair on them. It's a sport. People fail all the time. Everyone doesn't have the best days every day. My job is to back players and select the best playing 11.""Another subplot to the Kohli story is milestones. The 35-year-old is 53 runs shy of 9,000 runs, yet the 10,000 landmark is already being spoken about.While Gambhir didn't take the milestone bait, he outlined Kohli's hunger to excel.""He is a world-class cricketer,"" Gambhir said. ""He has performed for such a long period. And he is as hungry as when he made his debut. That is what makes him a world-class cricketer. I am sure that he will be hungry to get runs in this series, and probably moving forward to Australia as well. Once he starts scoring, he can be very consistent. I'm sure that he will be looking forward to these three Test matches and the series in Australia.""","Virat Kohli has been dismissed by spinners on 21 occasions in past 28 Test matches. In recent series against Bangladesh, he returned 99 runs and fell to off-spin twice. Royal Challengers Bengaluru head coach Gautam Gambhir has backed Kohli.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114232531,imgsize-80574,width-400,resizemode-4/114232531.jpg"

""(I am) very happy that they (teammates) are happy I did well. It can get frustrating knowing what you can do out there, and I have also felt I can do much better,” he admitted during the post-match presentation.The Kerala-born cricketer also acknowledged the challenges of inconsistent form but emphasized the importance of staying focused. ""Playing for your country, that pressure was there, but I wanted to perform and wanted to show. But I still kept it basic and wanted to take it by one ball (at a time),” Samson shared.Samson credited the team leadership for standing by him through ups and downs. “The leadership tells me they back me no matter what... not just in words but in actions also. Last series, I got two ducks and went back to Kerala thinking what will happen, but I'm here,” he said, grateful for the faith shown in him.","Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor gave a grand welcome to India’s cricket star Sanju Samson upon his return to Kerala, following his explosive maiden T20I century.

I think it was a knee-jerk reaction, new selectors in, the general opinion was that he needed rest and he was taken out of the squad completely.""Ramiz Raja adds, ""Now we need to understand that he sells cricket for Pakistan and this debate that's happening right now in Pakistan whether it's going to be another failure for Babar Azam or whether he's going to make a comeback and that keeps things interesting. Right now I don't see any saleable commodity in this Pakistan team, because sponsors are a little wary as well because Pakistan has been on the losing sequence and there are no real superstars playing in this Test match now.""The decision to leave out the top quartet for the final two Test matches against England - batter Babar Azam, former captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, and elite pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah-was supported by the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) on Tuesday.After suffering a historic loss by an innings and 47 runs in the first game of the series, Pakistan declared on Sunday that it was replacing its established stars with younger players, a move that caught the cricket world off guard.According to the PCB, the decision to drop players from the team was made with Pakistan's cricket team's best interests in mind.According to a PCB spokesman, the players were ""spared from the team to give them rest so that they can come back afresh,"" supporting the board's decision.The PCB's announcement of the decision to reorganize the men's selection committee before the decision. The selection committee has nominated Aleem Dar, Aaqib Javed, Azhar Ali, and Hassan Cheema as its new members.The four seasoned players have been replaced by Haseebullah, Mehran Mumtaz, Mohammad Ali, an off-spinner, Haseebullah, and Kamran Ghulam.",Ramiz Raja says Babar Azam's exclusion from Pakistan team was a 'knee-jerk reaction' The former cricketer-turned-commentator believes there are no real superstars in the Pakistan team.

India's head coach Gautam Gambhir has expressed confidence in Virat Kohli despite his recent performances, emphasising that the star batter is as committed as ever. Kohli, who has recorded only one half-century in his last eight innings, aims to improve his form in the upcoming Test series against New Zealand and the subsequent series against Australia .Gambhir highlighted Kohli's enduring passion for the game.""See, my thoughts about Virat have always been very clear that he is a world-class cricketer. He has performed for such a long period of time. He is as hungry as when he made his debut. To now, his hunger is always there,"" Gambhir said on Monday.Gautam Gambhir commented on Virat Kohli's performance, noting his ability to score consistently once he starts getting runs. He expressed optimism that Kohli will regain his form soon. Gambhir remarked, ""That hunger is what makes him a world-class cricketer. I am sure that he will be hungry to get runs in this series and probably moving forward to Australia as well.""He emphasized the importance of team results and supporting players throughout the season. ""Everyone doesn't have the best days every day. I think the kind of vibe we have is we keep backing our players. My job is to keep backing the players. My job is to keep selecting the best playing 11, not dropping anyone,"" Gambhir said.Gambhir also stressed that players should not be judged on a game-by-game basis. ""You don't keep judging people after every game. If you keep judging people after every game, that's not fair on them. It's a sport and people are bound to fail.""India is set to play eight more Test matches in the near future. Gambhir believes this period is crucial for the team’s performance.

The Pakistan women's team collapsed like a house of cards on Monday while chasing a victory and a place in the T20 World Cup semifinals, getting bowled out for just 56 against New Zealand in the penultimate group match of the tournament.After restricting New Zealand to a manageable 110 for 6, Pakistan first slipped to 28 for 5 and then crashed from 52 for 6 to 56 all out in 11.4 overs in an effort to win quickly to improve their net run rate and secure a semifinal berth.However, it's Australia and New Zealand who reached the semis from Group A, while India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were eliminated from the race.The win upset former Pakistan players and cricket experts, including ex-batsman Basit Ali .""It seemed like Pakistan were playing badminton, not cricket,"" said the 53-year-old Basit. ""Pakistan women's cricket chairperson is a badminton player. Badminton ki player cricket ki chairperson.""Tania Mallick, the Head of Women's Cricket in Pakistan, is a former national badminton champion.""I haven't seen such a team. You may lose 10 out of 10 matches, but I haven't seen a team dropping catches like that,"" said Basit about the butter fingers of the Pakistan team.""Mashallah, 11-12 catches chhorey, easy. Dolly, dolly, dolly!"" he said in sarcastic tone in a video on his YouTube channel.Basit praised Pakistan captain Fatima Sana who had lost her father a few days ago and went on to contribute the most runs (21) in her team's embarrassing collapse.Basit criticised the team's shot-selection and the drastic changes in the batting order in an effort to score quickly to win at the earliest.""Who got out on a good ball? Muneeba (Ali) played a cross-batted shot. They were getting run-out, playing bad shots. Sana Fatima lost her father recently; she played the best knock,"" he said.Extending his sarcasm to Pakistan men's defeat in the first Test against England despite scoring more than 500 in their first innings, Basit said that defeat possibly shook the women's team also.""I think the way Pakistan lost the first Test, it shocked the women's team as well and they too couldn't play...We know our team is weak, everybody knows that. But to lose like that...56 all out in 11.4 overs. It hurt me, personally,"" he said.""The way they changed the batting order, it was beyond me to comprehend.""","Pakistan women's team collapsed like a house of cards on Monday while chasing a victory and a place in the T20 World Cup semifinals.

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

BENGALURU: Captaincy is not unfamiliar territory for Tom Latham When New Zealand last played a Test in India - in 2021 in Mumbai - Latham stood in for an injured Kane Williamson . Since then he has stepped in for Tim Southee , who took over in 2022, on a few occasions. This series against India, coming on the back of New Zealand's 0-2 rout at the hands of Sri Lanka , will be Latham's first as full-time skipper.Given India's enviable record at home and the Black Caps' struggle in recent times, it will be a baptism by fire for the 32-year-old.""It's a huge, exciting privilege for me to be in this position,"" said Latham on the captaincy. ""I've been in this position before, have captained here in India, and have done it back home as well.""New Zealand are already out of the reckoning for a World Test Championship (WTC) final berth and the absence of Kane Williamson has added to the visitors' problems.""It's disappointing not to have Kane here. Fingers crossed, he'll be ready as soon as possible. It's disappointing when you miss a senior guy like Kane, but it gives opportunities for other guys to put their hand up,"" said Latham . Will Young will be the replacement, said Latham. ""Youngie will play and bat at No. 3. He's been in our squad for a long period. He's performed well in the past.""Southee, who relinquished captaincy after the debacle in Sri Lanka, has been struggling with form but could still find a place in the squad following a knee injury to Ben Sears .""Ben Sears has been ruled out, so if we do end up going with three seamers, then obviously Tim will come right into the equation.""As India start overwhelming favourites, Latham believes his team is not low on confidence. Notwithstanding the series loss to Sri Lanka, he said there were plenty of positives which he hopes will come handy in India.""I think that the first Test was a reasonably small margin in terms of defeat. But we did a lot of good stuff on the tour. From a batting point of view, you take away the first innings of the second Test. We changed our approach a little in terms of how we played and things unfolded. And we did that well,"" he added.",Tom Latham will captain New Zealand for the first time against India. The 32-year-old stood in for an injured Kane Williamson in the last Test in India. New Zealand lost the series 0-2 to Sri Lanka and are out of the World Test Championship final.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114268048,imgsize-62466,width-400,resizemode-4/114268048.jpg"

says 'roadmap has been set' for injured pacer's return to full fitness

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

BENGALURU: October 19, 2023 was a game changing day for Mohammed Shami . As India grappled with the injury to Hardik Pandya during the 50-over World Cup at home, the pacer, who was until then warming the bench, found himself on the field.The rest is history as the 34-year-old finished as the leading wicket taker of the World Cup, with 24 wickets from just seven matches.However, an Achilles tendon injury which needed surgery has kept Shami out since then. He wasn't available for the New Zealand series starting on Wednesday. The all-important five-Test away series in Australia is the next target but Shami is unlikely to make it Down Under.""Right now, it is pretty difficult for us to take a call on him, whether he will be fit for the Australia series ,"" skipper Rohit Sharma said here on Tuesday, adding: ""He recently had a setback. While he was in the process of getting close to 100% fit, he experienced swelling in his knee, which was quite unusual. That put him back a little bit in his recovery. So, he had to start afresh.""Shami, who hasn't featured in a Test match since the World Test Championship (WTC) final in June last year, is currently undergoing rehabilitation at theNational Cricket Academy (NCA). Rohit underlined that the team management will not rush Shami back.""We want him to be 100% fit. We don't want to take an undercooked Shami to Australia. He has not played cricket for a year, and it is quite tough for a fast bowler to come out and be at his best. It is not ideal. So, we want to give him enough time to recover,"" added Rohit.Shami will have to prove his match fitness in the Ranji Trophy before returning to international duty. ""A roadmap has been set. He is supposed to play a couple of games before (playing) international cricket. We will see where he is at after this New Zealand series, and then take a call, at what stage of Australia he will be fit for us,"" explained Rohit.","Mohammed Shami hasn't played a Test match since the World Test Championship (WTC) final in June last year.

'

HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN OUR LEADERSHIP GROUP'

BENGALURU: They are not called 'standbys' any more but 'travelling reserves' and their relevance and growth in Indian cricket is on the rise. This is especially true of the new breed of faster bowlers.Given the fact that India play eight Test matches from now until early Jan, there has been a lot of emphasis on workload management in Test cricket. With Mohammed Shami a doubtful starter and the five-Test Australia series being strenuous, India skipper Rohit Sharma on Tuesday stressed on bringing the pace resources together.For the home series against New Zealand, India have young pacers Harshit Rana (22-year-old), Mayank Yadav (22), Nitish Kumar Reddy (21) in the mix.Meanwhile, Karnataka's injury prone pacer Prasidh Krishna , the fourth travelling reserve, is learnt to have picked up an injury during the Ranji Trophy match against Madhya Pradesh, in which he bowled just eight overs.Barring Nitish, who has played 20 first-class matches, the other two are greenhorns in red-ball cricket and are unlikely to make the Test team soon.""In batting, there are a lot of options. We want to create the same with the bowlers. Hence, we try to keep them within the squad. If we feel they are ready to take that role, they should be ready for it. We just want to make sure that they are monitored well. Their workloads have been taken care of. Sometimes you have to fast-track someone and that is for the betterment of Indian cricket,"" reasoned Rohit.Rana and Mayank have impressed the leader. ""We want to create a pool where even if there are injuries, we have someone to step in quickly. Nitish and Harshit are talented individuals. In the future, they are going to provide a lot of stability to the team. Now, we want to see what they are capable of and what they have to offer.""Another pacer who may have to shoulder additional responsibility is Jasprit Bumrah , who has been named Rohit's deputy. With doubts about Rohit's availability for the early part of the Australia series, focus will be on Bumrah. The bowling spearhead, who led India in 2022 against England after Rohit tested positive for Covid-19, understands the team's requirements well, according to Rohit.""Bumrah and I have played a lot of cricket. He understands the game well and has got a good head on his shoulders. Tactically, I can't say much because he has not captained much.""When you are in a situation where you need a leader to step up, I think Bumrah will be one of them. He has always been in our leadership group,"" said Rohit.","India have young pacers Harshit Rana, Mayank Yadav and Nitish Kumar Reddy in the mix for the home series against New Zealand.

Rain may heavily impact first India-NZ Test starting today

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

BENGALURU: The only people who braved the relentless rain and made it to the M Chinnaswamy stadium on Tuesday were the ground staff.Continuous rain left roads in the city waterlogged and the traffic in a mess, but at the stadium, all was quiet and peaceful on the eve of the first India-New Zealand Test.More rain has been forecast for the next two days, jeopardising the first of three Tests between India and New Zealand. But if the elements relent by Wednesday morning, a game would be on, thanks to the state-of-the-art SubAir drainage system at the venue.Weather permitting, there will be plenty to look forward to from Rohit Sharma and Co. They have momentum on their side and will be keen to get as much game time as possible ahead of the meatier five-Test away series in Australia next month.For over a decade, India have dominated at home, quite unlike any other Test-playing side, a fact that has been rarely acknowledged amid the euphoria surrounding the country's white ball success. An 18-series winning streak at home underlines their mastery of the format.The Indians have been fine ambassadors of the long format, putting those who believe Test cricket has a foot in the grave to shame with a fearless, exciting brand of cricket.They have consigned talk of surfaces and advantages to the bin, owning every pitch they have played on. They have conjured wins from near-impossible situations and their star cast has fired the imagination.Head coach Gautam Gambhir on Monday underlined the team's philosophy, which is to produce an environment where players employ their natural instincts without the fear of failure.The home series against England offered ample proof of the emerging talent. Five players - Sarfaraz Khan, Rajat Patidar, Dhruv Jurel, Akash Deep and Devdutt Padikkal - made their debut and were impressive.The team without Virat Kohli , KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant won the series 4-1. The think-tank's eye for detail and investment in the future is reflected in their pick of the travelling reserves.As skipper Rohit Sharma said, ""I understand that some of them have not played a lot of red ball cricket, but when you see talent, you want to try and groom it and bring it as close to the team (standard) as possible.""In a short period, they have shown they have some ability. We want to keep them with the team and see whether they will be ready for international cricket, especially Test cricket. We want to create a bench strength. We don't want to be worried or too heavily reliant on a few individuals.""Against the red-hot home side, the Black Caps will have their task cut out. Coming off a two-match thrashing in Sri Lanka, among the few positives they will take from the loss to the Islanders is acclimatisation to sub-continental conditions, especially since their one-off Test against Afghanistan was abandoned in Noida last month.Among the batters, barring Rachin Ravindra (153), Kane Williamson (138) and to some extent Glenn Philips (131), the others hardly got an eye in. To compound the visitors' woes, Williamson has been ruled out of at least the first Test with a groin strain.If there was a sunny side to the annihilation in Lanka, it would be the familiarity with conditions the bowlers experienced after toiling against a formidable home side.There is a cloud of uncertainty about Tim Southee making the cut but given the overcast conditions and the variety at his disposal, his place in the XI may just be safe.","Heavy rain in Bengaluru prevented both teams from training while keeping the groundsmen busy at the Chinnaswamy stadium.

This win marked their biggest margin of triumph against the Caribbean side and their sixth-largest in T20Is.Defending a target of 163, Sri Lanka's spin-heavy attack dismantled the West Indies batting lineup, bundling them out for a mere 89 runs in 16.1 overs.This total was the West Indies' lowest against Sri Lanka in T20Is and their sixth-lowest overall. The spinners claimed nine wickets, exploiting the deteriorating pitch conditions.Debutant all-rounder Dunith Wellalage shone with figures of 3-9 in his four overs, while Maheesh Theekshana , Charith Asalanka, and Wanindu Hasaranga chipped in with two wickets each.The West Indies struggled from the outset, losing both openers within the first four overs and limping to 21-3 by the end of the powerplay.Earlier, Sri Lanka's total of 162 was built on a solid 72-run opening stand between Kusal Mendis and Pathum Nissanka Nissanka top-scored with 54 off 49 balls, hitting nine fours and a six.

""The selectors will breathe a sigh of relief"" 😅 | Nasser Hussain and Urooj Mumtaz review Day One

NEW DELHI: Former England captain Nasser Hussain was quick to heap praise on Pakistan’s Test debutant Kamran Ghulam , drawing comparisons to Australia’s Steve Smith for the 29-year-old’s balance of aggression and resilience at the crease.Ghulam made an unforgettable impact on Tuesday, guiding his team out of early trouble with a masterful century against England in the second Test at Multan.Nasser Hussain, speaking on Sky Sports, praised Ghulam’s adaptability in tricky conditions. “He had to wait his turn. He's been scoring prolific runs in the last three years. He got the right balance between attack and defence,” Hussain said.Hussain was particularly struck by Ghulam’s “swagger” at the crease, noting how the debutant seamlessly switched between attacking strokes and defensive solidity. He likened Ghulam’s footwork and defensive technique to that of Steve Smith, adding, “He's got a bit of Steve Smith about him when he defends the ball and charges. He's got a bit of swagger about him.”Ghulam was brought into the squad as a replacement for Pakistan’s star batter, Babar Azam , and he rose to the occasion in spectacular fashion.His innings of 118 off 224 balls was the backbone of Pakistan’s recovery after they found themselves reeling at 19 for 2.By stumps on Day 1, Pakistan had clawed their way to 259/5, thanks largely to Ghulam’s determined knock.Facing a probing England attack, Ghulam handled pressure with ease. Jack Leach , who had removed both Pakistani openers, was expertly neutralised by Ghulam. His 149-run stand with Saim Ayub (77) was critical in stabilising Pakistan’s innings.Ghulam’s century, which came off 192 balls, was a gritty display of mental toughness and technical skill.His innings included 11 boundaries and a six, with frequent strike rotation to keep England’s bowlers under pressure. It was a debut to remember—one that not only gave Pakistan hope but also hinted at a bright future for Ghulam at the international level.","Kamran Ghulam made an unforgettable impact on Tuesday, guiding his team out of early trouble with a masterful century against England in the second Test at Multan. Former England captain Nasser Hussain was quick to heap praise on Pakistan’s Test debutant. Hussain likened the 29-year-old's footwork and defensive technique to that of Steve Smith.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114259897,imgsize-48632,width-400,resizemode-4/114259897.jpg"

After hitting that blistering hundred against Bangladesh in the third T20 in Hyderabad three days ago, Sanju Samson broadened his horizons and revealed his burning ambition to play Test cricket for India.With the BCCI making it clear that all Indian team players must play domestic cricket when they are not on national duty, Samson will be playing Kerala’s second-round Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka at Alur, starting on Friday.“Before the Duleep Trophy, the leadership group sent me a message saying that they were looking at me as a red-ball option too and asked me to play Ranji Trophy. The Duleep Trophy performance (scoring a hundred) helped. I believe that I can play all three formats. I don’t want to be restricted to white-ball cricket. I have the desire to play Tests for India. I played well in the Ranji Trophy before and I want to do well in the coming days as well,” the 29-year-old said at a media interaction in Thiruvananthapuram.Samson also clarified that while discussions are ongoing regarding his batting slot, he is open to playing at any position. “I have trust in my ability and from No.1 to No.6, I have the skillset to bat anywhere.”Samson admitted that he felt pressure after failing in Sri Lanka. “When you fail in a match and when you walk out to bat for the next, there will be tension. Even the great players have said that. So I felt that pressure when I went out to bat after scoring two ducks. While there is pressure on one side, on the other side I know what I can do in this format (T20) and have the confidence to deliver.”He also praised the new captain-coach combo of Suryakumar Yadav and Gautam Gambhir for building confidence amongst the players.“Surya has great communication skills. He is straightforward and gives us role clarity. Every player in Team India is getting that clarity. He is supporting the players and backing them. Surya is doing a lot of things which a leader should do. Players enjoy that trust and they can perform well.”Samson feels that Gambhir has backed him right from the time he took charge of the team. “Gautam said, you will have my support. I know the kind of player you are, and I have been seeing you for many years. You try to enjoy your batting. We are all there for you. Getting that kind of confidence from a coach is crucial for a player,” revealed Samson.",Sanju Samson has revealed his burning ambition to play Test cricket for India.

On the first ball, Nissanka mistimed a heave, but the ball deflected off his pads and rolled to the boundary for four leg byes. The unlucky start rattled Joseph, setting the stage for what followed—an unforgettable exhibition of fearless batting.On the next delivery, Nissanka danced down the track, meeting a 138kmph length ball with authority.

NEW DELHI: Debutant Kamran Ghulam expressed the significant pressure he felt to deliver a strong performance after being selected to replace Babar Azam in the team. On Tuesday, he rose to the challenge by scoring a determined century in his first Test match .Ghulam acknowledged that his unwavering dedication and hard work in domestic cricket over the past four years had finally yielded the desired results.The debutant's impressive feat was achieved on a challenging recycled pitch in Multan, where Pakistan reached a total of 259 for 5 at the end of the first day of the second Test against England .By scoring 118 runs off 224 balls while batting at the No. 4 position, which is usually occupied by Babar Azam, Ghulam became the 13th Pakistani batsman to achieve a century in his debut Test match.

I had so much passion and wanted to do well when I got the chance,"" Kamran told mediapersons after the day's play.""I waited patiently as I knew sooner or later I would get my chance.

Scotland frustrated Cristiano Ronaldo 's Portugal in a 0-0 draw at Hampden on Tuesday to avoid losing five consecutive competitive games for the first time ever.The home side needed a wonder save from Craig Gordon to deny Bruno Fernandes a winner in the closing stages, but held out to secure their first point in the top tier of the Nations League .Portugal remain on top of Group A1 but were made to wait to book their place in March's quarter-finals.On his 216th international appearance, Ronaldo made his 200th start for his country, more than 21 years on from his first.However, the 39-year-old failed to add to his 133 Portugal goals and stormed off the field at full-time ranting at the officials.Scotland have won just one of their last 16 games - a 2-0 friendly victory over Gibraltar in June - and remain without a victory in a competitive match for over a year.But Steve Clarke 's men battled hard to stop the rot in Glasgow.Scotland even had the best chance of the first half inside the opening five minutes whenScott McTominay headed too close to Diogo Costa from point-blank range.Portugal quickly took control of possession without creating clear-cut chances.Francisco Conceicao spooned over early in the second period from Ronaldo 's lay-off.Ronaldo then fired inches wide after making himself room for a shot amid a flurry of desperate challenges from Scottish defenders.But it was Fernandes who had the best chance to claim all three points when the Manchester United captain's powerful low strike was brilliantly parried by Gordon and collected at the second attempt by the 41-year-old goalkeeper.Scotland are still on course for relegation from the top tier of the Nations League as they trail Poland, who drew 3-3 with Croatia, by three points with two games remaining.Croatia sit second, three points behind the Portuguese, who they host next month.","Portugal remain on top of Group A1 but were made to wait to book their place in March's quarter-finals.

French soccer star Kylian Mbappe 's representatives have rejected as ""false and irresponsible"" reports in Swedish media saying he is the subject of a rape investigation in the Nordic country.Without citing sources, several Swedish media including tabloids Expressen and Aftonbladet and broadcasters SVT and TV4 reported that the Real Madrid striker was the subject of a rape claim following a visit to Stockholm last week.In response to the reports, Swedish prosecutors issued a brief statement Tuesday saying a rape had been reported to police, but didn't name any suspect.""According to the report the incident took place on Oct. 10, 2024, at a hotel in central Stockholm,"" said the statement published by the Swedish Prosecution Authority .Prosecutor Marina Chirakova, who is leading that investigation, declined to give any further details.""From my side I cannot confirm whether there is a suspect in the case,"" she told The Associated Press.Names of suspects are typically not made public by Swedish authorities until charges are filed or a suspect is ordered held in pre-trial detention.Mbappe's communications team accused Swedish media of spreading ""slanderous"" rumors.""These accusations are totally false and irresponsible, and their propagation is unacceptable,"" they said in a statement sent to the AP and other media. ""Kylian Mbappe will under no circumstances tolerate his integrity, reputation and honor being sullied by unfounded insinuations.""In a post late Monday on his official X account Mbappe wrote ""FAKE NEWS!!!!"" and linked to a French article picking up the Swedish reports.He appeared to draw a link between the reports in Sweden and a hearing in Paris on Tuesday in a legal dispute with former club Paris Saint-Germain over unpaid wages.""It's becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance,"" the post said in French.Mbappe's lawyers didn't comment as they arrived for and left the hearing in Paris on Tuesday.Later Tuesday, a lawyer for Mbappe, Marie-Alix Canu-Bernard, told French broadcaster TF1 that her client was ""bewildered"" by the reports.""We are told that a complaint has been lodged, but at this stage we don't even know against whom.

Thomas Tuchel is set to be named England's new manager after agreeing a deal with the Football Association (FA), multiple British and German media outlets reported on Tuesday.The Times, Sky Sports, the BBC and German newspaper Bild said that Tuchel, 51, will be named as the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate .The FA declined to comment on the reports but said that CEO Mark Bullingham will provide an update on Wednesday at Wembley Stadium when the appointment is expected to be confirmed.The German, who has been out of work since leaving Bayern Munich at the end of last season, would become just the third foreign manager of the Three Lions after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.Sky Germany reported he will sign an 18-month deal from January 1, 2025 until the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup.A former coach of Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern, Tuchel has the trophy-winning pedigree that the FA is seeking to help end a 58-year wait to win a major tournament.However, the move has drawn criticism over the FA's unwillingness to trust an English coach with its top job.Tuchel won league titles at PSG and Bayern and the German Cup with Dortmund, but his greatest success came during his time in English football at Chelsea.He led the Blues to Champions League glory just months after taking charge in 2021 and also won the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup with the London club.Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 in a bold early move by Chelsea's new ownership group that did not pay off.Just six months later he was appointed Bayern boss and led them to an 11th consecutive Bundesliga title.However, Tuchel also oversaw the demise of Bayern's dominance of German football in a first trophyless campaign last season for 12 years.Lee Carsley was put in temporary charge of England in August following Southgate's resignation shortly after losing the final of Euro 2024 .However, the 50-year-old, who stepped up from his role as under-21s manager, has since given mixed messages about whether he wanted the job on a permanent basis.Despite winning three of his four games in charge, Carsley's case was further damaged by a 2-1 Nations League defeat to Greece last week and he backed the idea of appointing a foreign coach if they are the right candidate.""We've seen in the past that we've had different nationalities coach the team. The best candidate should get the job,"" said Carsley.""I think we'd be putting ourselves in a corner if we didn't, and we didn't open our minds a bit.""Carsley could still remain in charge for games against Greece and the Republic of Ireland next month if Tuchel does not take over until the new year.Tuchel will inherit a richly talented generation of players, including Harry Kane , Jude Bellingham and Cole Palmer, that will be among the favourites for World Cup glory in 2026.Kane was signed by Tuchel for Bayern last year and scored 44 goals in 45 matches under his tutelage.""Obviously, I know Thomas well from last year,"" Kane told Sky Germany. ""Fantastic coach, fantastic person, so I am sure the guys at the FA will contact me when they know more about it.""Southgate led the Three Lions to back-to-back Euros finals, plus a World Cup semi-final and quarter-final in his four major tournaments in charge.England, though, are still yet to win a major men's tournament since the 1966 World Cup.","Thomas Tuchel is set to be named England's new manager after agreeing a deal.

Montevideo, Oct 16, 2024 -Lionel Messi struck a vintage hat trick as world champions Argentina romped to a 6-0 win over Bolivia in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying on Tuesday.The 37-year-old provided an emphatic reminder of his enduring quality with three clinical finishes, two assists and some of his trademark creativity throughout the game as Lionel Scaloni's side dominated.The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner opened the scoring in the 19th minute when Bolivian defender Marcelo Suarez was robbed by Lautaro Martinez, who sent Messi clear and he cleverly slotted into the bottom corner.The home crowd at Buenos Aires' Monumental Stadium were on their feet again in the 43rd minute when Julian Alvarez threaded a brilliant pass through to Messi, who unselfishly squared the ball to Martinez to finish.Three minutes later, Alvarez was on target himself when Bolivia were caught sleeping at a free-kick, Messi chipping the ball over the top and the Atletico Madrid forward slotted home.After the break, Nicolas Otamendi had a header ruled out for offside but the home fans didn't have long to wait for the fourth when Thiago Almada side-footed home after a superb pull-back from Nahuel MolinaA classic Messi goal made it 5-0 in the 84th -- the Inter Miami forward dribbling centrally before switching from his left foot to his right and burying the ball into the bottom corner.Two minutes later and some fans were in tears after Messi cut in from the right, played a smart wall pass off substitute Nico Paz and again put the ball beyond the reach of goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra.Argentina are top of the 10-team table with 22 points from ten games — three points clear of second placed Colombia, who also enjoyed a handsome victory with a 4-0 crushing of Chile in Barranquilla.There was a different look to the team, wearing a special retro white kit, marking the Colombian Football Federation's centenary, featuring the national flag's colours in a hoop.It was a dashing design and the performance of Nestor Lorenzo's team was equally stylish as they took apart a woeful Chile side that remain rooted to bottom place in the ten-team qualifying group.Defender Davinson Sanchez opened the scoring in the 34th minute, nodding home after Jhon Lucumi had headed a James Rodriguez corner goalwards.Jhon Cordoba slotted home a Diaz cross in the 45th minute but the effort was ruled out for offside against Diaz.Chile gifted the Colombians a second, seven minutes after the interval, when they attempted to play the ball out from the back and Benjamin Kusevic gave the ball away to Rodriguez, who squared to Liverpool winger Luis Diaz to convert.Substitute Jhon Duran made it 3-0 in the 82nd minute after another giveaway, this time in midfield, allowed Sinisterra to break and then feed the Aston Villa forward, who made no mistake and Sinisterra then wrapped up the win in stoppage time.Paraguay boosted their chances of grabbing one of the six automatic qualification spots after substitute Antonio Sanabria scored twice in a 2-1 win over Venezuela.Full-back Jon Aramburu put Venezuela ahead in the 25th minute, bursting down the right and collecting a pass from Yeferson Soteldo that he buried in the bottom corner.Torino striker Sanabria was introduced at the interval and he brought sixth-placed Paraguay level when he slid in to meet a low cross from Junior Alonso.Sanabria then grabbed the winner in the 74th minute, leading a counter-attack before getting into the box to finish off the move with a header from close range.Uruguay and Ecuador played out a goalless draw and Brazil were playing Peru later on Tuesday.",Argentina beat Bolivia 6-0 in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.

NEW DELHI: The Nigerian national football team found themselves in a distressing situation as they were reportedly stranded at an airport in Libya , devoid of food and water, mere 24 hours before their crucial match against the host nation.Libya, however, expressed their discontent, alleging that they were subjected to 'poor treatment' during their visit to Nigeria.As tensions escalate ahead of the return leg, Nigeria 's players have been left exasperated by their current predicament, with Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi going as far as to suggest that they were being held 'hostage' by their hosts.In the previous encounter between the two sides, which took place in Nigeria as part of the African Cup of Nations qualifiers, the Super Eagles emerged victorious with a narrow 1-0 margin, thanks to a late goal from Fissayo Dele-Bashiru.According to media reports, the Nigerian players and team officials were virtually held hostage for over 12 hours at Al Abraq International Airport , which was about three hours away by road to Benghazi , the venue of Tuesday's match against Libya.The plane, carrying both players and officials, was unexpectedly rerouted from its original destination of Benghazi to Al Abraq, a smaller airport primarily used for hajj operations, while in mid-flight.Upon landing at Al Abraq, the Nigerian team found themselves stranded without any support from the Libyan Football Federation . The host team neglected to make the necessary arrangements to transport the team to Benghazi, leaving them in a difficult position.The vehicle arranged for the trip by the officials of Super Eagles was also not allowed to access the airport further compounding the challenges faced by the Nigerian team.As a result, the Nigerian team withdrew from their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya on Monday, according to captain William Troost-Ekong.","The Nigerian national football team were stranded at an airport in Libya.

Every kid watches cartoons, right? But I didn’t watch cartoons. I just used to watch sports, tennis specially.“So, my parents were like, ‘she likes it.We have to put her on to that’. So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.
