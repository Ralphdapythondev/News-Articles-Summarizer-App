T20 World Cup Super 8s: Cues for India from Windies win against Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-super-8s-cues-for-india-from-windies-win-against-afghanistan/articleshow/111099511.cms,"Rohit & Co may look to take Afghan pacers apart before spin comes into play

BRIDGETOWN: A sudden shower that lasted for about an hour in varying intensity on Monday night brought the humidity down a bit here after a hard day’s work. It continued for a bit on Tuesday morning as well, but the Indian contingent, and all those all around the team, would hope that it was just a one-off.Rain is the last thing that they would want on game-day against Afghanistan in Super-8s.Especially after what they saw of the Afghans in St Lucia in their last league game on Monday before they flew down to Barbados to take on the mighty Indians. Rohit Sharma would desperately want the game not to be curtailed, because in a 20-over contest on a good pitch --- as was the case in St Lucia and would be at Kensington Oval as well --- India are far ahead of the Afghans.To add to that, Monday’s game left a crucial pointer as to how India should go about their work on Thursday. West Indies top-order batters Johnson Charles and Nicholas Pooran launched a brutal assault on the Afghan pacers Fazalhaq Farooqi and Azmatullah Omarzai, plundering 92 off the first six overs that virtually killed the game for the Afghans. But over the next 14 overs, once the spinners came into operation, the likes of Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmed were able to curtail the West Indians, even though Rashid went for a massive 28-run last over towards the end, courtesy a rampaging Pooran.India will surely take a cue from this game and look to do maximum damage right at the top before Afghanistan spinners can get into the game. Given the fact that it’s a day game and there will be no dew, it won’t be a bad idea to bat first and take the game away from Afghanistan, unless of course, there is a lot of moisture on the day of the match.Virat Kohli , during the practice sessions here, is trying to be at his attacking best. For Rohit Sharma in T20s, it’s always top-gear cricket and the duo will look to push on the accelerator right from the word go. And India’s No. 3 for the tournament Rishabh Pant , too, has been in fine form and the team would love at least two of the three to take charge so that the Afghans don’t find a footing.For Afghanistan, the turnaround time from a heavy 104-run defeat is very short, especially when they are up against a team that they have never beaten. Coach Jonathan Trott tried to take the lessons from a defeat.""We have seen the areas that we need to work on…If we don’t start an over well, being able to get out of it without too much damage is something we need to do. Today we had two that went for 60 runs and that swung the game massively and took a lot of pressure off the next 18 overs,"" Trott said.But Afghanistan definitely lack the depth in their pace attack that can seriously threaten India. It’s one area where India --- with Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj and Hardik Pandya --- are so vastly superior that for the Afghan warriors, it can be a bridge too far.Or, at least that’s what all the Indian fans trooping into Barbados from different parts of the US and Canada believe, along with the millions back home. We will all know in a couple of days’ time!",Rain is the last thing that India would want on game-day against Afghanistan in Super-8s. Rohit Sharma would desperately want the game not to be curtailed. Monday’s game left a crucial pointer as to how India should go about their work on Thursday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111099694,imgsize-56216,width-400,resizemode-4/111099694.jpg"

That displays good batsmanship and that is what I try,"" said Suryakumar during a media interaction here on Tuesday.""It's difficult to generate that force when there's no pace on the wicket and when someone has read your game nicely. So, at that time, you have to be very smart how you want to extend your innings.""You have to change according to the situation, what team demands at that moment and talk to your partner who is inside, calm your nerves down and then take the innings ahead.""Suryakumar is eager to showcase his versatile batting style once again in the West Indies, although he didn't face any significant challenges with the conditions in the United States.""I was happy playing there as well (laughs). It's not that we weren't happy playing there, but we were playing for the first time, so yes, the conditions were different and little challenging as well. But we have played here (in West Indies), we know the conditions.""The Kensington Oval pitch has a distinct brownish appearance, which the Indian team also observed during their previous tour of the Caribbean.""The practice pitches, yeah, they were a little spicy in New York. It was fresh. They made the conditions after they got to know there is a World Cup there. Here they have been making pictures regularly and they are much better than (USA),"" he said.The spinners have been doing well in the Caribbean conditions so far in the tournament but Suryakumar is not perturbed.""That has always been my strong point (sweeps and reverse sweeps). I've tried to play the same way that I do in the practice sessions.""In a strategic move, Virat Kohli has been paired with captain Rohit Sharma to open the batting, while Rishabh Pant has been elevated to the number three position. The question remains: if India suffers early wicket losses, will Suryakumar adapt his approach to the situation""Nothing like that has happened. We try to play the format of the game. If there are early wickets you still have to put runs on the board and bat with that same intent.

The wrist-spin of Kuldeep Yadav is expected to be in the mix when India resume their T20 World Cup campaign in the 'Super 8s' stage in Barbados with the game against Afghanistan on Thursday.Skipper Rohit Sharma has emphasized the importance of using four all-rounders to maintain balance in the playing XI. That leaves the decision on the Indian thinktank if they want to tinker with their group-stage strategy and drop a pacer to bring Kuldeep into the playing eleven.Despite being India's top spinner across all formats, Kuldeep was not included in the eleven during the first stage. The team opted for three specialist pacers and two finger-spinners, Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja, which allowed for batting depth until number 8.If the pitch offers the same level of turn as seen in the nets in Bridgetown, bringing Kuldeep in the frame will become a no-brainer. However, it is difficult to predict the pitch behaviour until the actual game day. The wicket could favour batting, as evidenced by Australia's impressive score of 201 against their rivals England during the initial stage of the tournament.During Tuesday's practice session, Kuldeep had an extended bowling session. He bowled to Rohit and Virat Kohli, who practiced the slog sweep against the wrist spinner.Kuldeep could be seen simulating a particular field placement while bowling to Rohit, who found it tough tackling the spinner at the start of the net session as head coach Rahul Dravid watched on.""The pitch should turn in the middle as well, may be not as much as it is doing in the nets but will definitely turn. The spinners have proved quite useful throughout the Caribbean thus far. I don't think India will make any changes, they would not want to compromise on their batting,"" a former international player, who was present at the venue, told PTI.Kohli, eager to regain his scoring touch, dedicated a significant portion of his time to batting practice. He began with an extended session of throwdowns before shifting to the adjacent net, where he faced the spin of Kuldeep and the pace of left-armer Khaleel Ahmed.The entire squad, consisting of 15 players, attended the training session on Monday, two days prior to the upcoming game.

This run-out climaxed the West Indies' innings at 218 for five, marking the highest score of the tournament so far.In response, Afghanistan managed only 114 runs in 16.2 overs.

NEW DELHI: Gary Kirsten , the head coach of the Pakistan cricket team , has expressed his deep disappointment and frustration with the team's performance in the ongoing T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies.In a scathing criticism, Kirsten stated that there is ""no unity"" within the team, and he has ""never seen such a situation"" throughout his extensive coaching career.Pakistan's dismal showing in the tournament culminated in a group stage exit, a far cry from their runner-up finish in the previous edition.The team's lackluster performance was marked by a shocking defeat against tournament debutants USA, followed by a loss to their arch-rivals India. Pakistan managed to salvage some pride with a consolation victory over Ireland, but it was too little, too late.According to PTI, reports from Pakistani media outlets suggest that Kirsten, who famously led India to their ODI World Cup victory in 2011, did not mince his words when assessing the team's shortcomings after their elimination from the T20 World Cup.His candid remarks underscore the urgent need for the Pakistan cricket team to address the apparent lack of cohesion and unity within their ranks if they hope to bounce back from this disappointing campaign.""There's no unity in Pakistan's team. They call it a team, but it isn't a team. They aren't supporting each other; everyone is separated, left and right. I've worked with many teams, but I've never seen such a situation,"" Kirsten said as per reports quoting a senior scribe.According to sources cited by Geosuper.tv 4, Kirsten conveyed his dissatisfaction regarding the players' fitness levels. He also mentioned that the team's skill level is significantly lower compared to other teams worldwide.Following Pakistan's loss against India, Kirsten attributed the team's defeat to subpar decision-making on their part.""Disappointing loss, that's for sure,"" Kirsten had said.""I knew 120 was not going to be an easy target. If India got only 120, it was always going to be not the easiest. But I think we had the game at 72 for 2 with six or seven overs left. Disappointing not to get across the line from the position we got ourselves into.""Pakistan emerged victorious against Ireland by a margin of three wickets in their final encounter of the T20 World Cup on Sunday.Prior to their last group stage match, Pakistan had already been knocked out of the tournament due to their losses against the USA and India.By securing a win against Ireland, Pakistan managed to claim the third position in Group A, having achieved two victories out of their four matches played in the event.","Gary Kirsten, head coach of Pakistan cricket team, has expressed his disappointment and frustration with the team's performance in the T20 World Cup. Kirsten stated that there is ""no unity"" within the team, and he has ""never seen such a situation"" throughout his extensive coaching career. Pakistan's dismal showing in the tournament culminated in a group stage exit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111063296,imgsize-32886,width-400,resizemode-4/111063296.jpg"
T20 World Cup: Lockie Ferguson's record spell hands New Zealand consolation win over PNG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-lockie-fergusons-record-spell-hands-new-zealand-consolation-win-over-png/articleshow/111066590.cms,"|

NEW DELHI: Lockie Ferguson made history with the most economical spell in T20Is as New Zealand ended their World Cup campaign with a dominant seven-wicket win over Papua New Guinea in Trinidad on Monday.Ferguson's stunning spell of 4-4-0-3 helped New Zealand bowl out PNG for just 78 in 19.4 overs. The Kiwis then chased down the target with 46 balls to spare.Ferguson's performance was remarkable as he joined Canada’s Saad Bin Zafar as only the second bowler in T20I history to bowl all four overs as maidens and return with three or more wickets. Zafar had previously recorded 4-4-0-2.Despite New Zealand’s strong showing against Oman and PNG in the Group stage, they were ousted from the T20 World Cup after earlier losses to Afghanistan and West Indies, which led to their early elimination from the tournament.PNG faced its own challenges, losing each of its four Group C fixtures.New Zealand's bowlers, led by Ferguson, consistently troubled the PNG batters.Kabua Morea put up a fight for PNG, dismissing Finn Allen for a duck on the second ball of New Zealand’s chase and later taking the wicket of Rachin Ravindra.Devon Conway was pivotal with a 32-ball 35, including three sixes and two fours, laying a solid foundation for the win. Skipper Kane Williamson and Daryl Mitchell then ensured the chase was completed smoothly.Earlier in the match, Ferguson's magical spell restricted PNG to a low score. New Zealand’s bowlers successfully kept PNG’s batters on the defensive throughout their innings.Trent Boult played his last T20 World Cup match, starting with a tight two-run over. Tim Southee struck first, getting PNG opener Tony Ura caught at deep backward point. Boult didn’t take any new-ball wickets, but Ferguson struck immediately with his first delivery, dismissing Assad Vala.The pacer continued to dominate, preventing PNG from scoring off his next three overs. His second wicket came when he trapped Charles Amini lbw, adding to his tally.Mitchell Santner chipped in by dismissing Sese Bay, who was caught by Finn Allen at long-on attempting an aggressive shot. Ferguson completed his spell without conceding a run, later removing Chad Soper who edged to the keeper.Ferguson matched the record set by Zafar, who was the first to bowl four maidens in a T20I back in November 2021 against Panama during the T20 World Cup Americas Region Qualifier.Boult returned to the attack, cleaning up Hiri Hiri for his first wicket of the match. Southee took another wicket shortly afterward, dismissing Kiplin Doriga.Ish Sodhi, who had struggled initially, grabbed two late wickets to wrap up the PNG innings in the final over.The comprehensive win marked New Zealand's exit from the tournament with their heads held high.",Lockie Ferguson's spell of 4-4-0-3 helped New Zealand bowl out PNG for just 78 in 19.4 overs.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo is on the brink of making history. He could become the first player to compete in six European Championships when Portugal faces the Czech Republic .The Czech Republic, though, is no easy opponent, marking their eighth consecutive appearance in the tournament.The match is set to commence at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT) on Tuesday, ensuring an exciting showdown.This will be the fourth European Championship meeting between these two nations. The Czechs won their first encounter in 1996, while Portugal secured victories in 2008 and 2012.Portugal has dominated the recent clashes, winning the last four games. The Czechs have struggled to score in the past three matches against Portugal.Both teams progressed to the knockout stage of the 2021 European Championship, with defending champions Portugal being eliminated by Belgium in the round of 16, and the Czech Republic falling to Denmark in the quarterfinals.Portugal secured the Euro 2016 title, while the Czechs' last victory dates back to 1976 when they were part of Czechoslovakia. The legendary Antonín Panenka clinched their triumph with an unforgettable penalty, inspiring the famous Panenka technique attempted by players like Spain's Sergio Ramos.Roberto Martínez , who previously coached Belgium and orchestrated Portugal's exit in the last edition, now takes charge of the Portuguese team. Under his leadership, Portugal dominated the Euro 2024 qualifiers, winning all their matches while scoring an impressive 36 goals and conceding only two.Despite Portugal's star-studded attacking lineup, which includes talents like João Félix, Gonçalo Ramos, and Rafael Leão, Cristiano Ronaldo remains the center of attention. The superstar's presence drew enthusiastic fans to Portugal's training session, where some had to be escorted off the field while attempting to take selfies with Ronaldo.Ronaldo, who already holds the records for most goals (14) and appearances (25) at the tournament, continues to showcase his prowess on the field, as evidenced by his recent performance against Ireland.Patrik Schick , the Czech Republic's prolific striker and joint top-scorer at the 2021 European Championship alongside Ronaldo, poses a significant threat to opposing defenses.If Pepe takes the field, he could become the oldest player to participate in a European Championship, surpassing the record set by Hungary goalkeeper Gábor Király at Euro 2016.The UEFA European Championship 2024 Group F match between Portugal and Czech Republic is set for June 18, Tuesday.The game will be held in Red Bull arena, Leipzig, Germany, with a kick off time of 12:30 AM IST.In India and the Indian subcontinent, you can catch all UEFA Euro 2024 matches on Sony Sports Network, which has acquired the broadcast rights.For English commentary, tune into Sony Sports Ten 2 SD & HD.

NEW DELHI: Georgia is set to make its first appearance at a major soccer tournament, facing Turkey in Group F of the European Championship. The match will be held in Dortmund at 6 pm local time (1600 GMT), with Portugal and the Czech Republic completing the group.Although Georgia is a newcomer to Euro 2024 , the nation has a significant connection to the tournament's history. In 1960, three Georgian players were part of the Soviet Union team that won the inaugural title.To celebrate the national team's milestone, Georgia issued commemorative stamps and special coins.The team will heavily depend on Khvicha Kvaratskhelia , the star player who has excelled at Napoli over the past two seasons, including being named MVP in their Serie A championship campaign of 2022-23.Turkey, once considered promising outsiders in the previous Euros, underperformed by losing all three group games and scoring only one goal. Despite winning a qualifying group that included Croatia, the national team has garnered less attention this time.Vincenzo Montella , a former Italy striker, unexpectedly found himself coaching Turkey after spending two years as the coach of Turkish club Adana Demirspor. He assumed the position in September 2023.In a touching display of support, a moped driver traveled 4,000 kilometers (about 2,500 miles) over 12 days to deliver a Georgian flag covered in messages of encouragement from people back home to the team at its training base in Germany.Kvaratskhelia, aged 23, boasts an impressive record of 15 goals in 30 games for Georgia. On the other hand, Turkey's recent form has been disappointing, failing to secure a win in their last five matches, including a 2-1 defeat to Poland in a warm-up game for Euro 2024.The UEFA European Championship 2024 Group F match between Turkey and Georgia is set for June 18, Tuesday.The game will take place at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund, Germany, with kickoff at 9:30 PM IST.In India and the Indian subcontinent, UEFA Euro 2024 matches can be viewed on Sony Sports Network.

Opener Smriti Mandhana was the saving grace with a well-paced century.When on a song, these Indian batters can make any team sweat with their skill sets. But with experienced medium pacers — Ayabonga Khaka and Masabata Klaas — in their ranks, South Africa can trouble India if they get assistance from the pitch.On the other hand, India’s bowlers, especially leg-spinner Asha Sobhana — after an impressive four-wicket haul on Sunday — will be keen to perform well once again. With off-spinner Deepti Sharma and pacer Renuka Singh too in their bowling line-up, India have the variety and depth to trouble the visitors.With Asha, who plays for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the WPL, well acquainted with the Chinnaswamy surface, she is keen on making good use of the conditions. “Chinnaswamy is special for me. Even before I was playing for RCB, Chinnaswamy was always special. From my U-19 days, whenever I bowl here, I got some advantage,” said Asha, who scalped one of the key South African wickets in the first ODI in the form of Marizanne Kapp.South Africa are aware about the need to bring their A game to challenge India and force the series into a decider. Like India, they would also want their batters to deliver.Most importantly, skipper and opener Laura Wolvaardt, who has been their in-form player, need to lead from the front to unsettle the home team. She would also need support from her experienced teammates, including Kapp and Sune Luus, to make an impact.",India beat South Africa in the first ODI in Bengaluru on Sunday.

New Zealand 's early exit from the ongoing T20 World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean islands was particularly disappointing given their strong track record in previous editions, where they consistently reached at least the semi-finals.Their campaign was derailed by an unexpected loss to Afghanistan and a defeat at the hands of co-hosts West Indies, and ended with a meaningless victory against Papua New Guinea, a team considered to be one of the weakest in the tournament.The win provided little solace for the Kiwis, who were already eliminated from the competition.""It's natural at the end of the World Cup cycle, and especially if you haven't done quite as well as what you wanted, that there's a lot of reflections going on,"" said the NZ head coach Gary Stead, as quoted by Reuters. .As the team looks to rebuild and prepare for the next T20 World Cup in 2026, to be held in Sri Lanka and India, changes to the squad are likely.Trent Boult, a veteran seamer, has already announced that this was his last World Cup appearance. Further adjustments to the team's composition may be necessary to revitalize their performance and ensure a stronger showing in future tournaments.""Usually these things mean there's a line in the sand that's made and from there you make decisions around the way forward. I guess for us, looking at the next T20 World Cup in two years' time, it will be very quickly into (deciding) what does that look like (and) which of these players remain in the group,"" added the coach.The Black Caps have enjoyed success under the leadership duo of captain Williamson and coach Stead, securing victory in the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) in 2021 and reaching the T20 World Cup final in the United Arab Emirates shortly after.New Zealand's early exit from the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean marks the end of an impressive streak in major cricket tournaments, coming just seven months after Kane Williamson 's team reached their fifth consecutive semi-finals in the 50-over World Cup.Stead's contract as an all-formats coach extends until the conclusion of the current WTC cycle in 2025, but he may consider relinquishing his responsibilities in the white-ball formats, having previously advocated for a specialist to oversee the shorter formats.Despite their achievements, a long-sought-after white-ball trophy continues to elude New Zealand, leading supporters to question whether the current leadership has the ability to secure one.Similarly, Williamson, who relinquished the Test captaincy to paceman Tim Southee in 2022, may decide it is time for a new leader to take the reins in white-ball cricket or opt to drop a format to extend his playing career.""Oh, I don't know,"" Williamson, who is 33, was asked about his Test future. ""There's a bit of time between now and then (2026), so it's about regrouping as a side. We've got red-ball cricket over the next year basically, so it's back into some other international formats, and we'll see where things land.""""The older New Zealand players would have looked at this (T20 World Cup) as maybe their last good opportunity, so it might be that it's time to move on,"" former captain Stephen Fleming told ESPNcricinfo.New Zealand's Test team, whioch concluded the previous cycle in sixth place while attempting to retain their WTC crown, might face difficulties in reconstructing a competitive T20 squad for the 2026 World Cup.Some of the team's veteran players, such as 35-year-old Southee, who has been Boult's long-time bowling partner, may opt for a reduced workload or pursue a profitable path in franchise cricket.",New Zealand were eliminated from the T20 World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean.

However, the ODI series against Sri Lanka in July-August seems like a more realistic opportunity for him.Gambhir and Iyer had a successful partnership during KKR's victorious IPL campaign this year. The talented Mumbai right-hander, a prolific 50-over batter, may finally see his fortunes change after some challenging months.Gambhir, currently the front-runner for the India coach position, was the mentor of the franchise.Earlier, Iyer was dropped from BCCI's central contracts, along with Ishan Kishan, due to his apparent reluctance to play in the Ranji Trophy. Nonetheless, Iyer has consistently stated that a recurring lower back issue kept him out, even though he did participate in the Ranji Trophy final, scoring around 90 runs.Currently, many young players who performed well in the IPL are training at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru. They are preparing for the five T20Is against Zimbabwe, which will be announced next week.""Shreyas is currently not at NCA. Here mostly those players are there, who have performed in the IPL and will be in contention for Zimbabwe selection."" Abhishek Sharma , Riyan Parag , Mayank Yadav , Harshit Rana, Nitish Reddy, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Dayal are all at the camp. Some will go to Zimbabwe T20Is,"" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.""However, there is every possibility that Shreyas will travel for the three-match ODI series in Sri Lanka. The last ODI that India played was in South Africa and he scored a half-century (52). He had 500 plus runs (530) in World Cup and averages just around 50. Can you drop him?"" he added.It is understood that senior players like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , along with pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, will now focus on ODIs and Tests for the remainder of the season.

NEW DELHI: Australia have advanced smoothly to the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup , showcasing a scene familiar in major cricket tournaments. The West Indies have also thrived on home soil as the race for the semi-finals kicks off on Wednesday.Fresh from their recent World Test Championship and 2023 50-over World Cup wins, Australia's team aims to become the first to hold global titles in all three formats at once.Led by Mitchell Marsh , the team displayed their strength with four dominant victories in the group stage.In a tournament marked by low scores, Australia stands out as the only team to score two 175-plus totals and one of the three teams to hit the 200-run mark. They have navigated difficult conditions effortlessly, which has stumped many other teams.On the other hand, the West Indies, captained by Rovman Powell , have also performed exceptionally. They won all four of their group matches to secure their place in the Super Eight. The slow pitches have played to their advantage, highlighting their prowess in the T20 format.Despite their failure to qualify for last year's 50-over World Cup in India, the Caribbean team remains determined to excel in T20, a format where they have traditionally been strong.Under the leadership of Daren Sammy , the former all-rounder and now coach, the team has successfully combined youth and experience. Sammy, who led the West Indies to T20 World Cup victories in 2012 and 2016, has been instrumental in this blend.Batter Nicholas Pooran mentioned that the team feels comfortable playing on slow pitches, stating, ""We have been playing our entire career on these pitches. We're not surprised that it's slow, it's low, it's low-scoring. The reason why most of our averages are 20-25 is because we bat on pitches like this. But we know for a fact as a group, whenever we get good pitches, we are a very dangerous team and that is an advantage to us.""As the Super Eight stage progresses, both Australia and the West Indies are in strong positions to advance towards the semi-finals. They are capitalising on their familiarity with the conditions and their current performance levels.South Africa and India have successfully moved on to the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup 2024. Both teams remained unbeaten during the group stage, despite facing challenges in the United States leg of the tournament.India, eager to end their global title drought since the 2013 Champions Trophy, are particularly motivated. ""There is real keenness in the group to go and do something special,"" India captain Rohit Sharma remarked on Tuesday. ""That's a good way to start the second stage of the tournament.""India faces a busy schedule, playing three Group 1 matches in five days. However, Rohit, likely playing his last T20 World Cup alongside teammate Virat Kohli, expressed confidence. ""It is going to be a little hectic, but we are used to all of this,"" he said.England, the defending champions, have struggled to find their form, narrowly securing their place in the Super Eight. For Jos Buttler's squad, significant improvement is needed to aim for a semi-final berth, especially with strong teams like Afghanistan competing.A remarkable story in the tournament has been the United States, who managed to upset former champions Pakistan. Facing tough competition in the Super Eight will be challenging for Monank Patel and his team, but the experience will be valuable for their development. They will commence the Super Eight stage with a Group 2 match against South Africa in Antigua.",Australia and the West Indies advance to Super Eight stage of T20 World Cup 2024.

FIFA concerned with 'early call-ups' of national team players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/fifa-concerned-with-early-call-ups-of-national-team-players/articleshow/111093368.cms,"PANAJI: India’s preparations for international tournaments and friendlies outside the release period now seem difficult after FIFA said it was concerned with an increasing trend of member associations engaging in “early call-ups” for national team preparations.Successive national team coaches in India have demanded longer camps to prepare the team for international assignments. Former coach Igor Stimac, for example, has been vocal about it and in a post on social media said, “short preparation time is killing any hopes for us doing well in these major tournaments.”Even for the Asian Cup 2023 – where India finished without a goal or a point – Stimac had sought a minimum of four weeks’ camp. Such demands now are likely to be swept aside, given that FIFA has emphasised on the need to balance the rights and obligations of both clubs and national teams, in order to ensure that the harmonious relationship continues.“FIFA would like to strongly remind all member associations preparing for the upcoming international windows that call-ups in advance of the opening of the international window in question should not be undertaken unless otherwise mutually agreed between the member association and club concerned.“FIFA also draws attention to the fact that universal compliance with the regulations and consistency in their application are critical for the long-term health and coexistence of representative-team and club football globally. In this regard, all involved parties and stakeholders must respect the rules and their obligations, in order for this long-standing and successful system to function as intended,” secretary general Mattias Grafstrom wrote in a circular to all member associations early this month.FIFA’s Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players clearly define the timing of the mandatory release of players.Clubs across the world, though, have perennially been in conflict with federations over release of players for international duty. In India the problem is acute since national coaches feel the release period is too short, drawn up largely for well-established leagues and nations whose players are ready to effortlessly transition from club to national team.Last season there were several conflicts between the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and Indian Super League (ISL) clubs. While clubs first forced postponement of the preparatory camp for the AFC U-23 qualifiers, others refused to release players for the Asian Games, played outside the window.AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey in a recent interview said leagues cannot be halted for national team preparations.“Earlier it has happened during the National Football League when the league was halted. But we cannot do the same now, because the leagues are being done in a professional way, as per FIFA guidelines. So now we have to decide if we are going by FIFA or our own rules,” Chaubey said in a recent video posted by the federation.",FIFA is concerned with an increasing trend of member associations engaging in “early call-ups” for national team preparations.

Stimac mentioned that his tenure in India negatively impacted his health, leading to his decision to sever all ties with the AIFF.""I kindly ask you to immediately, but not later in next ten (10) days, organize payment to me for this termination of the contract without just cause in the amount which will represent a residual value of my employment contract that was prematurely terminated from AIFF side...,"" news agency PTI quoted Stimac as saying.""This amount should represent the remaining value of my employment contract prematurely terminated by the AIFF, in accordance with Article 6 of Annex 2 of the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players.""Otherwise, I will start proceedings against the AIFF before the competent FIFA Football Tribunal and file a lawsuit,' he added.On Monday, Stimac was removed from his role as head coach, with the AIFF terminating his contract a year before it was set to expire.The termination came after the team's early exit from the World Cup Qualifiers.Stimac,56, who has had ongoing conflicts with Chaubey, described the AIFF's decision to remove him without 'just cause' as unprofessional and unethical.""Publishing something like this (his termination) prior to reaching the conversation with me is blatantly unprofessional and unethical,"" Stimac said.Appointed in 2019, Stimac's contract was extended by the sports governing body until 2026 in October of last year. His new contract, signed on October 5, 2023, lacked a severance clause. If the AIFF has to honor the entirety of his remaining contract, it could cost around Rs six crore.Stimac further accused the AIFF of various contractual breaches, specifically pointing fingers at Chaubey. He alleged interference in his public statements and team selections for the Asian Games, which he claims compromised the integrity of his decisions as the coach.""President Mr Chaubey together with SAI (Sports Authority of India) officials changed my official players list for the Asian Games adding three senior players and allowing ISL clubs to decide which players will represent the country at the Asian Games,"" Stimac blasted Chaubey.""The way you organised the travel for our team going to China and back was unforgettable.""Additionally, Stimac stated that Chaubey canceled his post-match press conference after the AFC Asian Cup, where India did not secure any victories or score a goal.The Croatian, who won a bronze medal at the 1998 World Cup, revealed that his dealings with the AIFF have taken a toll on his health over the past two years. The stress and strain have prompted him to hand over all communications with the AIFF to his lawyer, Mr. Radic.""Hereby I am adding my lawyer Mr Radic to take over our communication because I don't want to speak or hear from AIFF anymore because AIFF has caused me enough health problems with its acts against me in the past two years.""Your 'show cause notice' and 'final warning letter' did stop me from speaking the truth to Indian fans and it did give me two stents just prior to the AFC Asian Cup but didn't stop me (from) giving it all to my team and fighting with my boys for the country.Finally, he said the mess that Indian football finds itself it at the moment was not created by him or his staff.",Igor Stimac has warned the All India Football Federation of legal action.

They believe finding a coach can be done swiftly, but discovering a striker of Chhetri's caliber overnight is nearly impossible.Vijayan and Lawrence, who have both had distinguished careers with the Indian team, anticipated Stimac’s sacking. The decision followed a disappointing AFC Asian Cup and the failure to progress beyond the second round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers, despite a relatively easy draw.The AIFF leadership, including the executive and technical committee members, shared a consensus regarding Stimac after the lackluster World Cup Qualifiers campaign.""It was a unanimous decision,"" news agency PTI quoted Vijayan as saying.""The coach will appointed as early as possible so that the team doesn't lose out on anything before the next FIFA window in September. They will soon sit together and start the process of finding a coach,"" Vijayan, one of India's finest players, said.""However, how do you find a replacement for Chhetri. That is going to very difficult as a great player like Chhetri comes rarely. We have some good strikers, and we are trying to get them to play as much as possible.""The biggest issue is that our strikers don't get a lot of playing time in domestic leagues, be it the ISL or the I-League.""In domestic tournaments such as the Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League, clubs often recruit foreign players to boost their chances of winning trophies. The trend has hindered the development of quality homegrown strikers.Lawrence believes that the game's stakeholders should now focus on scouting talent at the grassroots level.""Grassroots is where we have to focus. Yes, Indian strikers are not getting to play the amount of time they should, but there is no point cribbing over that. That's how professional football works. We have to look for talent at the grassroots and mould them into quality strikers,"" Lawrence said.""True, you are not going to suddenly get another Sunil Chhetri, another Bhaichung Bhutia and another IM Vijayan. So, we have to focus on building a good team and not just hope for one great striker to emerge and bail the team,"" Lawrence added.Upcoming talents like Vikram Partap Singh, Manvir Singh, Lallianzuala Chhangte, Liston Colaco, and Rahim Ali are considered potential leaders for India's attack in the future. However, Chhetri’s record of 94 international goals over a 19-year career has set a high benchmark for the young players.The AIFF terminated Stimac's contract a year before it was to expire, following the team’s elimination from the second round of FIFA World Cup Qualifiers.Stimac, who took over as head coach in 2019, received an extension last October until 2026 from the sport's governing body. However, due to a clause in his contract, the AIFF might have to pay him nearly USD 360,000 (approximately Rs 3 crore) as a severance package.

"AIFF sack coach Igor Stimac, ready for legal battle over compensation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/aiff-sack-coach-igor-stimac-ready-for-legal-battle-over-compensation/articleshow/111073207.cms,"PANAJI: The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) is bracing itself for a legal battle after sacking Igor Stimac , ending his five-year reign as head coach of the senior men's national team.Stimac, a World Cup bronze medal winner in 1998 and formerly coach of the Croatian national team, joined India in 2019. He was in charge for 53 matches, winning 19, drawing 14 and losing 20.The Croatian had come under heavy pressure since India's failure to score a goal, or pick up a point, during the three group-stage games at the Asian Cup 2023 in Qatar early this year. The team ended with the worst performance among the 24 participating teams.When India failed to qualify for the third round of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, despite winning the first game against Kuwait, the writing was on the wall. The only hindrance was his contract that ran till June 2026, without any clause for termination with a standard three-month compensation.""Stimac had publicly said that he would resign if he does not take India to the third round (of the World Cup qualifiers). India exited on June 11 and since then we have not heard anything from him. This decision has been taken in national interest. Compensation is secondary,"" a senior AIFF official told TOI.The decision to sack Stimac had the unequivocal support of AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey and was stamped during a virtual meeting of senior officials, led by vice president NA Harris. Technical committee chairman IM Vijayan and acting secretary general M. Satyanarayan were also present.""Noting the disappointing outcome of the senior men's national team's FIFA World Cup 2026 qualification campaign, the members unanimously agreed that a new head coach would be best placed to take the team forward,"" the AIFF said in a statement on Monday. ""A notice of termination has been issued to Stimac by the AIFF Secretariat. He stands relieved of his obligations with immediate effect.""Stimac draws a monthly salary of $30,000 (Rs 25 lakh approximately) and in the absence of a severance clause in his new contract signed on October 5, 2023, AIFF may have to pay a huge compensation, or in a worst-case scenario, the entirety of his remaining contract value which amounts to Rs 6 crore.AIFF officials, however, believe they have a case against the coach and are ready for a legal battle, either at FIFA's adjudicating bodies or the court of arbitration for sport (CAS), which is the world's premier forum for resolving sporting disputes.""AIFF offered Stimac a three-month salary for mutually terminating the contract. He did not agree. We could not afford to drag this for more time and decided to bring an end to this chapter,"" said another official.India will next feature in a tri-nation tournament at home during the September window and the AIFF plans to have a coach in place before July end.When Stimac took charge of the national team, he promised to change the mindset and make India punch above their weight.The Croatian presided over India's best year in terms of silverware in 2023 when the team won a record three trophies (Tri-Nation, Inter-Continental and SAFF Championship) broke into the top 100 of FIFA rankings (now 121) and recorded their best-ever run of clean sheets.It won him a new better contract, but 2024 turned out to be disastrous.First there was the Asian Cup disappointment, and then India managed just two points from four qualifiers, scoring only two goals, as a promising qualification battle ended in heartbreak.","Igor Stimac has been sacked as head coach of India's senior men's national team.

The decision, driven by concerns over potential injury risks, highlights the demanding physical challenges faced by professional athletes navigating a packed tournament calendar across diverse playing surfaces.Jabeur's withdrawal centres on the Olympic tournament's utilization of clay courts, the same surface used for the French Open .Having concluded her clay court season earlier this month with a quarter-final appearance at the French Open, the world no. 10 is currently transitioning to grass court competitions, followed by the hard courts of the US Open shortly after the Olympics This rapid succession of surface transitions poses a significant challenge for athletes. Adapting to the unique characteristics of each surface – clay's slow bounce and high friction, grass's low bounce and speed, and hard court's medium bounce and pace – requires significant physical adjustments. These adjustments impact movement patterns, footwork, and the strain placed on various muscle groups, particularly the knees.Jabeur, in consultation with her medical team, determined that subjecting her body to such a rapid transition, particularly after an already demanding clay court season, would significantly increase the risk of injury to her knee.""After consulting with my medical team regarding attending the Olympics in Paris we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardise the rest of my season,"" Jabeur wrote on social media.""I have always loved representing my country in any competition.
