You can say as many times that Dhoni is not captaining, but ultimately he is leading the side. 'Bargad ke neeche kya uga hai, uga kar dikhao. When Dhoni leaves, there might be no shadow of him,"" said Sidhu, who is doing commentary in the ongoing IPL, on the #AskStar show on Star Sports.Sidhu also stated that one can only evaluate a captain after he has guided the team through nearly 50 matches.Sidhu praised Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson for his maturity and skillful resource management. And when it comes to the best leadership, the cricketer-turned commentator named Australian skipper Pat Cummins , currently leading Sunrisers Hyderabad, as the best captain.Dhoni's tenure as captain of CSK has been marked by remarkable achievements, including five Indian Premier League (IPL) titles, which have solidified his reputation as a shrewd tactician and an astute leader. Despite stepping down from the captaincy role before the start of IPL 2024 , Dhoni continues to exert a significant influence on the team's strategy and decision-making, both on and off the field.Ruturaj, while assuming the formal captaincy position, may still be in the process of growing into his leadership role within the team. Dhoni's experience, tactical acumen, and ability to mentor younger players likely play a crucial role in guiding Gaikwad and the rest of the team during matches and training sessions.Sidhu's remarks highlight the intricate dynamics of leadership within cricket teams, where the presence of a seasoned veteran like Dhoni can continue to shape the team's performance and direction, even as newer leaders emerge. Dhoni's leadership legacy at CSK remains a cornerstone of the team's identity, with his influence extending far beyond his official title.",Navjot Singh Sidhu believes MS Dhoni is still leading the Chennai Super Kings.

NEW DELHI: As expected, Virat Kohli 's controversial dismissal against Kolkata Knight Riders ( KKR ) at the Eden Gardens on Sunday has become a major talking and debatable point in IPL 2024 .Chasing 223, Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) were bowled out for 221 on the last ball as KKR won the match by 1 run.RCB's star batsman and former captain Virat Kohli was adjudged out on the first ball of the third over when he was caught by surprise by a full toss from Harshit Rana and ended up edging a simple return catch.As the KKR players celebrated the prized wicket and the on-field umpire raised his finger, Virat went for the review as he thought the ball was a waist high full-toss and hence a no-ball.But the replays showed that as it was a slower ball, it dipped as it reached Kohli and more importantly the side angles showed that he was standing outside the crease.Ball-tracking showed that the ball would have been below the waist had Kohli been in his normal batting stance inside the batting crease.An infuriated Virat started to walk off the field shaking his head and came back to have quite a few angry words with the umpires.Many former cricketers shared their views on the controversial dismissal.While former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu disagreed with the decision, another former cricketer Irfan Pathan said it was a legal delivery and hence Kohli was out.Now former cricketer Mohammad Kaif too shared his view on the controversial dismissal.Talking on his official X handle, Kaif says, ""You can dismiss a batsman in different ways and if you bowl 6 balls, you have 60 chances to dismiss a batsman. There are ten modes of dismissals to get a batsman out if you go by the laws and the rulebook.""""Now Virat Kohli has been dismissed on a beamer, you can add this mode of dismissal too. To give Virat Kohli out on a beamer is a very bad decision because the ball on your waist height cannot be controlled, it's not allowed. The ball accidentally slipped out of Harshit Rana's hand, it became a waist-high full toss and should have been a no-ball. Rana should have apologized, saying sorry the ball slipped out of my hand, there Virat Kohli was given out, that's a very bad decision because the trajectory doesn't matter,"" Kaif added.""I understand that he was out of the crease but he played the ball on his waist, that cannot be controlled. The batsman always looks down where the ball is pitching, no one is ready for this kind of a delivery, so it was one of the worst decisions by the umpire to adjudge Virat Kohli out,"" Kaif concluded.Bottom-placed RCB play their next match against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) were bowled out for 221 on the last ball as KKR won the match by 1 run.

NEW DELHI: Mohsin Naqvi , the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), has expressed openness to the idea of resuming bilateral cricket series with India under certain conditions. Naqvi stated that the PCB would consider the possibility of playing against India in bilateral series if India sends their team to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy next year.Speaking to reporters in Lahore during a function, Naqvi addressed questions regarding a recent interview given by Indian captain Rohit Sharma . In the interview, Rohit praised the Pakistan team and expressed enthusiasm about the prospect of playing against them in a Test series overseas, describing it as ""awesome.""The statement from Naqvi signals a potential thaw in cricketing relations between the two neighboring nations, who have experienced strained diplomatic ties in recent years.Bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan have been rare due to political tensions, with matches typically taking place only in ICC tournaments or multi-team events.""Look, if any options in this regard come we will consider it, but our target right now is to host the Champions Trophy and first let India come for the tournament,"" he said.""Right now till the CT there is no slot available as our team has a packed itinerary.""""Once they come here first then we can look at any proposal whenever it comes before us,"" he added.The history of bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan underscores the complexities and challenges in resuming regular matches between the two cricketing giants. The last bilateral limited-overs series between the two teams took place in 2012-13 when Pakistan toured India. However, India has been reluctant to engage in Test matches against Pakistan since 2007, following a series between the two countries on Indian soil.In recent years, the strained political relations between India and Pakistan have spilled over into cricketing engagements. India's refusal to participate in Test matches against Pakistan, as well as its decision to skip the Asia Cup matches hosted in Pakistan last year, have further exacerbated tensions in cricketing diplomacy between the two nations. The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) had to devise a hybrid model for the event, with the majority of matches being held in Sri Lanka, due to India's non-participation.Despite these challenges, there have been attempts to improve cricketing relations between India and Pakistan. PCB chairman Naqvi held discussions with Jay Shah , the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), during an ICC meeting in Dubai in February.Such interactions between cricketing authorities from both countries signify a willingness to explore avenues for collaboration and potentially pave the way for the resumption of bilateral cricketing ties, albeit with certain conditions and diplomatic considerations.","Mohsin Naqvi, chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), has expressed openness to the idea of resuming bilateral cricket series with India.

Besides the last-ball thriller that the Kolkata Knight Riders vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru match produced on Sunday evening in IPL 2024 at the Eden Gardens , the dismissal of Virat Kohli on a controversial waist-high full-toss remains one of the talking points from the game.Chasing KKR's 222 for 6, RCB's star batsman and former captain Virat Kohli was adjudged out on the first ball of the third over when a full toss from Harshit Rana surprised Kohli, who ended up lobbing a simple return catch.The on-field umpires gave Kohli out while the batsman believed the full-toss was above the height of his waist and thus should be ruled a no-ball. Kohli went for a review, but because it was a slower ball and the batsman was standing out of his crease, ball-tracking deemed that the ball was dipping and thus would have been below Kohli's waist height by the time it reached the popping crease.It infuriated Kohli, who expressed his displeasure to the umpires before walking off, shaking his head in anger and disbelief and smashed the dustbin before entering the dressing room.Kohli made 18 off 7 balls.RCB, however, made a match of it, thanks to half-centuries by Will Jacks (55 off 32 balls) and Rajat Patidar (52 off 23 balls). It followed a flurry of wickets, but Dinesh Karthik (25 off 18 balls) and Karn Sharma (20 off 7) ensured the game went to the last ball, on which RCB needed 3 runs to to win. But Lockie Ferguson (1) was run out trying to steal a second run and force a 'Super Over'.It was RCB's seventh loss in eight matches, while KKR moved up to the second spot with their fifth win in seven games so far this season.Following the match, Kohli was again seen having a chat with the umpire, and also explaining to the KKR players what happened.Interestingly, the BCCI had measured the waist height of each player in IPL 2024 to minimize errors in decisions related to beamers that can be ruled as no-balls.Experts and former cricketers weighed in with their thoughts on the controversial decision.","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2024.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders ' (KKR) managing director and CEO, Venky Mysore , has come out in support of star player Mitchell Starc amid scrutiny over his performance in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) season.

I mean, his presence itself in the lineup adds a different dynamic to the team, and there were specific skills that the support staff were looking for. So, we think we had that.""Starc's struggles in the T20 format have been evident, with the Australian quick conceding 100 runs without taking a wicket in the first two matches. His performance took a further hit when he leaked 54 runs from 16 balls against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, facing criticism for his expensive final over.However, Mysore remained optimistic about Starc's contribution, stating, ""There are times when games are up and down. Everybody gets taken to the cleaners at times, and there are other times they come and just do their thing and win games for the team. So we're super happy having him in the setup.""ALSO SEE: IPL 2024 SCHEDULE KKR, currently placed second with five wins from seven matches, have seen a significant transformation under the mentorship of former captain Gautam Gambhir . Mysore credited Gambhir's return to the franchise as a team mentor for adding intensity and experience to the squad.""Needless to say, Gautam (Gambhir) coming in adds a lot of weight purely from the intensity that he brings, the experience that he brings. The winning attitude, I mean, he and Chandu (head coach Chandrakant Pandit) are both very, very determined and very desperate to win. They have a great support staff around them.

He highlighted the inconsistency of the Pakistan team, saying, ""Losing is a part of cricket, but such a defeat shakes the foundation a bit, especially with the World Cup just around the corner. Playing at home, on your favourite surface, against a team that isn't even a complete side - not a first-tier or even a second-tier New Zealand team - makes it an embarrassing loss.""""Let's admit that in T20, anyone's luck can change, but such a drastic turn of tables within 24 hours is a blow to Pakistan's reputation. For some time now, there has been a notion that you can expect anything from Pakistan on a given day. Just 24 hours ago, Pakistan defeated them by 7 wickets, and 24 hours later, they themselves suffered a 7-wicket defeat. This should not happen,"" added the former PCB chairman.Suggesting that Pakistan's total fell short of expectations, Raja continued: ""The batsmen who are set should not get out after scoring just 20-30 runs. That's why the score is only 180. This pitch is worth at least 250 runs, as we know how many runs have been scored here before. Pakistan scored fewer runs, and no one played a long innings.

There was a lot of debate about whether it should be deemed as no ball because the ball was above the waistline. Virat was standing outside the crease and when you are that far hawkeye measures the waistline from the popping crease (the white line).""""This year BCCI has measured the height of each player and if the ball passes above the waistline then it is given a no ball if not then the decision is not given,"" the former India international added.He further elaborated, ""The ball was going to dip because it was a slower one. If the ball was bowled with pace, it could have been a no ball. He was given out according to the rule. I believe that the ball would have dipped if he had stayed in the crease.""Reacting to the dismissal, Kohli contested the decision with visible frustration, even resorting to hitting a trash can with his gloves as he walked back to the pavilion after his dismissal.RCB skipper Faf du Plessis also chimed in, stating, ""Obviously, the rules are the rules. Virat and myself at that stage thought that possibly the ball was higher than his waist. I guess they measure it on the popping crease...

NEW DELHI: Liverpool reignited their Premier League title pursuit with a commanding 3-1 victory over Fulham on Sunday, drawing level on points with table-toppers Arsenal .While Manchester City still hold the fate of the title in their grasp, trailing the top two by just one point with a game in hand, both Liverpool and Arsenal have intensified the pressure on Pep Guardiola's side.This resurgence comes after both teams bounced back from unexpected defeats in the previous weekend.Jurgen Klopp expressed before the match at Craven Cottage that the comeback of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota from injury provided his team with ""a chance"" to reinvigorate their pursuit in the title race.Both were on target, either side of Ryan Gravenberch's first Premier League goal.Klopp took the brave decision to rest a series of first-team regulars among five changes to the side that won 1-0, but failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit against Atalanta in the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday.Mohamed Salah, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and Ibrahima Konate dropped the bench.Alexander-Arnold was one of the few shining lights in Bergamo and was restored for his first Premier League start in over two months.The England international showed the quality the Reds have been missing when he curled in a stunning free-kick to open the scoring on 32 minutes.Liverpool failed to hold onto the lead until half-time as the defensive lapses that have cost them in recent weeks reappeared.Timothy Castagne swept home a loose ball into the far corner after Rodrigo Muniz's header was blocked.Klopp had his stellar cast of substitutes warming up after a sluggish start to the second period.But one wayward pass from Alex Iwobi cost Fulham.Harvey Elliott intercepted on his return to Craven Cottage and teed up Gravenberch to curl in from the edge of the area.Jota then made the points safe with his 100th goal in English football when his low effort had too much power for Bernd Leno 18 minutes from time.Two more away trips at local rivals Everton and West Ham await Liverpool in the next six days.But with just five more games of the Klopp era to come, they remain at least in the hunt to give the German a glorious goodbye to his transformative time at Anfield.","Liverpool beat Fulham 3-1 to draw level on points with table-toppers Arsenal.

You would think with half-time nearing, this match was done and dusted, but the inevitable happened.Goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh gifted Lazar Cirkovic a goal in the fourth minute of added time to turn the momentum in Chennaiyin’s favour.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi showcased his brilliance by scoring twice and setting up another goal for Sergio Busquets , leading Inter Miami to a 3-1 victory over Nashville on Saturday in a captivating Major League Soccer encounter and maintaining their top spot in the Eastern Conference .Miami faced an early setback when defender Franco Negri inadvertently deflected a corner into his own net in the second minute, giving Nashville an early lead.However, Messi quickly turned the tide in Miami's favor, equalizing in the 11th minute after Luis Suarez directed a loose ball back to him following a parried shot.Despite hitting the post shortly afterward, Messi continued to orchestrate Miami's attacks, providing opportunities for his teammates and creating chances with his exceptional playmaking skills. In the 39th minute, his former Barcelona teammate Busquets nodded in a fine glancing header from Messi's corner to put Miami ahead just before halftime.The home side suffered a setback as Paraguay international Diego Gomez was stretchered off with an ankle injury just before the break, adding to Miami's injury woes.Nashville pushed for an equalizer in the second half but failed to capitalize on their dominance in possession. Miami sealed the victory in the 81st minute when Leonardo Afonso was brought down inside the box, allowing Messi to convert the penalty and secure his ninth goal in as many games for Miami in all competitions this season.Despite the win, Inter Miami head coach Gerardo Martino expressed dissatisfaction with his team's slow start, highlighting the need for improvement despite their depleted squad due to injuries.Inter Miami currently sits atop the Eastern Conference with 18 points from their opening 10 games, a commendable achievement considering the challenges they have faced. Martino emphasized the importance of accumulating points early in the season to avoid a repeat of last year's dramatic playoff chase.In other MLS fixtures on Saturday, reigning champions Columbus Crew salvaged a 2-2 draw against Portland Timbers, while Cincinnati secured a remarkable 2-1 comeback victory against Atlanta United, with Luciano Acosta playing a pivotal role in the win.",Lionel Messi scores twice as Inter Miami beat Nashville 3-1 in Major League Soccer.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal bounced back from their Champions League disappointment to reclaim the top spot in the Premier League with a convincing 2-0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.Leandro Trossard and Martin Odegaard were the heroes for the Gunners, striking at the end of each half to secure the crucial victory, taking them one point clear of Manchester City , who have a game in hand.The victory comes after a turbulent period for Arsenal, with a three-game winless run that included a Premier League defeat to Aston Villa and a Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Bayern Munich.Manager Mikel Arteta made just three changes from the side that suffered defeat in Munich, and although Arsenal took some time to find their rhythm, they capitalized on a stroke of luck just before halftime when Trossard's mishit shot found the back of the net.Despite dominating possession, Arsenal struggled to create clear-cut chances in the second half, but Wolves failed to capitalize on their injury-depleted squad's lack of attacking inspiration.Odegaard sealed the victory deep into stoppage time, compounding Wolves' misery and securing three vital points for Arsenal in their quest for a first league title in 20 years.Elsewhere in the Premier League, Liverpool have the opportunity to level points with Arsenal when they take on Fulham on Sunday, while at the bottom of the table, Luton Town suffered a crushing blow to their survival hopes with a 5-1 defeat to Brentford.Despite missing key striker Ivan Toney, Brentford's dominant display all but secured their top-flight status, leaving Luton still one point adrift of safety.Meanwhile, Burnley's 4-1 victory over Sheffield United leaves the Blades on the brink of relegation, with manager Chris Wilder lamenting his side's woeful defending.",Arsenal beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 to reclaim top spot in the Premier League.

But the defenders, on both sides, looked to have brought a little more of it on the pitch as they denied attacks to be reflected on the scoreline.While Odisha ended up with better possession in the first half, the only shot on goal came from Blasters’ Hormipam Ruivah in the 22nd minute when he headed a superb cross from Freddy Lallawmawma straight into the hands of Amrinder Singh in Odisha goal.Odisha once again relied on their talisman Ahmed Jahouh to keep creating moves from deep but all those attacks were foiled by the Marko Leskovic and Milos Drincic-led Kerala defence inside the D. The story was being played in the same vein at the other end too, with both teams missing that final touch or shot in the final third in search of a breakthrough.The highlight of the opening 45 minutes was the drama that followed Mourtada Fall sending in the ball with a casual back heel on connecting with a Jahouh cross from the left of the box. While it was first given a goal by the referee, after consultation with the linesman and vehement protests from Blasters, the decision was overturned with Jahouh and Fall both found to be offside.Despite some desperate attempts from both teams to change the scoreline, they left the field for the break with the first knockout of the playoff stage goalless.Jahouh kept sending in measured crosses into the centre and the flank after the change of ends as Amey Ranawade and Jerry Mawihmingthanga kept attempting to make a goal out of them. But Blasters soon took charge of the game with a barrage of attacks near the Odisha goal.Mohammed Aimen and Saurav Mandal displayed the youthful vigour that Ivan Vukomanovic’s team rode this season but it was Fedor Cernych who broke the deadlock in the 67th minute. Aimen sent a pass to the Lithuanian after a delicate first touch as Cernych made no mistake in finding the corner of the net to the right of Amrinder.It was a well-deserved goal for the visitors but they could only maintain the lead for 20 minutes.With Blasters’ injured custodian Lara Sharma taken off field in a stretcher and replaced by Karanjit Sharma, Odisha took advantage of the lapse in focus of the opposition defence as Diego Mauricio scored his 11th goal of the season. He turned in a delectable cross from the right from current top scorer Roy Krishna and brought the home team back in the game and took it into extra time.And it was a replay of the equaliser in the seventh minute of extra time with Jahouh, once again, the conductor of the move.

'Mbappe arrival will make Real Madrid complete',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/mbappe-arrival-will-make-real-madrid-complete/articleshow/109452804.cms,"PANAJI: Julio Baptista was part of the famed Real Madrid squads of the 2000s era that had Galacticos or superstars jostling for the world’s attention. The Brazilian forward shared the dressing room with the likes of Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Raul. It perhaps proved too intimidating when he joined from Sevilla FC, as a season later he was loaned to Arsenal.On his return to Los Blancos, though, he scored the winner against Barcelona in El Clasico and helped his side win the 2007-08 league title.“I have been fortunate to be part of great teams and they’ve been important moments in my career,” Baptista told TOI during a global media interaction arranged by LaLiga . “There cannot be a comparison between the Galacticos and the current team. I feel that being at Madrid drives players (forward) since the (media) impact is so huge. It’s something that you may not have with other teams.”Real Madrid president Florentino Perez abandoned his ‘Galactico’ transfer policy to build sustainable teams but could break the bank to complete the transfer of Kylian Mbappe , who has been one of the best players on the planet for a number of years now.Should, as highly-expected, the transfer go through next season, Baptista feels Madrid will become even more stronger.“If a player of Mbappe’s level comes to Real Madrid, it will make this team even more dangerous. It will give them a broader range (of attacking options), make them complete and help breach that gap in attack,” said Baptista, referring to the exits of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema that have left a void upfront.Madrid have won LaLiga twice in the last four years and the UEFA Champions League five times in a hugely-successful decade. This season, there could be more. They are now in the semifinals of the Champions League and can have at least one hand on the LaLiga crown should they put it across Barcelona in El Clasico on Sunday.With seven games left to be played, Madrid enjoy an eight-point lead over Barcelona at the top of the table.“Any team can win, but I think Real Madrid have the advantage in terms of mental strength. The mental factor plays an important role in games like the Clasico and Barcelona’s Champions League exit will hurt. Madrid players are euphoric after making it to the semis,” said Baptista.Barcelona’s adventure in the Champions League came to a painful end at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), who overhauled the Catalans’ two-goal lead in the tie. Madrid, on the other hand, fought hard to stave off the challenge of Manchester City on penalties.“It hurts to exit the Champions League and see that your rivals have progressed and playing against the best teams in the world,” said Baptista. “Let’s see how Barca players feel when they come to Madrid. (Carlo) Ancelotti will have to make changes because the players put in a huge physical effort (against City) but they will still have a competitive team with players who can make the difference on their own.""","Julio Baptista was part of the famed Real Madrid squads of the 2000s era.

I think after winning the first (singles) match against New Zealand, we should have won the tie,"" said AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar on Thursday.India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week.Winning the tie would have placed the team second in final standings, thereby securing them a spot in the Playoffs in November.""We are remaining in Group 1, but I was expecting to qualify,"" said Dhupar but then switched to highlighting the association's efforts in hosting tournaments through the season to help players gain ranking points.""The association has done everything. The girls have had the opportunity to get a lot of points, and we had organised a camp in China.""And they were all playing well. Ankita had just won a tournament (in doubles) in Japan just the week before.""Dhupar, however, brushed aside the questionable team combinations fielded by the captain and the coach.After entering Sahaja Yamalapalli in singles and pairing Rutuja Bhosale with Prarthana Thombare against the strong Chinese team, the team's think-tank opted to put Rutuja in singles and hand Ankita the additional duty of doubles for the remaining three ties.It proved to be disastrous as it left Ankita with little time to recover with only a 30-minute gap between second singles and the decisive doubles matches. Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective. ""If I were the coach or the captain, and if I find my No. 1 player not performing, I would put my No. 3 or any other player in,"" Bal, a former Davis Cup player, said.""Try something different, think out of the box. It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players.

Chinese Taipei and Pacific Oceania were relegated to Group 2.Rutuja won all her four matches in singles and her only loss of the week came in the one doubles match she was paired with Prarthana Thombare against the all-conquering Chinese.""For me, it was a very positive week, especially after the ankle injury I had in Mumbai (during the WTA 125K Series event),"" Rutuja said from Shenzhen, where she continued her exploits to win her first-round match in the $40K ITF event.""I didn't think I would be playing singles, but Sahaja had blisters and the captain ( Shalini Thakur ) and the coach (Radhika Tulpule Kanitkar) thought I had the experience, they trusted me.""In contrast to Rutuja's 100 percent record in the week, India No. 1 Ankita Raina had a below-par outing by her standards, winning just one of her five singles matches, although the World No. 255 had to double up for doubles duty as well.Two of Ankita's singles losses came against players whom Rutuja had beaten -- South Korea's Sujeong Jang (World No. 267) and New Zealand's Lulu Sun (167).""We could have qualified. The last day was very stressful. Ankita was a little bit tired, and it rained, so matches were moved indoors,"" Rutuja said.""It was clay but not the best like the one we played outdoors. The clay was coming off and you could see the (hard) surface beneath. We had to stay focussed.""And New Zealand (doubles team of World No. 5 and US Open winner Erin Routliffe and Paige Hourigan) played their best match of the week.""We had seen them play in the previous matches, and we were wondering if they were really World No. 5.""But against Ankita and Prarthana, they took the first set 6-1 in no time and went up 5-1 in the second. We made it 5-5 but they didn't really allow us to get back into the game.""It was a tough week but everyone gave their best.""Rutuja praised Ankita for showing courage to play back to back matches each day, but felt resting her a day could have helped the player's as well as the team's fortunes.""It was stressful for her. But credit to her, she stepped up to play both singles and doubles. Against Chinese Taipei, she had a long singles match (nearly two and a half hours) and then played doubles (after a 30-minute gap),"" Rutuja said.""Shalini ma'am and Radhika ma'am asked her if she could play, and she said she was ready.""She could have been rested one day, maybe against Korea (the day after playing Chinese Taipei). There were a lot of options.""","Rutuja Bhosale says Indian team ""could have qualified"" for the Playoffs of the Billie Jean King Cup.

Despite the hiatus, he showcased glimpses of his customary brilliance, delivering a solid performance that hinted at his enduring prowess on the court.""It was a good start -- when you return you can't get rid of the doubts in one day, above all, on a physical level,"" Nadal told TVE.""Within what it could be, it was a good first round.

Though Cobolli managed to break back in the third game, Nadal quickly regained the advantage with another break for a 3-1 lead, aided by Cobolli's third double fault. Nadal efficiently served out the set to secure the triumph.Despite his victory, Nadal's performance on serve was solid yet subdued, lacking in aces and explosive power, yet effective enough to outmaneuver his opponent and claim the win.""I've gone months without being able to serve, (and) although I've got a lot of excitement to play here and do the best I can, I'm not going to go crazy with the serve,"" added Nadal.""I have to serve with caution that the moment I'm in dictates... there are moments in which I feel more liberated and others in which I'm more careful.""","Rafael Nadal beats Flavio Cobolli 6-2, 6-3 in first round of Barcelona Open.
