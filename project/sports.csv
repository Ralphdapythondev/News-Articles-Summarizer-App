NEW DELHI: After India's first Test loss to New Zealand in Bengaluru, former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar questioned captain Rohit Sharma 's tactical choices.After New Zealand added 137 vital runs for the eighth wicket in their first innings, Rohit came under heavy fire for his captaincy. On the fifth day of the contest, the criticism persisted.Only after 10 runs had been scored did Rohit decide to bring on Ravichandran Ashwin , India's most effective bowler at home, with New Zealand requiring 107 runs to win.Rather, he used Mohammed Siraj , who failed to produce any returns in two spells of seven overs and was wicketless.""The thing with pacers, you might get wickets, but there are always runs coming through edges. I was a bit surprised, I think tactically for Rohit Sharma, this Test match wasn't his greatest. I can understand Siraj getting one or two overs and Bumrah getting a long spell. But Siraj getting 6 overs in that spell, I think that is far too many and already a lot of runs on the board, and you had that little margin to chase,"" Manjrekar said, as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.""And another part is Aswhin. When there is no lavish turn on the pitch, the captain tends to use him with a new ball. He would have been tough for the Kiwi batters had he started off with Bumrah, and even if he had come in the fourth over of the inning,"" he added.He drew attention to India's crucial tactical mistakes on the last day. It was only New Zealand's third Test victory overall and their first in India since 1988.Rohit Sharma commended his team's tenacity, especially their comeback in the second innings, despite the shocking eight-wicket defeat. India demonstrated incredible tenacity by scoring 462 to set a target of 107 for New Zealand despite trailing by a significant 356 runs at the end of the first innings.""It was a good effort with the bat in the second innings. We didn't bat well in the first innings. So knew what was ahead and couple of guys stood out. When you are 350 behind you can't think too much about it. just got to see the ball and bat. Couple of partnerships were really exciting to watch and got us back in the game. We could have easily been bowled out cheaply but proud of the effort,"" Rohit said at the post-match presentation.India needs to win the next two Test matches to keep up their remarkable 18-match winning streak in home Test series . From October 24, India and New Zealand will play their second Test match in Pune.",Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar questioned captain Rohit Sharma's tactical choices.

Amelia Kerr contributed a vital 43 off 38 balls, while Brooke Halliday's impactful 38 off 28 balls propelled New Zealand past the 150-run mark.In response, South Africa's opening pair, led by skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33 off 27), took their team to 47 for no loss in the powerplay.However, the New Zealand bowlers managed to restrict the opposition's scoring rate, and South Africa ultimately finished with 126 for nine in their allotted 20 overs.Kerr shone with her leg-spin, claiming three wickets for 24 runs in her four-over spell.New Zealand's success in the tournament was a remarkable turnaround, considering they had entered the competition on the back of 10 consecutive losses.Throughout the tournament, they consistently demonstrated the best bowling unit by a considerable margin, and in the final, they elevated their batting performance to secure the championship.South Africa's chances of victory diminished significantly after the loss of their determined captain Wolvaardt in the 10th over.Kerr claimed the crucial wicket as Wolvaardt, attempting to increase the scoring rate, found Suzie Bates at cover.The dismissal of Anneke Bosch, the semifinal hero, just five balls later, further solidified New Zealand's advantage.

Bumrah's burst not enough as clinical Rachin helps

New Zealand

win

GILL AND SHAMI HIT THE NETS

WASHINGTON ADDED TO INDIA SQUAD

SQUAD:

BENGALURU: A thick cloud cover and the omnipresent threat of rain on Sunday suggested conditions were ripe for India's quicks to pick off New Zealand on the final day of an engrossing first Test.It was not lost on Rohit Sharma and his men. The way the skipper had protested the umpires decision of offering the light to New Zealand's openers just before rain came down in buckets at the fag end on the penultimate day suggested as much.But while Jasprit Bumrah , especially, swung the ball prodigiously and asked the hard questions, the first innings failure with the bat came back to haunt the Indian team.The Black Caps withstood that assault, eventually easing to an eight-wicket win with two sessions to spare.Latham and his men ended a 36-year-old wait for a win on Indian soil. Their last Test victory was in 1988 when a John Wright-led side registered a 136-run win over Dilip Vengsarkar's team at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.New Zealand also became the third team in Test cricket after Australia and England to thump India at home in over a decade. It was also their first Test win in four attempts at the venue.The target of 107 was too modest although morning rain left New Zealand nervous as the start of play was delayed by an hour.When play did begin, the visitors lost Latham when a length delivery from Bumrah nipped back, and the skipper was caught in front. India's hopes soared with that early wicket. Bumrah struck again, removing a battling Devon Conway (17) by trapping him leg before. New Zealand were still 72 runs behind at that point.But while Bumrah was dangerous, Siraj at the other end struggled a bit as did the spinners when the quicks ended their opening spells.Man of the match and first innings centurion Rachin Ravindra (39 n.o) settled the nerves alongside Will Young (48 n.o) and eased the strain in the New Zealand dressing room by sneaking a boundary off Bumrah through gully and backing it up with another flick through midwicket. That was when India's hopes began to evaporate.The spinners, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav only hastened the visitor's victory march. With menacing clouds hovering around, the Kiwis wanted to leave nothing to chance. Young and Ravindra attacked the slow bowlers, with the former highlighting the duo's dominance by clobbering Kuldeep for a six over mid-wicket.Strangely, go-to spinner R Ashwin was brought on when New Zealand needed 10 runs to win. Ashwin could only delay the inevitable.While the loss is bound to hurt, Rohit later admitted that there were plenty of gains. Coming back from being bowled out for 46 to scoring 462 with two tenacious talents - Sarfaraz Khan and Rishabh Pant-leading the charge, augurs well for India. It helped the hosts to push the rain-affected match to the fifth day.In retrospect, India will analyse the twin collapses - the mayhem in the first innings and the loss of seven wickets for 54 runs in their second essay.The loss did not alter India's position on top of the World Test Championship table (98 points; 68.06 PCT). It propelled New Zealand to the fourth position (48 pts; 44.44). With five Tests in hand in the current cycle, the Kiwis have some catching up to do.Less than an hour after the match, it was clear India wanted to put the loss behind as Shubham Gill, who missed the Test due to a stiff neck, started practising on the centre pitch. Also making an appearance at the nets was a heavily strapped Mohammed Shami , who has been sidelined due to a knee injury.TNNTamil Nadu allrounder Washington Sundar was on Sunday added to the India squad for the remaining two Tests against New Zealand.The 25-year-old's inclusion comes after his 152 for Tamil Nadu in the ongoing Ranji Trophy match against Delhi. Washington had played a crucial role in India's historic win against Australia at the Gabba.Rohit Sharma (C), Jasprit Bumrah (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal , Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Sarfaraz Khan, Rishabh Pant (WK), Dhruv Jurel (WK), R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd.

BENGALURU: It took 163 minutes on Day 2 of India's opening Test against New Zealand to change the course of the contest here. New Zealand needed 189 deliveries to dismiss the hosts for 46 in their first innings. That according to skipper Rohit Sharma , was the lowest point during his team's eight-wicket loss to the visiting side.""Except for that first three hours, I thought we played very good Test cricket .In the second innings, to come out and play like that, it felt like we were ahead in the game at one stage. We didn't feel like we were 350 behind and that is something that I am proud of. When the guys are showing that kind of attitude on the field with the bat, it shows that the mindset is clear and they want to go out there and play with freedom,"" said Rohit on Sunday.Highlighting his men's positive mindset, the opener said, ""Whatever the situation is, unless you have belief, you are not going to achieve it. That is the mindset, talk and approach of this team. This team is not going to give it up so easily. We are going to keep fighting till it is over.""Defending a paltry lead of 106 runs was always daunting, but India, given their bowling attack, did fancy their chances. ""To get them to chase that 100-odd runs also was a great effort, after being 350 behind. When you are chasing a small total like that, you know on a pitch where so much cricket has been played, there is a lot of wear and tear in the pitch, anything is possible. And we have quality in our bowling line-up.We came with the belief of trying to pull the results towards us. But it didn't happen,"" Rohit stated.While India, with a batting wealth to choose from, Rohit said, the message to the players is clear-seize the opportunity and make the most of it. ""It's always nice to have these ( Sarfaraz Khan ) kind of players waiting to play the game. It was unfortunate that Shubman missed this game.

Despite the clear weather in Ahmedabad on Sunday, a cloud of uncertainty hovers over the fortunes of Jharkhand on whether they will be able to secure the first innings lead for three points in their second-round match of Ranji Trophy Elite Group D against Railways .As things stand at stumps on Day 3 at ADSA Railways Cricket Ground, Railways' solid reply to Jharkhand's first innings total of 417 sees them on 320 for four wickets from 101 overs.So, the home side is very much in the hunt for a first innings lead as they trail Jharkhand by only 97 runs with six wickets in hand and the entire final day remaining.Mohammad Saif (113 runs off 208 balls, 12x4, 2x6) led Railways' charge with his seventh first-class century while overnight batter Vivek Singh (75 off 160) and Upendra Yadav scored half-centuries to put on a steady show as Jharkhand bowlers were made to toil hard throughout the day.Resuming the day on 19/1, Railways overnight batters Vivek Singh and captain Pratham Singh (24 runs off 47 balls) batted with caution and took the scoreboard to 61 before the skipper departed in the 11th over of the day, returning a catch to Virat Singh off right-arm pacer Supriyo Chakraborty's bowling. Pratham's was the only wicket to fall in the first session as Vivek was then joined by only century-maker of the day Saif.The duo put on 120 runs for the third wicket at a brisk pace in less than 30 overs to take the score to 181 when Vivek was caught leg-before-wicket by off-spinner Utkarsh Singh. Vivek's return to pavilion put a brake on Railways scoring pace but there was no stopping them as Saif and Upendra then stitched together a steady partnership of 88 runs for the fourth wicket in about 32 overs. Saif was caught and bowled by Utkarsh, who returned 2-55.Jharkhand's case was further damaged in the last session by a rampaging Ashutosh Sharma of Indian Premier League (IPL) fame. The Punjab Kings batter raced to an unbeaten 45 off 40 balls with four boundaries and three hits clearing the rope at a strike rate of 112.5. Sharma's blitzkrieg with the bat reduced his partner Upendra to a mere onlooker at the other end as they shared a 51-run stand for the unbroken fifth wicket where the former's share was 45.Sharma remaining at the crease along with Upendra will keep the Jharkhand camp worried. To stop Railways from surpassing their score on the final day, Jharkhand bowlers need to pull up their socks and strike some early blows for sure.Jharkhand 417. Railways (o/n 19/1) 320/4 in 101 overs (Vivek Singh 75, Mohd Saif 113, Upendra Yadav 53 batting, Ashutosh Sharma 45 batting; Utkarsh Singh 2-55, Supriyo Chakraborty 1-12).

It ended a magnificent 222-run second wicket stand that spanned 342 balls, between Gaikwad and Dhas, playing just his third first-class match after impressing with a match-winning 96 for the India Under-19 team against South Africa in the U-19 World Cup semifinal in Benoni in February this year.However, it was Gaikwad's wicket that allowed Mumbai a foot in the door they desperately needed.Introduced into the attack as later as the 57th over, off-spinning allrounder Tanush Kotian, who too is set to depart with the India A team to Australia, then struck thrice in succession, prising out Azim Kazi (7), 'keeper-bat Nikhil Naik (5) and Arshin Kulkarni (0, caught brilliantly by a leaping SKY at short mid-wicket).However, for a team which was shot out for just 126 at lunch on Day One in their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match here at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy in BKC, Maharashtra, unwilling to go down without a fight in this prestigious ‘Maharashtra Derby,' showed their mettle in their second innings all through, albeit with the wicket having eased out considerably.Refusing to thrown in the towel, the seasoned Ankit Bawne , who crossed 8,000 first-class runs during his fine knock, stroked his 24th first-class century (101, 152b, 10x4), adding 88 in 148 balls for the seventh wicket with Satyajeet Bachhav (20), before Mumbai roared back, wrapping up Maharashtra's innings at 388 by taking the last four wickets for just five runs. Sweating it out for a day and a session, Mulani (3-150 in 36 overs), Tanush Kotian (3-74 in 25 overs) and Mohit Avasthi (3-65 in 19.3 overs) were rewarded for their efforts, as Mumbai, chasing 74 and a bonus point win on Monday which will help them bounce back after the drubbing at the hands of Baroda in the first match, finished at 13 for no loss. For the record, it will be Mumbai's 17 outright win over Maharashtra.Gaikwad's 87-ball century here, which ended a drought of 13 first-class innings and 21 months for him-will be remembered for a long time. The 27-year-old began Sunday's proceedings with a bang, hooking Shardul Thakur for a six off the very first ball after play began at 10am due to overnight rain.Shrugging off a relatively lean run-he logged two fifties in six innings in the Duleep Trophy, followed by scores of in the Irani Cup versus Mumbai and 86 against Jammu & Kashmir, Gaikwad led Maharashtra's stiff resistance in the second innings, which has taken the match into Day Four and restored the visitors' pride.Gushing about Gaikwad's sublime batting style, Maharashtra coach Sulakshan Kulkarni said, ""It was a quality hundred against a good side. In terms of pure statistics, a lot of players get hundreds, but there are some batsmen who are a treat to watch, and Ruturaj is one of them. His 145 was pleasing to watch. He's an amazing talent, and he has added hard work to his talent and multiplied it. He's a 'touch player.' A quality that very good batsmen possess is that they convert the good balls into runs/boundaries. That's why he has that special class.""Pointing out how Gaikwad was also a quick runner between the wickets, Kulkarni said, ""He is among the finest runners between the wickets, which helps him get his runs, his partner's runs and the team's runs. That will be an advantage for the Indian team in the future when Virat Kohli calls it day. His running between the wickets is also a treat to watch.""",Ruturaj Gaikwad scores his seventh first-class hundred for Maharashtra. Mumbai bowler Shams Mulani takes three wickets for just five runs.

Kolkata: Mohammedan Sporting faced some home truth again as Kerala Blasters rode a second-half fightback to beat the Indian Super League debutants 2-1 at the Kishore Bharati Stadium on Sunday.The hosts went ahead in the 28th minute when Brazilian Carlos Franca earned a penalty and his Uzbekistani teammate Mirjalol Kasimov converted it much to the joy of the partisan crowd.But Kerala Blasters stormed back into the contest through goals from Kwame Peprah (67) and Jesus Jimenez (75).This was the first victory in three consecutive matches on the road for Mikael Stahre ’s Blasters, who had earlier drawn their clashes with NorthEast United FC and Odisha FC.Mohammedan SC , on the other hand, remain winless at home, their latest setback coming after a 0-3 mauling at the hands of Mohun Bagan SG two weeks ago. Their defensive frailties came to the fore again as they lost another plot after taking the lead. Andrey Chernyshov ’s side suffered an early jolt when Ghanaian defender Joseph Adjei had to leave the ground with a serious leg injury, thus paving the way for new recruit Frenchman Florent Ogier to make his debut in the black-and-white colours.The hosts, however, took the lead deservedly when Franca latched on to a brilliant ball from his half and fell under the challenge of Blasters custodian Som Kumar, leading to the penalty. Kasimov sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot.Blasters announced their intention of a comeback when they finished the first half with Jimenez hitting the crosspiece.Franca missed a golden chance to extend the lead on the hour mark when he went for glory himself instead of sending the ball to an unmarked Fanai at the other end. Thus reprieved, Blasters came calling, Adrian Luna whipping in a long cross and Noah Sadaoui — who was a constant threat to the hosts’ box from the left — sent it back across the six-yard box for Peprah to make it 1-1, two minutes after replacing fellow defender Alexandre Coeff.Sadaoui then missed a sitter, failing to beat Mohammedan SC goalkeeper Padam Chhetri from a one-on-one situation. But it didn’t prove costly as Jimenez rose to the occasion, meeting Huidrom Naocha’s cross with a perfect header, taking Ogier’s challenge in his stride.Fanai could have salvaged a draw deep in stoppage-time but Blasters goalkeeper Som produced a brilliant save to ensure that his team returned home with a win.",Kerala Blasters beat Indian Super League debutants Mohammedan Sporting 2-1 at the Kishore Bharati Stadium.

They could make the most of the break time on offer, and on Monday, Jamshedpur FC and Hyderabad FC will retake the field in the last fixture of the fifth round of Indian Super League with a sense of optimism reigning at both ends.It will be another opportunity for Jamshedpur to continue their best ISL start in front of the home crowd at JRD Tata Sports Complex . With nine points from four matches, the Khalid Jamil-led side has surpassed their preceding league campaign so far and the Indian head coach backed his team to maximise the familiar conditions at home.“It is a very important game for us.We are playing in front of our home crowd. They’re a good team. They’re stronger than before. We must prepare well and take a positive result from this match,” Jamil said in the pre-match press conference on Sunday.Jamil’s stress on “a positive result” is guided by the fact that — currently lying in third spot — a win against Hyderabad on Monday would take the Men of Steel above Mohun Bagan Super Giant and a point behind leaders Bengaluru FC on the second position.With Jamshedpur’s creator-in-chief Imran Khan leading the charts among Indian players producing most goal-scoring chances, the likes of Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio are expected to be provided with ample scope to convert upfront. Jamil will also have the dependable Stephen Eze in backline to lead their defence.However, the hosts will take on a Hyderabad side — led by the only other Indian coach in the league Thangboi Singto — that secured a clean sheet in their last match against Chennaiyin FC , breaking a run of five games where they conceded at least two goals. They will be eager to build on it and achieve back-to-back clean sheets for the first time since March 2023.However, their attack — with the likes of youngster Devendra Murgaonkar — will need to step up as they remain winless this season.“The players have become stronger as a group, in terms of respect and camaraderie. Football is a team sport. If they can relate that respect on the pitch, then the results will speak for themselves,” head coach Singto said on Sunday.But an in-form Jamshedpur will be in their way with the aim of continuing their run this season, rejuvenated by a much-needed break. “It is good for everybody. They recovered. Everyone went for a break for a few days and then came back. The players who were not fit are fit now. So we are ready,” added Jamil ahead of their return to action at the Furnace.","Jamshedpur FC and Hyderabad FC will meet in the fifth round of the Indian Super League on Monday.

Rayo stayed ninth.Lautaro Martinez made sure that Inter Milan kept pace with Serie A leaders Napoli by netting the Italian champions' only goal in Sunday's 1-0 win at Roma.Argentina striker Martinez lashed home his fourth goal of the season in all competitions on the hour mark after a poor clearance from Zeki Celik to give Inter a hard-fought win at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.Inter remain two points behind Napoli, 1-0 winners at Empoli, as Italy's top four all won this weekend, with a huge match against Juventus at the San Siro coming up in a week's time.Before that Inter will try to continue their positive start to their Champions League campaign in Bern, where Simone Inzaghi's side will take on Young Boys potentially without Hakan Calhanoglu and Francesco Acerbi who both forced off with injuries in the first half.Inter will however be buoyed by a solid performance in the Italian capital which could have easily ended with a bigger win as Roma goalkeeper Mile Svilar did well to charge off his line and keep out Marcus Thuram and Denzel Dumfries.""The boys played well... once we broke the deadlock we had chances to score again and should have,"" said Inzaghi to DAZN.""I'm very happy with what the boys showed me today.""Roma meanwhile are lagging behind in 10th following a second league defeat of a what is already a troubled season for the capital club.The match began in a strange atmosphere as Roma's hardcore fans stayed outside the ground for the first 15 minutes in protest at the direction of the club under billionaire American owner Dan Friedkin.Fans are still unhappy about idol Daniele De Rossi being sacked last month and frustrated by the management of Roma, who last qualified for the Champions League in 2018.""We created chances but didn't take advantage of them... to give away a goal the way we did in a match like this is a real shame because the team played well,"" said Roma coach Ivan Juric.Khvicha Kvaratskhelia struck the only goal, and his fourth of the season, from the penalty spot in the 63rd minute to give Napoli their fourth straight win in all competitions.Empoli beat Napoli home and away last season and their victory in Naples last November cost Rudi Garcia his job as coach, as a disastrous league title defence ended with southern Italy's biggest club in 10th.And the hosts were the better team for large portions of the match, with Kvaratskhelia's winning spot-kick Napoli's only shot on target in front of thousands of enthusiastic travelling supporters.Napoli don't have European football as a result of their collapse following a first Scudetto since 1990 and the days of Diego Maradona.And under Antonio Conte Napoli have quickly re-established themselves as title challengers, with the advantage of not having the expanded Champions League jamming up their schedule.""We're trying to build something here, something that isn't just a flash in the pan but lasts long-term,"" said Conte to DAZN.Fiorentina hammered 10-man Lecce 6-0 to move up to fifth and six points behind Napoli with their best performance since Raffaele Palladino took over in the summer.Braces from both Danilo Cataldi and Andrea Colpani, the latter's first goals since following Palladino from Monza, drove Fiorentina to a thumping away win which also featured strikes from Lucas Beltran and Fabiano Parisi.Fiorentina were helped by Antonino Gallo being harshly sent off for fouling Dodo with the score 2-0, the offence considered the denial of a clear goalscoring opportunity despite the presence of other defenders.Level on points with Fiorentina in sixth place are Atalanta who eased to a 2-0 win at bottom side Venezia thanks in large part to in-form striker Mateo Retegui.Italy attacker Retegui helped Mario Pasalic open the scoring early on and then sealed the points two minutes after the break with a delightful chipped finish.Retegui, who only signed for Atalanta after Gianluca Scamacca suffered a serious knee injury before the start of the season, leads the Serie A scoring charts with eight goals.Young players made their mark as Union Berlin's resurgence in the Bundesliga continued with a 2-0 win over struggling Holstein Kiel on Sunday.Nineteen-year-old wing back Tom Rothe crossed for 20-year-old midfielder Aljoscha Kemlein to score his first senior goal with a header in the 18th minute. Rothe — who played a key role in Kiel earning promotion last season — made sure of the win when he headed in Union's second goal at a corner in the 85th.The win lifts Union to fifth in the Bundesliga, three points off leader Bayern Munich. Union recorded back-to-back wins in the league for the first time since February.Union stunned German soccer by finishing fourth in the Bundesliga to qualify for the Champions League in 2023 but last season was a failure. Union was winless on its Champions League debut and finished 15th in the Bundesliga.Promoted Kiel is in the relegation zone and is the only team yet to earn a point at home this season in the Bundesliga after losing its fourth home game in a row.Also Sunday, Werder Bremen recovered from 1-0 down to beat Wolfsburg 4-2 and rise to eighth.Tiago Tomas gave Wolfsburg the lead with his heel as the ball ricocheted around a packed penalty area, but Mitchell Weiser's volley deep into first-half added time got Bremen back into the game. Second-half goals from Bremen's Felix Agu, Marvin Ducksch and Marco Grüll secured the win.Wolfsburg coach Ralph Hasenhüttl will also have to do without attacking midfielder Patrick Wimmer, who faces a suspension after being sent off for a desperate lunging tackle on Grüll.Wolfsburg is 13th and has scored the opening goal in each of its last four Bundesliga games but won only one of them. It also has only one point in its four home games.Marseille got back to winning ways in style with a 5-0 thumping of Montpellier on Sunday to move within three points of Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain.A fast start to the season had raised hopes of Marseille challenging for a first title since 2010 under Roberto De Zerbi before they dropped off with a defeat by Strasbourg and draw with Angers.But OM were at their best at bottom club Montpellier, cutting the gap to PSG and Monaco who are separated by goal difference at the top of the table.Marseille will have the chance to draw level on points with PSG when they host their rivals next Sunday.""We know who we are, what our path is and what we still need to improve to reach their (PSG's) level. But we will prepare to win, like in every match,"" said De Zerbi, who took over at the Stade Velodrome in the close season after leaving Premier League club Brighton.The visitors got off to a flying start in Montpellier, as Elye Wahi nodded home Jonathan Rowe's header across goal in the first minute.Amine Harit added a second in the 36th minute, before Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg effectively wrapped up the points before half-time.Mason Greenwood collected Wahi's through ball and drove forward before picking out the bottom corner to score his first goal since August.Luis Henrique completed the scoring with 17 minutes left after Montpellier youngster Stefan Dzodic had been sent off.Montpellier sacked coach Michel Der Zakarian just a few minutes after the final whistle, with the team only on four points after eight matches.""He is no longer the coach of the first team.

WOLVERHAMPTON (England): Manchester City defender John Stones headed a controversial stoppage-time winner in a 2-1 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday that took them top of the Premier League and set a club record of 31 league games unbeaten.Champions City dominated possession from start to finish at Molineux, but were shocked in the seventh minute when a perfect cross from Nelson Semedo was met with a composed close-range finish by Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.Semedo missed a glorious chance to put Wolves further ahead in a one-on-one that Ederson saved, before City defender Josko Gvardiol picked up the ball in space and curled a beautiful shot past Jose Sa for a deserved 33rd-minute equaliser.Stones's late goal from a corner went to a Video Assistant Refereee (VAR) check for a possible offside by Bernardo Silva in front of the goalkeeper, but it was allowed, to the delight of their manager Pep Guardiola and travelling fans.""I'm really pleased to win in that fashion and get on the scoresheet again,"" said Stones, who also scored a late equaliser against Arsenal last month.""It was a tough game. I've got to give credit to Wolves, how they stopped us creating chances, made it difficult for us in the final third,"" he added.City moved top of the league on goal difference with 20 points, two above Liverpool who face Chelsea later on Sunday and could retake top spot with a win.Bottom on one point and without a win this season, Wolves are staring at a battle against relegation unless they can start picking up wins.Their manager Gary O'Neil was furious at the end of the game, after his team had defended valiantly against City who enjoyed three quarters of possession.Referee Chris Kavanagh initially disallowed Stones' goal, believing Silva had blocked goalkeeper Sa's line of vision, but VAR deemed that was not the case.

He plans to gradually shift his focus to the men’s competition, playing Futures and Challengers.Tyagi, who trains at the Harsha Lingappa Tennis Academy in Bengaluru, will look to sharpen his game, particularly his serve in the coming weeks. “I have decent serves, but I want to improve it, I also want to get stronger and bigger,” said Tyagi.The India No.1 is scheduled to play the J500 in Merida, Mexico, (from Nov 25). He will also feature in J300 Bradenton (from Dec 2) and J500 Plantation, (Dec 9) both in the United States. “These are important tournaments for me, and I’m quite sure of doing well in these and improving my ranking,” he said.","Kriish Tyagi is India’s number one junior (boys singles) The 17-year-old from Bengaluru has now climbed to a career-high No 51 in the latest ITF junior rankings.

"Odisha’s Aahan, 14, comes of age with National junior tennis titles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/odishas-aahan-14-comes-of-age-with-national-junior-tennis-titles/articleshow/114255070.cms,"PUNE: Aahan discovered tennis in an unsual way.“You know the Wimbledon matches, US Open, Australian Open, all those,” Aahan said in the tone of a child sharing a wonderment.“When I was small, I used to watch tennis videos. Every kid watches cartoons, right? But I didn’t watch cartoons. I just used to watch sports, tennis specially.“So, my parents were like, ‘she likes it.We have to put her on to that’. So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.

I don’t think the court would want the case to go into a limbo,” he said.“We are on the same page when it comes to what they (petitioners) are asking for, good administration and good compliance (of the sports code).“My advice has always been to abide by the law.

His title in Shanghai was his seventh of the year.""He's very solid from the forehand and backhand, doesn't make too many mistakes, and just tries to take away the time from the opponent,"" said Djokovic.""That's something that reminds me of myself throughout my career, that's what I've done for so many years consistently, playing fast-paced tennis , taking away time from the opponent, kind of suffocating the opponent in a certain way.""","Novak Djokovic says he plans ""to compete and play next season"" The Serb lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to Jannik Sinner in the final of the Shanghai Masters.
