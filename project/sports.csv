""Our whole cricket's atmosphere has been spoiled because of you people.""



Iftikhar Ahmed responded to a question by a journalist.#ChampionsCup | #PakistanCricket pic.twitter.com/x9WN3lg1YH — Grassroots Cricket (@grassrootscric) September 29, 2024

Things in Pakistan cricket took a turn for the worse on Saturday when one of the national selectors, Mohammad Yousuf, resigned from his position following continued criticism since the team's failure in the T20 World Cup and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) overlooking consistent performers in domestic cricket. The effects of that were clearly felt in batsman Iftikhar Ahmed 's press conference following the Champions Cup final.Markhors ' skipper, Iftikhar, was visibly upset after his team's defeat by Panthers and vented out at a reporter over a question on the young talent emerging from the Champions Cup.When asked which young players, according to him, the tournament has unveiled, Iftikhar blamed the media for unnecessary hype.""Media ne kya dekh liya hai (what has the media observed)?"" he shot back at the reporter.""See, I am not against anyone, but I tell you people, the media, that don't hype someone so much after just one innings, like we have got this and that talent. Let them (youngsters) perform in domestic cricket. Let them succeed there 2-3 seasons, then talk about their prospects to play for Pakistan,"" he said without taking any names.""Ek innings mei aap upar le ke jaate, fir wahan pe jab woh Pakistan ke liye fail ho jata hai, toh kehte ho 'yeh kahan se laye ho, yeh toh kuchh bhi nahi hai' (media puts a batsman on cloud nine after just one innings and when that batsman fails while playing for Pakistan, you guys say 'where has this come from, it's nothing'),"" said Iftikhar.However, former Pakistan players like Ahmed Shehzad have been continuously criticising the PCB for not giving young talent a chance and keeping inconsistent performers in the team for longer than they deserve.But Iftikhar reiterated that youngsters should be considered for Pakistan only after they have succeeded in domestic cricket for a couple of seasons and not just after one good innings.""For god sake, let a player succeed in all formats in domestic cricket, then talk about him. You guys talk so much, like 'Pakistan has got another Inzamam'...I am not against anyone. I am telling everyone to give domestic cricket its due respect. Let a player succeed there in all formats. Then let's all of us talk about that player,"" said the 34-year-old all-rounder who has played 4 Tests, 28 ODIs and 66 T20Is.He went on to blame the media for spoiling the cricket atmosphere in the country.""Aap logon ki wajah se cricket ka jo sara mahaul hai woh kharab ho gaya hai (things in Pakistan cricket have gone bad because of you guys). The reason is that you guys hype someone so much after just one innings, and then you bring him down to earth,"" Iftikhar concluded.","Markhors'skipper, Iftikhar Ahmed, was visibly upset after his team's defeat by Panthers.

Mayank Yadav

Speaks To TOI About India Call-Up, Injury Which Is Common Among Javelin Throwers And How

Sonnet Club

Took Care Of All Of His Needs…

A lot is said about your pace…

Your injury and rehab at NCA…

You are very attached to Sonnet Club…

Could you elaborate on how Sonnet helped you?

You have already worked with Gautam Gambhir and Morne Morkel at LSG…

KANPUR: Mayank Yadav was having his dinner at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) when he learnt the selectors had picked him for the T20I series against Bangladesh. “I wasn’t aware of the selection.But I saw my mates here receiving congratulatory calls. I just checked the BCCI website and got to know my name was there,” Mayank told TOI.He rang up his mother, spoke to her about six minutes before she got emotional and tears started rolling down her cheeks. “Once I put down the phone, I had flashbacks in front of my eyes—from the day I first went to Sonnet Club to the four anxious months spent at the NCA to recover from frequent niggles,” he said of his first reaction.Mayank is just 22 and he has only played one first-class match, 17 List A matches and 14 T20s for Delhi before the four exciting IPL matches for LSG this year. That’s not a lot to go by before being picked for India. It’s his electric pace which easily breaches the 150 kmph mark on the speed gun that stood out.Excerpts from a conversation:I was not aware I could bowl this quick. I always thought I bowled at a pace which is normal for anybody. Devender Sharma sir (coach at Sonnet) and people in Delhi cricket would tell me I am bowling 150 kmph but I never believed them. In my first session at LSG in 2022, I bowled for a while. The support staff asked me to guess the speed of my deliveries. I said 140 kmph since I felt I bowled in a good rhythm. But then they told me I was bowling 149 and 150 kmph throughout. That’s when I realized I could bowl really quick.”When I was with LSG, I went to Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala (one who treated Rishabh Pant and looks after India’s Olympians). He told me my side strain is not a regular one. It happens to athletes in high-intensity sports like javelin or there must have been a major impact with an object. When I went to NCA after IPL, it was found that I was not taking enough protein. Since I am a strict vegetarian, I had to be given supplements. I had other niggles when I was about to get fit. It was agonizing but people at NCA like Troy Cooley and my trainer Rajnikanth were helpful. I can tell you that I understand my body now.When I went for a trial for a summer camp there as a 14-year-old, I got picked immediately. But the fee was around Rs 35 thousand. My father had a very small business and could not afford that amount. But Devender sir and late Tarak Sinha sir immediately waived the fee for me. They said they would take care of me then on. My father never spoke to me about cricket since. Even yesterday, he didn’t speak to me. Sonnet is special to me. Even at NCA, I met Rishabh (Pant) bhaiya. He was helpful and talked so much about how the club is doing. That’s what Sonnet does to its players.I could never afford bowling shoes. Tarak sir and Devender sir once noticed it. They gave me the money to buy my shoes as per my wish. I never thought I was any special bowler. Once during a camp in Jaipur just before Covid lockdown, I was hiding in a group of players. Tarak sir told everyone at the ground: “There is a bowler here who is really special. He will be in Delhi’s Ranji probables in no time and will be playing for India in four years and that is Mayank Yadav.” From then I never had issues with my confidence. I was 15 when Devender sir made me play in a semifinal of a senior tournament. I got four wickets there. I had issues with my line and length but they kept giving me matches till I got consistent.Gautam bhaiya had once told me that there will be players who get multiple chances to prove themselves and there will be some who will get just one opportunity. I was struggling to even find a sponsor for my shoe despite being in an IPL team and having played for Delhi. Gautam bhaiya’s words stayed with me. He and Vijay Dahiya (former coach at LSG) had clearly told me that I would get my first game after one or two years. When the opportunity came this year, I had to make it count. The day after my IPL debut, I got offers for my bowling shoes. As far as Morne is concerned, he doesn’t speak much. If he observes anything then he will come and point it out. He will mostly talk about strategies.","Mayank Yadav was picked for the T20I series against Bangladesh.

Is the UNCAPPED PLAYER RULE in #IPL a new one? Was it made for MS Dhoni?

The much-awaited player-retention rules for the Indian Premier League (IPL) have been officially announced by the tournament's Governing Council, and the fact that the definition of an 'uncapped' player perfectly fits for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to retain MS Dhoni , it has sent rumour mills in overdrive.The truth is that the rule has not been designed but merely brought back since being scrapped in 2021.Pertaining only to Indian players, the rule states that any player who hasn't played international cricket or held a central contact for five years will be categorized as uncapped. A franchise is allowed to retain a maximum of two such players for Rs 4 crore each.Dhoni fulfills both the criteria, having last played for India in the 2019 ODI World Cup semifinal defeat against New Zealand.Former India opern Aakash Chopra shed further light on the rule related to 'uncapped' players.""Is this rule new? No, it is not. It was there from the time the IPL started (2008) until 2021 when it was scrapped because no franchise utilized it even once. Now it has been reintroduced, and it is clearly beneficial for Chennai Super Kings, to be honest,"" said Chopra in a video on 'X' and his YouTube channel.""Dhoni had very clearly stated that unless the retention rules are known, his participation (inIPL 2025 ) will also not be known...So the (uncapped) rule definitely benefits Dhoni and Chennai...In my mind, I am convinced Dhoni will play this (2025) season.However, Dhoni is not the only player in that group of former India players who can be categorized as 'uncapped'.""Vijay Shankar, Mayank Markande, Amit Mishra, Rishi Dhawan, Mohit Sharma, Sandeep Sharma, Karn Sharma and Piyush Chawla are the other names that you find in the list because of this ( uncapped player ) rule,"" Chopra revealed.According to the IPL Player Regulations 2025-27, a franchise can retain a total of six players from their existing squad. It can include a maximum of five capped players (Indian and overseas) and a maximum of two uncapped players.The ball is now in franchises' court to decide who they want to retain ahead of the 'Big Auction', which will most likely be held at an overseas location towards the end of November.",The much-awaited player-retention rules for the Indian Premier League (IPL) have been officially announced by the tournament's Governing Council.

With the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) Player Regulations announced, decks have been cleared for the ten franchises to decide on the players they want to retain before going into the 'Big Auction'; and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) have already received a major advice from former India batsman Mohammad Kaif - ""If you get a chance, get Rohit Sharma "".Rohit was replaced as skipper by the Mumbai Indians (MI) ahead of the 2024 season, handing over the team's reins to allrounder Hardik Pandya.But the move backfired as the team failed to make the knockouts in one of their worst performances in the IPL.While it is yet to be known if MI will retain their five-time title-winning skipper, Kaif has advised the RCB to not miss the opportunity of getting Rohit if they get that and appoint him as the team's captain.Kohli has been playing for the RCB ever since the league's inaugural season in 2008, but could never lead the team to a title. But he continues to shine for the franchise as a batsman and was the top-scorer of the 2024 season as well.Both Kohli and Virat quit the format in the international arena after India's T20 World Cup triumph in June this year.Kaif suggested Rohit's skills as a leader might end RCB's wait of winning the IPL.""Player unnees-bees hota hai. Yeh banda athharah ko bees kar deta hai (a player can be there or thereabout, but Rohit can turn the same player into exceptional)"", Kaif could be heard saying on a video floating on social media.""He (Rohit) knows how to get the best out of a player by putting an arm around him,"" added Kaif.""He understands the tactical moves, knows which player to fit where in the playing eleven, does that brilliantly. So I believe, agar mauka mile RCB ko, toh bhai le lo Rohit Sharma ko as a captain (if RCB get a chance, they should take Rohit as a captain),"" Kaif concluded.According to the IPL Player Regulations 2025-27, a franchise can retain a total of six players from their existing squad.

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Saturday announced new retention rules for the IPL 2025 season, which included a notable change for uncapped players .The rule change has sparked debate over Dhoni's future in the IPL, as many fans speculate if the 2024 season was truly his last.Amid the chatter around the uncapped player rule, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan 's recent comments about Dhoni have now gone viral.At the recent IIFA award ceremony, Shah Rukh was asked about retirement by his longtime friend and filmmaker, Karan Johar , leading to a hilarious exchange.During the event, Karan teased Shah Rukh when the latter said, ""Legends know when to retire."" He also cited the examples like Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Chhetri, and Roger Federer.Replying to that, Karan quipped, ""So, by that standard, why don't you retire?""In classic SRK fashion, he responded with quick wit, ""Actually mai doosre kisam ka legendary hoon. Mai aur Dhoni ek kisam ke legends hai. Na na kar ke bhi 10 aur IPL seasons khel jaate hai (Actually, I’m a different kind of legend. Dhoni and I belong to the same league. Even when we say no, we end up playing 10 more IPL seasons).""The audience erupted with laughter at Shah Rukh’s playful jibe. Vicky Kaushal , taking advantage of the situation, tried to add some more humour to the context by saying, “Retirement is for legends. Kings are forever.”Fans, already abuzz about the new retention rules, loved the camaraderie between SRK and Dhoni, further fueling the discussion about the CSK captain's future.According to the revised regulations, any Indian player who has not played an international match in the last five years will be considered 'uncapped'.This means that legendary Dhoni, who last played for India in 2019, now qualifies as an uncapped player for the upcoming IPL season. Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Dhoni’s long-time team, can retain the iconic wicketkeeper-batter for a much-reduced price of Rs 4 crore.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Saturday announced new retention rules for the IPL 2025 season, which included a notable change for uncapped players.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali feels that Kanpur should not host Test matches in the future, and if the second match between India and Bangladesh ends in a draw, then it could have a big impact on the hosts in the World Test Championship (WTC) standings.Only one session of the opening day has been played since the commencement of the Kanpur Test .On Sunday, the impact of rain continued to impact the Test as the third day was washed away due to wet outfield at Green Park .Basit Ali slammed the management for their inability to make the ground ready for play despite the availability of two super soppers.""They couldn't manage to dry the ground even though it hadn't rained since last night. Even after two super soppers, the ground was still wet. It means that covers were not great. Whoever is next BCCI secretary after Jay Shah should suspend Test matches in Kanpur,"" Basit said on his YouTube channel.Even though it didn't rain on Sunday, there were still some wet patches in the ground, including one near the bowler's run up area. The outfield could not be dried out despite the covers being peeled off.Basit went on to state that if the game ends up as a draw, it could have a major impact on their position in the WTC standings .""If the match ends up in a draw, then this result could affect India in the WTC standings. Everyone is thinking that India will win the three Tests against New Zealand. If one match ends up in a draw, then India could be in trouble.

NEW DELHI: The poor facilities at Kanpur's Green Park Stadium came under fire during the second Test between India and Bangladesh, particularly after Day 3 was abandoned due to a wet outfield, despite no rain on Sunday.Frustration mounted among fans and cricket experts as the drainage system became the focal point of criticism, with many questioning whether the venue is fit for international cricket .One fan's viral video captured the sentiment perfectly. “This stadium in Kanpur is so old, there’s no proper drainage system at all. It’s not even raining anymore. If it were any other ground, the covers would’ve been off by now, and the match would’ve started already. The ground's really bad, and I don’t think Kanpur will get more matches in the future with such poor facilities. (Itni ghatiya services hai yaha pe) It’s just terrible here,” he said, summing up the mood in the stands.The match had already been disrupted by rain on Day 1, and Day 2 was completely washed out due to a wet outfield.However, the decision to abandon play on Day 3, when there was no rain, left fans particularly outraged.Umpires conducted multiple inspections throughout the day, but the outfield remained unfit for play, resulting in another frustrating delay.The drainage system at Green Park, or rather the lack of it, became the centre of attention.In modern cricket, venues are expected to have top-notch facilities, including proper drainage, to ensure play can resume as soon as conditions improve.Comparisons to other stadiums with better infrastructure were inevitable, with many fans and pundits arguing that this wouldn’t have happened at more advanced grounds.Given these recurring issues, questions are being raised about Kanpur's suitability as a host for future international matches.","India vs Bangladesh 3rd Test at Green Park Stadium, Kanpur.

We won the (T20) World Cup (2024) in the West Indies which was a great result. But if you see all the three formats, we have dominated.""Not only the rankings, we have dominated. There is so much of supply chain as far as cricket is concerned. That means the amount of players we have at our disposal, it is a real blessing.""The 49-year-old said ""grooming"" the players, without tinkering with their natural game, was essential to maintain that ""supply chain.""""The whole idea is to monitor them, how to groom them, so that they realise their potential. It's not that we dictate them (players) that you have to do this or you have to change (technique).""Ultimately the player should feel comfortable, acknowledging and accepting that option. We don't want the player to suddenly feel the burden of whose advice he has to listen to.""The former India batter then described how monitoring of the ""targeted"" players was done at the CoE.""When Rahul was the head coach of the Indian team, he used to take care of the contracted players and we at NCA used to take care of the targeted players, emerging players and the under-19 players.""We know what are the areas they are required to work on. And through the year, we make sure that the player is working on them.""For this purpose, Laxman said he and the other support staff have created a wonderful synergy with various state associations to ensure continuity and similarity in coaching.""So, we collaborate with the state coaches because ultimately the state association coaches spend a lot more time with a player than what we do. We also have an athlete management system. A profile is created for all the players who come and attend the ZCA and the NCA camps...right from their reports of skills to the fitness to the musculoskeletal screening report.""Now, we are going to even request the state association to follow that process. So, at least 50 players of each state association - 25 men and 25 women -- should be there on the watch list. So, the whole idea is, if a player comes to NCA or is part of any ZCA camp, 5 or even 10 years from now, his file should be there.""We will know how the player has progressed and it will become very easy for anyone who is taking care of that player to know what the player has gone through every year,"" he elaborated on the process.Along with the skill enhancement, Laxman said keeping the players in a right mental state is important for their growth.""The players themselves are so professional. They understand what is needed for them to be in the best mindset when they are competing at the highest level. As far as the junior cricketers are concerned, we have got mental conditioners who spend 8 to 10 days with the players.Laxman described the significance of 'A' tours in preparing a player to tackle all kind of conditions that he may encounter in future.""Every year we make sure that we have at least two A Series. Sometimes it can be challenging because we want to have an A Series whereas the other boards will be busy with their own domestic cricket. Or they may not be ready to accommodate us.""But at least we try to have two A Series. The A programme allows us to go to different parts of the world and get experience. So that when they graduate to the national team, it is not a surprise to them,"" added Laxman.","VVS Laxman says India's dominance in world cricket is a reflection of a steady ""supply chain"" The 49-year-old said ""grooming"" the players, without tinkering with their natural game, was essential to maintain that "" supply chain"" He said he has created a wonderful synergy with various state associations to ensure continuity and similarity in coaching.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113802419,imgsize-39174,width-400,resizemode-4/113802419.jpg"

Gautam Gambhir goes on a duck .. jimmy Anderson shines

NEW DELHI: Gautam Gambhir , the hero of two World Cups for India in white-ball cricket, has taken on the responsibility of being the head coach for the Indian team . He has replaced Rahul Dravid , who ended his tenure after leading the team to victory in the T20 World Cup 2024 .Gautam Gambhir, who was awarded Test Player of the Year in 2009 was labelled 'rubbish' by an English commentator when India toured England in 2014.The Indian team had returned to English soil in 2014 for a Test series for the first time since their victory over the home side in the Champions Trophy final in 2013. The England team were eager to bounce back and play well to settle the score.India made a strong comeback after their last disappointing Test series in England. They managed a draw in the first match and secured a win in the second. With the five-match series becoming competitive, it was clear England would not have an easy time.England regrouped and won the next two matches, bringing the series score to 2-1 over four games. India, feeling the pressure, remained focused on winning the final Test to level the series, despite having lost momentum recently.India’s cricket team commenced batting on the first day of the fifth Test against England with openers Murali Vijay and Gautam Gambhir taking the crease. Despite previous struggles on English pitches, Gambhir's return to the Test scene was met with harsh criticism from commentatorGeoffrey Boycott .Boycott was vocal about Gambhir's performance, saying, ""Gautam Gambhir is now marking his crease, and he is one of those rubbish players in this Indian side.""Gambhir's outing was brief as he was dismissed on the first ball by James Anderson , failing to score. Gambhir's Test average in England is 12.70.Following Gambhir's early dismissal, Boycott reiterated his stance, ""Well, he is rubbish, isn’t he? I told you, he can’t bat in England. I have seen him play in nearly all his 50 Test matches. Flat decks in India, where the ball doesn’t bounce or do much. That’s just crazy batting.""This marked Gautam Gambhir’s final Test match in England.Contrary to Boycott's statements, Gautam Gambhir actually has a better Test average outside India than in India. On foreign soil, Gambhir averages 43.61, whereas in home conditions, his average is 40.73.",Gautam Gambhir has replaced Rahul Dravid as India's head coach. He was dismissed on the first ball of the fifth Test against England. The batsman was labelled 'rubbish' by English commentator Geoffrey Boycott.

CHENNAI: The India U-19 team is set to step into unfamiliar territory.With youth Tests being a rarity, India will play their first multi-day match in over five years when they cross swords with Australia U-19 in the first of two games that begins on Monday here. The India U-19 side had last featured in a red-ball fixture way back in February 2019.At the MA Chidambaram Stadium , Soham Patwardhan & Co, all new kids on the block, should tackle an element of uncertainty and handle the vagaries of long-format cricket besides adapting to the pitch and weather.Both India and Australia will have their work cut out, having had only three days to acclimatise to the challenging conditions in Chennai - in the one-day series that preceded the Tests and ended on Thursday in Puducherry, the hosts produced a 3-0 whitewash.India U-19 head coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar acknowledged that the home team has a tough task in front of it. ""It is a great initiative to play Tests. Red-ball cricket really tests you. For every player, it is the ideal challenge to see where they stand,"" Kanitkar said on Sunday.""There is enough time for the bowlers to plan and devise their strategies. Playing against a foreign side is a great thing. Playing foreign teams at the U-19 level has helped a lot of players, including myself,"" said Kanitkar, a former India batter.While India will head into the assignment as the favourites, considering the home advantage and recent results over their rivals, Kanitkar stressed that they will start afresh.""The boys are confident, we had a good one-day series. But having said that, this is a different format altogether. The place is different. It is better to take the good things and leave the highs as we prepare for the Tests. That is what we have done,"" said Kanitkar.As for the Oliver Peake-led Australia, they will be keen to open their account after having a frustrating start to the tour. The visitors will take heart from the fight they displayed in the high-scoring third one-dayer, where they came close to snatching victory.Rahul Dravid's son Samit Dravid , who sat out the one-day series, continues to remain on the sidelines as he is still recovering from a knee injury.""As of now, Samit is at the NCA ( National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru). We do not know if he will be a part of this series. It looks unlikely,"" said Kanitkar.",India U-19s set to play first multi-day match in over five years.

Next season, the red-ball tournament is likely to return to its traditional format of a zonal competition.The recently-concluded Duleep Trophy was highlighted by the presence of many star Indian players, but the state units were wary of the 'unfair representation' of players.",The BCCI Annual General Body meeting was a low-key meeting with no major decisions taken.

Grand centre is all set to roll

BENGALURU: The long-cherished dream of the BCCI to have a world-class multipurpose facility of its own is finally coming to fruition with the inauguration of the National Cricket Academy , rechristened the BCCI's Centre of Excellence , on Saturday evening.The foundation stone for the state-of-the-art facility was laid in February 2022, and 30 months later, the finishing touches are being added.The facility has been in the pipeline for a long time. In 2010, the BCCI purchased 49 acres of land from the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) to set up its own facility for the National Cricket Academy.Three years later, the property hit a legal hurdle when the Karnataka High Court deemed the transaction illegal. With the deadlock continuing, it wasn't until 2016 that the cricket board started identifying properties in other states. The Karnataka government swiftly acted to clear the decks for the acquisition of the property.After spending 24 years at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, the Centre of Excellence is likely to be operational at the new premises by the year-end.At the heart of the project are three international standard grounds with modern amenities. Ground A, the main ground, has an 85-yard boundary with 13 red soil pitches. Beyond the lush green boundary line on one side are seating mounds with the ground surrounded by picket fences giving it a county vibe.While the grounds, the dressing rooms, and administrative facilities are ready for use, the equipment in the gymnasium is yet to be installed.Speaking to the media, NCA head VVS Laxman , on Sunday, said, ""NCA has been renamed as the BCCI Centre of Excellence. The word excellence is very important for all the sportspersons who are trying to compete at the highest level. The beneficiaries will be not only the future generation of cricketers but also the current generation."" Laxman stated.""It is a dream come true for all the players with three world-class grounds, 45 practice wickets, and other facilities. I just hope that everyone who comes here will benefit from this initiative.""On the multi-layered use of facilities, Laxman highlighted, ""There is a misconception that the cricketers come here only for rehab. They come to upskill themselves and get ready for the challenges coming their way.""","The National Cricket Academy has been rechristened the BCCI Centre of Excellence.

KANPUR: As you approached the Green Park Stadium on Sunday morning, you could see hordes of excited fans pointing towards the blue sky as they briskly walked to watch the third day of the second Test between India and Bangladesh .The smattering of dark clouds could not bog them down. Little did they know that poor condition of the outfield would not allow a ball to be bowled in the day.There was no rain all day.But there wasn't any play either. That effectively means that there is a very slim chance of getting a result and India may lose out on some crucial World Test Championship points.Covers were off but the umpires weren't happy with the outfield which was under covers for nearly two days. The match officials had told both teams to stay put at the hotel until there could be a chance of resuming play after they had gone off the field post lunch on Day One. The crowd waited patiently and vociferously cheered every time the officials came out to inspect the outfield, every two hours.Soon, things were to turn rather comical. When the umpires felt the field wasn't ready to start the game even at 12 pm and scheduled another inspection at 2 pm, the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) officials started announcing that the game could not be started because of poor light. It was the brightest in the last three days!Shiv Kumar, the chief curator, claimed that the light wasn't good enough albeit one could see the umpires were concerned about some damp patches inside the 30-yard circle. ""The ground is absolutely fit to play. The moisture has been absorbed by the super sopper. The umpires feel it needs the sun for a natural element of heat,"" Shiv Kumar told TOI.At 2 pm, when the sun was beating down on the stadium, the officials called off the match citing a wet outfield .The Green Park Stadium's facilities have been under scrutiny for a while and UPCA's stubbornness to host the Test here despite the Indian team management's reluctance to play here must have left the association embarrassed.",Covers were off but the umpires weren't happy with the outfield which was under covers for nearly two days.

KOLKATA: Looking to make a comeback to winning ways in front of their home fans, a 10-man NorthEast United FC paid the price for profligacy and were left to eke out a 1-1 draw against Kerala Blasters in an Indian Super League ( ISL ) match in Guwahati on Sunday.Alaeddine Ajaraie gave the Highlanders a lucky lead in the 58th minute only to see Noah Sadaoui draw level in the 67th minute with a brilliant strike at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium.And though, after repeated replays, it looked to be a contentious decision by referee Pranjal Banerjee to show Asheer Akhtar a direct red in the 82nd minute, the home side had to defend well for the last 15 minutes to earn a point from the match.Earlier, the visitors started well and made several forays into the NorthEast box during the first 30 minutes only to see the action shifting to their area after the first-half drinks break. And with the crowd egging them on, the NEUFC players came close to scoring on a number of occasions.First in the 33rd minute, Guillermo Fernandez's right-footed shot from the right of the box was close to the target but missed the right post by a whisker as Blasters custodian Sachin Suresh managed a feather touch on the attempt by the NEUFC striker, who was assisted by a livewire Jithin MS following a fast break.Then two minutes later Ajaraie's right-footed shot from outside the box hit the left post as Suresh managed a fingertip to deny the Moroccan forward a deserving lead.However, the change of sides made the contest a closely fought one and it was Ajaraie, who finally broke the deadlock a minute from the hour mark. This time he scored directly from a free-kick, but with help from a howler by Suresh after Jithin had won the foul when he was tripped well outside the box following a swift turn.Ajaraie's powerful low kick easily beat the defensive wall but went straight to Suresh, who spilled it only to see the ball cross the goalline through his legs to give the hosts 1-0 lead.The Highlanders' joy was short-lived though as about ten minutes later, Noah Sadaoui silenced the home fans with a brilliant equaliser. The Moroccan winger's left-footed shot from outside the box to the bottom-right corner after cutting into the area following an assist by Mohammed Aimen was inch perfect, which beat a full-stretched NEUFC 'keeper Gurmeet Singh to his left at the right post.With the score locked at 1-1, NEUFC pressed for the winner but couldn't carry on attacking for long as they were down to ten men in the 82nd minute when centre-back Akhtar was shown a straight red for a challenge on Sadaoui near the touchline. It looked a bit harsh but NEUFC lost the sting after that and the match eventually ended in a draw.The result put both sides on four points after three matches with one draw, win and loss each.

Atletico was third, two points behind Madrid after eight rounds.""I always think positively,"" Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. ""We moved closer to the leader and we have been playing well.""The derby was interrupted shortly after Madrid's goal at the Metropolitano, with the referee sending the players to the locker rooms after Atletico fans kept throwing objects onto the field.Militao had celebrated near the side line in front of Atletico fans, and Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was seen appearing to provoke Atletico fans after Militao scored.""What the fans did wasn't right but we are not helping when we provoke them,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. ""I'm not justifying what the fans did, but we need to help as well.""It was Courtois who alerted the referee about the objects - including lighters - being thrown onto the field near him.Atletico defender Jose Maria Gimenez and midfielder Koke Resurreccion went to talk to the fans in the section behind Courtois' goal. That section is where usually the more radical Atletico supporters are located. Atletico coach Diego Simeone also asked several times for the fans to behave.A message over the stadium loudspeakers said the match was being interrupted for 15 minutes, and that it would be suspended if the problem continued.The interruption came a day after the Spanish league said it would ask police to act against the promoters of a social media campaign which the league said was aimed at promoting racist acts against Madrid star Vinicius Junior at the derby.The social media campaign was based on a hashtag encouraging Atletico fans to wear face masks, apparently to make it more difficult for authorities to identify individuals who participate in racist chants or insults.Social media videos showed Atletico fans before the match chanting ""Vinicius is different.""Vinicius occasionally clashed with Atletico players at the Metropolitano.Atletico's Marcos Llorente was sent off in stoppage time.Other results Fourth-place 10-man Athletic Bilbao conceded a stoppage-time equalizer in a 1-1 draw with Sevilla at home, while Giovani Lo Celso scored an 85th-minute goal in Real Betis' 1-0 home win over Espanyol.Iago Aspas got an 81st-minute equalizer for Celta Vigo in a 1-1 draw against visiting Girona.",Angel Correa scores in stoppage time as Atletico Madrid draws 1-1 with Real Madrid.

Moreover, we also wonder whether it will be safe for the players to travel and play in a country which is in a state of mourning,"" the source said.""We are ready to play at an alternative venue or in a neutral country, if possible. We have requested the AFC to look into the matter and are waiting for their guidance and clarity on the issue.

Alaeddine Ajaraei 's goal from a freekick was equalised by Noah Sadaoui's stunning strike as the Kerala Blasters FC salvaged a crucial point on the road.Right from kickoff, it was a very high-intensity match with end-to-end football from both sides.However, the visitors made the more impressive moves with the likes of Noah, Jesus Jimenez and Danish Farooq combining in attack.Kerala Blasters FC almost had the opener when their Moroccan superstar lost his marker and made a telling run down the left flank before finding Farooq in the box. Unfortunately the 28-year-old failed to make contact with the ball with only the goalkeeper to beat.Noah kept pushing for the opening goal as he once again dropped a shoulder and rifled an effort from outside the box but it was a whisker away from nestling into the top corner.The momentum of the game gradually shifted towards the Highlanders as Jithin MS made a surging run forward before releasing Guillermo Fernandez in space near the penalty box. With only the keeper to beat, the Spaniard scuffed his shot wide.A couple of minutes later, Guillermo and Ajaraei combined before the latter hammered a grounded effort which forced Sachin Suresh to come up with a sensational save before it brushed off the post.At the start of the second half, Mikael Stahre turned to Kwame Peprah to replace Alexandre Coeff as he wanted to add more guile to the attack.Kerala Blasters FC started the second essay brightly with Rahul KP getting more involved in play for them.The winger had a golden opportunity to break the deadlock following Vibin Mohanan's freekick which got deflected and fell right into Rahul's path in the penalty area. Unfortunately, his effort couldn't test Gurmeet Singh in goal.However, NorthEast United FC made them pay courtesy of a goal from Ajaraei in the 58th minute.The Moroccan struck a free-kick straight on goal and on any other day, Sachin would gather it with ease. But the young goalkeeper faltered with his collection as the ball crossed the line, awarding NorthEast United FC with the opening goal.Despite the goal, the visitors kept pushing forward in search of the equalizer. Noah with his mazy runs caused a lot of problems for the Highlanders' defence.Kerala Blasters FC were eventually rewarded in the 67th minute when substitute Mohammed Aimen released Noah just outside the box.

NEW DELHI: The FIFA Puskás Award has long been recognized as the pinnacle of individual brilliance in football goal-scoring. Named after Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskás, it celebrates the most aesthetically pleasing and remarkable goals each year.However, as with any award, the subjectivity of selection has led to some truly spectacular goals being overlooked.Here, we have five goals that, despite their brilliance, somehow missed out on the coveted Puskás Award, leaving fans and pundits wondering how they didn’t make the cut.Zlatan Ibrahimović is no stranger to wonder goals, but his stunning overhead kick for LA Galaxy against New England in 2019 deserved more recognition. With the ball lofted into the box, Zlatan demonstrated impeccable technique, timing his leap to unleash an acrobatic bicycle kick that nestled into the back of the net.It was the perfect combination of athleticism, audacity, and finishing prowess — everything you’d expect from a Puskás contender. However, despite being one of the standout goals of that MLS season, it didn’t make the final cut for the Puskás nomination.Hatem Ben Arfa’s talent has always been mercurial, but when he’s in form, he’s capable of producing moments of pure magic. One such moment came in 2016 while playing for Nice against Rennes.Picking the ball up deep in his own half, Ben Arfa slalomed past five defenders with a blend of mesmerizing footwork and speed, before calmly slotting the ball past the goalkeeper.It was a solo goal of the highest order, reminiscent of Diego Maradona’s famous World Cup strike. Yet, despite its genius, Ben Arfa’s solo effort didn’t claim the Puskás Award that year, much to the surprise of many.Few moments in football are as defining as scoring the winning goal in a major tournament final. Eder did just that, delivering a title-securing strike for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final against France.After receiving the ball from a deep midfield position, Eder took a touch and unleashed an unstoppable long-range effort that curled past Hugo Lloris, sealing Portugal’s first-ever European Championship.Given the magnitude of the occasion and the quality of the goal, many felt it deserved a Puskás nomination. However, it wasn’t even shortlisted, leaving fans scratching their heads.One of the most jaw-dropping moments of Euro 2020 was Patrik Schick’s audacious long-range strike against Scotland. Spotting the goalkeeper off his line, Schick took aim from just inside the halfway line, curling the ball with perfect accuracy into the net.It was a goal that left viewers stunned, with the precision and audacity of the attempt setting it apart from anything seen in the tournament.Despite the goal being widely hailed as one of the best in recent international tournaments, it did not win the Puskás Award, with many feeling it was unfairly overlooked.Few goals encapsulate the spirit and excitement of a World Cup quite like Siphiwe Tshabalala’s opening strike in the 2010 tournament.Playing for host nation South Africa, Tshabalala received a through ball on the left side of the pitch, took a perfect first touch, and rifled the ball into the top corner from the edge of the box.The goal was not only a thing of beauty but also carried immense historical significance, being the first goal scored on African soil in a World Cup.Many believed Tshabalala’s strike was a strong contender for the Puskás Award, but it didn’t even make the final three, leading to widespread disappointment.",The FIFA Puskás Award celebrates the most aesthetically pleasing and remarkable goals each year. Zlatan Ibrahimović’s bicycle kick for LA Galaxy against New England in 2019 deserved more recognition. Patrik Schick's long-range strike for Czech Republic against Scotland in Euro 2020 was widely hailed as one of the best in recent international tournaments.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113791257,imgsize-74058,width-400,resizemode-4/113791257.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Key players will be side lined when the Champions League resumes Tuesday after a wave of injuries within a week of the new-look competition starting. Kylian Mbappe 's sore hamstring is likely to sideline him beyond Wednesday when he was due to return to France with defending champion Real Madrid to face Lille.Serious knee injuries mean Manchester City midfielder Rodri is out for the season and Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen will miss at least most of it.Inter Milan midfielder Nicolo Barella , who was a standout playing against Rodri on Sept. 18, will miss at least one Champions League game because of a thigh strain.The injuries to four players who were involved at the European Championship into the knockout phase have sharpened the debate about player workload in a calendar made more congested by the bigger Champions League.The extended program is what influential clubs all-but forced UEFA to create and the 18 games this week, split between Tuesday and Wednesday, still leaves each of them with six more to play through January.Another final rematch There were two repeats of past finals in the first week of games that relaunched the Champions League in a single-standings format. Man City and Inter drew 0-0 and Liverpool won 3-1 at AC Milan.The next rematch comes Wednesday when Aston Villa hosts Bayern Munich , a giant of the European Cup era that was shocked 1-0 in the 1982 final.Villa Park will host a first game in the competition since March 1983 when the English side's title defense was ended by Juventus.Both eased to winning starts two weeks ago. Villa won 3-0 at Young Boys and Bayern's nine goals against Dinamo Zagreb was a record for any team in the 33-season Champions League era. Harry Kane scored four in Bayern's 9-2 win and has a good record visiting Villa, with five goals there in five Premier League games for Tottenham. He faces a late check on an ankle injury.Kane edges Haaland Kane's fast start to the season with 10 goals in seven games for Bayern has outpaced even Erling Haaland's 10 in eight games for Man City.Haaland was kept quiet by Inter for the second time in 16 months, a fact he was reminded of in a post-game talk with the Italian champion's center back Francesco Acerbi, who smiled and held up two fingers.Haaland should find it easier on Tuesday in Slovakia when Man City faces Slovan Bratislava, which took the second biggest beating in the opening round, 5-1 at Celtic.Crowd size and fan fervour The pulsating atmosphere at Celtic Park for a rare European win by the Scottish champion stood out in an opening week where anticipation was not universal.Pundits including former Man City goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel noted a quietness about the stadium for the Inter game. The attendance was nearly 2,000 higher five days later when Man City met Arsenal in a tempestuous Premier League clash where title ambitions were already in play.Milan-Liverpool was a heavyweight European fixture yet far from sold out, with fewer than 60,000 at San Siro. The crowd topped 70,000 at each of Milan's first two Serie A home games this season, and 66,000 on the equivalent Champions League opening night last season to see another English club, Newcastle.Paris Saint-Germain drew at least 46,000 fans for each home game in Ligue 1 this season - and all three Champions League group-stage games last season - yet fewer than 40,000 were at Parc des Princes to see European debutant Girona two weeks ago.Sporting Lisbon also had 40,000 fans for a Champions League opener against Lille that was 6,000 down on the crowd for a domestic league game against Porto.The attendance and atmosphere trends will be watched as fans respond to the longer and more expensive program of four Champions League home games. The 36-team standings is set to be more dynamic for the final two rounds in January.Tuesday's games The raucous atmosphere should follow Celtic to Borussia Dortmund whose fans in the Yellow Wall tribune are among the noisiest in Europe.Bundesliga champion Bayer Leverkusen hosts Milan after making a fast star in a 4-0 rout at Feyenoord. San Siro now reverts to Inter to host Red Star Belgrade.Arsenal hosts PSG in a meeting of two teams chasing a trophy they never won. Each was a beaten finalist once. Also, Barcelona hosts Young Boys.Wednesday's games Even without Mbappe, Madrid should have too much for Lille playing in the stadium that hosted basketball group-stage games at the Paris Olympics.Premier League leader Liverpool hosts Bologna, and Girona's first European visitor to the Montilivi stadium is Feyenoord.Dinamo Zagreb fired its coach, Sergej Jakirović, after the drubbing at Bayern and brought back Nenad Bjelica for a second spell. He starts in the Champions League hosting Monaco.",Key players will be side lined when the Champions League resumes Tuesday. Kylian Mbappe's sore hamstring is likely to sideline him beyond Wednesday. Manchester City midfielder Rodri is out for the season. Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen will miss at least most of it.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113785391,imgsize-29694,width-400,resizemode-4/113785391.jpg"
Top Five All-Time FIFA World Cup Goal Scorers: From Miroslav Klose to Lionel Messi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/top-five-all-time-fifa-world-cup-goal-scorers-from-miroslav-klose-to-lionel-messi/articleshow/113783264.cms,"Miroslav Klose and Lionel Messi

Miroslav Klose (Germany) – 16 Goals

Ronaldo (Brazil) – 15 Goals

Gerd Mueller (West Germany) – 14 Goals

Just Fontaine (France) – 13 Goals

Lionel Messi (Argentina) - 13 Goals

The FIFA World Cup has seen some of the greatest footballers etch their names into history with extraordinary goal-scoring feats. Since its inception in 1930, the tournament has provided a global stage for players to showcase their talents, and a select few have risen above the rest to become all-time leading goal scorers.Topping this list are legends who have defined eras and brought glory to their nations.Miroslav Klose , Ronaldo , Gerd Müller , Just Fontaine , and Lionel Messi are five players who have made their mark in the World Cup with exceptional scoring records.Let’s take a closer look at the top five all-time FIFA World Cup goal scorers and the impact they've had on the tournament's rich history.Miroslav Klose stands atop the list of FIFA World Cup all-time scorers with 16 goals, accumulated over four tournaments (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014). Klose's World Cup debut in 2002 saw him score 5 goals, helping Germany reach the final. He added 5 more in 2006 and 4 in 2010 before scoring his record-breaking 16th in the 2014 semifinal against Brazil. Klose’s crowning achievement came when he won the World Cup with Germany in 2014.Brazilian forward Ronaldo scored 15 World Cup goals across three tournaments (1998, 2002, 2006). He scored 4 goals in 1998, where Brazil finished as runners-up, and was the top scorer in 2002 with 8 goals, including a decisive brace in the final against Germany, as Brazil secured their fifth World Cup title. Despite injuries, Ronaldo added 3 more goals in 2006, taking his total to 15, a record that stood until 2014.Gerd Mueller was a prolific scorer for West Germany, netting 14 goals in just two World Cups (1970, 1974). His 10-goal haul in the 1970 edition led Germany to a semifinal finish. In 1974, he added 4 more goals to his tally, including the match-winner in the final against the Netherlands, as West Germany lifted the trophy on home soil.Just Fontaine’s record of 13 goals in a single World Cup, set in 1958, remains unmatched. The French striker's remarkable goal-scoring run in Sweden included a four-goal performance in the third-place match against West Germany. Despite playing in only one World Cup, Fontaine's sharp finishing and ability to score from various positions made him a standout figure. He led France to a third-place finish, their best performance at the time.Lionel Messi scored 13 goals across five FIFA World Cups. He made his World Cup debut in 2006, scoring once as a teenager. Despite not scoring in 2010, Messi provided key assists and led Argentina's attack. In 2014, he netted 4 goals and was named the tournament’s best player, guiding Argentina to the final. In 2018, Messi added one goal but faced an early exit. His crowning achievement came in 2022, scoring 7 goals, including two in the final, as he led Argentina to World Cup glory and won the Golden Ball.","Miroslav Klose, Ronaldo, Gerd Müller, Just Fontaine and Lionel Messi are the top five all-time FIFA World Cup goal scorers. Klose tops the list with 16 goals, while Ronaldo scored 15 in three tournaments. Messi scored 13 goals in five World Cups, including two in the final in 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113783399,imgsize-66512,width-400,resizemode-4/113783399.jpg"

Take on

in their first home game of the season

KOLKATA: It's so far been a season that the NorthEast United FC fans had hoped for after a forgettable campaign last time around. Yet, most of them have not been able to see their heroes in action as the Highlanders played their title-winning Durand Cup campaign as well as their opening two games of the Indian Super League away from their base in Guwahati.But come Sunday, that's all going to change for NEUFC and their fervent local supporters when the Juan Pedro Benali-coached side take on Kerala Blasters FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium . And the Highlanders are treating it as a joyous occasion, overlooking the added pressure of a home match.""It's not pressure but really a pleasure to play the first home game,"" Benali said at the pre-match press conference in Guwahati on Saturday.""Since we started on the 14th of July, all the games we played were away. We played in Kokrajhar, we played in Shillong, and we played in Kolkata. This is the first home game for us. We are a little bit tired from travelling the whole time but we are fantastically happy to play at home, in front of our fans. It's a great feeling and we hope we have that feeling on the field, too.""It will be their first game since the heartbreaking 3-2 defeat toMohun Bagan Super Giants that once again brought to the fore the refereeing standards in ISL with the hosts' second goal. Benali, however, looked to have moved on from the controversy - terming the referees as ""human beings"" - and shifting focus to the home game at hand.""It will be a very difficult game for both of us tomorrow (Sunday) and a very nice game for the fans to watch. They are a very tactical team and so it will be a very tactical game. And I think the team that will be more calm and organised will win the game,"" he said.Nonetheless NEUFC will be eager for their second win after claiming their opener against Mohammedan Sporting, with Hamza Regragui returning to the squad after missing out on the previous fixture with illness.""I feel good,"" said the Moroccan defender on Saturday. ""We are training hard every day in the field, fully focused on the challenges ahead.""Kerala Blasters, too, will have the same goal of registering their next three points after defeating East Bengal in their last game for their first win of the season. Interestingly, Sunday's game will be their first of three consecutive away fixtures and coach Mikael Stahre is aware of the challenge before the Blasters.""We will be facing a good team, very organised, well coached and some absolutely interesting players. So, we need to stay humble,"" Kerala Blasters coach Mikael Stahre said at his pre-match interaction in Guwahati. ""But we need to focus on our game and keep up the momentum from the first win.""However, the last time they met in Guwahati, Jithin MS and Nestor Albiach earned the hosts a crucial win against the Blasters and the home fans will hope for an encore when the teams take the field again on Sunday.",NorthEast United FC take on Kerala Blasters FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium on Sunday. It will be the Highlanders' first home game of the Indian Super League season. NEUFC beat Mohammedan Sporting 2-1 in their opening game. The Blasters beat East Bengal 1-0 in their last game.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113780100,imgsize-63112,width-400,resizemode-4/113780100.jpg"

Chhetri becomes ISL's top-scorer after scoring against Bagan

BENGALURU: Bengaluru FC skipper Sunil Chhetri emerged as the Indian Super League 's top-scorer firing in his 64th goal in his 152nd match as the Blues engineered a 3-0 win against Mohun Bagan Super Giant to climb to the top of the standings.Changing ends with a two goal deficit, Bagan tried to stage a comeback making few key substitutions but their efforts came undone when defender Dippendu Biswas brought down BFC striker Edgar Mendez inside the box and conceded a penalty in the 51st minute.Chhetri, who was replaced in the 75th minute, scored with a neat placement beating Bagan 'keeper Vishal Kaith to his right. He thus emerged on top of the charts leaving Nigerian Barth Ogbeche in second place. It was sweet revenge for BFC, they almost made it 4-0 in the 90th minute, who had crashed to a 0-4 defeat against the Kolkata side last season. Incidentally, it was also the last time the Blues lost at home and are now unbeaten in 10 games under coach Gerard Zaragoza .It was an overall team effort that also saw the Rahul Bheke-led defence help Gurpreet Singh Sandhu keep his third straight clean sheet. The former champions are the only side who are yet to concede a goal this season after clearing the toughest test of the season so far with flying colors.Bengaluru translated their confidence from their first two wins into a dominating show as they came up trumps in an entertaining match that lasted 103 minutes. The matchup between two unbeaten sides saw the hosts pressing hard early on. The Blues, who faced flak last year for their goal drought, were 2-0 up by the 20th minute as they made full use of Bagan's defensive lapses. Highly rated Spanish striker Mendez found his rhythm against Bagan as he repeatedly troubled the rival defence moving up through the right. His pace and physical presence made him a constant threat in the Bagan box as he repeatedly powered his way in. BFC took the lead in the ninth minute after threatening a few times early on. Medio Alberto Noguera's kick came down nicely and Nikhil Poojary smartly slotted it for Mendez in front who scored with a cracking finish.Bagan, who had conceded four goals in their two matches, were soon trailing as Suresh Singh made full use of an assist by skipper Sunil Chhetri who was back in the starting XI. Once again it was Mendez who did the spade as he sped through the right and pushed it into the box. Chhetri was marked tightly but he still managed to poke it to Suresh who scored in the 20th minute. The Bagan defence were in total disarray and Chhetri soon had a chance to make it 3-0 but he failed to beat Kaith.",Bengaluru FC captain Sunil Chhetri becomes ISL's top-scorer after scoring against Bagan.

PUNE: The cracks in the All India Tennis Association ( AITA ) appeared to have been papered over, for the time being at least, as the no-confidence motion sought by eight state associations against president Anil Jain was withdrawn on Saturday.The Extra-ordinary General Meeting, which had been called in New Delhi specifically to discuss the no confidence motion, ended with a whimper as the affiliated units concerned submitted a letter informing their volte face.With the Delhi High Court staying the declaration of AITA's election results - while taking up a writ petition filed by Davis Cuppers Somdev Devvarman and Purav Raja - earlier in the week, the Annual General Meeting too was wrapped up without a fuss.""The returning officer will submit the results in a sealed envelope to the court. Fortunately or unfortunately everything will start only on October 14,"" AITA's honorary secretary general Anil Dhupar told TOI, referring to the next date of hearing.The current set of office bearers will continue to hold office until further orders from the court, but the members agreed that all important matters should be left to the new committee to decide, Dhupar said. ""We will continue to carry out routine matters like allotting tournaments,"" he said.Dhupar pleaded ignorance about the reasons for the withdrawal of the no trust move against Jain by the relevant associations, but one of the state officials backing the proposal said the decision was ""taken in the larger interest of the game"". ""It is the end of his (Jain's) term. There was no point,"" the official said, referring to Jain not seeking an extension.As of September 22, the initial list of nominations had Chintan Parikh (Gujarat) and Rohit Rajpal (Delhi), the current treasurer, in the race for the president's job.The no-confidence motion could have also added to legal headache for AITA as a minimum three weeks' notice is required to convene any meeting as per its constitution. Jain had on Friday filed a petition in the Delhi High Court challenging the no-trust vote, but it was yet to be admitted. That petition becomes redundant now.Given the battering AITA's image had received over the last week ever in the wake of the Indian Davis Cup team's 0-4 loss to Sweden in Stockholm, it is obvious that the members' foremost priority at the moment is to present a united front.

BEIJING: Top-ranked Jannik Sinner rallied to beat Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 in the second round of the China Open on Saturday and learned afterward that his steroid case is far from over.While Sinner was on court in Beijing, the World Anti-Doping Agency announced it was seeking a ban of one to two years for the U.S. Open champion who tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but was not suspended in a decision by an independent tribunal announced by the International Tennis Integrity Agency on Aug.20 because the ITIA determined he was not to blame.Sinner's fate will now be determined by the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport after WADA said it filed an appeal on Thursday.""Obviously, I'm very disappointed and also surprised of this appeal, to be honest, because we had three hearings,"" Sinner said at a press conference after his match Saturday. ""All three hearings came out very positively for me.""You know, I was not expecting it. I knew it couple of days ago, that they were going to appeal, that today it's going to go official. But yeah, it's surprise.""On court Saturday, the two-time Grand Slam champion again found himself behind in the Chinese capital after Safiullin broke serve twice to claim the opening set.Sinner's power and laser-like accuracy from the baseline gradually chipped away at his Russian opponent and helped the Italian to win seven straight games from 2-2 in the second set to take the ascendancy and close out a gritty win.Sinner, who has reached at least the quarterfinals at every tour-level event he has played in 2024, will next play Jiri Lehecka, who earlier defeated Roberto Bautista Agut 3-6, 6-2, 6-1.Third-seeded Daniil Medvedev , who lost to Sinner in this year's Australian Open final, also reached the last eight after beating French veteran Adrian Mannarino 7-6 (6), 6-2.Medvedev, the 2021 U.S. Open champion, had eight aces and broke Mannarino's serve four times as he advanced to his 75th tour-level quarterfinal.""Titles are more important obviously than finals. But even then 75 quarterfinals are great,"" said Medvedev, who is Russian. ""When I made my first quarterfinal (it) was (in) Moscow and I was pretty happy. And now it's 75. I am still happy, but not the same way.""He next faces Italy's Flavio Cabolli, who advanced with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Pavel Kotov.In the women's draw, U.S. Open champion Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the third round with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Thai qualifier Mananchaya Sawangkaew.""In the first set, I was struggling a little bit with the rhythm,"" said Sabalenka, who's best run in Beijing has only been to the quarterfinals. ""In the second set, seems like everything started working much better. I think that's why it was more smooth and better quality.""The second-ranked Sabalenka is the top seed in Beijing in the absence of Iga Swiatek .Next up for the three-time major winner is American Ashlyn Krueger, who beat New Zealand's Lulu Sun 6-1, 7-6 (4).Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen of China, seeded fifth, also advanced with a 6-1, 6-1 win over unseeded Kamilla Rakhimova. Her next opponent, Nadia Podoroska of Argentina, is also unseeded.Third-seeded Jasmine Paolini of Italy rallied from a poor first set to beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. Paolini, the French Open and Wimbledon runner-up, will play Poland's Magda Linette after the 31st-seeded player also needed three sets to progress past Moyuka Uchijima 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.Ninth-seeded Daria Kasatkina of Russia beat Croatian Jana Fett 6-1, 6-2. She will play Amanda Anisimova, who beat Camila Osorio of Colombia 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova was upset 1-6, 6-4, 7-5 by Romania's Jaqueline Cristian.American Madison Keys, seeded 18th, won 6-2, 6-1 against Spaniard Sara Sorribes Tormo and next faces 13th-seeded Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil.Japan Open Tomas Machac upset fifth-seeded Tommy Paul 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4) to advance to the quarterfinals and continued a disappointing week for the top-seeded players in Tokyo.Top-seeded Taylor Fritz, third-seeded Casper Ruud and fourth-seeded Stefaos Tsitsipas were all beaten in the first round, before second-seeded Hubert Hurkacz was also eliminated as he lost to U.S. Open semifinalist Jack Draper 6-4, 6-4 in the second round.Sixth-seeded Holger Rune is the highest-ranked seed remaining in the draw. Rune, from Denmark, beat home favorite Yoshihito Nishioka 6-2, 6-4.Defending champion Ben Shelton , the No. 8 seed, is the only other seeded player left in the quarterfinal draw.Alex Michelsen of the U.S. also advanced after a 6-1, 6-4 win over Australian Christopher O'Connell to set up a quarterfinal match against Machac.Kei Nishikori beat Jordan Thompson 6-2, 6-3 and will play Rune in the quarterfinals.","Top-ranked Jannik Sinner rallies to beat Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2,. 6-3 in the second round of the China Open.

PUNE: Sometimes the sequel can be better than the original.If his tennis career were to be divided in two halves, there would be no prizes for guessing which one Vijay Sundar Prashanth would cherish more.The 37-year-old has been living his dreams these past couple of years. He notched up three Challenger doubles titles in 2023 in partnership with Anirudh Chandrasekar , 11 years younger to him.The pair played the Australian Open this year, first appearance in a Grand Slam for both, before a string of poor results saw them part ways.Vijay, however, found his mojo back quickly after starting to combine with his childhood friend Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan from May.The duo reached the final of the clay-court Challenger in Bonn in August and took it up to another level last week by clinching the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China.""I mean, it's a great feeling after having gone through the journey. And, I would say some type of validation that we are doing the right things and on the right path,"" said Vijay of his maiden success on the ATP Tour in a measured tone, belying the overwhelming emotions he was experiencing.Except in the opening round, all three teams the Indian combination subsequently defeated enroute to the trophy featured top-50 ranked players - Julian Cash (38) and Lloyd Glasspool (42) in the second round, Ariel Behar (45) and Robert Galloway (40) in the semis, and Constantin Frantzen (47) and Hendrick Jebens (47) in the final.""To be honest, we didn't expect to win the title. I mean, we always believed in ourselves and our talent, and we believed that we can match any team at the highest level,"" Vjay said.""With the doubles format, we knew that we had to play good on big points. I think we did it well this week.""Actually, to do it back to back for four matches and against top 50 teams, that really surprised us. But also not in a big way, because I think both of us truly believed that we could match any team in this tournament.""Playing with Jeevan seems to bring out the best in him.""We are very familiar with each other, we've known each other for almost 25 years, on court and off court. We grew up together in Chennai. So that makes it easier to work as a team,"" Vijay said.""We acknowledge each other's analysis after the match and feedback with an open mind, so it helps the team progress.""We kind of know we are in it for a long run, and we are not going to judge the partnership based on a few bad results or a few first-round defeats. That's how we've taken it, so that’s helped.""But the journey has not always been a bed of roses. The covid pandemic disrupted his career right when he was shifting focus to doubles and the prolonged period of uncertainty was much harsh on someone who has had to deal with financial constraints right through his career.""Yes, after covid, it was tough, because for most tennis players who weren't playing at the highest level, they had to, I had to re-evaluate my whole career, my life, how to take it forward,"" he said.""That's when I felt doubles could be a viable option to continue, because at least I would be playing the Challenger tour, which technically would help me progress up the ladder and financially help me sustain playing the sport.""Since then, I've had a lot more clarity on how to approach doubles. And I have this blind belief that I can be a very good doubles player. That has just translated (to) on-court.""The revival began when his contemporary and former Tamil Nadu state-mate PC Vignesh asked him if he was willing to combine with his younger brother Anirudh.Anirudh had made a pretty early decision to play doubles full-time and Vignesh felt the seasoned Vijay would be the ideal partner to guide Anirudh.""The partnership with Anirudh was good because we kind of made use of each other's strengths,"" Vijay said.""He made use of my experience, and I made use of his young, enthusiastic energy, which I was lacking.""Because I was coming back after lockdown, (I was) searching for answers, and someone who had that motivation and enthusiasm, it rubbed off on me, and I was giving him the experience.""Then we kind of worked our way. So, it was actually a good partnership because we had to climb different levels.""We had to work as a team. For the first time in my career, I worked as a team with someone, and we had to cross many barriers. We played the first slam (for both) together. So, it was really good, yeah.""While he has managed to turn things around on the tennis court, it is yet to translate into financial security - given the low purse offered in doubles.""To be honest, what's always been the challenge for me my entire career is the financial aspect of playing the sport professionally,"" Vijay said.""I don't know how long I can sustain because now I am married, I have a five-month-old baby. So, I have to think about that aspect of life as well.""So, I've accepted that it's never going to go away. It's up to me to start doing well, and then I can generate my own funds and sustain myself playing at this level.""So, for me personally, that's the only challenge, everything else, I'm very confident about myself, my work ethic, the partner that I have, and the circle that I've created around myself.""My wife has been very supportive of my career, which is really crucial at this stage.""So, the only challenge for me is the financial aspect. Hopefully there comes a stage where I don't have to worry about it.""","Vijay Sundar Prashanth won the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner ’s ongoing doping controversy has ignited discussions about doping in tennis once again. While Sinner, ranked among the top tennis players in the world, continues to appeal his case after testing positive for an anabolic steroid, the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) is seeking a ban.The tennis world is watching closely, as this case brings back memories of other high-profile doping bans in the sport.That said, we look at five tennis stars who were banned for doping.In 2016, the tennis world was stunned when Maria Sharapova, one of the most celebrated female players, tested positive for meldonium at the Australian Open.Meldonium, which had just been added to the banned substances list, was a heart medication Sharapova had been using legally for many years. She was initially handed a two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), but after appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), her suspension was reduced to 15 months.Sharapova admitted to not being aware of meldonium’s addition to the banned list, and though the ban affected her career, she returned to the sport in 2017.Five-time Grand Slam champion Martina Hingis shocked the tennis world in 2007 when she announced she had tested positive for cocaine at Wimbledon.Hingis denied ever taking the drug, but chose not to contest the result. She retired from tennis soon after and was handed a two-year ban by the ITF.Despite the ban, Hingis's legacy remains strong, and she later made a successful comeback in doubles tennis, further cementing her place in tennis history.Simona Halep, a two-time Grand Slam champion, was handed a four-year ban in September 2023 after testing positive for the banned substance Roxadustat at the 2022 US Open. However, it was later cut to nine months.Halep has consistently maintained her innocence, claiming the result was due to contamination or an unintentional error. Despite her defence, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) pursued a thorough investigation, leading to the suspension.The case has raised questions about doping regulations and the challenges athletes face in proving their innocence when contamination is alleged. Halep's career now hangs in the balance as she fights to restore her reputation.The Croatian tennis star Marin Čilić was banned in 2013 after testing positive for the stimulant nikethamide. Čilić claimed he had inadvertently ingested the banned substance through glucose tablets and contested the severity of the ban.Initially banned for nine months, the suspension was later reduced to four months by CAS.Čilić went on to win the 2014 US Open, proving that a doping ban, while damaging, doesn’t necessarily end a player’s career.In 2009, French tennis player Richard Gasquet tested positive for cocaine and was handed a 12-month ban by the ITF. However, Gasquet's defence was one of the more unusual in sports doping history.He claimed that he had ingested the drug inadvertently by kissing a woman who had consumed cocaine in a nightclub. An independent tribunal accepted his explanation and reduced his ban to two and a half months, allowing him to return to competition soon after.The current case with Jannik Sinner bears some similarities to these past incidents, especially in terms of contested explanations and appeals.Sinner, who tested positive for low levels of Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, claims the substance entered his system accidentally through his physiotherapist's treatment. Despite three hearings that ruled in Sinner’s favour, WADA has appealed the case, seeking a one-to-two-year ban, which could disrupt the young player's rising career.","Jannik Sinner tested positive for Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid.

BEIJING: Jannik Sinner said he was ""disappointed and surprised"" Saturday after the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) appealed the decision to clear him in his steroid case, seeking a ban of up to two years.The Italian world number one twice tested positive for traces of the banned substance clostebol in March but was exonerated and allowed to carry on playing.The 23-year-old went on to win the US Open earlier this month for his second major crown, weeks after the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) found he ""bears no fault or negligence"".The ITIA accepted his explanation that the drug entered his system when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy to the player.WADA on Thursday appealed the high-profile case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport .""It is WADA's view that the finding of 'no fault or negligence' was not correct under the applicable rules,"" it said in a statement on Saturday.WADA made the appeal announcement as Sinner was on court at the China Open, where the defending champion fought back to beat 69th-ranked Russian Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 in Beijing.""WADA is seeking a period of ineligibility of between one and two years,"" it added.Sinner has consistently denied knowingly doping and said after his win: ""Obviously I'm very disappointed and also surprised.""We had three hearings. All three hearings came out very positively for me.""Clostebol is an anabolic agent prohibited at all times by WADA.After winning the US Open, Sinner said that the controversy over his failed tests was still on his mind.He defeated Taylor Fritz in straight sets to add the New York title to his Australia Open triumph in January.""It was and it's still on my mind. It's not that it's gone, but when I'm on court, I try to focus about the game, I try to handle the situation the best possible way, communication with the team, in the practice courts,"" said the world number one.""It was not easy, that's for sure, but I tried to stay focused, with which I guess I've done a great job.""The decision to clear the Italian was met with scepticism by some players in the locker room who suggested that Sinner had benefited from preferential treatment due to his status in the sport.Australia's Nick Kyrgios said in a post on X that the lack of a suspension was ""ridiculous"".Canadian player Denis Shapovalov said the decision proved that there are ""different rules for different players"" suggesting that Sinner was saved by his ranking.On court in Beijing, Sinner fell behind against the ""lucky loser"" Safiullin on Saturday after also dropping a set in his opening victory over Chile's Nicolas Jarry.The second set went with serve until the sixth game when Sinner finally broke to go up 4-2, celebrating with a subtle fist pump.Sinner took control early on in the deciding set on the way to an ultimately comfortable victory to reach the last eight, where he faces Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic.In-form Sinner has reached at least the quarter-final of every tournament he has played this year.","Jannik Sinner says he is ""disappointed and surprised"" by World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal.

NEW DELHI: The steroid case involving top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency , the Montreal-based body known as WADA , announced Saturday.WADA said it is seeking a ban of one to two years for the U.S. Open champion but indicated that it does not plan to back date an eventual ban - which would mean that Sinner could keep his second Grand Slam title if he is found guilty.The announcement was made while Sinner was on court against Roman Safiullin at the China Open in Beijing.Sinner tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but was not banned in a decision by an independent tribunal announced by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) on Aug. 20 because the ITIA determined he was not to blame.Sinner's accepted explanation was that the banned performance-enhancer entered his system unintentionally through a massage from his physiotherapist, who used a spray containing the steroid to treat their own cut finger.WADA said it filed an appeal on Thursday to the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport .""It is WADA's view that the finding of no fault or negligence' was not correct under the applicable rules,"" WADA said in a statement. ""WADA is seeking a period of ineligibility of between one and two years. WADA is not seeking a disqualification of any results, save that which has already been imposed by the tribunal of first instance.""WADA suggested the rules were not followed correctly despite a prosecutor for tennis's integrity body - which accepted Sinner's version of events - being a lawyer who regularly works on high-profile cases for the global watchdog, including the successful appeal against Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva.An appeal verdict at CAS could come quickly - even within just a few months - if the parties agree to cooperate. At least that's how it worked in another high-profile doping case in tennis involving Maria Sharapova.Still, the case likely won't be resolved before Sinner begins the defense of his Australian Open title in January.Sharapova tested positive at the Australian Open in January 2016 for the newly-banned heart medication meldonium. She was banned for two years in June that year by the International Tennis Federation.The Russian star appealed to CAS, had an appeal hearing in New York before three judges that September, and four weeks later got the verdict that cut her ban to 15 months.The entire process for Sharapova with CAS took just four months - far shorter than most doping cases, which typically last for about one year. The timeline can stall with the complexities of picking a judging panel, finding a hearing date and parties exchanging documents and evidence from expert witnesses.During the Indian Wells hard-court event in March, Sinner tested positive for low levels of a metabolite of Clostebol , a banned anabolic steroid that can be used for ophthalmological and dermatological use. It's the same drug for which San Diego Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. was suspended by MLB in 2022.Sinner tested positive again eight days later in an out-of-competition sample.He was provisionally suspended twice by the tennis integrity body because of those test results, but he successfully appealed twice to an independent tribunal judge and was allowed to keep competing on tour.Sinner said his test results happened because his fitness trainer purchased an over-the-counter spray called Trofodermin in Italy that contained Clostebol and gave it to Sinner's physiotherapist to treat a cut on the physiotherapist's finger. The physiotherapist then treated Sinner without wearing gloves.The ITIA said it accepted Sinner's explanation, after 10 interviews with the player and his entourage, and the independent panel agreed at a hearing on Aug. 15.Sinner later announced that he had fired his two trainers.",Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency.

PUNE: The simmering tension at the All India Tennis Association ( AITA ) seemed to boil over on Friday, the eve of the Annual General Meeting in New Delhi, with eight affiliated state associations calling for a no-confidence motion against their president Anil Jain.The motion is set to be taken up during an Extra-ordinary General Meeting to be held an hour prior to the AGM, two officials of the AITA member associations confirmed to TOI.Jain had sought to block the move by filing a writ petition in the Delhi High Court on Friday, but that was not taken up by the court, according to a third state association official who is also on the AITA executive committee.""We can go ahead with the EGM,"" Sunder Iyer , honorary secretary of the Maharashtra State Tennis Association as well as one of the AITA joint secretaries, said.As per Clause 16 of the AITA constitution, a proposal for no confidence motion against the executive committee or any of its office-bearers ""can be taken up only at an EGM convened specially for this purpose"".""The proposal should be made by at least 25% of the affiliated organizations ... A no confidence proposal would be considered as passed if the votes cast in favour of the proposal are at least two thirds (sic) of the votes properly recorded at the meeting,"" the clause states.However, as per Clause 15 (g), ""notice of every meeting shall be sent .. at least 3 weeks prior to the date fixed for such meeting"".One state association official said the notice was received on September 23, a day before Davis Cuppers Somdev Devvarman and Purav Raja filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court on Tuesday to stay the AITA elections, scheduled to be held during the AGM on Saturday.Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav did not grant the stay but ordered that the results should not be published, and the same to be presented to the court in a sealed envelope.In their petition, Devvarman and Raja had alleged various violations of the National Sports Code by AITA.As per the initial list of nominations (as on Sep 22 on the AITA website, two days before Justice Kumar Kaurav's order), more than a dozen contestants could be deemed ineligible on account of cooling-off period or age limit - as interpreted under the draft constitution of the IOA and the national sports federations.It includes Chintan Parikh (Gujarat), one of the two nominees for president, and Iyer (Maharashtra), for honorary secretary general - both on the account of cooling-off period.",Eight affiliated state associations call for a no-confidence motion against their president Anil Jain.
