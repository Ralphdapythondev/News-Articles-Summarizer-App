NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals secured a crucial 20-run victory over Rajasthan Royals in a must-win game at home on Tuesday to keep their IPL playoffs alive.The win for Capitals came courtesy an all-round effort with both bat and ball as Royals fell short in a steep 222 chase.The DC spinners Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav dished out impressive performances after batters fired in unison.Yet again, it was Jake Fraser-McGurk (50) and Abishek Porel 's (65) coruscating display of power-hitting that took DC to a challenging 221 for eight.Royals, needing a win to guarantee their spot in the playoffs, started their chase strongly. However, the dismissal of captain Sanju Samson, who scored a blistering 86 off 46 deliveries, in the 16th over proved to be a turning point. The Royals' innings lost its momentum following Samson's departure, and they ultimately fell short, finishing at 201 for 8.Wrist spinner Kuldeep (2/25 in 4 overs) and left-arm spinner Axar (1/25 in 3 overs) exhibited impressive control over line and length that did put brakes on Royals' scoring rate in the middle overs.The two bowlers gave away just 50 runs in their combined seven overs.After Tuesday's win, Delhi Capitals moved to fifth place with 12 points -- the same as three other teams -- but even if they win their remaining two contests, it will be difficult for them to make the knockout stage as the teams placed above them have better chances of logging 18 points. DC can have a maximum of 16 points.Veteran off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin had jolted the Capitals with wickets in his successive overs but pacer Avesh Khan bled runs.Samson's stroke-making was a treat to watch, even as Jos Buttler could not make the most of a dropped chance. Samson treated the seasoned pacer Ishant Sharma with utter disdain, scoring easy boundaries off him.Buttler struggled to get going and was handed a chance when he was on 8 as Jake Fraser-McGurk dropped a high catch off Mukesh Kumar.The England batter dragged one from left-arm spinner Axar, who displayed the art of containing the batters on a small ground like Kotla.Kuldeep too had the batters in a tight leash as the asking rate grew. Rasikh Dar cleaned up Riyan Parag after getting hit out of the park.Samson completed his fifty with a six off Kuldeep and then launched a severe attack on Dar, who leaked 18 in runs in the 13th over of the innings.Royals needed 91 runs from 42 balls. Debutant Shubham Dube supported his skipper well as he hit a monstrous six off Ishant after hitting a four.Left-arm pacer Khaleel Ahmed bowled four wides in a row before creating a chance to get rid of Samson, whose lofted shot just fell short of long-off fielder.However, after the departure of Samson, Royals innings fell apart.Earlier, had it not been some smart bowling by Ashwin and fellow off-spinner Riyan Parag in the middle overs, DC would have put more runs on the board.Young Australian batter Fraser-McGurk (50 off 20 balls) continued with his splendid form while Abhishek Porel contributed 65 off 36 balls. Tristan Stubbs chipped in with a useful 20-ball 41 but skipper Rishabh Pant's (15) bat did not talk much.Royals pacer Trent Boult and Sandeep Singh came in with hit-the-deck approach and largely succeeded in not letting home openers swing freely. The initial boundaries were largely well-timed drives and lofted shots in the 'V' space.Fraser-McGurk grew restless and began to throw his bat around. The Australian gradually got his rhythm and was harsh on Avesh, who he blasted for 28 runs, plundering four fours and two sixes in the fourth over of the innings to complete his half-century in just 19 balls.As fate would have it, Fraser-McGurk had a soft dismissal when he hit a full-toss from Ashwin straight to cover fielder Donovon Ferreira. Shai Hope too departed soon in a rather unfortunate fashion. Porel hit Sandeep straight, the ball touched the bowler's hand before crashing into the stumps, and caught the West Indian outside the crease.Yuzvendra Chahal (1/48 in 4 overs) began with a slightly fullish length and was hammered for six by Porel. Parag, though, did a great job with his off-spin as he managed to keep the batters quiet.Ashwin returned and got rid of Axar Patel, who had just hit Parag for a maximum. Porel though kept going strong and completed his fifty while Avesh continued to bleed runs. In his two overs, he conceded 42 runs.RR captain Sanju Samson handed the ball to Ashwin and he delivered yet again, this time sending back Porel with a back of the length ball that the southpaw could not connect well.The home skipper didn't do much, throwing his wicket away with a sweep shot off Chahal. DC gathered 65 runs from the last five overs.",Delhi Capitals beat Rajasthan Royals by 20 runs to keep IPL playoffs alive. DC spinners Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav give impressive performances. Jake Fraser- McGurk (50) and Abishek Porel (65) top score for DC. Royals need to win to guarantee their spot in the playoffs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109927190,imgsize-88700,width-400,resizemode-4/109927190.jpg"

'Will send team to Pakistan only if...': BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla on India's Champions Trophy participation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/will-send-team-to-pakistan-only-if-bcci-vice-president-rajeev-shukla-on-indias-champions-trophy-participation/articleshow/109892040.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Rajeev Shukla , the vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ), has clarified that the Indian team's participation in the ICC Champions Trophy next year, scheduled to be held in Pakistan from February to March 2025, is contingent upon receiving approval from the central government.The statement comes amidst speculation regarding India's potential absence from the tournament.Tensions between India and Pakistan have significantly impacted cricketing relations between the two nations since 2008, following the Asia Cup. Bilateral series between India and Pakistan have been suspended since December 2012-January 2013, with ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup serving as the primary platforms for their cricketing encounters.The decision to send the Indian team to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy hinges on various factors, including the prevailing diplomatic and security situation between the two countries.Given the history of strained relations and security concerns, any decision regarding India's participation will be subject to careful consideration and consultation with relevant authorities.Speaking to the ANI, Shukla said, ""In the case of the Champion Trophy, we will do whatever the Government of India will tell us to do. We send our team only when the Government of India gives us permission. So we will go according to the decision of the Indian government .""Pakistan resorted to a hybrid strategy during the hosting of the Asia Cup last year due to logistical and security challenges, notably hosting all of India's matches, including potential encounters against Pakistan, in Sri Lanka. This decision was made in the interest of ensuring the smooth conduct of the tournament while accommodating security concerns and diplomatic sensitivities.Contrastingly, when it came to the possibility of adopting a similar hybrid approach for the ODI World Cup hosted by India the previous year, Pakistan did not seriously consider such a strategy.Instead, they participated in the tournament in India, playing all their matches at various venues across the country. Despite initial discussions regarding the feasibility of a hybrid approach, Pakistan ultimately competed in the tournament in India, albeit facing challenges in the group stages and being eliminated early on.It's worth noting that Pakistan holds the distinction of being the defending champions of the ICC Champions Trophy, with their triumph in the last edition held in 2017. As they gear up for future tournaments, Pakistan will undoubtedly aim to replicate their past success on the global stage.The Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has designated Lahore as the only location for India matches for the Champions Trophy that Pakistan has been awarded for the next year, as ESPNcricinfo reported earlier in May.According to ESPNcricinfo, PCB has locked three locations--Karachi, Lahore, and Rawalpindi--to host the two-week Champions Trophy. India's draft schedule calls for them to play all of their games at Lahore, which is also the location of the final.It is said that the idea of putting India in a single place was put forward to avoid potentially significant logistical and security issues related to their travel. Additionally, it gives Indian fans a comparatively easier choice to visit because it is headquartered in Lahore, which is near the Wagah border crossing between the two countries.PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi said earlier that the board had sent a draft schedule of the tournament, likely to be staged in mid-February next year, to the ICC. Discussions on it involving the eight participating members will take place, with the major sticking point likely to be whether the India team travels or not.","Rajeev Shukla, vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ), has clarified that the Indian team's participation in the ICC Champions Trophy next year is contingent upon approval from the central government.

NEW DELHI: Was it a clean catch or was it not? The match on a knife's edge - somewhat tilting towards Rajasthan Royals - and a debatable catch sparking a controversy of sorts.RR skipper Sanju Samson (86 off 46b; 8x4, 6x6) - in the form of his life - was going ballistic and looked set to singlehandedly win the game for his team against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday.It was the 16th over of the Royals innings and 60 runs were needed off 27 balls with Mukesh Kumar bowling. A gettable task in the modern T20 game. Samson got hold of an off-cutter from Mukesh and smacked it with ferocity, trying to clear the long-on boundary. But, Shai Hope - stuttering and stumbling - managed to hold on to the catch. TV replays showed that Hope's small strides - in pursuit of the catch - were almost parallel to the boundary cushion.The TV umpire decided that cushion didn't move, Samson felt Hope had touched it. Samson stayed on the field for a while, arguing with the umpires but finally had to saunter away to the dugout.The dismissal took the wind out of the sails of Rajasthan Royals, as Shubham Dubey (25 off 12b; 2x4, 2x6) - Samson's partner in a 59-run fourth-wicket partnership - fell in the next over to Khaleel Ahmed. Kuldeep Yadav 's double-wicket 18th over just sealed the deal for DC as the home team went on to win by 20 runs. The victory kept DC's hopes of a playoff spot alive, as they jumped to the fifth in the points table.Meanwhile, bowlers must be breathing a sigh of relief that Australian selectors did not pick Jake Fraser-McGurk for the upcoming T20 World Cup.JFM, as he is now being referred to, is in imperious form. The 22-year-old is meting out tennis shots to all kinds of bowlers. It was a sight to see Fraser-McGurk flat bat a tennis-like forehand to a great of the game, Trent Boult.The Delhi Capitals opener did so in the third over, evoking awe and surprise from the New Zealander. Fraser-McGurk (50 off 20b; 7x4, 3x6) went on to smash two more boundaries and take 15 runs from the over.But the next over (DC's fourth) bowled by Avesh Khan was even more special. Fraser-McGurk went berserk, clobbering the Royals bowler for 28 runs in the over. Four boundaries and two maximums ensured Fraser-McGurk brought up his fourth IPL fifty off just 19 balls.Rajasthan introduced Ashwin to stem the run flow, and the wily off-spinner had an immediate impact. Fraser-McGurk wanted to dominate Ashwin from the word go but could only push a full toss straight to the extra cover fielder, bringing curtains to a highly entertaining innings.Fraser-McGurk's opening partner Abishek Porel (65 off 36b; 7x4, 3x6) was enjoying the fireworks from the other end till the Australian was there at the crease. Soon after his departure, Porel took over the mantle of taking down the bowlers. Porel took a special liking for RR's spinners.

Tristan Stubbs added a quick 41 off 20 balls, but skipper Rishabh Pant (15) did not contribute much with the bat.Rajasthan Royals' pacers Trent Boult and Sandeep Singh employed a hit-the-deck approach and largely succeeded in restricting the home openers from freely swinging their bats.The initial boundaries were largely well-timed drives and lofted shots in the 'V' space.Fraser-McGurk grew restless and began to throw his bat around. The Australian gradually got his rhythm and was harsh on Avesh, who he blasted for 28 runs, plundering four fours and two sixes in the fourth over of the innings to complete his half-century in just 19 balls.As fate would have it, Fraser-McGurk had a soft dismissal when he hit a full-toss from Ashwin straight to cover fielder Donovon Ferreira. Shai Hope too departed soon in a rather unfortunate fashion. Porel hit Sandeep straight, the ball touched the bowler's hand before crashing into the stumps, and caught the West Indian outside the crease.Yuzvendra Chahal (1/48 in 4 overs) began with a slightly fullish length and was hammered for six by Porel.

In his two overs, he conceded 42 runs.RR captain Sanju Samson handed the ball to Ashwin and he delivered yet again, this time sending back Porel with a back of the length ball that the southpaw could not connect well.The home skipper didn't do much, throwing his wicket away with a sweep shot off Chahal.

All of us have a lot of passion for playing in national colours.There is this feeling that we will give our lives to win the game for India. So that’s the feeling I get and get connected emotionally when representing India.”While the 21-year-old has chosen to stay low before the final squad selection, the Assam footballer is one of the new faces that head coach Stimac chose to give a shot ahead of India’s vital June fixtures in quest to progress to the third round of World Cup qualifiers. He will join NEUFC teammate and fellow first-time India probable Jithin MS for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar set to begin this week.And if NEUFC’s only player to score in four consecutive games for his club makes it into Stimac’s final squad, it will be a milestone in Gogoi’s journey from his father’s football training centre in Assam’s Sivasagar to donning the jersey for the senior national team.“My idol is Sunil Chhetri . And if I get to share the dressing room with him, I can learn so much from him. If young players get a chance in the Indian squad, we can learn so much from the senior players. But it depends on the coach. If he picks me, I will give my best,” Parthib said during a freewheeling interaction with TOI.Parthib, along with Jithin this season, has been a bright spot in the Highlanders’ last two Indian Super League campaigns and has been getting better with time and experience. He had eight shots on target, of which three were goals, in 18 appearances in 2022-23 and continued the form at Durand Cup this year with his first hat-trick for NEUFC.Having extended his NEUFC contract till 2026-27, Parthib scored five goals for his team this ISL season while also providing two assists. But what captivated fans are three spectacular strikes from long range – against title winners Mumbai City, Chennaiyin and East Bengal.Parthib expressed his love for such piledrivers during the interaction. “That’s something I really love to do. Even while playing FIFA on Playstation, I always look for opportunities to shoot from distance,” he said.Having started his football journey as a two-year-old by following his brother Pragyan – also his teammate and “mental support” at NEUFC – to the field, Parthib has had the support of his entire family in his pursuit.“My father and his colleagues started a football training centre in 2005 that trains kids even today. My brother used to go there for training from 2005. My father, who was not a footballer but loves the game, used to carry me to the ground when I was two to watch my brother play and if I liked it, I could play it too. So that's how my football journey started in 2007. Also, papa used to get football clips on his phone, like those of Messi or Ronaldo, for us and watching these clips, I got attracted to the game,” Parthib said before adding with a laugh, “I have broken many doors in my house.”Having climbed through the ranks of Assam age-group teams, Bengaluru’s Ozone Football Academy and Indian Arrows, Parthib has also represented India at age-group competitions, the most recent being U23 AFC Cup Qualifiers in China followed by friendlies in Indonesia.But the bigger test begins for him this week as he looks to grab a place in Stimac’s scheme of things and add a goalscoring touch to the squad against Kuwait and Qatar.Asked about his future goal, the Messi fan and self-proclaimed “Barcelona boy” said, “I want to become one of the best footballers in India.”The dream bodes well for India, too, with the team in dire need of goal scorers as Chhetri approaches his twilight days with the team.",Parthib Gogoi named among probables for India's World Cup qualifiers.

KOLKATA: The referee's final whistle was yet to be blown but Lallianzuala Chhangte briefly came over to the Mumbai City FC bench and kissed the crest of his jersey. A couple of his teammates came out of their seats to bow down to him in deference.The packed stands of 62,000 had fallen silent by that time.It was Mohun Bagan SG's heartbreak and Mumbai City FC's hurrah. It was Chhangte's night.In a team game, Mumbai City's No. 7 painted the Salt Lake Stadium's canvass with one of the finest individual performances this season, guiding his team to a remarkable 3-1 win over Mohun Bagan to lift the ISL championship title and denying Antonio Lopez Habas 's Shield winners an opportunity of doing a 'double' in the league.Chhangte, who finished the league with 10 goals - the maximum among domestic players - didn't score this time. But such was his elegant menace that he almost single-handedly brought crowd favourites Mohun Bagan to their knees. His acceleration, vision and endless determination were too much for the home team. He simply eviscerated the opponents.Mumbai City started with such intensity that Chhengte was denied by the woodwork twice in the first half. Yet, the fickle hand of football seemed to turn the script on its head in a stunning way when Jason Cummings put Mohun Bagan ahead in the 44th minute in what was the team's second shot on target at that time.But Petr Kratky 's Mumbai - having certainly learnt from their Shield-losing defeat here three weeks ago - continued to control the game with their passing and possession and always looked threatening on the break. The equalizer came in the 53rd minute through Jorge Pereyra Diaz .Mumbai soon lost Pereyra Diaz and Alberto Noguera to injury. But their substitutes Bipin Singh and Jakub Vojtus rose to the occasion, scoring in the 81st and 95th minute, respectively, giving Mumbai the deserved victory.While Mumbai players sang and danced with the cup, the result also put a question mark on Habas's strategy. They missed the usual creativity, and the likes of Manvir Singh, Liston Colaco and Dimitri Petratos were not given the license to set the tempo until the final 15 minutes when they decided to throw the kitchen sink in desperation.Mumbai started on the front foot, flourishing in Petr Kratky's pass-and-move doctrine and leaving Mohun Bagan all over the place. The imperious Chhangte - the winger with exceptional work rate - was the heartbeat of their relentless pressure on the Bagan box.Soon after Chhangte saw his lay-off across the goalline go begging, he came calling again, this time his looping shot hit the crosspiece.The woodwork came to Bagan's rescue again when, receiving the ball from Vikram Pratap Singh, Chhangte took aim at the goal, the ball coming back into play after hitting the far post.The storm was heavy but Bagan somehow managed to weather it for a while, and then added a twist to the tale out of nowhere.Two minutes after Liston Colaco fired Bagan's first shot on target in the match, the Bagan winger initiated another move just on the cusp of halftime, with his usual brisk pace down the left flank. Petratos, receiving the ball from him, unleashed a ferocious strike from the edge of the box. Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa could only manage to block it but Cummings --just like the semifinal second-leg clash against Odisha FC here six days ago --reacted the quickest to slam home the rebound.But Mumbai came back and stole the home team's thunder with a remarkable second-half performance.","Mumbai City FC beat Mohun Bagan 3-1 to lift ISL championship title.
