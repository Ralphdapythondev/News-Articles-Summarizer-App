LIVE: India vs NZ 1st day washed out | Virat Kohli’s form | 2025 IPL Retentions

MUMBAI: In a sensational development, India's star wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant will not lead the Delhi Capitals in IPL 2025 , Times of India has reliably learnt.""Yes, the Delhi Capitals could be looking for a new captain. There are chances that India allrounder Axar Patel may take over as the new IPL captain, or the franchise could be eyeing someone who is captaincy material at the IPL auction (likely to take place overseas in mid-November).Pant, though, is set to be the franchise's top retention. It's just that the leadership group at DC feels that he's better off without the pressures of captaincy,"" the source told TOI.DC last reached the IPL playoffs in IPL 2021, and their best-ever finish in the tournament is when they finished as finalists in 2020, under Shreyas Iyer 's captaincy.Returning from an injury in a horrific car accident which kept him out of the game for a year-and-a-half, Pant led the Delhi Capitals in IPL last season, where they finished sixth, logging six wins and losing as many matches.One possible option for the franchise in the auction, if the Kolkata Knight Riders don't retain him, is Iyer, who led KKR to their third IPL title earlier this year.It's learnt that Pant recently met with Delhi Capitals' co-owners Parth Jindal and Kiran Kumar Grandhi to discuss his future at the franchise.Interestingly, just after midnight on October 12, the 27-year-old posted on X (formerly Twitter), ""If [I] go to the auction, will I be sold or not and for how much ??""Pant has been India's biggest match-winner with the bat in recent times in Test cricket, but his performance in white-ball formats hasn't been at par with his red-ball exploits for India.In 76 T20Is, he has scored 1,209 runs, with just three half-centuries, at an average of 23.25, and a strike rate of 127.26.One solid knock from him was a 31-ball 42 against Pakistan on a difficult pitch in New York in a low-scoring match of the 2024 T20 World Cup , that helped India win by six runs.In the IPL, where he has played for the Delhi-based IPL franchise all through, Pant has scored 3284 runs in 111 matches at an average of 35.31, with 18 fifties and one hundred.At the 2022 T20 World Cup, Pant was pipped by Dinesh Karthik in India's XI.The Delhi Capitals recently appointed former India and Tamil Nadu batter Hemang Badani as head coach for the next two seasons , while also appointing his former India teammate Venugopal Rao as the team's director of cricket.","India's star wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant will not lead the Delhi Capitals in IPL 2025.

The opener's ferocity, finesse & adaptability have ensured a quick rise up the ranks, attracting lavish praise from his captain. It all bodes well ahead of the looming acid test, the 5-game series Down Under...

LIVE: India vs NZ 1st day washed out | Virat Kohli’s form | 2025 IPL Retentions

BENGALURU: In the short while that Gautam Gambhir has been Team India head coach, he has reiterated one of his key philosophies of acing Test cricket - adaptability.The head coach couldn't have found a better ambassador for this mantra than opener Yashasvi Jaiswal Although questions have been raised on Jaiswal's ability to stretch his current purple patch to the five Tests in Australia beginning next month, his current form and ability to switch gears bodes well. The cool head he bears on his strong shoulders are an added bonus.Given the way he carries himself, it's hard to believe Jaiswal will celebrate only his 23rd birthday in Dec. Mostly likely, he will celebrate the day Down Under. His approach to the game is often modern, although his techniques are classic. He can drop jaws with the ferocity with which he attacks opposition bowlers and yet draw applause from purists with the finesse of his shots.In an age of quick-fix cricket, Jaiswal comes across as a square peg. He loves the red-ball version of the game and is hungry to make a mark. A teen sensation who broke on to the domestic circuit in 2019 and made an instant impact, he has shown that he is an incredibly quick learner.Two years ago, turning up for West Zone in the Duleep Trophy final against South, Jaiswal struck a double ton, but his on-field behaviour left a sour note. His constant sledging of the opposition led skipper Ajinkya Rahane to give him marching orders after he failed to heed the umpires' warning. He was censured by the match referee as well.That incident, luckily, appears to be an aberration. He has adapted well and been a far more disciplined player after breaking into the India team in July last year. In the two Tests away in South Africa . Jaiswal was immediately under the scanner after he scored 50 in two matches (17 & 5; 0 & 28). While he wasn't the only Indian to fail, his failure stood out.Jaiswal showcased his versatility early. In his debut against hosts West Indies in Roseau, he spent 501 minutes at the crease, crafting a 387-ball 171. Yet, in the next match, he appeared equally comfortable clobbering the West Indies bowlers around the park, making a 74-ball 57 without compromising on his instincts. In his 11-match Test career so far, he has been a revelation.In seven home Tests thereafter, he has scored at least a half-century in each match. He has two double centuries, coming in back-to-back matches against England and amassed a staggering 901 runs in the seven home games.Skipper Rohit Sharma has been a staunch believer in the youngster's abilities. ""I'm not surprised at all (by his progress) because the guy has got real talent,"" Rohit said. ""He has the game to suit any conditions. He is new to international cricket and it is hard to judge him right now. But he has all the ingredients for success at this level. It is just about how he manages himself in the next couple of years.""For Rohit, Jaiswal, his opening partner, has been a worthy investment. ""In this brief time, he has shown that you can bet on him and expect him to do wonders for the team. He has come through the ranks and shown what he is capable of. Hopefully, he will continue to do that.""""He is somebody who wants to learn the game and learn about batsmanship, which is always a nice thing,"" Rohit added.","Yashasvi Jaiswal has been a revelation in his 11-match Test career so far.

India captain Rohit Sharma continues to be the centre of attraction whether on or off the field, and it got highlighted once again when a fan started running behind Rohit's car to get his attention.In a video going viral on social media, a fan with tricolour painted on his body and Rohit written on his back could be seen running behind the skipper's car.""Rohit sir!"" the fan is heard shouting.Heartwarmingly, Rohit asked the driver to stop the car to meet the fan and rolled down the window to sign an autograph for him.While the date and location of the video is not certain, Rohit is currently leading India in the first Test of the three-match series against New Zealand in Bengaluru.The first day of the Test was washed out by torrential rain in the Karnataka capital.The next two Tests of the series are scheduled to be held in Pune and Mumbai, after which India will travel to Australia for the much-anticipated Border Gavaskar Trophy.

Michael Vaughan rubs Pakistan the wrong way with 'collapse' comment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/michael-vaughan-rubs-pakistan-the-wrong-way-with-collapse-comment/articleshow/114299831.cms,"Photo: @TheRealPCB on X

Adding salt to Pakistan 's wounds after the home team's embarrassing defeat in the first Test against England at Multan , Michael Vaughan has said that the second Test at the same venue may follow a similar script with another ""Pakistan collapse"".The second match of the three-Test series, which England lead 1-0, will enter its third day on Thursday, after Pakistan threw a few punches through spinner Sajid Khan to peg the visitors back.After scoring 366 in their first innings, the hosts reduced England to 239 for 6 at stumps on Day 2 despite opener Ben Duckett's century (114), with off-spinner Sajid registering impressive figures of 4 for 86.While Duckett was going strong, former England captain Vaughan commented that the visitors may take a first-innings lead, which could lead to a finish similar to the first Test.""Early signs this Test could end up the same as the first .. England lead, then Pakistan collapse in the 2nd innings,"" Vaughan posted on 'X'.But 127 runs behind at stumps on Day 2 and with just four wickets in hand, it might happen that Pakistan take a first-innings lead and then build on it.Vaughan's comment came after he had said that dropping Babar Azam from the Test squad was a ""stupid decision"" by Pakistan. However, Babar's replacement Kamran Ghulam went on to score a century (118) on debut to prove Vaughan wrong.""So Pakistan haven’t won in a while .. Go 1 nil down in the series and decide to drop the best player in @babarazam258 .. I guess Pakistan cricket is full of surprises but this tops the lot .. absolutely stupid decision .. unless he has asked for a break !!!"" Vaughan had written on X.Reacting to Vaughan's comment after Ghulam's century, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali had said that ""Vaughan should be shown the picture of Kamran Ghulam"".",Michael Vaughan says Pakistan may take a first-innings lead in the second Test. England lead the three-Test series 1-0 after winning the first Test in Multan. Pakistan are 127 runs behind at stumps on Day 2 and have just four wickets in hand.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114299863,imgsize-60542,width-400,resizemode-4/114299863.jpg"

NEW DELHI: As Kamran Ghulam made headlines by hitting a century on debut against England in the second Test at Multan on Tuesday, he was lauded for not just the hundred but also for the fact that he had achieved the feat after replacing a stalwart like Babar Azam in the team.Ghulam has gathered tons of runs in all three formats of the game since making his first-class debut in 2013.His highest performance came in 2020-21, when he scored 1,249 runs in 11 domestic matches.That broke a 36-year record.Ghulam was not given a chance despite being named in Pakistan's preliminary team for a home series against South Africa in 2021.Ghulam was part of Pakistan's team for the one-day international in Karachi last year against New Zealand, but he only got to play because he was Haris Sohail's replacement after he sustained a concussion.After Pakistan's innings defeat in the first Test, Ghulam finally made his Test debut by taking the place of the struggling Babar Azam.Cashing on the opportunity, the 29-year-old debutant made a terrific 118 on the opening day of the second Test.But now a two-year-old video is going viral where Pakistan's star pacer Haris Rauf had slapped Ghulam in a Pakistan Super League ( PSL ) match.The incident took place during a game between Lahore Qalandars and Peshawar Zalmi .Rauf was seen slapping and expressing his anger at his teammate Ghulam after the latter had failed to hold onto a catch during the last PSL 2022 league match between Lahore Qalandars and Peshawar Zalmi.Ghulam had dropped Peshawar Zalmi's Hazratullah Zazai off Rauf but on the penultimate delivery of that very over, Fawad Ahmed took a good catch to dismiss Mohammad Haris. As the Lahore Qalandars players got together to celebrate the wicket, Rauf slapped Ghulam in frustration.To Ghulam's credit, he took it sportingly even though Shaheen Shah Afridi tried to calm down Rauf.Rauf was reprimanded by the match referee for his shocking behaviour on the field.This is not the first time that Rauf has had altercations. Remember the incident when he had almost come to blows with a fan after the T20 World Cup?",Kamran Ghulam made his Test debut against England on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: With India gearing up for the highly anticipated Test series against New Zealand, the focus remains not only on winning but also on nurturing emerging talent within the squad. Team India 's Test captain Rohit Sharma emphasized the importance of developing a robust pipeline of fast bowlers, particularly as the team prepares for the demanding conditions expected during the Border-Gavaskar series in Australia later this year.""Mayank has shown what he is capable of, but we need to be cautious with him,"" Rohit said in the pre-match press conference on Tuesday. ""He has dealt with several injuries in the past, so we don't want to rush him. We'll monitor him daily and gradually build up his workload with the red ball. Our aim is to develop him progressively rather than throwing him straight into international cricket .""The inclusion of young talents like Harshit Rana , Nitesh Kumar Reddy , and Mayank Yadav as Travelling Reserves signals a strategic shift towards investing in the future.""We have seen potential in them. They haven't played much red-ball cricket, but we want to groom them and bring them closer to the team in a short period. They've shown they have some ability as well,"" Rohit noted.""We wanted to keep them close because we are thinking of taking them to Australia. It's important to monitor their workloads and gradually build them up to see what they can offer. We want to create bench strength, especially with fast bowlers. We have 8 or 9 options, not just 3 or 4. Like we have multiple options in batting, we want the same depth with our bowlers,"" the skipper further added.As the team prepares for the first Test at M.

Rain may heavily impact first India-NZ Test starting today

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

BENGALURU: The only people who braved the relentless rain and made it to the M Chinnaswamy stadium on Tuesday were the ground staff.Continuous rain left roads in the city waterlogged and the traffic in a mess, but at the stadium, all was quiet and peaceful on the eve of the first India-New Zealand Test.More rain has been forecast for the next two days, jeopardising the first of three Tests between India and New Zealand. But if the elements relent by Wednesday morning, a game would be on, thanks to the state-of-the-art SubAir drainage system at the venue.Weather permitting, there will be plenty to look forward to from Rohit Sharma and Co. They have momentum on their side and will be keen to get as much game time as possible ahead of the meatier five-Test away series in Australia next month.For over a decade, India have dominated at home, quite unlike any other Test-playing side, a fact that has been rarely acknowledged amid the euphoria surrounding the country's white ball success. An 18-series winning streak at home underlines their mastery of the format.The Indians have been fine ambassadors of the long format, putting those who believe Test cricket has a foot in the grave to shame with a fearless, exciting brand of cricket.They have consigned talk of surfaces and advantages to the bin, owning every pitch they have played on. They have conjured wins from near-impossible situations and their star cast has fired the imagination.Head coach Gautam Gambhir on Monday underlined the team's philosophy, which is to produce an environment where players employ their natural instincts without the fear of failure.The home series against England offered ample proof of the emerging talent. Five players - Sarfaraz Khan, Rajat Patidar, Dhruv Jurel, Akash Deep and Devdutt Padikkal - made their debut and were impressive.The team without Virat Kohli , KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant won the series 4-1. The think-tank's eye for detail and investment in the future is reflected in their pick of the travelling reserves.As skipper Rohit Sharma said, ""I understand that some of them have not played a lot of red ball cricket, but when you see talent, you want to try and groom it and bring it as close to the team (standard) as possible.""In a short period, they have shown they have some ability. We want to keep them with the team and see whether they will be ready for international cricket, especially Test cricket. We want to create a bench strength. We don't want to be worried or too heavily reliant on a few individuals.""Against the red-hot home side, the Black Caps will have their task cut out. Coming off a two-match thrashing in Sri Lanka, among the few positives they will take from the loss to the Islanders is acclimatisation to sub-continental conditions, especially since their one-off Test against Afghanistan was abandoned in Noida last month.Among the batters, barring Rachin Ravindra (153), Kane Williamson (138) and to some extent Glenn Philips (131), the others hardly got an eye in. To compound the visitors' woes, Williamson has been ruled out of at least the first Test with a groin strain.If there was a sunny side to the annihilation in Lanka, it would be the familiarity with conditions the bowlers experienced after toiling against a formidable home side.There is a cloud of uncertainty about Tim Southee making the cut but given the overcast conditions and the variety at his disposal, his place in the XI may just be safe.","Heavy rain in Bengaluru prevented both teams from training while keeping the groundsmen busy at the Chinnaswamy stadium.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the first Test versus New Zealand in Bengaluru, India captain Rohit Sharma provided an update on Mohammed Shami and revealed that the seamer, who has been away from cricket since November 2023, has developed ""swelling in his knee"" and it has ""put him back a little bit in his recovery"".""To be honest, right now it is very difficult for us to make a call on him whether he will be fit for this series or Australia series.He recently had a setback. He had a swelling in his knee, which was quite unusual while he was in the process of getting fit, getting close to 100%. That put him back a little bit in his recovery,"" said Rohit at the pre-match press-conference.The Indian skipper further added that they don't want to take an ""undercooked"" Shami to Australia for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and divulged that the medical team has already put a road map in place for him.""So he had to start again fresh. Right now, he is at NCA ( National Cricket Academy ). He is working with the physios, the doctors at NCA. We are keeping our fingers crossed. We want him to be fit. We want him to be 100% fit. More than anything else, we don't want to bring an undercooked Shami to Australia.

We want to give him enough time to recover and be 100% fit. The physios, the trainers, the doctors have set a road map for him. He is supposed to play a couple of games before he plays international cricket. We will see where he is at after this New Zealand series. Then take a call at what stage of Australia he will be fit for us,"" added Rohit.The development was first reported by The Times of India on October 2 and it also mentioned the high chances of the 34-year-old taking another ""six-eight weeks"" to regain fitness. The report created a stir in cricketing circles and Shami took to social media platforms terming it as ""baseless rumours"".He went on to add: ""Why these type of baseless rumors? I'm working hard and trying my level best to recover. Neither the BCCI nor me have mentioned that I am out of the Border Gavaskar series. I request the public to stop paying attention to such news from unofficial sources. Please stop and don't spread such fake fake fake & fake news, especially without my statement.""Minutes after Shami's posts, TimesofIndia.com reached out to a senior member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) who backed Shami's version and reiterated that the seamer's rehab is very much on track and he's likely to feature in the three Tests against New Zealand.Little over a week after all the drama, BCCI named the squad for the New Zealand Tests and Shami's name was missing. There was no official word from the Indian cricket board on the star's player's current situation as he continued to be away from competitive cricket since the 2023 World Cup final in November last year.A day after the squad announcement, the BCCI official insisted that Shami was very much on track for New Zealand series and it was only after some developments during his rehab that he wasn't included.""He was very much on track for New Zealand Tests as of that day. There were some developments during his rehab which tend to happen,"" added the official.Who exactly is not telling the truth?Shami said all is well, BCCI official said all is well but the Indian captain Rohit Sharma and TOI report on October 2 mention otherwise. It is further understood that Shami is not close to match fitness right now for the gruelling five Tests in Australia and the situation is very much 50-50.The seamer has been regularly posting rehab videos on social media but the bowling videos have now made way for a lot of gym work in the last few days.The first Test against Australia, scheduled to begin on November 22, is still over a month away but Shami is clearly in a race against time to regain match fitness before the high-profile series.","Mohammed Shami has been away from cricket since November 2023.

Kamran Nay Debut Main Century Bana Kar Babar Ko Happy Birthday Bol Diya | Basit Ali

A century on debut by Kamran Ghulam has substantiated the point that many former Pakistan players had been making in run-up to the Test series against England, and Basit Ali didn't miss the opportunity to get under the skin of Michael Vaughan who had termed dropping Babar Azam a ""stupid decision"".Coming in to bat at a shaky 19 for 2, Ghulam showcased his skills to tackle both pace and spin expertly while scoring 118 off 224 balls, including 11 fours and 1 six.Ghulam, who was awarded a debut for his consistent run in domestic cricket, added crucial 149 runs in partnership with opener Saim Ayub who scored 77.The 29-year-old Ghulam replaced Babar in the Pakistan Test squad after the former captain went through another poor outing. Along with Babar, fast bowlers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah, as well as wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmad were also dropped by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).""PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi will be very happy today. He had given a statement that 'there is no replacement at the moment'. But (selectors) Aaqib Javed & Co introduced a new kid and he made a century on debut,"" said former Pakistan batsman Basit while analysing the first day's play in a video on his YouTube channel.""The best thing about the knock was that he (Ghulam) came out to bat when the score was 19 for 2,"" he added.Following the PCB's decision to drop Babar, former England captain Michael Vaughan had tweeted: ""So Pakistan haven’t won in a while .. Go 1 nil down in the series and decide to drop the best player in @babarazam258.. I guess Pakistan cricket is full of surprises but this tops the lot .. absolutely stupid decision .. unless he has asked for a break !!!""Ahead of the toss on Tuesday, in conversation with another former England captain Nasser Hussain, PCB's ex-chairman and Pakistan's World Cup winner Ramiz Raja also believed that it was probably not right to drop Babar because ""he sells cricket"" for Pakistan.But Basit disagreed, saying that the decision to drop Babar and Ghulam's century has ""opened the door for domestic performers"".""...match shuru hone se pehle baat kar rahe the ke ji 'usko rest gala kiya hai, sponsor nahi aayenge' (they were saying before the match that it was wrong to rest Babar, sponsors won't come),"" said Basit. ""Kamran Ghulam ki tasveer dikha dena Michael Vaughan ko aur kehna main hoon na (show Ghulam's picture to Vaughan and tell him he is there).""""The bold decision taken by the selectors can lead to betterment (of Pakistan cricket). Like Rohit Sharma had said there (in India), give domestic cricket its due,"" he added.Opting to bat first on a pitch that was used for the first Test as well, Pakistan reached 259 for 5 at stumps with Mohammad Rizwan batting on 37 and Agha Salman on 5.Pakistan had lost the opening Test by an innings and 47 runs despite scoring more than 500 runs in their first innings.",Basit Ali says dropping Babar Azam was a'stupid decision' by Pakistan selectors.

BENGALURU: It was a damp start to the landmark 25th Test at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium here, with the opening day of the first Test between India and New Zealand being abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain on Wednesday.There was always a cloud of uncertainty over the start of play, with the India Meteorological Department having issued an orange alert for the city.The Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), which is celebrating its golden jubilee this year, would have hoped for better weather. The venue hosted its first Test match in 1974, when a Clive Lloyd-led West Indies tamed Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and his men by a massive 267 runs.Rain could well have the last laugh in the 25th Test here since more of it is predicated over the next two days. Despite the gloomy forecast, a handful of optimists made their way to the stadium, perhaps banking heavily on the city's fickle weather.However, all they saw was the covers being briefly lifted and glimpses of the likes of Virat Kohli, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Nitesh Reddy and assistant coach Abhishek Nayar. The Indian trio were among the home team players who spent time in the indoor nets at the adjoining National Cricket Academy facility.The Black Caps arrived at the venue at around 8 am but with no sign of the weather improving, they returned to their hotel. They may have felt a sense of déjà vu since their previous match againstAfghanistan in Noida last month was abandoned without a ball being bowled.Ironically, a few minutes after play was called off at around 2.30 pm, rain stopped and the light improved prompting ground staff to take the covers off the pitch for the first time in the day.Skipper Rohit Sharma, who was at the NCA, hopped across and had a good look at the pitch before another spell of rain forced it under covers. The toss has been scheduled for 8.45 am on Thursday with play at 9.15 am, but given the prevailing conditions, it seems like a distant possibility.","First Test between India and New Zealand at M Chinnaswamy Stadium abandoned due to rain.

SYDNEY: Cricket Australia announced a net deficit of A$31.9 million ($21.34m) for the 2023-24 financial year on Thursday, results that were better than expected at a low-point in the game's four-year cycle.With a lucrative five-Test home series against India starting in November and an Ashes series on home soil next year, the governing body can expect a big boost to revenue over the next 18 months.""The better than forecast financial result ... is the result of a strong collaborative effort across Australian cricket to both manage costs and drive revenue,"" chief executive Nick Hockley said in news release.Higher than expected crowds at last season's home internationals against Pakistan and West Indies netted an extra A$7 million, while an additional A$11 million landed in the coffers from the ICC, Indian Premier League and the Indian tax office.As a result, CA was able to fund a 7% increase in player payments in the first year of the new pay deal.At the grassroots level, CA reported an increase in registered participation in community cricket from 627,793 to 661,161, although there was a 3% drop in the number of junior cricketers.""The strong growth in registered participation was the result of targeted programmes to increase participation in areas including 5-12 year-olds, women and girls and players of South Asian heritage,"" Hockley added.",Cricket Australia announce a net deficit of A$31.9 million ($21.34m) for the 2023-24 financial year.

NEW DELHI: England opener Ben Duckett etched his name in cricketing history on Day 2 of the second Test against Pakistan in Multan by becoming the fastest batter to reach 2,000 Test runs in terms of balls faced.Duckett’s brilliant knock of 114 off 129 balls, laced with 16 boundaries, was not only a personal milestone but also a crucial effort for England amid a challenging day.Duckett surpassed the previous record held by New Zealand’s Tim Southee, who had reached the 2,000-run mark in 2,418 balls.Duckett achieved the feat in just 2,293 deliveries, leaving behind renowned batters like Australia’s Adam Gilchrist (2,483 balls) and India’s Virender Sehwag (2,759 balls) and Rishabh Pant (2,797 balls).In reply to Pakistan’s first-innings total of 366, Duckett and Zak Crawley provided England with a solid start, adding 73 runs in just 12 overs.Duckett was particularly effective against spin, using sweeps and reverse sweeps to disrupt Pakistan’s bowlers, bringing up his fourth Test century with ease.He went on to stitch another important 52-run partnership with Ollie Pope, further consolidating England’s innings.However, Duckett’s individual brilliance wasn’t enough to prevent a dramatic England collapse later in the day.Pakistan’s off-spinner Sajid Khan engineered a stunning fightback, dismantling England’s middle order with a four-wicket haul.Sajid’s spell included key dismissals, such as Duckett, Joe Root , and Harry Brook Duckett, who seemed untouchable, eventually nicked one to slip while attempting to drive a sharply turning delivery, leaving England vulnerable at 239/6 by stumps.","Ben Duckett becomes the fastest batter to reach 2,000 Test runs in terms of balls faced.

Indian Premier League franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to spend a jaw-dropping Rs 23 crore to retain the services of South African swashbuckler Heinrich Klaasen ahead of the mega auction, areport said.Klaasen set the IPL on fire last year, where he amassed 479 runs for the finalists at a staggering strike-rate of over 171.Alongside Klaasen, skipper Pat Cummins is also set to be retained by the franchise and they are willing to shell out Rs 18 crore for the Australian all-rounder.Among Indians, Abhishek Sharma is on the list and the franchise is reportedly set to spend Rs 14 crore for the 24-year-old.IPL's all time biggest buy is Australia's Mitchell Starc, who was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders for a record sum of Rs 24.75 crore in the 2024 mini auction.With the deadline for retention set to expire on October 31, SRH are also lining up to lock Travis Head and Nitish Kumar Reddy.Last season in IPL, Head was the top run-getter for the franchise, smacking 567 runs in 15 innings. Abhishek (484 runs in 16 games) was second highest scorer for the side followed by Klaasen.Riding on strong performances from Head, Klaasen and Abhishek, SRH went on to smash the highest-ever team total in IPL -- 287 for 3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.In the same season, the side also smacked 277 for three against Mumbai Indians.As per IPL retention rules, a franchise can retain a maximum of six players, including one uncapped player.

However, the Bangladesh veteran was participating in a T20 league in Canada at the time of the alleged incident.Initially, Faruque Ahmed , the new president of the BCB, had rejected Shakib's request for security, stating that the board was not a security agency and could not guarantee any cover for him.However, Asif Mahmud , the sports advisor to Bangladesh's interim government, stated that Shakib would be provided security once his political stance was clear.In response, Shakib issued an unconditional apology for his silence during the civil unrest in Bangladesh, which led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina In a statement on his official Facebook page, Shakib paid respects to the students who sacrificed their lives during the anti-discrimination movement and expressed his sincere apologies to those who were hurt by his silence during this critical period.Shakib also addressed a message to the Bangladesh fans, acknowledging that he would soon be playing his last match.He expressed his desire to bid farewell surrounded by the fans whose applause compelled him to play better and whose eyes welled up with tears when he did not perform well.""You all know that I will soon be playing my last match… I want to say goodbye with all of you around.

NEW DELHI: England’s steady march in the second Test against Pakistan was halted abruptly by Sajid Khan , whose spell of sharp off-spin triggered a rapid batting collapse.After being well-placed at 211/2, England lost four wickets for just 14 runs, finding themselves reeling at 225/6 in the final session of Day 2 at Multan.Sajid’s brilliant bowling performance ensured Pakistan seized control at a crucial phase, leaving England trailing by 127 runs.The collapse began with the dismissal of England’s talisman Joe Root , who had looked comfortable until Sajid deceived him with a well-flighted delivery.On the third ball of the 42nd over, Root attempted a sweep but only managed an inside edge onto his boot, sending the ball rolling into the stumps. His dismissal at 211/3 opened the floodgates.Sajid’s next victim was Ben Duckett , who had earlier anchored the innings with a fluent 114. Duckett had survived multiple close calls, with Sajid repeatedly beating his bat.Finally, an aggressive drive off a full-length delivery found a thick outside edge, and Agha Salman at first slip made no mistake.With Duckett’s departure, England slumped to 224/4, and Sajid celebrated with his signature thigh-slap gesture.In Sajid's very next over, Harry Brook was bowled trying to punch a spinning delivery off the back foot.Brook misjudged the sharp turn, and the ball crashed through the gap between bat and pad, handing Sajid his fourth wicket of the innings.England, suddenly in trouble, stood at 225/5 with Brook gone for just nine.Noman Ali then compounded England’s woes by dismissing captain Ben Stokes for a mere 1. Stokes failed to adjust to Noman’s turn, edging a defensive push onto his pad, and Abdullah Shafique at short leg completed an outstanding diving catch.From a position of strength at 211/2, England were now in deep trouble at 225/6, leaving Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse to steady the ship before stumps.However, the pair managed to stabilize the innings and guided England to 239/6 by the end of the day.Sajid Khan finished the day with figures of 4/86, his devastating spell turning the match on its head.With Pakistan’s bowlers firing on all cylinders and England trailing by 127 runs, Day 3 promises to be a pivotal chapter in this thrilling Test series at Multan.",England lose four wickets for just 14 runs in final session of Day 2 at Multan.

As Indian Super League ( ISL ) returns from the international break with NorthEast United FC hosting Chennaiyin FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati on Thursday, the home side will look to start afresh and comeback to winning ways.Beginning their ISL journey this season with a 1-0 away win over debutant Mohammedan Sporting Club, NEUFC have lost one and drawn two games thereafter. Sitting in sixth position on the league table, the Juan Pedro Benali-coached side will aim for a win in their fifth tie against the southern opponents, who have four points after three games.Speaking about their opponents, NorthEast head coach Juan Pedro Benali said that the Marina Machans are physically very strong.“We’re playing against a nice team, a team who has a very peculiar style. Owen Coyle ’s style, we know it. They’re a strong team, physically very strong and they don’t give you a chance to breathe. And we hope at home we can do much better than the last game and get the three points,” Benali said in Guwahati on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Chennaiyin have experienced all three results possible once each, and have undergone quite a similar fate like NEUFC after a winning start to the league. They have been on the road for two out of their first three matches this season. Speaking to the media ahead of their third away tie, head coach Owen Coyle praised NorthEast while highlighting the need for his boys to be more clinical.“What you have is two very good teams,” Coyle said on the eve of the game. “Two very attack-minded teams, going all out to win a tough game. NorthEast are always a very dangerous opponent — they were last year and they certainly are this year. I think Juan Pedro Benali has done a fantastic job.”“Equally, we know we have a good team, we know we have good players and can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams in this league when we are at our best. So that’s our focus, being very respectful of our opponents but focusing on our qualities.

Expressing his gratitude to the Highlanders for opening their facilities early, the Scottish coach wished for the safety of the people back home.“We haven’t been able to train for the last three days because of the severe weather in Chennai.

MADRID: Real Madrid have, for the moment at least, given their support to star forward Kylian Mbappe since the Swedish media reported that he is being investigated for an alleged rape during a visit to Stockholm.The reigning European champions, who have not commented publicly on the reports, do not appear to be overly concerned about the reports about the player who joined this summer from Paris Saint-Germain .An internal club source, who spoke to AFP on condition of their identity not being revealed, described the accusations as ""the biggest fake in the history of sport"".On Tuesday, Real were accused of deleting 25-year-old Mbappe from photos it published in a promotional campaign with its jersey manufacturer Adidas.Real told journalists the reason was simply because Mbappe's boot sponsor is Adidas's bitter rivals Nike.That explanation was questioned on social media though, with many people pointing out that several players in the photos are also under contract with Nike, like Mbappe's French international teammate Eduardo Camavinga.In the midst of the media storm -- and on the day his lawyer spoke to AFP and other French media to insist her client was ""shocked"" to be linked to arape investigation -- Mbappe trained with his teammates in Madrid on Tuesday.This time, the club had no hesitation in posting photos and videos of the Frenchman, who should be available for selection on Saturday for the visit of Celta Vigo to the Bernabeu as he is said to have recovered from discomfort in his left thigh that kept him out of France's squad for Nations League games.With a rare few free days on his hands, Mbappe chose to go to Stockholm with a group of friends, arriving on October 9 and departing on October 11.Reports in several Swedish media say they visited a restaurant and a nightclub. Once the group had left Sweden, a woman went to police to allege she was the victim of a rape.On Monday, after Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet became the first media outlet to reveal that a rape probe had been opened, Mbappe slammed the report as ""fake news"" on his social media and alleged there was a link between the accusations and his financial dispute with his former club Paris Saint-Germain. A hearing into the case was held on Tuesday.""It's becoming so predictable, the day before the hearing as if by chance,"" Mbappe said on X, formerly Twitter.A Swedish prosecutor has only confirmed that an investigation has been opened, without naming Mbappe.His lawyer Marie-Alix Canu-Bernard told AFP on Tuesday the 2018 World Cup winner was ""at ease"" because ""he has done nothing wrong"".Canu-Bernard said Mbappe had ""asked my office not to leave things as they are because it is impossible to allow yourself to be slandered and defamed in this way"".""This is why we are going to file a complaint for libel.""","Kylian Mbappe trained with his Real Madrid teammates in Madrid on Tuesday.

Scotland frustrated Cristiano Ronaldo 's Portugal in a 0-0 draw at Hampden on Tuesday to avoid losing five consecutive competitive games for the first time ever.The home side needed a wonder save from Craig Gordon to deny Bruno Fernandes a winner in the closing stages, but held out to secure their first point in the top tier of the Nations League .Portugal remain on top of Group A1 but were made to wait to book their place in March's quarter-finals.On his 216th international appearance, Ronaldo made his 200th start for his country, more than 21 years on from his first.However, the 39-year-old failed to add to his 133 Portugal goals and stormed off the field at full-time ranting at the officials.Scotland have won just one of their last 16 games - a 2-0 friendly victory over Gibraltar in June - and remain without a victory in a competitive match for over a year.But Steve Clarke 's men battled hard to stop the rot in Glasgow.Scotland even had the best chance of the first half inside the opening five minutes whenScott McTominay headed too close to Diogo Costa from point-blank range.Portugal quickly took control of possession without creating clear-cut chances.Francisco Conceicao spooned over early in the second period from Ronaldo 's lay-off.Ronaldo then fired inches wide after making himself room for a shot amid a flurry of desperate challenges from Scottish defenders.But it was Fernandes who had the best chance to claim all three points when the Manchester United captain's powerful low strike was brilliantly parried by Gordon and collected at the second attempt by the 41-year-old goalkeeper.Scotland are still on course for relegation from the top tier of the Nations League as they trail Poland, who drew 3-3 with Croatia, by three points with two games remaining.Croatia sit second, three points behind the Portuguese, who they host next month.","Portugal remain on top of Group A1 but were made to wait to book their place in March's quarter-finals.

French soccer star Kylian Mbappe 's representatives have rejected as ""false and irresponsible"" reports in Swedish media saying he is the subject of a rape investigation in the Nordic country.Without citing sources, several Swedish media including tabloids Expressen and Aftonbladet and broadcasters SVT and TV4 reported that the Real Madrid striker was the subject of a rape claim following a visit to Stockholm last week.In response to the reports, Swedish prosecutors issued a brief statement Tuesday saying a rape had been reported to police, but didn't name any suspect.""According to the report the incident took place on Oct. 10, 2024, at a hotel in central Stockholm,"" said the statement published by the Swedish Prosecution Authority .Prosecutor Marina Chirakova, who is leading that investigation, declined to give any further details.""From my side I cannot confirm whether there is a suspect in the case,"" she told The Associated Press.Names of suspects are typically not made public by Swedish authorities until charges are filed or a suspect is ordered held in pre-trial detention.Mbappe's communications team accused Swedish media of spreading ""slanderous"" rumors.""These accusations are totally false and irresponsible, and their propagation is unacceptable,"" they said in a statement sent to the AP and other media. ""Kylian Mbappe will under no circumstances tolerate his integrity, reputation and honor being sullied by unfounded insinuations.""In a post late Monday on his official X account Mbappe wrote ""FAKE NEWS!!!!"" and linked to a French article picking up the Swedish reports.He appeared to draw a link between the reports in Sweden and a hearing in Paris on Tuesday in a legal dispute with former club Paris Saint-Germain over unpaid wages.""It's becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance,"" the post said in French.Mbappe's lawyers didn't comment as they arrived for and left the hearing in Paris on Tuesday.Later Tuesday, a lawyer for Mbappe, Marie-Alix Canu-Bernard, told French broadcaster TF1 that her client was ""bewildered"" by the reports.""We are told that a complaint has been lodged, but at this stage we don't even know against whom.

Thomas Tuchel is set to be named England's new manager after agreeing a deal with the Football Association (FA), multiple British and German media outlets reported on Tuesday.The Times, Sky Sports, the BBC and German newspaper Bild said that Tuchel, 51, will be named as the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate .The FA declined to comment on the reports but said that CEO Mark Bullingham will provide an update on Wednesday at Wembley Stadium when the appointment is expected to be confirmed.The German, who has been out of work since leaving Bayern Munich at the end of last season, would become just the third foreign manager of the Three Lions after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.Sky Germany reported he will sign an 18-month deal from January 1, 2025 until the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup.A former coach of Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern, Tuchel has the trophy-winning pedigree that the FA is seeking to help end a 58-year wait to win a major tournament.However, the move has drawn criticism over the FA's unwillingness to trust an English coach with its top job.Tuchel won league titles at PSG and Bayern and the German Cup with Dortmund, but his greatest success came during his time in English football at Chelsea.He led the Blues to Champions League glory just months after taking charge in 2021 and also won the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup with the London club.Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 in a bold early move by Chelsea's new ownership group that did not pay off.Just six months later he was appointed Bayern boss and led them to an 11th consecutive Bundesliga title.However, Tuchel also oversaw the demise of Bayern's dominance of German football in a first trophyless campaign last season for 12 years.Lee Carsley was put in temporary charge of England in August following Southgate's resignation shortly after losing the final of Euro 2024 .However, the 50-year-old, who stepped up from his role as under-21s manager, has since given mixed messages about whether he wanted the job on a permanent basis.Despite winning three of his four games in charge, Carsley's case was further damaged by a 2-1 Nations League defeat to Greece last week and he backed the idea of appointing a foreign coach if they are the right candidate.""We've seen in the past that we've had different nationalities coach the team. The best candidate should get the job,"" said Carsley.""I think we'd be putting ourselves in a corner if we didn't, and we didn't open our minds a bit.""Carsley could still remain in charge for games against Greece and the Republic of Ireland next month if Tuchel does not take over until the new year.Tuchel will inherit a richly talented generation of players, including Harry Kane , Jude Bellingham and Cole Palmer, that will be among the favourites for World Cup glory in 2026.Kane was signed by Tuchel for Bayern last year and scored 44 goals in 45 matches under his tutelage.""Obviously, I know Thomas well from last year,"" Kane told Sky Germany.

So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week. The Odisha girl, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, won her first juniors title in Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114255057,imgsize-39734,width-400,resizemode-4/114255057.jpg"

PUNE: The All India Tennis Association on Monday filed an application in the Delhi High Court to unseal the results of its recently held elections.The application was part of the response AITA filed in a writ petition brought forward against it by Davis Cuppers Somdev Devvarman and Purav Raja , who had sought a stay on the elections citing breach of National Sports Code .Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav had on September 24, while admitting the case, allowed the polls to go ahead but ordered the results to be not declared and presented to the court in a sealed envelope.“The returning officer today filed the sealed envelope to the court. From AITA, we have filed an application to open the envelope,” Ashish Prasad, advocate for AITA, told TOI from Delhi over phone.“Two weeks’ time has been given for all parties to file their response. Next hearing is on November 25,” he added.Prasad said that with the Union government , first respondent in the case, releasing a draft for a new sports code, AITA would prefer the “new bill to come into play” before the court makes a decision.“Until then the current office-bearers would continue. I don’t think the court would want the case to go into a limbo,” he said.“We are on the same page when it comes to what they (petitioners) are asking for, good administration and good compliance (of the sports code).“My advice has always been to abide by the law. If the new group (of office-bearers) comes forward, and if they are above 70 or (in breach of) tenure as per the (new) code, they will go.”Asked if there had been any overtures from either party to settle the case amicably, Prasad was diplomatic.“My advice is to talk and look for common ground,” he said.","The application was part of the response AITA filed in a writ petition brought forward against it by Davis Cuppers Somdev Devvarman and Purav Raja.

Shanghai, Oct 13, 2024 -Novak Djokovic insisted Sunday that he plans ""to compete and play next season"" despite suffering another loss at the hands of world number one Jannik Sinner .The 37-year-old Serb, the holder of a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles , went down 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to the Italian in the final of the Shanghai Masters .However, Djokovic said he has no intention of following career-long rival Rafael Nadal into retirement even though he endured by his own admission ""one of the worst-performing seasons in terms of results"".""I don't know what the future brings, I'll just try to kind of go with the flow to see how I feel in a given moment but I still plan to compete and play next season,"" he told reporters.Djokovic failed to add to his Grand Slam haul in 2024 as Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz , who claimed the French Open and Wimbledon titles, took possession of the sport's major honours.However, Djokovic was crowned Olympic champion , winning an emotional roller-coaster of a final against Alcaraz in Paris in August. That was his 99th career title.Sunday's loss left him frustratingly short of becoming just the third man after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer to win 100 titles.""It's not a live-or-die type of goal for me, I think I've achieved all of my biggest goals in my career,"" he said.""Right now it's really about Slams and about still seeing how far I can kind of push the bar for myself.""Djokovic hailed Sinner who at 23 is 14 years his junior. His title in Shanghai was his seventh of the year.""He's very solid from the forehand and backhand, doesn't make too many mistakes, and just tries to take away the time from the opponent,"" said Djokovic.""That's something that reminds me of myself throughout my career, that's what I've done for so many years consistently, playing fast-paced tennis , taking away time from the opponent, kind of suffocating the opponent in a certain way.""","Novak Djokovic says he plans ""to compete and play next season"" The Serb lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to Jannik Sinner in the final of the Shanghai Masters. The 37-year- old Serb is the holder of a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114195001,imgsize-33394,width-400,resizemode-4/114195001.jpg"
