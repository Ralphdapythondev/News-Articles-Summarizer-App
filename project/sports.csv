NEW DELHI: Amidst reports that Babar Azam is preparing to take legal action against YouTubers and former cricketers who have accused him of misconduct during the T20 World Cup , another video is doing the rounds where former cricketer Ahmad Shahzad is criticising the Pakistan cricket captain for the same.During a talk show in Pakistan Shahzad says, ""Former players that he (Babar) is talking about, they should also file a case on him asking when you had a team for 5 years, where have you brought the team, to the 7th spot. Then the 25 crore fans whose sentiments also got hurt, they should also ask what results have you produced.""Shahzad continues, ""The domestic cricketers whom you didn't select for the team, you went ahead with one group, kept on saying that this group will win you matches, but that didn't happen, and those domestic cricketers who didn't get a chance in the past 5 years, they should also file a case and ask questions. They should also ask Babar how you kept adjusting your friends in the team, who you turn into bowlers when they can't bat, turn into batsmen when they can't bowl, and when they do nothing, you adjust them by making them fielders.""Shahzad adds, ""Then you (Babar) should ask that the people who used to criticize you are now in the team, you are their captain, then your sentiments didn't get hurt? Then the selectors who 3 months ago used to say that you don't know captaincy, you are not captaincy material, now you are saying 'yes yes' to them, then your sentiments didn't get hurt? There also you should have filed a case.""Shahzad retorts, ""After losing 3 World Cups, 2 Asia Cups, you (Babar) were made captain again after 2 months, you should have asked the question how you were made the captain? Is it only you whose sentiments are getting hurt, not of the fans? We always tell the public the truth, we don't body shame anyone, we don't even take wrong names, we talk only about cricket,Pakistan cricket. What have you done? You always try to find an escape route.""""Even great players like Messi and Ronaldo , who have a huge fan following, are criticized. Even the effigies of Messi were burnt recently, shoes were hurled at their photos. But they are sportsmen, they take all this in their stride. You should also take the criticism positively, but instead you are saying you will file defamation cases against former cricketers. We were also criticized, so much that we didn't get the third match after two bad matches. We didn't say anything to anyone. You get paid to do well. Even the cameraman here has a job to do, even if he doesn't do it properly, he is also answerable,"" Shahzad concludes.Babar and the Pakistan team faced intense criticism following their disappointing performance in the tournament, which saw them exit during the group stage. This criticism, which targeted Babar in particular, has left the captain disheartened.A report had revealed that a coordinated social media campaign aimed at defaming Babar was launched during the World Cup. The PCB 's legal department is now investigating the defamatory statements made by several YouTubers and former cricketers.Pakistan, who were runners-up in the previous edition of the T20 World Cup, failed to advance beyond the group stage in this year's tournament, prompting a wave of scrutiny and criticism from fans and commentators alike.",Babar Azam is preparing to take legal action against YouTubers and former cricketers who have accused him of misconduct during the T20 World Cup.

India scored 196 for five, thanks to contributions from Virat Kohli , Shivam Dube, and Hardik Pandya. In response, Bangladesh struggled to 146/8 in their 20 overs.Virat Kohli (37 off 28) found some rhythm at the crease before Shivam Dube (34 off 24) and Hardik Pandya (50 not out off 27) pushed India to their highest total at the venue. Pandya provided the final flourish, completing his half-century off the last ball of the innings.India’s bowlers ensured that Bangladesh never posed a serious challenge in the steep run-chase. Kuldeep Yadav (3/19) made the Bangladesh batters look clueless with his mix of googlies and stock deliveries. Jasprit Bumrah (2/13 in four overs) also offered a frugal bowling effort.""Bangladesh skipper Najmul Shanto (40 off 32) played some attacking shots including two sixes over fine leg off Hardik but did not get support from others as the batters let the team down once again.""After Litton Das (13 off 10) pulled Hardik for a six over deep mid-wicket, he was caught at deep square leg the next ball. Litton’s premeditated walk across the stumps led to his dismissal.Kuldeep quickly made an impact by getting rid of opener Tanzid Hasan (29) with a wrong’un, trapping him leg before wicket. Towhid Hridoy, Bangladesh's standout batter so far, went for a sweep against Kuldeep but missed it completely to be adjudged LBW.Bangladesh, at 76 for three in the 12th over, could only delay the inevitable as wickets kept falling.India’s innings was buoyed by a strong start from skipper Rohit Sharma (23 off 11) and Virat Kohli. They allowed themselves to play freely unlike in previous games. Bangladesh's strategy of starting with spinners from both ends against the two right-handers was unusual.Rohit hit three fours and one six before mistiming a shot to be caught. Kohli’s shots included a notable 94m six off Mustafizur Rahman. Kohli also launched leg-spinner Rishad Hossain for a straight six but was later deceived by a slow off-cutter from pacer Tanzim Hasan.Suryakumar Yadav also fell in quick succession, caught after a delivery jumped off the length and kissed his gloves. This left India at 83 for three in 10 overs."" Rishabh Pant (36 off 24) then brought the momentum back in India's favour by collecting two fours and a six over deep midwicket off Mustafizur who had a rare off day.""Pant attacked Rishad Hossain in the next over but was dismissed by the reverse sweep for the second consecutive innings. Dube and Hardik then forged a 53-run stand to propel the innings forward.Hardik’s innings included four boundaries and three sixes. Dube targeted the deep midwicket boundary against spinners and hit Tanzim Hasan for a six down the ground.India's victory against Bangladesh marked their second straight win in the Super 8s. They will face Australia, the only other unbeaten team, in their final Super 8 fixture in St Lucia on Monday.Bangladesh's batting wobbles continued despite their captain’s efforts, making it difficult for them to chase down India’s substantial total. Their inability to support Shanto was evident throughout the innings. After Litton Das’s brief cameo, there was little resistance.Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya emerged as the heroes for India. Kuldeep’s introduction in the Caribbean leg of the competition has paid off well for the team. Hardik's all-round skills shined through, setting up a competitive total and then contributing with the ball.For India, this win edges them closer to a semifinals spot with a key challenge against Australia forthcoming. Their strategy to utilize both fast bowling and spin showcased a well-rounded and adaptable side.In summary, India’s overall strong performance led by key players secured a significant victory against Bangladesh, moving them a step closer to the semifinals in the T20 World Cup.","India beat Bangladesh by 50 runs in their second Super 8 match of the T20 World Cup.

Buttler, who had to leave IPL 2024 before the playoffs to represent England in a T20I series against Pakistan, expressed his opinion during a press conference ahead of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.Buttler stated, ""It's my personal opinion that there shouldn't be any international cricket that clashes with the IPL. These games have been in the calendar for a long time, and leading into a World Cup, your No. 1 priority is playing for England and performing for England. I feel like this is the best preparation.""The comments sparked a debate on the Club Prairie Fire podcast, where Hafeez asked Michael Vaughan and Adam Gilchrist for their views. Vaughan supported Buttler's stance, acknowledging the growing significance of the IPL. He remarked, ""I actually agree with him. IPL has become so big, and the players are so well rewarded for participating.""Hafeez interrupted Vaughan by questioning whether it was fair for players to prioritize IPL over national duties. Vaughan responded, ""It is the nature of the beast in 2024. Whether it is absolutely morally right is a very good question. But I think IPL is so big now that it is very hard for international boards to compete with it.""Vaughan also noted the potential impact on the County Championship , with many players likely to miss matches due to IPL commitments. ""Pakistan Super League (PSL) will compete with IPL next year, which will be interesting. It will affect the English summer more than any other country because so many players will be involved in both tournaments,"" the former England skipper added.Adam Gilchrist echoed Vaughan's sentiments, pointing out that domestic cricket will inevitably be compromised due to IPL. He mentioned, ""Domestic cricket is going to be compromised within the more established cricketing nations. For instance, the Sheffield Shield final overlaps with the IPL, so players will have to make a choice.""Hafeez found Buttler's remarks surprising and emphasized the importance of national pride. He commented, ""To me, that was a shocking statement from the captain of England because representing your country is the biggest prize you play for. If you are compromising and saying that national pride should not be there due to the IPL contract, I think that's not right.""","Former Pakistan captain Mohammad Hafeez criticized England skipper Jos Buttler for his recent comments.

Shivam Dube 's place in India's playing eleven at the ongoing T20 World Cup is facing immense scrutiny after the all-rounder's failure to impress with the bat and under-utilization as a bowler, with fans and experts drawing logical conclusions for him to be replaced with either Sanju Samson or Yashasvi Jaiswal .Dube earned a call-up for the T20 World Cup on the back of his fine batting form for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) during IPL 2024; however, he hasn't yet succeeded in replicating that in this tournament.It was Dube's ability to hit spinners for sixes in the middle overs during the IPL that impressed Rohit Sharma and the BCCI selectors to include him in the 15-member squad, while keeping the likes of Shubman Gill and Rinku Singh among the reserves.But in four innings so far in this World Cup, Dube has scored just 44 runs, with a highest of 31 not out against USA. Add to that Rohit's reluctance in using him as a bowler, and it gives more reasons for him to be replaced.Dube has so far been asked by Rohit to bowl just one over, which he delivered in the match against USA and conceded 11 runs. Interestingly, in IPL 2024 as well he bowled just one over.If India decide to drop him, middle-order batsman Samson fits the bill more than Jaiswal unless Rohit and coach Rahul Dravid decide to bring Kohli back to No. 3 and draft Jaiswal in to open with the skipper.Both Samson and Jaiswal have so far warmed the bench in this T20 World Cup, while the team management decided to push Kohli up a spot to partner Rohit as opener. The move, however, hasn't worked, with Kohli's four innings in the tournament so far reading 1, 4, 0 and 24.""I would love to see Yashasvi Jaiswal getting a look in and opening with Rohit, with Virat at number three,"" said India pacer S Sreesanth on Star Sports.""The player who might miss out will be Shivam Dube. I have been telling this from day one of the World Cup, much before it started, if Dube is not bowling his one or two overs, then either it should be Samson in the middle, who can change the game, or it should be Jaiswal opening the batting and Virat at number three,"" he added.The other thought is that with Bangladesh inclined to us a spin-heavy bowling unit, India might give Dube one more game to show his batting skills; but that line of thought can also be debated because Samson too is a good player against spin.A lot to ponder for Rohit and Dravid.",Shivam Dube's place in India's playing eleven is facing immense scrutiny.

Georgia struck first with Georges Mikautadze's penalty, but Schick equalized in a match filled with action and drama in Hamburg.Georgia, debutants in the competition, showcased their progress under coach Willy Sagnol , who highlighted his players' disappointment at their opening defeat as a sign of their growth. The Georgian team put in a spirited performance to earn their first Euros point, guided by goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili's exceptional saves.Sagnol said his players' disappointment at their opening defeat showed how far his team has come, and they gave everything in Hamburg to earn their first Euros point.Mamardashvili played a pivotal role, making crucial saves early on, denying efforts from Adam Hlozek and Schick. Georgia's offensive efforts were rewarded just before halftime when Mikautadze converted a penalty, secured after a VAR review flagged a handball by Czech defender Robin Hranac.The game's momentum swung back in favor of the Czechs in the second half. Schick, who had already demonstrated his scoring prowess at Euro 2020, equalized with an improvised finish, chesting home a rebound off the post from Ondrej Lingr's header. This goal marked Schick as the Czech Republic's top scorer in Euros history, surpassing Milan Baros with six goals, but a calf injury forced him to leave the pitch midway through the second half.The Czech team, led by coach Ivan Hasek, had started strong, creating numerous chances. They were initially frustrated when VAR disallowed Hlozek's goal due to a handball, following a save by Mamardashvili that deflected back onto Hlozek’s face and arm. Czech right-back Vladimir Coufal received a booking for a foul on Georgia's standout player Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who along with Mikautadze, had required medical attention before the match but both started.“He attempted to counter and was met with Coufal's challenge, resulting in a yellow card for the Czech defender,” observed reviewers of the game.Georgia also saw their penalty appeals for an incident involving Zuriko Davitashvili and Ladislav Krejci dismissed. Despite these setbacks, Georgia captained by Guram Kashia, managed to test the Czech defense, with Stanec making a brilliant first-half stoppage-time save before conceding the penalty kick.Czech fans experienced further tension as Krejci came close to scoring from another header, narrowly missing the target. The Czechs’ persistence nearly paid off, but they failed to capitalize on several opportunities.In an end-to-end encounter, Georgia showed impressive resolve. “Georgia's fans were in the majority…they began to roar every time Napoli winger Kvaratskhelia got the ball in opposition territory,” noted observers.The match concluded with a dramatic moment when Georgia had a golden opportunity to clinch victory. Substitute Saba Lobjanidze found himself in a prime position but fired over the bar amid a three-on-one break, leaving the match tied.This draw leaves both teams with a challenging road ahead in Euro 2024 Group F. With strong performances from both sides, they will be looking to build on this match in their subsequent fixtures.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo and the Portuguese national team are set to face Turkey in their second Group F encounter at the European Championship. Both teams emerged victorious in their initial matches, with Portugal edging out the Czech Republic 2-1 and Turkey triumphing over Georgia 3-1.The highly anticipated clash is scheduled to commence at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT) in the city of Dortmund .Ronaldo, who found himself relegated to the bench during the 2022 World Cup, has now solidified his position as a guaranteed starter under the guidance of newly appointed coach Roberto Martinez. Although the Portuguese superstar played the entire game against the Czechs, he was unable to find the back of the net.Portugal encountered difficulties when pitted against a defensively minded Czech side in Leipzig. However, they are expected to find more space to operate against a Turkey team that favors an attacking approach. One player to keep an eye on is Turkey's rising star, 19-year-old Arda Guler, who showcased his immense talent by scoring a spectacular goal against Georgia.However, there are concerns regarding his fitness level ahead of this crucial match. Turkey will undoubtedly benefit from the fervent support of their fans at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion, the venue where they played their opening game.A victory for either team in this encounter will guarantee their position at the top of the group, provided that Georgia and the Czech Republic settle for a draw in their earlier match.

At the same time, the Czech Republic suffered a narrow 2-1 defeat to Portugal, thanks to a late goal from Francisco Conceicao. Both teams now look to this match as a pivotal opportunity to improve their standings.A win would significantly enhance the prospects for either side. However, even the team that loses might still progress, as some third-place teams could qualify.

NEW DELHI: Austria 's Euro 2024 knockout stage aspirations received a significant boost on Friday as they secured an impressive 3-1 victory over Poland. Despite Robert Lewandowski's ineffective substitute appearance, Poland struggled to make an impact. Ralf Rangnick's Austrian side is now in a strong position to qualify for the last 16, needing only to avoid defeat against the Netherlands in their final Group D encounter on Tuesday.Poland's chances of progressing have diminished, as they can no longer secure a top-two finish. Their only hope lies in defeating France and relying on other results to qualify as one of the four best third-placed teams. However, their fate may be sealed before that match if the Netherlands fail to overcome France later on Friday.Austria took a well-deserved early lead through Gernot Trauner's header, but Poland equalized in the 30th minute courtesy of Krzysztof Piatek, who had missed their opening defeat to the Netherlands. Despite Lewandowski's introduction with half an hour remaining, he had little impact as Poland edged closer to elimination. Christoph Baumgartner restored Austria's advantage following a well-worked team move, and Marko Arnautovic sealed the victory with a penalty in the 78th minute.Austria, who reached the knockout stage of a major tournament for the first time since 1954 at Euro 2020, will guarantee their progression with a win against the Netherlands. The Olympiastadion was filled with fans from both countries, with Polish supporters outnumbering their Austrian counterparts.However, it was the Austrian fans who celebrated early on as their team started strongly and took the lead through Trauner's header, aided by Phillipp Mwene's clever wing play. Although Poland grew into the game, they squandered a good chance to equalize when Nicola Zalewski shot over the bar.1.

The result also kept Canadian hopes alive in the group.Chile and Peru have both struggled in CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying, with a combined total of just four goals in 12 matches. This lack of offensive prowess was evident in their scoreless draw, according to a report by Reuters.Alexis Sanchez of Chile missed the best chance of the game in the 16th minute. He failed to convert Victor Davila's low cross from the six-yard box, sending his shot over the crossbar.Chile displayed more attacking intent but struggled with the final pass in a first half disrupted by injuries.

'Your football is imprisoned': Outgoing coach Igor Stimac tells India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/your-football-is-imprisoned-outgoing-coach-igor-stimac-tells-india/articleshow/111181274.cms,"PANAJI: Igor Stimac isn’t going down without a fight. Sacked earlier this week for a string of disappointing results that started with India finishing as the worst-performing among 24 teams at the AFC Asian Cup — no goals, no point — and missing out on qualification to the next stage of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Stimac said he was planning to resign, even if India had made it to the third round of the qualifiers for the first time.“I had informed some senior players that I have decided to leave, even if India qualified, since it was impossible to work without proper support, just listening to lies,” Stimac told reporters during an online media interaction that lasted for almost two hours on Friday.“Nobody was bothered about the players, everyone (at the All India Football Federation) is more worried about their own personal interests.”For most part, Stimac trained his guns at senior AIFF officials, starting with president Kalyan Chaubey .“Sooner he leaves, Indian football stands a chance,” he roared.Vice president NA Haris was always “entering airports, travelling, not serious enough (about football),” while secretary general M Satyanarayan, he said, astounded him by proposing an Inter-Continental Cup in July, a time when clubs start their preseason.Even the legendary IM Vijayan wasn’t spared. In his words, “a great footballer and legend but not the right person to be chairman of a technical committee.”Then there was the customary stick reserved for FSDL, the body that owns and runs the Indian Super League (ISL), India’s top-tier league.Stimac said the contract between AIFF and FSDL started in good faith but remains questionable.“The league and top tier cannot be run by corporate business,” he said.Handed an extension seven months ago, Stimac was sacked this week after a poor AFC Asian Cup campaign and an even poorer FIFA World Cup qualifying run. The sacking, Stimac suggested, came less than 24 hours after he had told the AIFF that he was negotiating with two potential employers and needed time to resign.“I told (AIFF secretary general) Satya I am negotiating with two parties for jobs in the future, so until the end of the month, I will accept one of the offers and you won’t have to pay more than one (month’s) salary. The next day I received the termination letter on email. I could not believe it. This happened only half a day after telling him to be patient and not get influenced with social media,” said Stimac.A bronze medal winner at the FIFA World Cup in 1998 with Croatia, Stimac got the India job in 2019 after convincing the technical committee that he could help Indian footballers punch above their weight. Five years later, while India are playing more attractive football and won a record three trophies last year, the Croat is leaving with a bitter taste in his mouth.“I came here with open arms, but your football is imprisoned. Without the law being changed and allowing PIO players to represent India, nothing will change. It’s a slow process. Will take another two decades or so to make progress,” said Stimac.The AIFF has started the process to look for Stimac’s successor. On the first day itself, there were 45 applications from coaches across the world. But given the negative publicity surrounding the sport here, Stimac felt the job wouldn’t attract bigger profiles.“The new coach will know immediately (what awaits him),” he said. “You cannot get a big-name coach. Everyone knows what kind of things we deal with in Indian football. How we operate, you might get someone who is desperate for a job. Don’t think there will be any success.”Asked what he would have done differently during his fiveyear tenure, Stimac said he should have resigned after the SAFF Championship in July last year, winning his third trophy of the year.“I shouldn’t have trusted these people,” said Stimac. “After winning three trophies in 2023, I had huge support among the media and fans. As much as they wanted me out, they could do nothing. The only way they knew of running was through social media. They don’t care about other things. It’s a wrong approach to run any serious institution.”","Igor Stimac says he was planning to resign even if India had made it to the third round of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers for the first time. Stimac trained his guns at senior AIFF officials, starting with president Kalyan Chaubey. “Sooner he leaves, Indian football stands a chance,” he roared.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111181279,imgsize-41714,width-400,resizemode-4/111181279.jpg"

For the quadrennial extravaganza, Balaji got the nod ahead of his closest challenger Yuki Bhambri after Rohan Bopanna suggested his name to the All India Tennis Association (AITA).While Balaji's next big assignment is Wimbledon, he has his plans sorted for the Olympics . Bopanna and Balaji will join hands after Wimbledon and compete in two clay-court tournaments in the lead-up to the Games, where tennis events will be played at Roland Garros.

After the match, Bopanna told me that he was going to pick me and send an email to the AITA.

Andy Murray a Wimbledon doubt after injury forces him to retire at Queen's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/andy-murray-a-wimbledon-doubt-after-injury-forces-him-to-retire-at-queens/articleshow/111120587.cms,"NEW DELHI: Andy Murray 's second-round match at Queen's came to a premature end on Wednesday when he was forced to retire after just five games due to injury, raising concerns about his potential farewell appearance at Wimbledon , AFP reported.The 37-year-old Murray's hip and right leg appeared to give way following his very first serve of the match against Australia's Jordan Thompson .Despite serving out the game virtually on one leg and holding for 1-2 after dropping the first two games, Murray's condition did not improve.During the changeover, Murray received vigorous treatment on his right hip, which he had replaced in 2019, and his right knee during a medical time-out.Although he returned to play the fourth game, Murray struggled to chase down anything out of reach and served first serves at speeds below 100 mph (160 kph).The official explanation for Murray's retirement at 4-1 down was a back injury . The Scot, who is a two-time Wimbledon champion and five-time Queen's winner, had already shown signs of discomfort during his first-round victory over Alexei Popyrin on Tuesday.As Murray enters what is expected to be his final year on tour, fitness issues continue to plague him, potentially jeopardizing his hopes of making a final appearance at Wimbledon, which is set to begin in less than two weeks.Reflecting on the brief encounter, the 30-year-old Thompson noted, ""I could see he had a problem in the warm-up and then his first serve.""""I thought, 'hit the ball in and make him run'. I actually learned that from him, when he was playing, and if a guy was hurt or cramping or something, he'd always use a drop shot or just try and take it up the line.""He added: ""I learned a lot of things watching him play, so it's an honour to share the court with him, but it's just sad that it ended like that.""","Andy Murray forced to retire after just five games due to injury.

"Not satisfied with Olympics entry, want to win the medal: Sriram Balaji",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/not-satisfied-with-olympics-entry-want-to-win-the-medal-sriram-balaji/articleshow/111120088.cms,"PUNE: It has already been an incredible journey as a professional tennis player for Sriram Balaji .Having started comparatively late at the age of nine in the southern city of Coimbatore, the 34-year-old Balaji is now on the cusp of playing in the Olympics — as Grand Slam champion Rohan Bopanna ’s doubles partner in Paris.Only Nirupama Sanjeev from the city known for its textile and auto industry has wielded the racquet for India at the Summer Games before.Yet, Balaji has come a long way, so much so that he is not ready to be satisfied by simply turning up in India colours, but go all the way and fetch the coveted medal.“Last year I played couple of slams. I did have the game, but was not sharp enough. The last couple of months I have been playing much better tennis. Earlier I would question myself, now I believe in myself much more, my confidence level has gone up. Right now, I am not getting satisfied (with) just making the entry, I want to win the medal,” Balaji, world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles, said.Balaji conceded playing in the Olympics had not been his goal until recently.“It is truly dream come true for me, thanks to Bops (Bopanna). Yuki (Bhambri) is 10 spots ahead of me in rankings,” said Balaji.“When I started, wanted to take it step by step. First the Under-14s (for India), then the Davis Cup. Olympics was not in my thoughts.""The right-hander who began his tennis journey at Perks Tennis School near his home in Coimbatore under the guidance of Elango Ranganathan, whose daughter Madura was a women’s pro.The first major step-up for Balaji was moving to Chennai at the age of 16 and beginning to work Hiten Joshi and Ilyas Hussain.“They (Joshi and Hussain) told me 'don't play juniors' … so I started playing the men’s (circuit). I earned my first ATP ranking point when I was 16. They were the ones who put me on to (Alexander) Waske (in Germany),” he said.Moving base to Europe was another steep learning curve for the Tamil Nadu lad as he had to adapt fast to the difference in culture and tennis.“It was totally different. My ranking was 800 but I was not even getting into qualifying (of ITF men's events),” Balaji said.“That's how tough it was, the standard was very high. It took me one year (to start winning) ... I lost all my matches. I went there in 2010, it was only in 2011 summer that I started getting into qualifying and winning.“It was also mentally very difficult. It makes you think, 'what am I doing here?' I got a lot of help from the coaches and my parents. They never let me down. They pushed me, they believed in me.”Balaji encountered another speed bump a few years later when his game began to stagnate at between 300 and 400 in world rankings. He was at a crossroads and needed to choose his path — continue to pursue success in singles or switch to doubles.“I did have limitations in my game. It was 2017 and I had to make a choice. That was also my best year,” he said of winning nine doubles titles, including his maiden Challenger, with Vishnu Vardhan .The preceding year the duo had won seven ITF titles.“My belief in singles was less. I believed I could get to top-200, but to get inside top-100 ... I could see that I had limitations, and I knew that in doubles I was capable of top-50.“So the choice was whether to go for top-200 in singles or top-20 in doubles. I chose top-20 doubles.”Almost immediately his ambitions suffered a setback as Vardhan decided to stop playing full schedule.“I didn't have a set partner after that. Every four-five weeks I had a different partner. In 2022, I started playing with Jeevan, in 2023 we did well and then he wanted to take a break,” Balaji said.But the tide began to turn when he started forging a partnership last year with Andre Begemann, a 39-year-old German who had ranked 36 in 2015 and won four ATP Tour titles.The Indo-German combination won three Challengers with Balaji getting into the top-100 in rankings for the first time and Begemann returning to the elite bracket too.“Both of us play in the German league, so I knew him already. It is only in the slams I play with a different partner since we don't get in. Otherwise in Challengers I play with Andre,” said Balaji who had beaten Rajeev Ram and Scott Lipsky in the company of Jeeven Nedunchezhiyan at the Chennai ATP Tour event in 2012.Balaji credited the ‘Doubles Dream of India’ programme for supporting the top-200 ranked players in the country.“It makes a lot of difference. Having a coach through the whole year is not affordable, especially with the less prize money in doubles,” he said.“Someone watching from outside can tell you what you cannot absorb when you are playing.“Providing a coach and a trainer during the matches in doubles, you don't find that in many countries. We have eight players in the top-200 ... without this (programme), players would have a lot of struggle.”This year’s French Open was a sort of dress rehearsal for the Olympics tennis competition, which will be held at the Roland Garros.Balaji had made it to the second round last year, and went one step further this year in tandem with Mexican Miguel-Angel Reyes-Varela. The pair lost to none other than Bopanna and Aussie Matthew Ebden.The fortnight proved to be a rewarding one in many ways for the Indian.“I was not in the tournament to begin with, we were sixth out,” Balaji said.“Rohan also has been mentoring me, telling which tournaments I should be playing. This time I told him I want to come to Paris, it's ok if I miss a Challenger.“I decided I was going to take my chances and signed in. The other thing is you also get to practise with the top players during the Grand Slam.“Finally we got in, thanks to the (inclement) weather also, as the singles players pulled out.”The match against the Australian Open winners in the third round was a difficult one but also brought out the best in Balaji and Begemann.“It was not an easy match, it was really hard (to play against Bopanna),” Balaji said.“I look up to him, he is like a mentor to me. I felt I handled it well.”",Sriram Balaji is on the cusp of playing in the Olympics as Rohan Bopanna’s doubles partner in Paris. The 34-year-old is world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles.

Adapting to the unique characteristics of each surface – clay's slow bounce and high friction, grass's low bounce and speed, and hard court's medium bounce and pace – requires significant physical adjustments.
