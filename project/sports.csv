The business end of the T20 World Cup begins for India against spirited Afghanistan . Rohit Sharma 's men have never lost to the Afghans in this format and are a much stronger team on paper, but this is a high-stakes World Cup game in sticky Caribbean conditions.Remember, the last T20I played between the two teams in Bengaluru on Jan 17, 2024 was the only one in T20I history to feature two sets of Super Overs. The Afghans will be no pushovers.Matches in the US were low-scoring affairs with the ball dominating bat, but things are expected to improve in the Caribbean. The Barbados track has been a sporting pitch with an average bat-first score of 172.Both teams may look to bat first if they win the toss. It's worth mentioning that the Afghans excel at defending targets but tend to struggle while chasing.The previous game here saw Australia score 201 batting first against England. For Afghanistan, inform openers Gurbaz andIbrahim Zadran will once again be the key.Caribbean tracks are usually spin-friendly, with finger-spinners who bowl faster and flatter - like Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel - expected to do well.However, leg-spinners have done well here too, and India's dilemma is what to do with in-form left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who has been warming the bench.The wily leggie is an expert at turning matches with key wickets in the middle while keeping the scoring rate down. Can India's batter of the moment Rishabh Pant , designated spin-hitter Shivam Dube and the maverick Suryakumar Yadav keep him quiet?Left-arm pace has been the Indian captain's old bugbear and Afghanistan will depend heavily on Farooqi to get India's opener with the one that swings in.Another potentially spicy faceoff given the history of antagonism between the two. Kohli's recent rough patch may put extra pressure on him to take on the pacers.How this one goes may well decide which way the contest swings.","The business end of the T20 World Cup begins for India against spirited Afghanistan.

BARBADOS: The Indian team is in a happy space. The players look relaxed, enjoying every bit of the trip, pulling each other's legs, breaking out into laughter once in a while, yet extremely intense when they get into the nets to bat or bowl.It has a lot to do with captain Rohit Sharma and his ways - frank, friendly, chatting with the media and telling his boys, ""Go talk to the media yaar,, how long will the captain speak for you?""It's this infectious energy and happy vibes of Rohit that have put an already good team completely at ease as they get ready to play Afghanistan on Thursday.India landed here a couple of days earlier and trained at the Kensington Oval nets. They struggled with the bat on a few occasions after a spot of rain made the pitch stickier, but were always quietly confident that ""if New York conditions could be negotiated, everything else can be"".After Afghanistan on Thursday, India play Bangladesh on Saturday. If current form and pedigree are any indication, India should wrap up their semifinal entry even before they play Australia in St. Lucia on Tuesday.The team knows it too but that doesn't make them complacent. Despite the complete domination India have enjoyed over Afghanistan over the last few years in every format, they are not taking Rashid Khan 's boys lightly at all. Rashid himself is an IPL legend while the likes of chinaman Noor Ahmed, opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz or medium-pacer Naveenul-Haq are moderately familiar faces on the Indian circuit.But more than the quality of the players, it's the warrior-spirit of the Afghans that Team India needs to be careful about. T20, at the end of the day, is a flippant format and a small phase of 12 balls here and there can turn the game upside down.Add to that the decent run that Afghanistan enjoyed in the group stages, till they were handed a reality check by an impressive West Indies in St. Lucia. But India will keep in mind that Afghanistan have beaten a team of great pedigree in New Zealand. Interestingly, the conditions here at Kensington Oval might just be to the liking of both teams.Discussions with locals suggest that 180 could be a par score, while spinners should get some assistance. The Afghans have their own battery of tweakers led by Rashid, and it will be interesting to see if India manage to find a place for chinaman Kuldeep Yadav ahead of paceman Mohammed Siraj, who has looked the least dangerous till now.But Rohit would also be mindful of the fact that the Afghans aren't the greatest players of pace bowling either. If the ball is aimed at their ribcage at good speed, the likes of Gurbaaz and others do tend to flounder a bit. And the pace-attack that India has is being touted as the best in this World Cup. If Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh find their rhythm straight up, the boys in blue should be setting the pace right from the word go.As for the batting, there's enough depth and experience in the Indian ranks to deal with any kind of Afghan threat. And with Virat Kohli due for a big one and Rohit completely at ease with his own game, there is a case for the 2007 champions to race off the blocks, as West Indies did in St Lucia the other day.If India can set the early pace, Thursday should be a comfortable day in office for the team and a stress-free evening for the fans back home.","India take on Afghanistan in their second T20 World Cup match on Thursday. The 2007 champions are favourites to win the tournament. The conditions at Kensington Oval might just be to the liking of both teams. If India can set the early pace, Thursday should be a comfortable day for the team.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111125574,imgsize-61010,width-400,resizemode-4/111125574.jpg"
'We know Afghanistan is a...': Rahul Dravid ahead of T20 World Cup Super Eights clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/we-know-afghanistan-is-a-rahul-dravid-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-super-eights-clash/articleshow/111125235.cms,"T20 WORLD CUP:

NEW DELHI: India's coach, Rahul Dravid , issued a warning, saying his team will ""not take Afghanistan lightly"" in their opening match of the T20 World Cup on Thursday in Barbados .India moved to the Super Eights , which consisted of two groups of four, having gone undefeated in the first round of pool play.Dravid is well aware of the struggle his team faces at the Kensington Oval, since India defeated Afghanistan in a T20 match in Bengaluru in January, requiring two Super Overs to win.""We know Afghanistan is a very dangerous team in this format of the game,"" former India batsman Dravid , 51 told a pre-match press conference on Wednesday, according to AFP. ""They have shown that by their performances in this World Cup.""They might not have a lot of international experience in the other formats of the game, but a lot of their players do play in a lot of T20 leagues, more than in fact some of our players do.""So, certainly in this format they are not a team to be taken lightly. They are deservedly in the Super Eights.""Afghanistan have lived up to the hype that they could be semifinalists.Prior to an overwhelming 104-run loss by a surging West Indies in a match between two unbeaten teams on Monday in St. Lucia, when Nicholas Pooran smashed 98 for the tournament co-hosts, they had already secured their spot in the Super Eights.But earlier in the competition, Afghanistan hammered New Zealand for 84 runs.Afghanistan's success has been largely attributed to Rashid Khan 's excellent spin bowling, who led the way against New Zealand in Guyana by taking four wickets for 17 runs.However, in the same match, left-arm fast bowler Fazalhaq Farooqi also took 4-17, and New Zealand was eliminated for just 75.""They have a good bowling attack all round,"" said Dravid. ""Even their two pacers are quite experienced. Farooqi and Naveen-ul-Haq have both played a lot of cricket, they both swing the ball as well.""I think their bowlers are some of the most sought-after bowlers in this format across the world.""We understand that is going to pose a challenge to us and we are going to have to play well to counter that.""Jonathan Trott , the coach of Afghanistan, said that better player relations had resulted from the introduction of T20 franchise cricket, which was driven by the Indian Premier League and ""obviously very different from when I played"".However, the 43-year-old claimed that the acquired information ""works both ways"".""We had nine, 10 players at the IPL. They will be able to share their knowledge of Indian players, and they'll be able to do the same with our players,"" explained Trott. ""That's the current state of world cricket.""I think it's in a good position, and it's very healthy. And we're in the middle of a World Cup and we're in Barbados, so the world's pretty good.""Trott maintained that Nicholas Pooran's ferocious attack would potentially help his team defeat India.""Pooran played a great knock,"" said the former England batsman. ""But other sides are going to have players of that calibre, who on their day can win matches like Pooran did. So, I think it's a good thing that it's happened.""We've learned lessons and we're going to put that right starting tomorrow (Thursday).""","India coach Rahul Dravid says his team will ""not take Afghanistan lightly"" in their opening match of the T20 World Cup on Thursday in Barbados. India defeated Afghanistan in a T20 match in Bengaluru in January, requiring two Super Overs to win. Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott says better player relations have resulted from T20 franchise cricket.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111125211,imgsize-50266,width-400,resizemode-4/111125211.jpg"

BARBADOS: When somebody referred to Suryakumar Yadav as Mohammed Siraj by mistake, there was a roll of laughter in the press-conference room. "","" the Mumbai man said with a smile, exuding the relaxed frame of mind that the entire team is in going into the business end of the T20 World Cup .On the eve of India's first Super-8s match against Afghanistan here on Thursday, Surya doesn't feel any pressure being referred to as the best T20 batter in the last two years. Rather he embraces it and tries to explain why he is ""the game changer"" for India.""To be the best T20 batter in the world, I have to know how to bat in different conditions. I always try to keep changing according to the situation,"" Surya said after a practice session on Tuesday, when he batted for almost 40 minutes at the nets.He was seen bringing out all those horizontal bat shots that have made him the best in business during practice and he wants to keep doing it against the likes of Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmed , who have looked pretty good in the tournament so far. ""My area of strength is when the spinners are bowling and the pitch is slow. I have my gameplan which I have worked on in practice. We obviously have plans about Afghanistan and we will try to bring that to good use,"" the right-hand middle-order batter said.In fact, the 33-year-old is pretty comfortable being called the game changer. ""When I first walked into the Indian dressing room, I had to figure out how I have to play and how people have played in that No. 4 position. That phase between overs 7-14 are crucial because if the attacking intent can be maintained, the work for the latter batters at the death becomes easier. So I always wanted to be the game changer, I have tried a lot of match simulations so that I can be the game changer on a given day,"" Surya said.In New York, Surya scored a 49-ball 50 against USA, which was slow by his standards, but it was good enough to win the game for India. He expects the pitches to be better in the West Indies, but if it is slow, the batter has a gameplan ready.""When the ball is not coming on to the bat, the first thing you should do is to hit the gap and run hard. Yes, it becomes difficult to generate force and you have to be smart and change according to the situation. The best way is to keep talking to your partner, calm the nerves down and go about the business.""It's this simplicity in approach of Surya that makes him such a special player in T20s and it's about keeping it going for a while longer.","Suryakumar Yadav doesn't feel any pressure being referred to as the best T20 batter in the last two years. The 33-year-old is pretty comfortable being called the game changer.

It is highly likely that Gambhir will replace Rahul Dravid , who will step down after the team's T20 World Cup campaign in the Americas.Dravid was already on an extension after his initial contract ended following last year's ODI World Cup at home. He chose not to seek another term after the T20 World Cup in the USA and Caribbean.Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal believes Gambhir is the ideal candidate for the head coach position. He also suggested that Team India consider legendary pacers Ashish Nehra or Zaheer Khan as potential options for the bowling coach role.""Gambhir jo cheez chootha hai, wo sona ban jaati hai. Wo jis team se judta hai, wo successful ho jaati hai [Whatever Gambhir touches turns into gold. The team he joins becomes successful],"" Kamran told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""Team India doesn't need any foreign coaches. They have plenty of options and talent. After Dravid, no one can be the best and bigger than Gautam Gambhir. He was a big player and will become a great coach too. He is the best option India have right now.""Gambhir was with Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). They did really well under him. He became a mentor of KKR and they became champions. He is an amazing planner and has a brilliant cricketing mind. I have played a lot of cricket with him. We have been together for a long time. We played, had food, and had chats together. We are still good friends. We are still in touch,"" he said.""He is the best man to coach Team India. He should be the head coach. India can go for Ashish Nehra or Zaheer Khan as bowling coach,"" Kamran added.Current India head coach Dravid is currently with the team for the T20 World Cup in the Americas. India topped Group A and are now in Barbados for their Super 8 matches. They will face Afghanistan on June 20 in their first Super 8 match.Praising Dravid, Kamran Akmal remarked that the legendary cricketer has significantly contributed to Indian cricket both as a batsman and a coach.""Rahul Dravid has given a lot to Indian cricket. Not just with his batting, he has given a lot to Indian cricket as a coach as well. He has been working with a different model with Team India. He is one of the greats. Be it Dravid, Tendulkar, Ganguly or Dhoni, these four have given a lot to Indian cricket. And Team India should take help from these four cricketers as much as possible,"" Kamran said.""Dravid started coaching U-19 cricket and then went to NCA and then the senior team. Just look at his graph. He is someone who believes in making the roots and foundation so strong. He has made his Team India. Team India are dominating at the moment but the behind the scene credit goes to Rahul Dravid,"" he said.",Gautam Gambhir interviewed by BCCI's Cricket Advisory Committee on Tuesday.

Kuldeep Yadav: T20 World Cup: How can India bring Kuldeep Yadav into the playing XI?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-how-can-india-bring-kuldeep-yadav-into-the-playing-xi/articleshow/111100009.cms,"Pant takes a break

BRIDGETOWN: It's been one of the most difficult decisions for the team management so far — how to play Kuldeep Yadav , who came into the event in red-hot form but hasn't got a game yet?And now that India are into the West Indies leg of the World Cup, is there a temptation to get the left-arm wrist spinner into the playing XI?On both days of practice at the Kensington Oval here, the chinaman bowler was seen turning his arm over for long spells.In the spinners' net, Kuldeep was definitely the best bowler in action.In the long spell that he bowled in tandem with Ravindra Jadeja , both got the ball to turn quite a bit. It's difficult to predict whether the nature of the practice pitch and the centre-wicket where the game will be played on Thursday will be of similar nature. But if it is anything close, Kuldeep should be in the fray.During his spell, Kuldeep got both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli out, not a mean feat wherever you're playing. While Rohit lobbed one back to Kuldeep, Virat's slash outside the off-stump should have resulted in a catch in cover.But the problem of including Kuldeep here will mean that the team will have to break a winning combination. India will be extremely reluctant to drop any of the four all-rounders in Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Jadeja and Axar Patel. If there has to be a change, it has to be to leave Mohammed Siraj out.""Ideally, India should go in with three pacers and three spinners, but it's to be seen whether they are ready to take the gamble,"" an insider who has a fair understanding of the Kensington Oval conditions told TOI.The team management, too, understands that it is slightly unfair to keep Kuldeep out. Bowling coach Paras Mhambrey had said that the left-armer could well be in the equation once the group moves to the West Indies.Captain Rohit, too, had spoken of some ""secret"" up his sleeve that he didn't want to divulge in New York. ""You'll have to wait for some more time to know what it is,"" Rohit had said during one of his interactions.One feels in slightly favourable conditions for spinners, Kuldeep can well be that secret weapon that Rohit had spoken about. But there's absolutely no denying that two finger spinners and one wrist-spinner, and all in good form, make the attack look way more balanced.The fact that Aussie leggie Adam Zampa became the Man of the Match here in a high-scoring match when they played England should also be in the team management's mind when they sit down to choose the XI.Rishabh Pant had a long batting and wicket-keeping session on Monday but he took a break on Tuesday. It was an optional session and Pant might well have been cooling his heels before a final training session on Wednesday.",Kuldeep Yadav is in red-hot form but hasn't got a game yet.

New Zealand reached the semi-finals in the last three T20 World Cups and also played the 2021 final but has yet to secure a ICC white-ball title.Another New Zealand cricketer, Lockie Ferguson , a fast bowler, has also stated that he will not accept a national contract, according to New Zealand Cricket (NZC).Williamson, one of the world’s top batsmen with over 350 international appearances in Tests, ODIs, and T20s, will continue to play for New Zealand in all three formats. However, he will be unavailable for part of the home summer due to a new contract abroad starting in January.""Pursuing an overseas opportunity during the New Zealand summer means I’m unable to accept a central contract offer,"" said the 33-year-old in a statement.""Playing for New Zealand is something I treasure, and my desire to give back to the team remains undiminished. My life outside cricket has changed however - spending more time with my family and enjoying experiences with them at home or abroad is something that’s even more important to me,"" Williamson added.Williamson is expected to join a T20 franchise league overseas, with possible destinations including Australia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. He had previously relinquished the Test captaincy to Tim Southee in 2022.NZC said Williamson would still be available for eight Tests leading up to Christmas and the ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan from February to March. The board emphasized that Williamson's decision to opt out of a contract would not affect his chances of selection, which is a shift from its typical policy that favors contracted players.""We’re happy to make an exception for our greatest ever batter – especially as he remains so committed to the team.

NEW DELHI: South Africa 's world-class batters will be eager to showcase their skills against a determined USA side in their first Super Eight match of the T20 World Cup on Wednesday. The Proteas have remained undefeated in the tournament thus far, with their bowlers shouldering the responsibility in all four matches.Despite playing three games on the demanding New York pitches and one in Kingstown, South Africa has yet to surpass the 120-run mark in any of their matches. This batting performance does not reflect the team's potential, which boasts powerful hitters such as Quinton de Kock, Henriech Klassen, Tristan Stubbs, and David Miller. However, the top order consisting of De Kock, Reeze Hendricks, and captain Aiden Markram may feel the need to step up their game.South Africa narrowly escaped defeat against Nepal in their last match, and with formidable opponents like defending champions England and hosts West Indies also in Group 2, the Proteas cannot afford to relax against USA. They will be determined to begin the Super Eight stage with a victory.Prior to the World Cup, South Africa's primary worry was Anrich Nortje 's poor form, but the star pacer has turned things around with some outstanding performances in the group stage, currently tied for second place among leading wicket-takers with nine scalps. Nortje and fellow pacer Ottneil Baartman have formed an impressive duo, while Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada will also be looking to unsettle the inexperienced USA batters.Co-host USA, a diverse team consisting of eight Indians, two Pakistanis, a West Indian, one New Zealander, a South African, and a Dutch player, is in the midst of a remarkable run, having qualified for the Super Eights in their debut appearance. They have displayed an aggressive style of play throughout the tournament.The USA team will be monitoring the fitness of their skipper, Monank Patel, who missed the match against India and was also set to sit out against Ireland due to a niggle. They will be eager to cause another upset after defeating former champions Pakistan in the league stage. While it may be a challenging task, the spirited group is prepared to face the challenge head-on.The T20 World Cup Super 8 encounter between the United States (USA) and South Africa (SA) is set to take place on June 19 at 8:00 PM IST, as part of the Super Eights stage of the T20 World Cup 2024. The Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua, will host this historic match.This will be the first ever T20I match between the United States and South Africa.The North Sound Stadium pitch has already hosted four matches in the tournament, and it has proven to be a challenging surface for the batsmen. The new ball bowlers have found swing, while the spinners have also managed to extract turn from the wicket once the ball has lost its shine. Scoring runs on this track will be a daunting task for the batters, and it is likely that the bowlers will have a significant impact on the outcome of the game.The Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua has hosted four matches in the T20 World Cup 2024. Teams batting first have won three of these matches, indicating that the pitch might offer some advantage to the team setting a target. This could influence your fantasy team selection, favoring bowlers and middle-order batters.Considering the pitch and player performances, it might be wise to include these bowlers in your fantasy team to maximize your points. Additionally, middle-order batters could also be crucial in accumulating points, as they might have the opportunity to build innings and score well.from the USA has been impressive with four wickets in three matches.

NEW DELHI: It won't be an understatement to say that Pakistan 's group stage exit from this edition of the T20 World Cup has neither gone down well with former players or critics, nor with the die-hard fans of the country.With defeats against the United States and archrivals India, Pakistan's fate was sealed with a washed-out game against the USA.Already eliminated Pakistan avoided another embarrassing loss against Ireland in their final game at the T20 World Cup.While former players and critics have vented out their frustration on air on various television and talk shows, there have been various videos of Pakistani fans breaking their TV sets in anger and blowing off steam on various social media handles.Amidst these gloomy times in Pakistan, a video has surfaced online where pacer Haris Rauf is allegedly taunted by a fan for the team's poor performance in the T20 World Cup.The video shows Rauf walking with his wife on a sidewalk, while being allegedly taunted by the fan. A furious Rauf jumps over a line of street shrub as his wife tries to stop him.Though the video is not clearly audible, Rauf appears to say for the fan that he must be Indian, to which the fan responds that he is a Pakistani.To his credit, the fan stands his ground against a furious Rauf who is stopped by 3-4 more fans who were passing by.On Monday there was a report that Pakistan's skipper Babar Azam and five other players - Mohammad Amir , Imad Wasim , Haris Rauf, Shadab Khan , and Azam Khan - have chosen to spend their holidays in London before going back home.",Haris Rauf allegedly taunted by a fan for Pakistan's poor performance in T20 World Cup.

""He knows how to stand up in big matches, isn't he? That's what makes him really, really special,"" IANS quoted Pathan as saying.""He's a special player and I'm sure he's going to put his hand up and say OK, I'm going to do this for Team India. When the time comes, especially in the big matches, we have always seen Virat Kohli perform. Just wait and watch, the slog sweep will come out now. He will definitely use those shots because, look, those conditions in New York were challenging. But now things will be different, and you'll see a real Virat Kohli coming to the fore.""Pathan's confidence in Kohli is not without reason. The star batsman has consistently performed in crucial moments, and his assertive style during the group matches, although not resulting in substantial runs, suggests a deliberate change in tactics aimed at throwing off the opposition's bowlers from the start.Supporters who have been eagerly awaiting this aggressive approach, similar to his IPL performances, might witness it come to fruition in the match against Afghanistan.Nevertheless, the Indian batting order will have to contend with a daunting spin attack from the Afghan side, spearheaded by the trio of Rashid Khan , Noor Ahmad , and Mohammad Nabi .Ambati Rayudu , a former Indian cricketer, shared his thoughts on the potential strategy India could employ against Rashid, the Afghan spin sensation. Rashid, who underwent surgery after the ODI World Cup 2023, hasn't been at his devastating best since his return to the international arena.""I think the biggest challenge against Rashid Khan is trying to be too aggressive against him. That is where you land in trouble,"" Rayudu explained. ""As a batter, you need to just wait for those loose balls and capitalize on them. After his injury, I don't think his pace is the same. So, you have enough time now, and people have been getting after Rashid. Also, the Indian batsmen know him very well.""Rayudu's examination of Rashid's bowling highlights the need for a calculated strategy when facing the Afghan spinner. By taking advantage of any slight decrease in his speed and pouncing on infrequent mistakes, Indian batsmen may find success against him.This tactical approach, combined with the expected return to form of Kohli, might prove pivotal for India as they confront the spin challenge posed by Afghanistan's bowling attack.",India face Afghanistan in their opening Super Eight stage match of the T20 World Cup 2024 on Thursday in Barbados.

Their only loss in the league stage was against West Indies earlier this week.""Day games actually suit us better. So, quite excited to play India in a day game.

Trott believes this reputation is a compliment to his team’s progress and performance.“It's a compliment, but also earned as well. We've had, as you see in he IPL, we've got a lot of players playing a lot of T20 cricket around the world and now it's about putting that together as a side I think in the past we've had some good individual players, but we need all those players playing together as a side,"" Trott said.Traditionally, Afghanistan have relied on spin bowling, but in this tournament, left-arm pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi has emerged as the standout performer and is currently the top wicket-taker.""When you've got the spinners with the experience of T20 cricket, like we have, I think you would obviously say that's one of our strengths, but yet one of our seamers is a leading wicket-taker in the tournament. So, I think we've seen certainly over the last couple of years a more rounded side.

Reminded of that game India narrowly won, Trott added: “What I take away from the match is we should have won it, in that super over. But also, what I take away, it shows how the gap is closing with regards to our side, the ability that our players have to be able to chase as well in T20 cricket.“That was a fantastic chase in Bangalore and unfortunately, we didn't win.

NEW DELHI: Led by opener Andries Gous' gutsy unbeaten 47-ball 80, a spirited USA gave South Africa a fight before the experienced Proteas managed an 18-run win in their Group 2 Super 8 match at the T20 World Cup in Antigua on Wednesday.With the first win in Super 8s, South Africa earned two points and registered their fifth win on the trot at the this year's cricketing extravaganza.Chasing a challenging 195 on a batting-friendly pitch at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, the USA were stopped at 176 for six in their 20 overs.South African-born Gous put up a valiant fight, especially with his 91-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Harmeet Singh, who scored 38 from 22 balls, featuring two fours and three sixes. The effort, however, could not bridge the gap as the Proteas' bowling attack eventually prevailed.The USA faced a turbulent start, losing Steven Taylor (24 off 14), Nitish Kumar (8), skipper Aaron Jones (0), Corey Anderson (12), and Shayan Jahangir (3) early in their innings.At 76 for five in the 12th over, with another 119 runs required for victory, it seemed a near-impossible task for the newcomers.Gous and Harmeet mounted then a fierce counter-attack in the middle overs, swinging their bats at will and found gaps with precision as South African bowlers, who had almost set up a comfortable win.Harmeet’s aggressive batting, particularly against Tabraiz Shamsi, kept USA’s hopes alive even as the asking rate climbed to about 15 runs per over.However, Rabada's exceptional bowling display, which included three wickets for just 18 runs in his four overs, ultimately turned the tide. His bowling in the penultimate over, which conceded just two runs, was crucial in breaking the USA’s stand and sealing South Africa's win.Earlier in the day, Quinton de Kock played a cracking knock in setting up South Africa’s formidable total. De Kock scored 74 from 40 balls, a display that set the tone for the innings.De Kock's fireworks at the top and skipper Aiden Markram's fluent 46 helped South Africa banish their top-order woes after the frontline batters had flopped collectively in the group stage.The pitch, expected to be slow and spin-friendly, instead saw De Kock putting the USA bowlers to the sword.De Kock's partnership with Markram yielded 110 runs from just 60 balls.Heinrich Klaasen (36 not out) and Tristan Stubbs (20 not out) further boosted South Africa’s total by adding 53 runs unbeaten for the fifth wicket in the final five overs.South Africa did have a cautious start with Reeza Hendricks scoring just 11 before falling victim to Saurabh Netravalkar, who logged figures of 2 for 21 in his four overs.But the partnerships that followed were instrumental in compiling a challenging total of 194 for four in their allotted 20 overs.South Africa, with this win, managed to capture two crucial points, opening their account in the Super Eight stage of the tournament.Despite the USA falling short, their determined fightback, especially the efforts of Gous and Harmeet, made the match a noteworthy contest.",South Africa beat USA by 18 runs in their Group 2 Super 8 match at the T20 World Cup in Antigua on Wednesday.

Speculation is rife that their plan is to run the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) Academy in close collaboration.Multiple sources have also shared that RSSC will not renew the academy contract with former state cricketer Pankaj Singh that will end in August.The Royals’ entry into the set-up comes at a time when the RCA is struggling to get its act together with their coffers lying empty and getting the elections conducted looks a tough task.The RCA is in doldrums since Vaibhav Gehlot resigned as its president in February while RSSC launched an investigation and also sealed the association’s academy and office.It would be interesting to see how things pan out once the RCA elections are conducted. “The new president would want to have the RCA Academy. We will have to wait and watch how things unfold in that scenario,” another source stated.Pankaj’s academy contract to end in August: If sources are to be believed, shutting down Pankaj’s PS Sports Academy at SMS Stadium will disturb the ‘well-set and flourishing structure’. “If the sports council doesn’t renew the contract with Pankaj, the future of around 300 youngsters will be in jeopardy and they will have to look for another alternative. We all know what Pankaj brings to the table and there aren’t any former players of his stature in the state. Also, the coaching staff employed at his academy are a team of credible individuals and it would be tough for the aspiring cricketers to find a better place to hone their skill if this academy is closed, which is also centrally located,” said a source.“It was a 7+3-year contract with Pankaj which allowed him to run his academy inside the SMS Stadium on Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. Seven years will be completed in August and the government is unlikely to extend the contract due to external pressure. That space, most likely, will be given to the highest bidder,” said a source privy to the development.Until now, no clarity has been given to Pankaj and this news might catch him unawares, the source added.Along with the academy at the stadium that was established at the PPP mode, the former Rajasthan captain Pankaj also has his own set-up at Ring Road, Muhana.In May during the IPL, Royals had partnered with Pankaj to open their first academy in the state at the latter’s PS Sports Excellence Arena situated in Muhana.RSSC secretary Sohan Ram Choudhary dismissed the alleged development as ‘baseless conjectures.’ “There is no truth in it. And you will get to know about the contract with Pankaj after we make a decision on it. Right now, we haven’t given it a thought,” Choudhary said.",Rajasthan Royals and Rajasthan State Sports Council (RSSC) are all set to enter a new partnership.

However, the conditions in Barbados seem to be more suitable for the inclusion of a wrist spinner in the playing XI.""It's tough to leave anyone out. New York had pace bowlers conditions... slightly different. We might need something different here (in Barbados). Yuzi (Chahal) or Kuldeep (Yadav) could be used here,"" said Dravid, while interacting with the media on the eve of theSuper Eight game.""We are lucky to have players with all-round abilities. We had eight batters but we (also) had seven bowling options,"" he added.According to PTI, Dravid also mentioned that the Indian team will adapt their batting order based on the circumstances of the match. He emphasised the importance of being versatile and making adjustments as needed.""Each situation is unique. Can't set it in stone. I believe in flexibility. The Pakistan game we moved Axar (Patel), specifically thinking around it... Rishabh (Pant) up the order (at No. 3), lots of thinking goes into it. I don't think in Tests (cricket), we will have that flexibility. In T20s where it is a lot about match-ups, you see it happening more (flexibility in batting position).""In cricket terminology, a ""match-up"" refers to a situation where a specific bowler or batter dominates a particular player from the opposing team.India found themselves in a precarious position at 19/2, with their top batsmen, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, dismissed early in a critical encounter against their arch-rivals, Pakistan.To counter this setback, the team management made a strategic decision to promote Axar up the batting order to No. 4. In his elevated role, Axar contributed a valuable 20 runs off 18 deliveries, helping to stabilize the Indian innings during the league match.Dravid also expressed his pleasure in arriving at the West Indies for the Super Eights stage of the tournament.""Lovely to come to the Caribbean and play cricket. Couple of practice sessions. We are prepared. Afghanistan are a very dangerous side. Their players play more in leagues than our players. They are not a team to be taken lightly.

NEW DELHI: Legendary South Africa batter AB de Villiers believes that for India to emerge victorious in the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup , they must adopt an aggressive approach and ""throw the first punch"" in their matches.On Thursday, India will face Afghanistan in their ICC T20 World Cup Super Eights encounter in Barbados. The Indian team concluded their group stage with an impressive record of three wins in three matches against Ireland, Pakistan, and the USA in Group A, while their final match against Canada was abandoned due to rain.Afghanistan, on the other hand, finished second in Group C, securing three victories and suffering a single defeat against the West Indies.India's primary objective is to break their drought of ICC tournament titles, with their last triumph being the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013, following their successes in the T20 World Cup and the 50-over World Cup in 2007 and 2011, respectively.In recent years, India have come close to winning tournaments, reaching the semifinals and finals, but they have consistently fallen short during the knockout stages.Speaking on his YouTube channel, De Villiers said, ""Just make sure you throw the first punch. In the past World Cups, I think they have been a bit conservative, sort of feeling their way into a game. They are such a quality team that I feel they can take a bit of a risk early in the game to get the momentum because there is no looking back once they get the momentum.""De Villiers believes that star India batter Virat Kohli should occupy the number three position in the batting order during the current ICC T20 World Cup. He regards Kohli as ""the best player in the world during middle overs.""Despite being the highest run-scorer in T20 World Cup history and consistently performing exceptionally well over the years, Kohli has had a disappointing start to the tournament. In his three innings so far, he has scored just 1 run against Ireland, 4 against Pakistan, and a duck against the USA.Two of his dismissals occurred while he was attempting to play aggressively, while in the match against the USA, he was dismissed after poking at a delivery pitched outside the off stump, a weakness that has troubled him frequently in the past.Virat entered the tournament following an outstanding Indian Premier League 2024 campaign with the bat for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, amassing 741 runs in 15 innings at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of 154.69, including a century and five half-centuries.He also secured the Orange Cap for his exceptional performance. Virat achieved his highest-ever strike rate in his IPL career and displayed remarkable prowess against spinners, adopting a more aggressive approach when facing them.Unfortunately, this attacking strategy proved ineffective on the challenging pitches of Nassau County International Stadium in New York, which faced criticism for its inconsistent bounce and unfavorable conditions for batsmen. As India prepare to play their matches in Barbados, Antigua, and Saint Lucia, Virat will be eager to break his streak of low scores and showcase his newfound style with a significant innings in the West Indies.De Villiers said on Virat, ""I have always said please bat Virat at number three. Especially in better wickets that they will play now, Virat is the go-to guy at number three. He can play the attacking game and also pull back and absorb the pressure if necessary. He is the best player in the world in the middle overs. I do not see any reasons (for opening).""","India will face Afghanistan in their ICC T20 World Cup Super Eights encounter in Barbados. Legendary South Africa batter AB de Villiers believes that for India to emerge victorious in the ongoing tournament, they must adopt an aggressive approach.

Michael Vaughan reveals struggle with stress-induced illness,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/michael-vaughan-reveals-struggle-with-stress-induced-illness/articleshow/111119715.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former England captain Michael Vaughan recently shared his experience with a health condition that has affected him for the past nine months. The illness, which is caused by stress, has resulted in inflammation in his body.In a post on social media, the 49-year-old Vaughan opened up about the challenges he has faced due to this condition. He mentioned that the illness has had a substantial impact on his daily life, especially around the time of Boxing Day , when he found himself unable to even hold a microphone.Vaughan's revelation sheds light on the often-overlooked effects of stress on one's physical well-being. As he continues to navigate this difficult period, he has chosen to share his story with the public, providing an update on his current health status.""Today I have spoken about the stress-related illness I have been fighting for 9 months. I don’t want sympathy as I was lucky enough to see a specialist early to give me the best medication. If this helps one person, it has been worth it,"" Vaughan wrote in a post on ‘X’.In a candid conversation with the Telegraph, Vaughan delved deeper into the details surrounding his health situation. He admitted that he was hesitant at first to openly talk about his medical condition in the public eye.""I’ll be honest with you, I was never going to speak about it,"" Vaughan admitted. ""But then I thought, ‘Wait a minute, there are probably quite a few people who go through similar and stay silent’. I don’t want this to appear as if I’m after any sympathy, because I’m not. I just hope I can help one or two people.""The former England top-order batter recently shared details about the extreme physical challenges he faced as a result of his medical condition. ""There were loads of times when I wouldn’t go out, because I was embarrassed. Even climbing in and out of a car was awful. I would try to walk over the road to Starbucks, and I’d be hobbling. Somebody would ask if I was OK. ‘Fine,’ I’d reply. ‘Just a dodgy knee’.""Vaughan stressed the significance of mental well-being and encouraged individuals to consult with healthcare professionals if they observe signs indicative of an inflammatory condition.""People always talk about mental illness being the hardest to detect because it’s not a visible injury; it is just something that happens inside your mind. It’s similar to this illness. Over time, it just builds up.""""In the end, we’re men, aren’t we? If we can do something tomorrow, we’ll do it tomorrow. But I’ve had this warning in my life, where my state got so bad, so quickly, that I had to go and see someone. Don’t ever think you can’t get treated for something or you can’t get through it. And if you do have the signs of some inflammatory disorder , go to your doctor as soon as possible,"" Vaughan urged.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan recently shared his experience with a health condition that has affected him for the past nine months.

"2nd ODI: Centurions Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur sparkle as India beat SA by four runs to clinch series",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/2nd-odi-centurions-smriti-mandhana-harmanpreet-kaur-sparkle-as-india-beat-sa-by-four-runs-to-clinch-series/articleshow/111119402.cms,"NEW DELHI: India secured a thrilling four-run victory against South Africa in Bangalore on Wednesday, taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the ODI series . The match witnessed spectacular centuries from Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur , who helped set a formidable score of 325 for three. The South African side countered with remarkable centuries from Laura Wolvaardt and Marizanne Kapp , but their efforts fell short at 321 for six.India had earlier triumphed over South Africa by 143 runs in the first ODI on Sunday.Riding on Mandhana's 136 off 120 balls, featuring 18 fours and 2 sixes, and Harmanpreet's unbeaten 103 off 88 balls, decorated with 9 fours and 3 sixes, India posted an imposing total. These were their seventh and sixth one-day hundreds, respectively.However, South Africa staged a spirited fight back through Kapp's 114 runs off 94 balls, including 11 fours and 3 sixes, and Wolvaardt's unbeaten 135 off 135 balls, with 12 fours and 3 sixes. The pair added 184 runs off 170 balls for the fourth wicket. Despite their valiant efforts, the team could only muster 321 for six.The pitch at Chinnaswamy Stadium stayed true to its character compared to the previous match, requiring Indian bowlers to maintain precise line and length to remain effective. They managed to do so, restricting the South African batsmen by picking wickets at regular intervals.Pacer Arundhati Reddy, replacing Renuka Singh, provided India with a strong start by dismissing Tazmin Brits early on with a delivery that swung in marginally. Mandhana contributed with the ball too, claiming her maiden international wicket by getting Sune Luus caught behind by Richa Ghosh.Wolvaardt and Kapp then came together and exhibited stellar footwork and shot selection to resist the Indian spinners. Kapp, who reached her fifty off 53 balls, was the more aggressive of the duo, marked by her powerful pulls off Pooja Vastrakar.Wolvaardt offered steady support and reached her fifty in 69 balls, hitting a well-timed boundary to mid-wicket off Vastrakar. The duo's partnership accumulated 100 runs for the fourth wicket in 114 balls, with Kapp sweeping left-arm spinner Radha Yadav for a boundary.Despite their measured approach, this partnership also increased the required run rate, which soon climbed past nine and then ten. South Africa needed 103 runs in the last 10 overs, a challenging task even with set batsmen at the crease.Kapp, the enforcer of the partnership, went for a big hit against off-spinner Deepti Sharma but was caught near the boundary by Vastrakar, bringing a crucial stand to an end. Subsequently, Wolvaardt and Nadine de Klerk combined to add 69 runs off 41 balls for the fifth wicket, but it was insufficient as Vastrakar successfully defended 11 runs in the last over.Earlier in the day, Mandhana and Harmanpreet's partnership of 171 runs for the third wicket significantly lifted India's total. Wolvaardt's decision to bowl first seemed justified initially as Ayabonga Khaka and Masabata Klaas found good bounce and movement under overcast conditions.Khaka began with two consecutive maidens, keeping Mandhana and Shafali Verma in check. Mandhana opened her account after 18 balls and was dropped by Khaka on 69 off left-arm spinner Nondumiso Shangase.Post Shafali's dismissal, Mandhana and Dayalan Hemalatha added 62 runs for the second wicket. Hemalatha, who struck two sixes off Shangase, was bowled while attempting a big shot off Klaas.The arrival of skipper Harmanpreet swung the momentum back in India’s favor. The run-rate, initially sluggish at around four, soon soared past five and six runs an over.Mandhana accelerated the scoring by hitting Shangase for three consecutive boundaries, including five fours across six balls, edging closer to her century. Harmanpreet, dropped on 41 by Klaas, quickly found her rhythm and hit Luus to start her scoring.South African bowlers aimed to bowl wide off Mandhana’s off-stump to curb her free-flowing runs but made errors in line that allowed her to capitalize on boundaries. Mandhana reached her century off 103 balls with a single off Luus, and Harmanpreet followed with a boundary off Klaas in the final over.Despite the aggressive fightback by the South African batsmen, India held their nerves to clinch a narrow win in a gripping last-over finish. The home team’s precise bowling and fielding efforts on the day complemented the solid batting performances, ensuring their series victory.",India beat South Africa by four runs to take 2-0 lead in ODI series. Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur hit centuries for India. Laura Wolvaardt and Marizanne Kapp scored centuries for South Africa. India had earlier won by 143 runs in first ODI.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111119627,imgsize-54308,width-400,resizemode-4/111119627.jpg"

Igor Stimac: Irked ex-India coach Igor Stimac threatens to sue AIFF,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/irked-ex-india-coach-igor-stimac-threatens-to-sue-aiff/articleshow/111102558.cms,"Stimac cites unfulfilled promises & contract breaches, calls termination 'unilateral'

BENGALURU: Former India football coach Igor Stimac , who was served a termination notice by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Monday, has called it an ""unilateral termination"" which was ""unprofessional and unethical"". Citing a list of unfulfilled promises and contract breaches by the AIFF , Stimac has threatened to sue the federation if it doesn’t settle his dues for terminating the contract within the next 10 days.""I kindly ask you to immediately, but not later in next ten days, organize payment to me for this termination of the contract without just cause in the amount which will represent a residual value of my employment contract that was prematurely terminated from AIFF side, and all that in connection to the article 6 Annexe 2 of the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players. Otherwise, I will start proceedings against AIFF in front of the competent FIFA Football Tribunal and sue AIFF,"" Stimac said in his email reply, accessed by TOI, to AIFF’s acting secretary general M Satyanarayan.Detailing the promises not kept by the federation, the coach said: ""Instead of improving our travel logistics, it all went from bad to worse. Our president Mr (Kalyan) Chaubey didn’t mind publicly announcing that the team will get charter flights to reach Saudi Arabia before the away game vs Afghanistan, so our fans still think that we have used charter flights to reach there not knowing that we actually travelled three days there and back to India prior to the most important games in our history. The Afghanistan team reached India before us and slept all night while our players travelled 30 hours without sleep after the game in Abha City to reach the venue in Guwahati.""He added: ""We have been left to work without GPS equipment for over 200 days even though we continuously kept reminding you how important this was. India was the only team at the Asian Cup not having GPS equipment.""Stimac said despite the assurance from Chaubey in March this year that the support staff would get their contracts soon, it was still delayed. ""It took you another three months to do so. In the meantime, we have worked without a match analyst for most of the days and without a sport psychologist,"" he said.The coach further said his lawyer will take over any communication with the AIFF. ""I don’t want to speak or hear from AIFF anymore because AIFF has caused me enough health problems with its acts. Your ""show cause notice"" and ""final warning letter"" did stop me from speaking the truth to Indian fans, and it did give me two stents just prior to the AFC Asian Cup, but didn’t stop me from giving it all to my team. I hope India will find a way out of the mess, created not by me or anyone under my leadership in the last few years, and will always be in my heart!""","Former India football coach Igor Stimac was served a termination notice by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Monday.

Lionel Messi takes center stage again for Copa America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/lionel-messi-takes-center-stage-again-for-copa-america/articleshow/111100729.cms,"NEW DELHI: World champions Argentina are set to kick off an expanded Copa America on Thursday, with Lionel Messi aiming to secure a second continental title in what is likely his last appearance in the tournament.The 108-year-old competition, being hosted by the United States, will feature six teams from the CONCACAF region joining the 10 South American nations vying for a spot in the July 14 final in Miami. While FIFA will be closely observing the organization of the event, two years before the World Cup co-hosted by the USA, Canada, and Mexico, the tournament's rich history and prestige ensure it is far more significant than a mere 'trial event'.Argentina have clinched the Copa 15 times, but only once, in 2021, during the Messi era. Coach Lionel Scaloni has largely maintained his World Cup-winning squad, with veterans Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi likely making their final appearances in a major tournament.It remains uncertain whether this marks Messi's farewell to elite international football . The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, now playing in Major League Soccer with Inter Miami, will celebrate his 37th birthday four days after Thursday's opener against Canada in Atlanta. He has yet to decide if he will attempt to play in a record sixth World Cup.""It's great to have records and continue to achieve things but I won't take part in a World Cup just to say I've done six,"" Messi told ESPN last week.""If I feel good and everything is in place for me to be there, fine, but I won't go just to go. It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,"" he added.Lionel Messi, who has carefully managed his workload to reach peak form for the tournament, would undoubtedly cherish the opportunity to secure a third consecutive major title with Argentina after years of disappointment with his national team.Following their match against Canada, Argentina will face Chile in New Jersey and conclude their group A campaign against Peru in Miami. However, they are well aware of the formidable opposition that awaits them in the knockout stage, with rivals Brazil and Uruguay expected to be the main contenders for the title.Brazil has struggled in the CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, having only won two of their first six matches and currently sitting in sixth place in the standings after losses to Uruguay, Colombia, and Argentina.Several familiar names are absent from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad, including Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus, and Thiago Silva , while Richarlison and Neymar are sidelined due to injury.The pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking duo of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo to replicate their club form for the Selecao, and there is much anticipation surrounding the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old prodigy Endrick, who is set to join Real next month from Palmeiras.Uruguay, also 15-time winners, has impressed under their 68-year-old Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has implemented his signature high-energy style and raised expectations with recent victories over Argentina and Brazil. Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez will spearhead the attack, although Bielsa has the option of bringing on veteran Luis Suarez from the bench.Colombia enters the tournament undefeated in over two years, with Liverpool's dynamic winger Luis Diaz posing a constant threat and James Rodriguez experiencing a late-career resurgence. Coach Nestor Lorenzo's team cannot be overlooked.The USA hopes to generate much-needed excitement after losing their way since a respectable run to the last-16 at the World Cup. Coach Gregg Berhalter is under pressure to demonstrate that his team, which relies on Christian Pulisic's intelligent wing play, can compete with teams from outside of CONCACAF.Mexico has frequently participated in the Copa as a guest and reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but they appear to be well below their usual standard, although they can, as always, rely on massive support in the USA.This marks the second time the Copa America is being held in the USA, following the Centenary tournament in 2016. While this deviates from tradition, the presence of significant immigrant communities from all the participating nations should ensure large crowds at the primarily NFL stadiums being utilized.","The 108-year-old competition will feature six teams from the CONCACAF region joining the 10 South American nations vying for a spot in the July 14 final in Miami.

The Scot, who is a two-time Wimbledon champion and five-time Queen's winner, had already shown signs of discomfort during his first-round victory over Alexei Popyrin on Tuesday.As Murray enters what is expected to be his final year on tour, fitness issues continue to plague him, potentially jeopardizing his hopes of making a final appearance at Wimbledon, which is set to begin in less than two weeks.Reflecting on the brief encounter, the 30-year-old Thompson noted, ""I could see he had a problem in the warm-up and then his first serve.""""I thought, 'hit the ball in and make him run'. I actually learned that from him, when he was playing, and if a guy was hurt or cramping or something, he'd always use a drop shot or just try and take it up the line.""He added: ""I learned a lot of things watching him play, so it's an honour to share the court with him, but it's just sad that it ended like that.""","Andy Murray forced to retire after just five games due to injury.

"Not satisfied with Olympics entry, want to win the medal: Sriram Balaji",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/not-satisfied-with-olympics-entry-want-to-win-the-medal-sriram-balaji/articleshow/111120088.cms,"PUNE: It has already been an incredible journey as a professional tennis player for Sriram Balaji .Having started comparatively late at the age of nine in the southern city of Coimbatore, the 34-year-old Balaji is now on the cusp of playing in the Olympics — as Grand Slam champion Rohan Bopanna ’s doubles partner in Paris.Only Nirupama Sanjeev from the city known for its textile and auto industry has wielded the racquet for India at the Summer Games before.Yet, Balaji has come a long way, so much so that he is not ready to be satisfied by simply turning up in India colours, but go all the way and fetch the coveted medal.“Last year I played couple of slams. I did have the game, but was not sharp enough. The last couple of months I have been playing much better tennis. Earlier I would question myself, now I believe in myself much more, my confidence level has gone up. Right now, I am not getting satisfied (with) just making the entry, I want to win the medal,” Balaji, world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles, said.Balaji conceded playing in the Olympics had not been his goal until recently.“It is truly dream come true for me, thanks to Bops (Bopanna). Yuki (Bhambri) is 10 spots ahead of me in rankings,” said Balaji.“When I started, wanted to take it step by step. First the Under-14s (for India), then the Davis Cup. Olympics was not in my thoughts.""The right-hander who began his tennis journey at Perks Tennis School near his home in Coimbatore under the guidance of Elango Ranganathan, whose daughter Madura was a women’s pro.The first major step-up for Balaji was moving to Chennai at the age of 16 and beginning to work Hiten Joshi and Ilyas Hussain.“They (Joshi and Hussain) told me 'don't play juniors' … so I started playing the men’s (circuit). I earned my first ATP ranking point when I was 16. They were the ones who put me on to (Alexander) Waske (in Germany),” he said.Moving base to Europe was another steep learning curve for the Tamil Nadu lad as he had to adapt fast to the difference in culture and tennis.“It was totally different. My ranking was 800 but I was not even getting into qualifying (of ITF men's events),” Balaji said.“That's how tough it was, the standard was very high. It took me one year (to start winning) ... I lost all my matches. I went there in 2010, it was only in 2011 summer that I started getting into qualifying and winning.“It was also mentally very difficult. It makes you think, 'what am I doing here?' I got a lot of help from the coaches and my parents. They never let me down. They pushed me, they believed in me.”Balaji encountered another speed bump a few years later when his game began to stagnate at between 300 and 400 in world rankings. He was at a crossroads and needed to choose his path — continue to pursue success in singles or switch to doubles.“I did have limitations in my game. It was 2017 and I had to make a choice. That was also my best year,” he said of winning nine doubles titles, including his maiden Challenger, with Vishnu Vardhan .The preceding year the duo had won seven ITF titles.“My belief in singles was less. I believed I could get to top-200, but to get inside top-100 ... I could see that I had limitations, and I knew that in doubles I was capable of top-50.“So the choice was whether to go for top-200 in singles or top-20 in doubles. I chose top-20 doubles.”Almost immediately his ambitions suffered a setback as Vardhan decided to stop playing full schedule.“I didn't have a set partner after that. Every four-five weeks I had a different partner. In 2022, I started playing with Jeevan, in 2023 we did well and then he wanted to take a break,” Balaji said.But the tide began to turn when he started forging a partnership last year with Andre Begemann, a 39-year-old German who had ranked 36 in 2015 and won four ATP Tour titles.The Indo-German combination won three Challengers with Balaji getting into the top-100 in rankings for the first time and Begemann returning to the elite bracket too.“Both of us play in the German league, so I knew him already. It is only in the slams I play with a different partner since we don't get in. Otherwise in Challengers I play with Andre,” said Balaji who had beaten Rajeev Ram and Scott Lipsky in the company of Jeeven Nedunchezhiyan at the Chennai ATP Tour event in 2012.Balaji credited the ‘Doubles Dream of India’ programme for supporting the top-200 ranked players in the country.“It makes a lot of difference. Having a coach through the whole year is not affordable, especially with the less prize money in doubles,” he said.“Someone watching from outside can tell you what you cannot absorb when you are playing.“Providing a coach and a trainer during the matches in doubles, you don't find that in many countries. We have eight players in the top-200 ... without this (programme), players would have a lot of struggle.”This year’s French Open was a sort of dress rehearsal for the Olympics tennis competition, which will be held at the Roland Garros.Balaji had made it to the second round last year, and went one step further this year in tandem with Mexican Miguel-Angel Reyes-Varela. The pair lost to none other than Bopanna and Aussie Matthew Ebden.The fortnight proved to be a rewarding one in many ways for the Indian.“I was not in the tournament to begin with, we were sixth out,” Balaji said.“Rohan also has been mentoring me, telling which tournaments I should be playing. This time I told him I want to come to Paris, it's ok if I miss a Challenger.“I decided I was going to take my chances and signed in. The other thing is you also get to practise with the top players during the Grand Slam.“Finally we got in, thanks to the (inclement) weather also, as the singles players pulled out.”The match against the Australian Open winners in the third round was a difficult one but also brought out the best in Balaji and Begemann.“It was not an easy match, it was really hard (to play against Bopanna),” Balaji said.“I look up to him, he is like a mentor to me. I felt I handled it well.”",Sriram Balaji is on the cusp of playing in the Olympics as Rohan Bopanna’s doubles partner in Paris. The 34-year-old is world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles.

The decision, driven by concerns over potential injury risks, highlights the demanding physical challenges faced by professional athletes navigating a packed tournament calendar across diverse playing surfaces.Jabeur's withdrawal centres on the Olympic tournament's utilization of clay courts, the same surface used for the French Open .Having concluded her clay court season earlier this month with a quarter-final appearance at the French Open, the world no. 10 is currently transitioning to grass court competitions, followed by the hard courts of the US Open shortly after the Olympics This rapid succession of surface transitions poses a significant challenge for athletes. Adapting to the unique characteristics of each surface – clay's slow bounce and high friction, grass's low bounce and speed, and hard court's medium bounce and pace – requires significant physical adjustments. These adjustments impact movement patterns, footwork, and the strain placed on various muscle groups, particularly the knees.Jabeur, in consultation with her medical team, determined that subjecting her body to such a rapid transition, particularly after an already demanding clay court season, would significantly increase the risk of injury to her knee.""After consulting with my medical team regarding attending the Olympics in Paris we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardise the rest of my season,"" Jabeur wrote on social media.""I have always loved representing my country in any competition. However, I must listen to my body,"" she added.While representing Tunisia in the Olympics holds immense personal significance for Jabeur, as evidenced by her participation in three previous Games, prioritizing her physical well-being is paramount to ensure continued success throughout the season and beyond. Jabeur will be seen plying her trade in Wimbledon starting on July 1, 2024.","Tunisian tennis star Ons Jabeur has announced her withdrawal from the 2024 Paris Olympics.
