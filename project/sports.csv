NEW DELHI: At the tender age of 18, Saurabh Netravalkar 's fervent aspiration was to represent India at the pinnacle of international cricket . Although that dream remained unfulfilled, at 32, he now finds himself presented with an extraordinary opportunity to bowl against his nation of birth at the prestigious Twenty20 World Cup.When the teams clash on Wednesday at Long Island's Nassau County International Stadium, a billion ardent cricket enthusiasts back in India will be watching the left-arm United States pacer with bated breath.Indian broadcaster Star Sports has already commenced promoting the encounter as an epic showdown between Mumbai-born Netravalkar and another U.S. player of Indian lineage, Alabama-born Nosthush Kenjige , pitted against India's illustrious batters Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli .Despite being the tournament favorite, India will approach the match with cautious optimism, having witnessed the U.S. orchestrate a stunning upset in world cricket by vanquishing Pakistan on Thursday.Netravalkar did indeed showcase his skills at the junior level for India. He was among the select group of 15 players who proudly donned the Indian colors at the Under-19 World Cup in 2009-10, alongside the likes of KL Rahul, who emerged as the most prominent name from that squad. Mayank Agarwal, Harshal Patel, Jaydev Unadkat, and Mandeep Singh also went on to make their mark on the international stage and secured lucrative Indian Premier League contracts.For most Indian youngsters, achieving such heights in cricket is the ultimate aspiration. However, when those dreams remain unfulfilled, the majority find themselves grappling with the absence of a contingency plan.Netravalkar, on the other hand, had a well-defined strategy in place.With unwavering determination, he embarked on a journey to the U.S., where he pursued a master's degree in computer engineering at the prestigious Cornell University in 2015.A decade later, Netravalkar's prowess with the ball propelled his team to a thrilling Super Over victory against former champions Pakistan.Similarly, Kenjige's path to success was paved with challenges. Despite failing to secure a contract in a local T20 league in Karnataka, India, he ventured to the U.S. to further his education while nurturing his cricketing ambitions. His perseverance paid off as Kenjige claimed three crucial wickets against Pakistan, showcasing his crafty left-arm spin.American batter Aaron Jones charted a slightly different course. He honed his skills in Barbados, playing alongside West Indies stalwarts Nicholas Pooran and Jason Holder before making his way north to spearhead the U.S. charge.Jones set the tournament ablaze on opening day, amassing a scintillating 94 off a mere 40 deliveries as the U.S. effortlessly chased down Canada's formidable total of 194.India and the U.S. currently sit atop Group A, having secured two victories apiece.The U.S. requires just one more win in its remaining two fixtures—against India and Ireland—to cement its place in the Super Eight. Such an achievement would mark a significant milestone for the sport in the country and wholly vindicate the ICC's bold decision to grant co-hosting rights to the U.S..India, on the other hand, is acutely aware that one more victory will guarantee its progression to the next round.","Saurabh Netravalkar and Nosthush Kenjige will face each other at the T20 World Cup.

When India take the field on Wednesday, there will be some familiar faces in the USA camp. For example, Suryakumar Yadav will square up against his age-group Mumbai teammate Saurabh Netravalkar, while Rishabh Pant will have a chance to catch up with Delhi's Milind Kumar , who has seen Pant grow at the Sonnet Club.USA's competitive show in the ongoing T20 World Cup - which has seen them become surprise table-toppers with India - has caught everyone's attention.This American cricket dream started taking shape in 2020-21. While the squad still has players like Netravalkar, who started out as amateurs in the US circuit, it was the influx of professionals through Major League Cricket (MLC) and mushrooming local tournaments that raised the level of cricket.This was despite the infrastructure being nowhere close to professional standards. ""In 2020-21, a lot of us who were still playing first-class cricket in our respective countries were offered contracts by MLC to move to the USA and earn a living as cricket professionals,"" Milind told TOI from New York.Milind, who hit a century for Delhi on his Ranji Trophy debut in 2011, had recorded the highest number of runs in a Ranji season while playing for Sikkim after falling out of favour with Delhi. He now represents the Texas Super Kings team in the MLC.The likes of Unmukt Chand, Harmeet Singh and New Zealand's Smit Patel also moved at the same time. Corey Anderson from New Zealand and Sami Aslam from Pakistan were other big names to also shift base.For these cricketers, it was a jump into the unknown. MLC was yet to be launched. They were allotted teams in different states to play in the Minor League Cricket . The deal was simple. They were awarded visas on terms that they would be working for the development of cricket in the US. The base price of a contract was $50,000 a year.""We work at academies around the country. When we are not playing, we are coaching. Most of the kids have origins in the Indian subcontinent. We are not allowed to take up any other job. This is our job. When we moved here, we never thought about playing a World Cup for USA. But things happened and we have enjoyed our time here,"" Milind said.Professionalism is still a distant goal. The minor league is played in makeshift grounds which are mostly public parks. There is no concept of a coaching staff in those teams and playing XIs are largely picked by the promoters of the clubs.How did this competitive edge come into their cricket, which saw them rout Bangladesh in the lead up to the World Cup before defeating Pakistan? Milind laughed: ""We know these Pakistani players very well. We play with them.""He added: ""A lot of short private tournaments are played here. The promoters have been bringing active international cricketers like Mohammed Amir, Azam Khan , Shai Hope, Oshane Thomas and Martin Guptill to play in these tournaments for a few years. Playing with international players is not new to us. Azam is a good friend. We have learned so much from them.""According to Milind, there's now a certain awareness about the sport. Cricket gear and equipment is easily available, curators around the country have started understanding the art of making a pitch. But he asserted that there's no culture of pleasing the bigger names to get into the USA team.""Even Anderson has had to earn his spot. Aslam, who had played for Pakistan, was not picked because he didn't perform as well. The country has just two stadiums but it seems like a good beginning,"" Milind said.","USA's competitive show in the ongoing T20 World Cup has caught everyone's attention. American cricket dream started taking shape in 2020-21.

NEW DELHI: The United States national cricket team has already made a significant impact in the game's hierarchy by defeating Pakistan last week at the 2024 T20 World Cup , a remarkable feat considering the sport's relative obscurity in America compared to the fervor it generates in countries like England, where it originated.Cricket, with its unique terminology and gameplay, bears a passing resemblance to baseball, but the differences are stark, from the purposeful bouncing of the ball by the pitcher to the scoring of runs.This year, the United States is witnessing the sport up close as the T20 World Cup unfolds across various venues in New York, Texas, Florida, and the Caribbean. The U.S. team, with a history dating back to at least 1844, is set to face India on Wednesday in Long Island, a match that will likely draw a passionate crowd from the South Asian diaspora.Despite the expected support for India, the American team , comprising players with roots in cricket hotbeds such as India, Pakistan, South Africa, and the Caribbean, remains undaunted. Aaron Jones , the team's top batter, expressed excitement at the prospect of playing against the best in the world, including Indian stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma .""I think the crowd will be supporting both teams, to be honest,"" Jones said Tuesday. ""We have a lot of Indian players on our team as well. So, I think the crowd will be supporting both teams.""The United States' victory against Pakistan was unexpected, but it has positioned them well in the tournament. A win against India would further solidify their standing, but even a loss would not eliminate them from contention. The team's focus remains on the match at hand, with the goal of advancing to the Super 8 stage of the competition.""With cricket being one of the biggest sports in the world, it’s only a matter of time before the majority of people come on board as it relates to American born and raised people,"" Jones said. ""I think America is a place where people love sports and obviously this World Cup is going to open the eyes of a lot of people, and then in a few years obviously with cricket being in the Olympics, that’s a very big thing as well.""As cricket gains momentum in the United States, with its inclusion in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and the establishment of the Major League Cricket professional circuit, the sport is poised for a resurgence in the country.The T20 World Cup serves as a platform to showcase the talent and potential of the U.S. team, and their success could be instrumental in garnering support and enthusiasm for cricket among American-born and raised individuals.","The United States national cricket team has already made a significant impact in the game's hierarchy.

NEW YORK: The difficult part has been dealt with. India's first hurdle - qualification to the Super8s - looks like a formality now.The win against Pakistan on Sunday at the Nassau County ground underlined the depth that this Indian team has, and on paper, the Wednesday game against minnows USA shouldn't be a matter of concern.But is it that straight-forward? There's a little bit more to this United States team that we knew of. It's a group built around players who might have dreamt that one day they would play for India. For the likes of Saurabh Netrawalkar , Monank Patel, Nitish Kumar or Harmeet Singh, their primary goal might not have been successful. But the land of opportunities has given them a second chance and it seems all of them are determined to make the most of it.A USA victory against Pakistan in Dallas a few days ago was one of the biggest upsets of the tournament so far and now there's suddenly a bit more in the offing. When the tournament started, they wouldn't have given themselves a chance to make the Super-8s, but now it is a realistic possibility. Two more points will help them seal that trip to West Indies, but for a team that is not used to winning, the fear of the finish line sometimes becomes the biggest impediment.Against India though, they're not supposed to win and that should unshackle them just a little bit. Add to that the pitch at the Nassau County ground, where anything is possible.After the low-scoring rollercoaster that was the India-Pakistan game, the drop-in pitch at the new venue made Bangladesh on Monday appear way more threatening against South Africa than they would have seemed in flatter conditions, even though the Proteas were finally able to deal with the challenge.For the likes of USA pacers Ali Khan, a former Kolkata Knight Riders player, Nosthush Kenjige or Netravalkar, winning the toss may open up a great chance to test the Indian greats.USA's biggest test will come if the toss goes against them. The Indian pace quartet - led by the magnificent Jasprit Bumrah - has too much variety and quality in its arsenal for the hosts, especially on a helpful pitch. ""USA looked very well-organised and the way they stood up to that Pakistan attack in Dallas, one of the best bowling units at the World Cup, you have to give them huge kudos. They will now look to cash in on this result and they can absolutely reach the Super 8s,"" former West Indian opener Chris Gayle wrote in his column for ICC.But all this talk around the USA shouldn't really worry the Indian team, who took a deserved break on Monday and turned up for an optional training session on match eve. The team would ideally prefer Virat Kohli and Shivam Dube to hit a bit of form. While Kohli has batted in both games so far at the most difficult times and the practice sessions suggest that it is a matter of time before he comes good, time might be running out for Dube.India have come here with certain plans and now that the Pakistan game is out of the way, skipper Rohit Sharma's aim will be to fine-tune those rough edges so that the machine runs smoothly when it matters most.",India's first hurdle - qualification to the Super8s - looks like a formality now.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Saleem Malik has made allegations against all-rounder Imad Wasim , claiming that he intentionally wasted deliveries during the T20 World Cup match against India. Pakistan, chasing a modest target of 120 runs, fell short by 7 runs, ending their innings at 113 for 7.The team consumed an astonishing 59 dot balls during their chase. Wasim scored only 15 runs in 23 balls with the help of one boundary.In response to these accusations, Australia legend Adam Gilchrist took a swipe at the notion of accusing a player of deliberately underperforming in a match that resulted in a loss.""A bunch of ex-Pakistan cricketers haven't missed their teams, at all.

High hopes of qualification to the third round of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers for the first time have almost evaporated after India picked up just two points from their last two games against lower-ranked Afghanistan (draw away, loss at home), and a home draw against Kuwait last week.A win would have provided the perfect ending to Chhetri’s stellar international career and taken India to the third round. Instead, to be certain of booking their spot in the next round, India are now faced with an uphill task of winning the concluding group clash against Asian champions Qatar at the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Doha on Tuesday.India are tied on five points with Afghanistan. Kuwait are one adrift, but India have a superior goal difference. A win will be enough, but given that Stimac’s side have not scored a single open-field goal in seven matches, three points against Qatar seems like a difficult ask.“We are trying not to think about Sunil not being there,” Stimac said at the pre-match media interaction. “This is such an important game. There are 90 minutes ahead of us, a fantastic opportunity to make Indians across the world happy. We will die on the pitch, if needed.”Having already made it to the next round, Qatar did not pick a host of star players in their squad, instead opting for several under-23 players. They were held goalless by Afghanistan with a stubborn performance.Stimac could probably draw some hope from Afghanistan’s performance.

NEW DELHI: A Spanish court has handed down prison sentences to a trio of Valencia supporters for their involvement in racist abuse directed at Real Madrid 's Vinicius Jr .The court's announcement revealed that the three individuals were given eight-month jail terms for committing hate crimes against the player. This landmark ruling marks the first time in Spain that anyone has been convicted for hurling racist insults within a football stadium.""The ruling handed down today, which is final, establishes as proven that the three defendants insulted Vinicius with shouts, gestures and chants referring to the colour of his skin,"" the court said in a statement.""These shouts and gestures of a racist nature, consisting among other things in the repetition of the sounds and imitating the movements of monkeys, caused the footballer feelings of frustration, shame and humiliation, with the consequent undermining of his intrinsic dignity.""In Spain, individuals who are convicted of non-violent offences and receive prison sentences shorter than two years are unlikely to serve time behind bars, provided they have no prior convictions.As a result, the trio is expected to remain out of custody unless they engage in additional criminal activities.The supporters, having admitted to the offences, were handed a two-year ban from attending football matches and were also required to cover the expenses associated with the legal proceedings.""This ruling is great news for the fight against racism in Spain as it repairs the damage suffered by Vinicius Jr and sends a clear message to those people who go to a football stadium to insult that LaLiga will identify them, report them and there will be criminal consequences for them,"" LaLiga president Javier Tebas said.In May previous year, a league match at Valencia's Mestalla stadium was marred by a disturbing incident. Vinicius, a Black Brazilian forward, was subjected to racist slurs throughout the game. The abhorrent behavior displayed by some individuals in the crowd was deeply troubling and unacceptable.The incident sparked a wave of support for Vinicius from various quarters. People from all walks of life came together to condemn the racist abuse and stand in solidarity with the young player. The outpouring of support was a testament to the collective desire to combat racism and promote equality in sports and society as a whole.""During the hearing, the defendants read a letter of apology to Vinicius Jr, LaLiga and Real Madrid,"" LaLiga said in a statement on Monday.Real Madrid said the defendants had shown repentance and, in their letter, had ""asked fans that all traces of racism and intolerance should be banished from sporting competitions.""""Real Madrid, which together with Vinicius Jr has acted as private prosecutor in these proceedings, will continue to work to protect the values of our club and to eradicate any racist behaviour in the world of football and sport,"" the club added in a statement.Vinicius, at the age of 23, played a crucial role in Real Madrid's successful campaign, securing both the LaLiga title and the Champions League trophy. His outstanding performance earned him the prestigious title of Champions League's player of the season.Additionally, he is considered a top contender for the Ballon d'Or award, which recognizes the world's best player and will be presented in October.Over the course of the last two seasons, LaLiga has reported a total of sixteen instances of racist abuse directed towards Vinicius to Spanish prosecutors.""In March, Vinicius broke down in tears at a press conference and said he was struggling to stay motivated and enjoy playing football due to the recurring abuse, urging Spanish authorities to take action.""""People should know that this type of act is punishable, punishable as a hate crime, because the conviction is for crimes against moral integrity but with the aggravating circumstance of hatred,"" state prosecutor Susana Gisbert told reporters.In a recent incident, German Burgos, an analyst for the Spanish television network Movistar Plus+, was dismissed from his position. This decision came after both Barcelona and Paris St Germain declined to provide interviews to the network, following a remark made by Burgos about Lamine Yamal, a Barcelona player. The comment was perceived as racist in nature.During the same month, LaLiga took action against Atletico Madrid and Getafe, mandating partial closures of their stadiums. This disciplinary measure was in response to incidents of racist and xenophobic abuse that occurred during a match between the two teams.Additionally, a third-division encounter between Rayo Majadahonda and Sestao River was halted when Cheikh Kane Sarr, the Senegalese goalkeeper for Rayo, confronted an opposing fan who he accused of subjecting him to racial abuse.",A Spanish court has handed down prison sentences to a trio of Valencia supporters for their involvement in racist abuse directed at Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr. The three individuals were given eight-month jail terms for committing hate crimes against the player.

Her best performance at the grass-court major has been reaching the third round.In her upcoming match at the tournament in s'Hertogenbosch, Osaka will face either Bernarda Pera of the United States or Suzan Lamens, a Dutch player.Throughout the match, Osaka seemed at ease, grooving to the music during changeovers. She also appeared to engage in lighthearted conversation with her support team seated in the stands, showcasing a relaxed demeanor on the court.""I tried to play every point as well as I can and hopefully that will take me further and further. I guess I'm really happy... It was a really nice atmosphere,"" she said.Osaka, participating in just her second Grand Slam tournament since the birth of her daughter in July of the previous year, came incredibly close to unseating Iga Swiatek during their second-round encounter at the French Open .Despite Osaka's valiant effort, Swiatek, the world's top-ranked player, managed to secure her third consecutive championship at Roland Garros. However, it was Osaka who presented Swiatek with the most formidable challenge she encountered throughout her campaign on the clay courts.""My match against Iga was really amazing for me even to play. I just need to play tighter matches like that because I felt like I was playing well,"" she said.","Naomi Osaka defeated Elise Mertens 6-2, 6-4 in the second round of the Libema Open in s'Hertogenbosch.

French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz says he has the game for all surfaces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/french-open-champion-carlos-alcaraz-says-he-has-the-game-for-all-surfaces/articleshow/110892230.cms,"The only defense Carlos Alcaraz knows is all-out attack. The 21-year-old sets up points, creates openings, and goes for high-risk shots; the stage of the match if he’s leading or trailing is irrelevant. Drop shots that skim the net, racy winners that go around the pole and outrageous forehands. He can run a marathon and win a sprint.The Spaniard plays every shot in the book and thinks up new ones on the run. He smiles during matches, sometimes dazzled by his own brilliance, other times in disbelief. An expression that says, why? Not really.Alcaraz, who won his third Grand Slam title on Sunday, his first at Roland Garros , is 11-1 in five-set matches. Against Alexander Zverev in the final of the French Open and world No.1 Jannik Sinner in the semifinals, Alcaraz motored from a 1-2 deficit in sets, not by keeping the ball in play, but by going for his shots. And like his last two opponents, Alcaraz was also running on reserve in the fourth and fifth sets, but he understood the only way he was crossing that finish line first was by winning it, not waiting for it.“He’s a beast. He’s an animal,” Zverev said of the 21-year-old. “The intensity he plays with is different to other people.”Alcaraz’s long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero talks as fast as the Spaniard charges the court, the duo is quite the vibe. Ferrero hurls instructions at the dynamo in the middle that leaves one wondering if he’s actually reminding Alcaraz of the defense they may have practiced a 1000 times.“I’m trying just to be aggressive, to go for it, play my style -- go to the net, dropshots, hitting big shots,” said Alcaraz . “If I lose it, if I miss it, my feelings are really good. If I lose, it doesn’t matter if I miss it, because when I go for it, the feelings are much better than if I go defensive and lose. My team is telling me to go for it.”Alcaraz is at No.2 in the rankings now which spreads the field for the new guard at Wimbledon, with Sinner and Alcaraz likely bookending the draw.“My game suits very well for every surface because I practice it (like that),” Alcaraz said. “I wanted to develop my style of being aggressive all the time, practicing the defense and all that stuff...but my main goal is being aggressive as much as I can. On grass, I have to play like that almost every time, but on all surfaces too.”Alcaraz — the youngest man to win a Grand Slam on three different surfaces after his triumphs on hard courts at the 2022 US Open and grass at 2023 Wimbledon – put a number against his achievements.“Obviously winning the US Open, when I reached for the first time the No. 1 ranking, is something that I dreamt of since I started playing tennis , getting my first Grand Slam was pretty special,” Alcaraz said. “But the way that I won Wimbledon, beating Novak Djokovic in five sets, has been a great achievement for me.”“Right now, lifting the Roland Garros trophy, knowing everything that I have been through the last month with the injuries...” he said. “Probably this one is the moment that I’m really proud of myself, because of everything that I have done the last month just to be ready for this tournament with my team. It has been really difficult for me.”“So I’m going to say that this one, Roland Garros,” he said, looking up at the packed media room, “is the one I’m most proud about.""","Carlos Alcaraz is the youngest man to win a Grand Slam on three different surfaces.

NEW DELHI: The Indian women's hockey team continued its streak of consecutive losses in the FIH Pro League , succumbing to Germany 2-4 on Saturday, marking their seventh consecutive defeat in the tournament. Despite a strong start, with Sunelita Toppo and Deepika scoring impressive field goals in the first quarter, the Harendra Singh-coached side could not maintain their advantage.Sunelita (9th minute) and Deepika (15th minute) provided India with a morale-boosting 2-0 lead, but this was soon nullified by Germany's Viktoria Huse, who converted penalty corners in the 23rd and 32nd minutes to equalize.Germany then took the lead when Stinne Kurz converted a penalty corner in the 51st minute, followed by Jule Bleuel scoring a field goal in the 55th minute, furthering India's woes.This latest defeat follows a series of losses where India was defeated in all four matches against Belgium and Argentina in Antwerp last month, and subsequently by Germany (1-3) and Great Britain (2-3) last weekend.Determined to end their losing streak, India started the match energetically, with Lalremsiami making significant plays in the initial minutes. The veteran forward created space and took a powerful shot, which German goalkeeper Julia Sonntag saved at the last moment.The Indian midfield set up a perfect pass for an unmarked Sunelita in the ninth minute, allowing the teenager to score and give world No.5 India an early lead. Deepika then demonstrated her skill by intercepting the ball in midfield, advancing with Vandana Katariya, and finishing with a goal just before the end of the first quarter.However, Germany's penalty-corner specialist Viktoria Huse struck twice, once in the second quarter and again in the third, to level the score. Although Deepika made several promising runs into the circle in the second half, she couldn't convert them into goals.The final quarter saw complete domination by the German forwards, who launched a series of attacks that overwhelmed the Indian defense.India will face Great Britain in their final Pro League match on Sunday, hoping to break their string of losses.","India's women's hockey team continued its streak of consecutive losses in the FIH Pro League, succumbing to Germany 2-4 on Saturday.

"After Tokyo setback, Amit Panghal banking on both skills and luck to win in Paris",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/boxing/after-tokyo-setback-amit-panghal-banking-on-both-skills-and-luck-to-win-in-paris/articleshow/110741356.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Amit Panghal had never put much faith in the concept of fate until he faced a disappointing defeat at the Tokyo Olympics and the ensuing hardships. As he navigated through this difficult period, Panghal came to the realisation that in order to secure a medal at the Paris Games, he would require not only his remarkable abilities but also a touch of ""kismet"" or luck.""After the Tokyo Olympics I have started believing in kismet,"" Panghal told PTI on Wednesday.Panghal, a name once synonymous with excellence in Indian boxing , found himself at the peak of his career, adorned with gold medals from the Asian Games and Asian Championships. His crowning achievement was a historic silver at the World Championships, making him the sole Indian male boxer to attain such a feat.His exceptional performances propelled him to the coveted world number one ranking in his weight category, establishing him as a strong contender for an Olympic medal.However, fate had a different plan in store for Panghal. His Olympic aspirations were shattered following a devastating pre-quarterfinal exit. To add to his woes, he lost his position in the national team based on the Boxing Federation of India 's evaluation system, which was formulated by the then High Performance Director, Bernard Dunne.The constant rejections dealt a severe blow to Panghal's self-assurance, causing him to doubt his own capabilities and question his future in the sport he once dominated.""Jo humare foreign coaches unka muh dekh kar toh nahi lag raha tha mere samay aayega par kismat mein hota hai toh sabko milta hai (Looking at our coaches' faces, I did not feel that my time would come. But you get what is written in your destiny),"" Panghal said.During this challenging phase, his coach, Anil Dhankar, played a pivotal role in motivating him.""Acha toh kya hi lagega uss time. Jab aapko khelna hain aur khelne hi nahi diya jaa raha hai. (How would you feel fine when you want to play and you're not being allowed to do so).""However, his time eventually arrived. After Deepak Bhoria failed to secure a quota in the 51kg category after two attempts, Panghal was selected for the final qualifying event.This opportunity represented his first and only chance to qualify for the Olympics, and he seized it with aplomb. In Paris, he will undoubtedly be eager to exorcise the ghosts of a disappointing Tokyo Games.""Feeling quite good,"" Panghal said half-heartedly when asked how was the feeling.After enduring a challenging few years, the reserved southpaw, who has secured medals in all major events except the Olympics, has emerged as a firm believer in ""kismet"".""There was no pressure of going into the qualifiers. I was a little scared in the beginning because it was a big tournament.""I was also scared that a head butt doesn't happen. Whenever I go to play after a long time I am scared that it will happen. It was also the last shot to win a quota.""With rare participation in international events over the last three years, Panghal had to address numerous aspects of his game, especially considering that he learned about his selection barely a month before the event.""I worked on everything. I worked on rest, the rest between bouts. And on endurance, because I had not gone to competitions in a while. I was only training and power and strength doesn't come only in training, and you have to compete as well.""I got to know less than one month before the tournament that I have been selected to play. I did not know if I'd be able to go. I used to be involved in training.""Panghal and Nishant Dev (71kg) are the sole two Indian male boxers who have secured a spot for the Paris Olympics .","Amit Panghal believes in ""kismet"" after a disappointing defeat at the Tokyo Olympics.
