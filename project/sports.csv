Royal Challengers Bengaluru registered their fifth straight win to improve their IPL playoff hopes with a 47-run thrashing of Delhi Capitals on Sunday.We look at the chances of the teams in contention: KKR have a 62.5% chance of finishing sole toppers and a 87.5% chance of finishing at least joint toppers, The worst they can do is tied for second with one other team ( SRH ). RR despite the loss on Sunday have a 12.5% chance of finishing sole toppers and a 37.5% chance of finishing joint toppers. The worst they can do is tied for third with two other teams ( CSK and LSG ), which means they could still theoretically fail to qualify.Third placed CSK have a nearly 91% chance of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly. Their best case scenario is tied for second with one to three other teams.SRH have a nearly 97% chance of making it to the top four slots on points, but only a 3% chance of tying for third spot with two other teams (KKR and RR). RCB , now in fifth place, have a better than 40% chance of making it to the top four on points. The best they can do, however, is tied for third spot with three to five other teams. The good news for them is that they currently have the best net run rate among all of those.Sixth placed DC have a 31.3% chance of making it to the top four slots on points, singly or jointly. Their best case scenario is tied for third with three to five other teams.Seventh placed LSG have a little over 56% chance of making it to the top four on points thanks to the extra game in hand. Their best case scenario is tied for second with one to three other teams.Eighth placed GT have a less than 16% chance of making it to the top four on points. Their best case scenario is tied for third with four or five other teams and their net run rate at the moment does not make that an attractive prospect.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru registered their fifth straight win to improve their IPL playoff hopes with a 47-run thrashing of Delhi Capitals on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: That MS Dhoni has a legendary stature in India is an open secret. And in Chennai, home of the Chennai Super Kings , the former captain is revered as a demi-god. CSK ended their home league stage in IPL 2024 with a five-wicket victory against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.Speculation was rife that Dhoni may have played his last match at the Chepauk with rumours going around that this may be his last IPL season.But Dhoni, as always, is keeping his cards close to his chest and hasn't yet spilled the beans on his retirement and there is no doubt that an ear will end once ' Thala ' decides to call it quits.The official broadcaster of the tournament shared a video of Navjot Singh Sidhu in which the former cricketer-turned-commentator salutes the legendary status of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in his typical style.In the video Sidhu says, ""The world bows to the strong, not to the weak. It's the thoughts that count. Thoughts can make humans god or demon. All the miracles in the world are of thoughts. Your thoughts are the real interpreters of your actions."". And when he will retire from the game, an era will end. It's rare that mothers give birth to a great man and the stature of that great man grows and spreads like a cult, the legend grows, it happens every second. And the world always remembers great people like an institution. Mortals like me will come and go but an institution like Dhoni will continue to inspire generations to come and will be immortalized,"" Sidhu adds.Defending champions CSK rose to the third spot with the victory over the Royals and are in the running to make the playoffs and ended their highly successful home leg, winning five out of their seven matches at the Chepauk.",CSK ended their home league stage in IPL 2024 with a five-wicket victory against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: A light-hearted banter between players always eases nerves. And when the banter is between India players who are international stars, it's more pleasing to the eyes.Playoffs berth are at stake for both Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Delhi Capitals but that didn't stop the Delhi boys Virat Kohli and Ishant Sharma having a go at each other during their IPL match at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Sunday.First Kohli hit Ishant for a four and a six, but the pacer had his revenge by dismissing the former captain and even tugged at Kohli who just smiled back.Later during the 19th over of the DC innings, Kohli teased back Ishant and even the commentators enjoyed the moment to the hilt.Former cricketers-turned-commentators Navjot Singh Sidhu and Mohammad Kaif made some hilarious comments in Hindi during the friendly exchange between Virat and Ishant, that can be heard in a viral video.Sidhu says, ""First tell me who's the camel and who's the mountain? It looks like a kid is looking at a huge mountain,(referring to Ishant, who is well over six feet).""Kaif responds, ""A tall man always has to lower his eyes to talk and the smaller one has to raise his head high.""Sidhu continues, amidst the laughter in the commentary box, ""He (Virat Kohli) may be small in height but his stature is as big as the Mount Everest, there is no one bigger than him.""The friendship of Virat and Ishant goes back a long way. They have played for Delhi in the Ranji Trophy together for many years and Ishant has also played under Virat when he was Team India captain.With a 47-run win over DC, RCB rose to the fifth spot in the points table keeping their slim hopes of reaching the playoffs alive.",Playoffs berth at stake for Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Delhi Capitals.

"RCB vs DC, IPL 2024 Highlights: Rajat Patidar fifty, gritty bowlers keep RCB in playoff race",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rcb-vs-dc-ipl-2024-highlights-rajat-patidar-fifty-gritty-bowlers-keep-rcb-in-playoff-race/articleshow/110060392.cms,"NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru kept their playoff dreams intact through Rajat Patidar 's blazing fifty and a strong-willed effort from the bowlers, who set up the hosts' 47-run victory over Delhi Capitals in the IPL on Sunday.The target of 188 was not insurmountable, but the Capitals' chase descended into disarray once they lost four wickets inside 3.3 overs upfront, eventually finishing at 140, with Axar Patel 57 (39b, 5x4, 3x6) playing a lone hand.RCB now have 12 points from 13 matches – same as the Capitals – and need a win against Chennai Super Kings in the last league match here on May 18 to push their case for a playoff berth.The Capitals also need a win in their final league game against Lucknow Super Giants on May 14 to stay in the hunt.Cutting back to the match, Impact Player David Warner, who missed the action for close to a month due to a wrist injury, slog-swept left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh into the waiting hands of Will Jacks at deep.The dismissal flagged off Capitals' train of disaster. Left-arm pacer Yash Dayal (3/20) consumed Abhishek Porel, caught at covers by Lockie Ferguson, in the first ball of the third over.Delhi suffered a body blow in the very next ball. The in-form Jack-Fraser McGurk, who smashed Mohammed Siraj for two fours and a six in the second over, backed up too far as Shai Hope's straight drive rattled the stumps after taking a deflection of Dayal's outstretched left-hand.Siraj trapped Kumar Kushagra, who came in for the suspended Rishabh Pant, plumb in front with a nip-backer as DC slumped to 30 for four.Axar and Hope (29, 23b) added 56 runs for the fifth wicket off 36 balls but the partnership offered only temporary relief than any real hope to the visitors.Axar, who took over the reins of DC in the absence of Pant, played a handy innings, but it just delayed the inevitable.The rest of the DC batters were bogged down by a confused mind, best exemplified by the run out of Tristan Stubbs.Stubbs sprinted out of the non-striker's crease as if chased by a lion after Axar defended a length ball from Cameron Green, who quickly grabbed the ball and completed the simple task of hitting the stumps.Earlier, RCB could not exploit Patidar's quick fifty to the optimum, settling for an underwhelming 187 for nine.Patidar (52, 32b, 3x4, 3x6) and Jacks (41, 29b, 3x4, 2x6) added 88 runs off 53 balls for the third-wicket as RCB overcame the early departures of skipper Faf du Plessis and Virat Kohli .Du Plessis' slice off pacer Mukesh Kumar was gobbled up by McGurk near third man.Kohli gave signals of another T20 masterclass while creaming 27 off 13 balls, including two sixes off Ishant Sharma and one off Khaleel Ahmed (2/31).But a waft outside the off-stump with little foot movement resulted in a catch to stumper Abhishek Porel.RCB, however, found Patidar in full flow. His first scoring shot was a magnificent cover driven four off Mukesh and he never let that early momentum fade.The elegance soon gave way for brute force as Patidar brought forth his six-hitting abilities, smashing Axar for two sixes and sending Kuldeep Yadav over long-on for a maximum.The DC fielders too helped Patidar copiously. Hope dropped the right-hander on 42 off Kuldeep and five runs later Axar grassed him off pacer Rasikh Salam.At the other end, Jacks, who was given a reprieve on 19 by Axar off Kuldeep, displayed his untrammelled power and the left-arm wrist spinner was at the receiving end, watching the ball sailing over long-on twice.Just as the alliance was blossoming, DC managed to latch on to a catch.Axar atoned for his previous failures as he made a fine tumbling catch off Salam to terminate the stay of Patidar.Jacks soon followed his partner as a weak slap off Kuldeep ended in the hands of Axar at the edge of the ring.The dismissals of two set batters affected the run-scoring rate of RCB. From 137 for four in 14.4 overs they could only add 50 runs in the remaining overs.(With inputs from PTI)","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Delhi Capitals by 47 runs in IPL.

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings kept their hopes alive of securing an IPL playoffs berth, registering a five-wicket win against Rajasthan Royals at the Chepauk on Sunday.The win came courtesy a disciplined bowling performance led by pacer Simarjeet Singh -- who recorded his career-best figures of 3/26 at the home ground.The low-scoring affair also had its share of controversy when Ravindra Jadeja was given out obstructing the field.Despite the challenging pitch conditions, CSK successfully chased down the target of 142 with 10 balls remaining.The hero of the day for CSK was also their captain, Ruturaj Gaikwad , who remained unbeaten on 42 off 41 deliveries, guiding his team to a crucial victory in pursuit of a playoff berth.Rachin Ravindra (27 off 18 balls) and Gaikwad managed a 32-run stand before the former was dismissed by Ravichandran Ashwin in the fourth over.However, that did not have any impact on Gaikwad and Daryl Mitchell (22 off 13 balls) as they maintained a run rate of over nine and ended the powerplay at 56 for one.Pacer Sandeep Sharma was the most expensive bowler for the visitors during this phase and was hammered for 23 runs.Mitchell appeared to be the man on a mission, but his stay was cut short by spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who trapped him leg-before wicket in the eighth over to end a 35-run partnership with Gaikwad.Moeen Ali (10 off 13 balls) came in next, but he holed out to Nandre Burger in the 12th over.With the score reading 92 for three in the 13th over, Shivam Dube decided to have a go at Ashwin in his final over.While Dube hammered Ashwin for a six and two fours in the over, the veteran had the last laugh, which also turned out to be his 50th IPL wicket at this venue.Also, Jadeja (5 off 6 balls) survived a scare in the subsequent over after Jos Buttler dropped him off Chahal at long-on.Rookie Sameer Rizvi then hit an eight-ball 15 not out with three fours to end the game in a jiffy after Jadeja became the third batter in IPL history to be adjudged out for obstructing the field after miscommunication with Gaikwad, who refused to go for a second run even as the all-rounder was halfway down the pitch.The third man hurled it to Sanju Samson, who aimed the ball at the bowler's end but the throw hit Jadeja. RR appealed, and the third umpire was convinced that Jadeja knew in which direction the ball was heading.CSK needed 21 off the final four overs, and the duo of Gaikwad and Rizvi got the job done.The win took CSK to the third spot on the points table, while RR suffered their third straight defeat but remained in second position.Earlier, Simarjeet dished out his best performance in the IPL while helping CSK restrict RR to a modest total.For the visitors, the in-form Riyan Parag top-scored with a 35-ball unbeaten 47 on a slow wicket.Opting to bat, the RR openers were off to a cautious start. After RR ended the powerplay at 42 for no loss, the 26-year-old Simarjeet made the first breakthrough in the seventh over, getting rid of Jaiswal (24 runs off 21 balls).Simarjeet came up with the second breakthrough in the ninth over, with Jos Buttler (21 off 25 balls) departing.Samson failed to get going, and it was Simarjeet again who grabbed the prized wicket of the RR skipper, ending his 42-run partnership with Parag.Deshpande, bowling the final over, got rid of Jurel and Shubham Dubey (0 off 1 ball) in consecutive deliveries. Eventually, the visitors didn't get a big enough total on the board.",Chennai Super Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by five wickets at the Chepauk.

And it should be exactly like that. Everything is fine when things are normal. Anybody can be a pilot when the sea is calm. But a person's character is tested when the going is tough.""Sidhu adds in another video, ""KKR is the only team which has bowlers who have taken 10-10 wickets and the sixth has taken 9. Show me one team who has this. The most valuable player in the tournament is Sunil Narine. Who got Starc (Mitchell)? Everybody was saying 23 crore, 23 crore. The cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. It is the value addition, boss. Don't measure him in crores, just see what value addition he is bringing. Look at KKR's bowlers, top batsmen, everybody is in form. They stand like recruits, padded-up, all ready to go in anytime. They have one parallel power centre. Everybody will feel they deserve to do that. They have balance, they have a great mentor, they have a superb captain. They have everybody in form. What else do you want?

CHENNAI: A 35-run defeat against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Friday night has left Chennai Super Kings in a spot of bother.A top-two spot seems off and now the entire focus will be on making the playoffs, for which CSK need to win both their matches. And with no time to recover and reflect on the performance against Titans, a tired CSK will be up against a powerful Rajasthan Royals in a day game on Sunday.It is CSK's last home game and if they do not manage to stay alive for the final two games of the season - second qualifier and final - this may well become MS Dhoni's last match at Chepauk.Royals, who will look to book a playoff berth, came to Chennai on Thursday night, had a couple of good practice sessions and are now ready to put CSK under some serious pressure. Royals might have lost a couple of games back-to-back in the lead-up to this high-voltage clash, but they have the wherewithal to match CSK in every department.Speaking after the loss against Titans, Chennai skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad said that the RR match would be a tough battle. ""It is (the next match) real quick, actually. We get a flight tomorrow (Saturday). It is going to be tough as we will just get up there. And, it will be difficult playing a day game in Chennai, especially against a really good side. But I feel that to stay in the tournament, we need to turn up really well,"" Ruturaj said on Friday.The dew has been a huge factor in the past few games at Chepauk. But on Sunday, with the match being played in the afternoon, dew won't be a factor and the spinners should enjoy the conditions. While the hosts will bank on the spin trio of Ravindra Jadeja , Mitchell Santner and Moeen Ali to make the most of the conditions, Royals are on par with them in this department.Home boy R Ashwin knows Chepauk conditions like the back of his palm and for company, he has leggie Yuzvendra Chahal, who found a place in the T20 World Cup side on the basis of his performances in the IPL CSK will also be wary of RR's formidable battling line-up that has the dependable duo of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jos Buttler, in-form Sanju Samson and young gun Riyan Parag, who can turn the match on its head. The firepower of this line-up can be a big headache for Ruturaj, given the fact that his pace attack is still coming to terms with the departure of Matheesha Pathirana, Mustafizur Rahman and Deepak Chahar.The only bright spot for CSK in their defeat against Titans was the bowling form of Shardul Thakur, who was landing his yorkers and mixing his pace well. CSK will hope the senior bowler keeps doing the job and coupled with the comfort of home conditions and passionate fans, the team does enough to take the survival battle to the final lap.",Chennai Super Kings face Rajasthan Royals in a day game on Sunday.

The heroics of spinner Varun Chakravarthy stole the show, leaving a lasting imprint on KKR 's journey to the playoffs.Former India cricketer Virender Sehwag applauded the decision making from KKR, allowing Varun to bowl the maximum four overs [only one bowler was allowed to bowl four overs in an innings as the rain has curtailed the match to 16-overs-a-side] instead of more established international bowlers like Sunil Narine and Mitchell Starc .""They have Sunil Narine and Mitchell Starc - who play international cricket and different T20 leagues. They didn't get the four overs. Toh yeh bhi toh unhone samajhdari ki na ki meri yeh bowler achcha kar rahi hai to inhi se chaar karaung. Udhar se Mumbai bhi yeh kar sakti thi na, yeh bowler achcha kar raha hai toh isko khelke nikaale, aur dusre ko maar lenge. Toh samajhdari jaruri thi aaj ke match mein, aur kuch nahi tha, sirf samajdari se khelte aur wicket nahi jaati toh nikaal le jaate [KKR took the right decision to use four overs from Varun, who was bowling extremely well. Mumbai could have also done the same and played Varun cautiously and attacked the others. Good decision making was required in the match. If MI had played with better planning and didn't lose wickets, they could have won],"" Sehwag said in a post-match discussion on Cricbuzz.Sehwag, though, lamented the timing of Varun's stellar displays, expressing regret that they came too late for consideration in the T20 World Cup squad .""Not only in this match but in the previous matches also he was bowling brilliantly, but somehow he missed the flight to the T20 World Cup. If these performances came a bit earlier, selectors would have at least considered him for the squad. It came a bit late for him,"" Sehwag said.Manoj Tiwary , another former India cricketer, agreed with Sehwag and heaped praise on Varun.""Brilliant bowling. It was a dream spell which every bowler wishes to bowl once in every 2-3 games,"" remarked Manoj Tiwary, encapsulating the essence of Chakravarthy's performance. His figures of 2-17 throttled Mumbai's chase.""The speed he was bowling, his mystery ball which leg-spin was turning more and his googly was also coming good,"" noted Tiwary, underlining the difficulty batters faced.Reflecting on the dynamics of KKR's bowling unit, Sehwag drew parallels between Chakravarthy and Sunil Narine's partnership, likening it to the famed 'KulCha' duo. ""They are hunting in pairs like 'KulCha' used to do when bowling in tandem,"" he mused, emphasizing the pressure generated by their combined prowess.With Chakravarthy's wizardry complemented by Venkatesh Iyer's explosive batting and Harshit Rana's crucial contributions, KKR stamped their authority as they became the first team to secure a spot in the IPL playoffs",Kolkata Knight Riders secure spot in IPL playoffs with win over Mumbai Indians.

But Narine had the last laugh and dismissed the destructive Kishan.Narine deceived Kishan with a seam-up delivery as the left hander holed out to midwicket for KKR's first breakthrough.Chakravarthy ended Rohit's forgettable stint at the crease in the next over and finished his four-over spell by dismissing MI skipper Hardik Pandya .Coming in as an impact player, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma 's patchy run of form continued as he looked out of sorts.Rohit was going run-a-ball in his scratchy knock, but that was not a problem for MI as Kishan took the attack to the KKR camp with his flat-batted approach.The left-hander smashed Harshit Rana for two fours and one six, and then took on Narine with successive fours and a six.MI were well on course with 59 for no loss in five overs with a required run-rate of exactly nine runs per over at that stage. But then, KKR's spin duo plotted MI's downfall.Earlier, on a tacky wicket that remained under covers for three days owing to persistent rain in the city, KKR lost their openers -- Phil Salt (6) and Sunil Narine (0) -- in seven balls.Battling a strained hamstring, Iyer lifted KKR after their worst start of the season with his counter-attacking knock after MI won a good toss following a late start because of rain.The highlight of the left-hander's innings was the way he hit Jasprit Bumrah for a six and two fours.Having missed their last 10 matches because of a finger injury, Nitish Rana made a 23-ball 33 during a key partnership with Iyer before getting run out.But Mumbai bounced back well with leg-spinner Piyush Chawla returning figures of 2/38 from his three overs, taking the two key wickets of Iyer and Andre Russell (24 off 14 balls; 2x4, 2x6).Bumrah (2/39 from four overs) ended his splendid spell by dismissing Rinku Singh for a 12-ball 20.(With inouts from PTI)",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Mumbai Indians by 18 runs in IPL match.

However, a video circulating on social media shows Rohit expressing his deep affection for the franchise, likening it to a second home for him while talking to KKR assistant coach Abhishek Nayar.Though the noise in the video is not clear due to constant cheering by fans for Rohit in the background, he can be heard saying, ""Ek ek cheez change ho raha hai...Woh unke upar hai...Jo bhi hai woh mera ghar hai bhai, woh temple jo hai na maine banwaya hai."" The last audible line in the chat is ""Bhai mera kya mera to ye last hai"".Though the rest of the conversation is not audible, fans were quick to react to it and speculated that Rohit was talking about the MI captaincy and some fans even alleged that KKR had deleted the video after uploading it on X.Rohit and Nayar go back a long way from their Mumbai domestic cricket days and are good friends.

Despite their best efforts, Rajasthan Royals couldn't quite capitalize on the batting front.Chennai Super Kings, on the other hand, demonstrated a better understanding of the conditions, particularly at home.After restricting Rajasthan Royals to 141/5 in their 20 overs with a superb bowling performance, CSK put on a clinical display with the bat.Led by captain Ruturaj Gaikwad 's unbeaten 42-run knock, CSK chased down the target comfortably, showcasing solid batting performances from Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, and Shivam Dube . Gaikwad played the role of the anchor, while the explosive batting from his teammates ensured a smooth victory for CSK.CSK's victory was also buoyed by fine bowling efforts from pacers Simarjeet Singh and Tushar Deshpande , who applied continuous pressure on the Rajasthan Royals' batting lineup throughout the game.With this important win, Chennai Super Kings moved closer to securing a spot in the playoffs with just one game remaining in the league stage. Their all-round performance, combining effective bowling and composed batting, showcased their potential as strong contenders in theIPL 2024 tournament.Sanju Samson agreed that they failed to get to the score they had in mind after the first few overs.""I think after the Power-play, the message was the wicket was slow and two-paced. The bounce was also not as much as we expected. When I was batting in the middle, the score I was expecting was around 170. We were 20-25 runs short. We tried our best, they knew the conditions and they bowled smartly,"" said Samson at the post-match presentation ceremony on Sunday.He admitted that Chennai Super Kings bowler Simarjeet Singh bowled well. ""Simarjeet bowled well today. We are not very sure what to expect in away games. Looking at the venue, we thought batting first might be better. I think when you have a score to chase, on these wickets, they had a better idea and a better hand in this,"" he said.Samson, who set the record for leading Rajasthan Royals in the greatest number of matches by leading them out in the 57th match and getting past Shane Warne, said the wicket did not slow down as much as they had expected in the second innings.""We expected it to be slower in the second innings, but it was a touch better. When you play here in night games, it is a no-brainer (to chase) with all the dew coming in. The summer is getting hotter in India and as the wicket heats up, I was expecting it to slow down. They also batted really well. The way the game went to the 18th over, the wicket was tough to bat on,"" he added.Samson said the race for qualifying spots in the playoffs was top-most of their minds. ""Very normal to keep thinking about the qualification at this stage. The conversations we are having is to control what we can do. At the team brief, I will probably ask them to continue the process and hope to get on the better side next game,"" he said.Rajasthan Royals are currently on 16 points in the points table with eight wins from 12 matches. They have suffered losses in three successive matches and now have two more games to play.Rajasthan Royals will take on Punjab Kings at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium, Guwahati on Wednesday followed by a clash with Kolkata Knight Riders at the same venue on May 19.

However, their victory at Old Trafford was far from convincing, as they battled stifling heat and a determined United side.United's injury woes and defensive vulnerabilities were exposed once again, with Casemiro's error leading to Trossard's decisive goal. The absence of key players like Bruno Fernandes only added to their struggles.Despite a spirited second-half display from United, Arsenal held firm defensively, securing their sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United clinched their first Women's FA Cup title with a commanding 4-0 triumph over Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Sunday. Under the guidance of manager Marc Skinner , the team avenged their defeat in last year's final to Chelsea by putting on a dominant display.The match saw United assert their authority, with midfielder Ella Toone breaking the deadlock on the stroke of halftime with a spectacular strike.After the break, Rachel Williams extended their lead with a well-timed header, followed by two goals from Spanish forward Lucia Garcia , sealing a comprehensive victory.This triumph marks a significant milestone for Manchester United's women's team, who have steadily progressed since their reformation in 2018. Winning their first major trophy will undoubtedly serve as a source of pride and motivation for the players and staff alike as they continue to make strides in women's football.""Wembley is always special. Last year we spoke as a group and said 'one day that will be ours' and today's the day so I'm buzzing,"" said goalkeeper Mary Earps.The atmosphere at Wembley Stadium was electric on a sunny day, with a staggering 76,082 fans in attendance, including Manchester United's co-owner Avram Glazer and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. Despite the anticipation, the first half of the match produced few noteworthy chances, with the breakthrough coming in the second minute of stoppage time.It was England's Ella Toone who seized the moment, driving the ball forward and unleashing a powerful strike from outside the area that found the top corner of the net. This stunning goal gave Manchester United a crucial lead heading into halftime.Tottenham, appearing in their first-ever FA Cup final, struggled to pose any attacking threat throughout the match, failing to register a single shot on target. Their hopes were further dashed after the break as United's Rachel Williams, a former Spurs player who had previously won the FA Cup with Birmingham City, rose high to head in a free kick, extending United's lead.Spanish forward Lucia Garcia capitalized on a mistake from Tottenham goalkeeper Becky Spencer, intercepting a poor pass and slotting the ball into the net to make it 3-0 in the 57th minute. Garcia then secured her brace, and United's victory, with another goal in the 74th minute, this time via a deflection.This triumph comes as a bright spot in Manchester United's challenging season, where they have struggled in the league standings, currently sitting fifth. Winning the Women's FA Cup represents a significant achievement for the club and underscores their progress since reforming the women's team in 2018.""We don't like to admit it but it does mask over the issues we've had,"" goalscorer Williams, 36, told the BBC. ""We have had some ups and downs this year. That's for Marc (Skinner) and the backroom staff to be like 'right, this is what we have to do in the summer'.""We are going to have change things next year.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi played the full 90 minutes in Inter Miami's 3-2 victory over Montreal on Saturday night, despite a brief injury scare in the first half. Benjamin Cremaschi scored the decisive goal in the 59th minute, helping Inter Miami secure their fifth straight Major League Soccer win after overcoming a two-goal deficit.Luis Suarez and Matías Rojas also found the back of the net for Inter Miami, while Jules-Anthony Vilsaint and Bryce Duke scored for Montreal (3-5-3).Inter Miami (8-2-3) stretched their unbeaten run to seven matches (5-0-2), even though Messi failed to score or assist for the first time in his nine MLS appearances this season. The team has a 7-0-2 record in those nine games, with one of their losses coming against Montreal in March when Messi was not playing.Messi experienced a concerning moment towards the end of the first half when he was fouled by George Campbell . The impact of the challenge caused Messi to fall to the ground, visibly in pain and clutching his left knee.Inter Miami's medical staff attended to Messi on the field, and after about two minutes, he got up and walked to the sideline. He was not substituted, allowing him to return to the game shortly after.Remarkably, the match dynamics shifted following Messi's injury scare. Inter Miami was trailing 2-0 when Messi got hurt, but the score was 2-1 when he returned, and they equalized moments after he re-entered the field. Rojas scored from a free kick that Messi would typically take, putting Inter Miami on the scoreboard. Suarez then tapped in a goal from a corner kick late in first-half stoppage time, becoming the third player in MLS history to score 11 goals in his first 800 minutes of a season.Cremaschi's go-ahead goal came when Rojas sent a ball into open space, and the young midfielder ran it down, nudging the ball just past two defenders and into the net for a 3-2 lead. Messi had two chances to extend the lead in the final minutes but narrowly missed both.The match attracted a sellout crowd of 19,619 spectators, with Montreal selling out its 15,000 season tickets for the first time since joining MLS in 2012, largely due to Messi's arrival in the league last summer.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe confirmed on Friday his decision to depart from Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) at the conclusion of the current season. The French champions, who signed Mbappe from Monaco in 2017 for a staggering 180 million euros ($194 million), are expected to bid farewell to their star player as he likely moves to Real Madrid .""I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain.I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks,"" Mbappe, 25, said in a video posted on social media. ""I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.""PSG, owned by Qatar, have already clinched their 10th Ligue 1 title in the past 12 seasons and will be presented with the trophy following Sunday's match against Toulouse, their final home game of the campaign. However, the team's Champions League aspirations were dashed by Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals, with a 1-0 home defeat sealing a surprising 2-0 aggregate loss. Consequently, Mbappe will not have the opportunity to bid farewell in the Champions League final at Wembley on June 1, and his seven-year tenure at PSG will conclude without having secured Europe's most prestigious club competition.Mbappe had privately informed PSG of his intention to leave when his contract expires at the end of the season back in February. Although he had not publicly confirmed his departure or his next destination, it is widely believed that he will join Real Madrid. Spanish media reports have suggested that Mbappe has already signed an agreement to join LaLiga champions in July once his PSG contract concludes.""It's a lot of emotions, many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club, one of the best in the world,"" said Mbappe.""It allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure, to grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history, some of the greatest champions,"" he added. ""It's hard and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that... but I think I needed this, a new challenge, after seven years.""Mbappe's arrival in Paris as a teenager in 2017 came after he had helped Monaco secure the league title. His transfer fee, initially on loan before becoming permanent, remains the second-largest in football history, coming just weeks after PSG paid a world-record 222 million euros to acquire Neymar from Barcelona.Despite the Qatari takeover in 2011 and the subsequent dominance of French football, PSG have struggled to achieve European success, even with the addition of Lionel Messi to their lineup for two seasons. The closest they came was the 2020 Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich, where PSG academy graduate Kingsley Coman scored the winning goal against his former club.Mbappe, who has scored 43 goals in all competitions this season, including 26 in Ligue 1, will aim to add to his club-record tally of 255 goals for PSG and secure another medal in the French Cup final on May 25. During his seven years at his hometown team, Mbappe has won six Ligue 1 titles, three French Cups, and the now-defunct League Cup twice.Following Sunday's game, PSG will conclude their league campaign with away matches at Nice and relegation-threatened Metz before Mbappe's final appearance for the club in the Cup final in Lille.Mbappe's relationship with PSG boss Luis Enrique has come under scrutiny since he informed the club of his plans to leave earlier this year. The club had initially frozen him out at the start of the campaign, pressuring him to either sign a new deal or agree to be sold rather than simply running down the final year of his contract.",Kylian Mbappe confirms he will leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season.

Goalkeeping howlers, as they say, are part of the game but some stay entrenched in minds much longer after the final whistle has been blown.Magnificent till the 87th minute in the Champions League semifinal's deciding tie against Real Madrid on Wednesday night, Bayern's Manuel Neuer will have nightmares about what happened in the 88th.Even Neuer spills. Even Homer nods.As Neuer stood aghast, from the flash drive of memory popped up a hoary, time-worn visual of Oliver Kahn 's slip from grace.

We had taken one step to London, we saw ourselves in the final and now I'm lost for words,"" Neuer told the media after his disastrous moment in Madrid.Till that moment, Neuer remained impregnable under the bar. He remained the only reason the radioactive Vinicius Junior failed to get on the scoresheet. A back-to-back save to deny Real Madrid was the standout moment that enhanced Neuer's reputation of being the big game performer, the big brother of custodians, one who could slap a ball off an attacker's head inside his own box in a World Cup final and carry on as if it's just another day in office.Those who were fortunate enough to watch him at the Maracana would never forget a goalkeeper's supreme nonchalance.When he acrobatically palmed Vinicius' vicious punch over the bar, no one missed a beat because it was 'Manu the wall', as the Bayern fans have been fondly calling him for the last 13 seasons.""Manu did incredibly well but then made a mistake he wouldn't have made for 100 years,"" said Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel . ""It's frustrating. If there's anyone who didn't deserve that, it's Manu. We know who he is, what he's achieved.""At 38, Neuer made everyone believe in his stupendous shot-stopping ability and feline reflexes when his slightest touch defied Vinicius and when the ball bounced off the post, he was ready to deny Rodrygo. The reason Bayern could make the tie so close was Neuer and Neuer alone. Even legends do have a fall and Neuer relived the Kahn emotions and surely the senior felt the same.Wednesday's loss meant Neuer and Bayern will finish the season without a trophy for the first time since 2012.",Manuel Neuer's slip was reminiscent of Oliver Kahn's butterfingers in 2002 WC final.

Olympiakos secured their place in the Europa Conference League final by defeating Aston Villa 2-0 in the second leg of the semi-finals, marking a historic moment for the club. Led by Jose Luis Mendilibar, Olympiakos sealed a commanding 6-2 aggregate victory, largely thanks to Ayoub El Kaabi's brace, who had also scored a hat-trick in the first leg.The atmosphere at the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus was electrifying as Olympiakos, boasting a record 47 Greek championships, earned their debut in a major European final.This achievement places them alongside Panathinaikos as the only Greek clubs to reach such heights, with Panathinaikos falling to Ajax in the 1971 European Cup final.The upcoming final against Fiorentina at the AEK Arena adds to the sense of destiny for Olympiakos, as it lies just 10 miles away from their home ground, further emphasizing the local rivalry.Despite Mendilibar's recent appointment in February, he has quickly become an iconic figure for Olympiakos, turning around their European fortunes after several disappointments in previous seasons.Under the ownership of Evangelos Marinakis, Olympiakos had struggled in Europe, failing to progress past the group stage 14 times out of 16 attempts. However, this season presents an opportunity for redemption, with Olympiakos aiming to secure their first European trophy in their nearly century-long history, a feat that would rival Greece's memorable Euro 2004 triumph.It has been a remarkable year for Olympiakos, highlighted by their Under-19 team's success in the UEFA Youth League final against AC Milan in April.On the other hand, Fiorentina booked their spot in the final by overcoming Club Brugge in the semi-finals, setting the stage for a thrilling showdown.Villa's departure marked a painful end to their quest for their first European final appearance since 1982. After returning to European competition following a 13-year hiatus, Villa now face the challenge of regrouping and redirecting their focus towards securing a top-four finish in the Premier League to qualify for the next season's Champions League.Under the guidance of Unai Emery, currently occupying fourth place in the league standings, Villa hold a seven-point lead over Tottenham, who sit in fifth place with three games remaining, compared to Villa's two.Early in the match, Olympiakos's Chiquinho had a chance on goal after bypassing Villa's defense, but his shot missed the target. However, Villa failed to take heed of this warning as Olympiakos capitalized on their defensive lapses to take the lead in the 10th minute.Despite Villa's attempts to find their rhythm, they struggled to coordinate their efforts, exemplified by Leon Bailey's slip as he attempted a shot that posed little threat to Olympiakos goalkeeper Kostas Tzolakis, who showcased his skill with a remarkable save to deny Bailey's powerful strike just before halftime.With Olympiakos firmly in control of the match, they pressed relentlessly and defended resolutely to keep Villa at bay. In the 78th minute, Ayoub El Kaabi sealed the result for Olympiakos, capitalizing on Tzolakis's clearance to score, securing their victory and igniting celebrations among the Olympiakos faithful.",Olympiakos defeated Aston Villa 2-0 in the second leg of the semi-finals.

Moments later, he secured the win with a second goal, albeit controversially initially ruled out for offside before being awarded following a VAR review .Reflecting on the team's indomitable spirit, midfielder Jude Bellingham remarked, ""We've seen it a lot of times this season when it looked as though we're dead and buried ... it doesn’t matter who scores the goals but someone always manages it... that mentality of never say die.""Real Madrid's dominance throughout the game was evident, with Vinicius Jr leading the charge down the left channel and Neuer putting up a valiant defense for Bayern.

The defeat came just two days after he was struck on the head by a bottle, an incident that left him experiencing symptoms of nausea and dizziness.Djokovic's bid for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title came to an abrupt end at the hands of Alejandro Tabilo , a Chilean player ranked 32nd in the world.Tabilo's victory marked his first win over a top-10 opponent, as he defeated Djokovic convincingly with a scoreline of 6-2, 6-3.The 24-time Grand Slam champion attributed his subdued performance to the blow he sustained while greeting fans after his second-round win.Despite initially downplaying the incident and even wearing a cycling crash helmet to training the following morning, Djokovic acknowledged that the effects of the injury may have contributed to his underwhelming performance on the court.The unexpected loss in Rome serves as a setback for Djokovic, particularly as he had enjoyed success at the tournament in the past, having won six titles there.The incident highlights the physical toll that even seemingly minor injuries can have on professional athletes, underscoring the importance of health and safety in sports.""I don't know, to be honest. I have to check that. Training was different. I was going for kind of easy training yesterday. I didn't feel anything, but I also didn't feel the same,"" Djokovic told reporters.""Today under high stress, it was quite bad -- not in terms of pain, but in terms of this balance. Just no coordination. Completely different player from what it was two nights ago.""Djokovic also said that he would have scans to ""see what's going on"" before the French Open in Paris, where he will head not just worried by the after-effects of the bottle incident but also his form.The last time Djokovic got to Roland Garros without a title to his name that season was in 2018, when his first honour of the campaign came at Wimbledon.With the French Open getting underway in two weeks and where he is the defending champion, Djokovic admitted that ""everything needs to be better in order for me to have at least a chance to win"" a 25th Grand Slam.""The way I felt on the court today was just completely like a different player entered into my shoes,"" added Djokovic.

This match presents an intriguing battle between an established top player and a rising talent, with both players eager to make their presence felt in the tournament.Meanwhile, Tabilo's impressive victory over Djokovic has captured attention, as he demonstrated exceptional skill and composure against his superstar opponent. Tabilo's performance, marked by 22 winners, only four unforced errors, and no break points faced, solidifies his status as a formidable contender in the tournament.""Honestly in no moment was I like, Okay, I can win this,"" said a delighted Tabilo.""I was playing incredible tennis.

Rafael Nadal suffered a disappointing exit from the Rome Open on Saturday, bowing out in the second round with a 6-1, 6-3 loss to Poland's Hubert Hurkacz .This defeat to the seventh seed raises questions about whether the clay-court maestro will participate in the upcoming French Open, where he boasts a record 14 titles.Nadal has emphasized that his decision to compete at Roland Garros hinges on his sense of competitiveness, particularly given his recent string of injury setbacks.Currently ranked 305th in the world, Nadal remains cautious about committing to the prestigious tournament.And the manner of his elimination in his first ever encounter with 27-year-old Hurkacz was a step backwards after reaching the last 16 in Madrid.Nadal held his own in the first two games in the first set, which took 26 minutes to complete, but then fell away as errors handed Hurkacz points.The 37-year-old twice gave away breaks of serve with miscued drop shots in the first set which Hurkacz closed out in 49 minutes as he blew through five straight games.And the match was as good as done when Hurkacz, who did not drop a single service game, broke Nadal in the third game of the second set to set up a famous victory.That level of dominance over Nadal on clay, much less a court where he has won a record 10 titles, would have been unimaginable a few short years ago.But Hurkacz will face Tomas Etcheverry in the third round after likely ending Nadal's love affair with Rome as the 22-time Grand Slam winner looks set to call time on his career at the end of the season.","Rafael Nadal loses 6-1, 6-3 to Hubert Hurkacz in the second round of the Rome Open.

However, as he was signing autographs for fans while exiting the centre court at the Foro Italico , Djokovic was struck by a hard plastic water bottle on the back of his head, leaving him in agony and crouched on the ground.Security staff led the 24-time Grand Slam winner from the arena, covering him as he made his way into the stands. It remains unclear from the video footage whether the bottle was deliberately launched from the stands or accidentally fell onto Djokovic's head.Watch:However, giving an update on his situation, Djokovic wrote on X, ""Thank you for the messages of concern. This was an accident and I am fine resting at the hotel with an ice pack. See you all on Sunday. ""His next opponent will be Chile's Alejandro Tabilo.
