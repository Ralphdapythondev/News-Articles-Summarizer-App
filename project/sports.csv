Ryan ten Doeschate: The unsung hero for whom Gautam Gambhir can even 'take a bullet',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ryan-ten-doeschate-the-unsung-hero-for-whom-gautam-gambhir-can-even-take-a-bullet/articleshow/111887871.cms,"Gambhir-Doeschate camaraderie

Who is Ryan ten Doeschate?

A man of character

NEW DELHI: The announcement of Gautam Gambhir as the new head coach of the Indian men's cricket team has brought a wave of excitement among fans and players alike.But the buzz doesn't stop there.Potentially joining Gambhir's team as assistant coaches are former India all-rounder Abhishek Nayar and former Dutch international Ryan ten Doeschate Although the BCCI has not yet officially confirmed these appointments, the cricketing world is already abuzz with anticipation.Gambhir's legacy as a leader is well-known. His tenure with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) saw the team rise from mediocrity to championship glory, clinching two IPL titles under his captaincy. Now, as the head coach of Team India, Gambhir brings with him a wealth of experience and a reputation for revitalizing struggling teams.Gambhir's knack for leadership was on full display when he led KKR to the knockout stages in his first year as captain and subsequently to IPL victories in 2012 and 2014.Now as the mentor, he brought the glory days back to KKR this year, though not single-handedly.With Ryan ten Doeschate orchestrating from behind the scenes, Gambhir had a man for whom he could, in his own words, even take a bullet.In a media interaction, Gambhir referred to Ryan ten Doeschate as the ""greatest team man"" he has ever played with. He recounted an anecdote from 2011 when ten Doeschate, despite having a stellar 50-over World Cup, carried drinks without a hint of disappointment. This act of selflessness left an indelible mark on Gambhir, shaping his own leadership ethos.""When I talk about selflessness, I have never said this in 42 years of my career, and I wanted to say this. The greatest team man I have ever played with, the most selfless human being, someone I can take a bullet for, someone who I can trust for life, and I can tell you this because in 2011, for my first game as a KKR captain, we only had four overseas players available, and this man had a fabulous 50-over World Cup. We went in that game with only three overseas players, and he was carrying drinks in that game with no disappointment on his face. He taught me selflessness. Ryan ten Doeschate. These are the people who made me the leader,"" Gambhir previously said during a media interaction.Born on June 30, 1980, in Port Elizabeth, Cape Province, Ryan ten Doeschate is a former Netherlands international, who has had a cricketing journey nothing short of remarkable.Discovered by Essex during a pre-season tour of South Africa, Ryan ten Doeschate's all-round abilities for Western Province caught their eye. His EU citizenship qualified him to play county cricket, paving the way for his impressive career.Standing at 5 feet 11 inches, the right-handed batting all-rounder and right-arm fast-medium bowler left an indelible mark on every team he played for.His impressive stats speak volumes: an average of 67 in ODIs, with five centuries and nine fifties in just 33 matches, and a strike rate of 132.92 in T20Is.In his IPL career, the part-time medium-pacer played 29 matches and took 2 wickets with a best bowling figure of 1/24 while maintaining an economy rate of 7.23.When it comes to his batting numbers, Ryan ten Doeschate scored 326 runs at an average of 23.29, with a highest score of 70* across 29 IPL matches.Ten Doeschate's talent took him across the globe, playing for clubs and franchise teams in the Netherlands, England, Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Pakistan.In September 2021, Ryan ten Doeschate bid farewell to his illustrious cricketing career, announcing his retirement by year's end. His swan song came on October 20, 2021, in a final international match against Namibia during the group stage of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.However, his association with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL further cemented his reputation as a versatile and reliable player.What sets ten Doeschate apart is not just his statistics but his character. Known for his humility and dedication, he has often been described as the best associate player among non-Test-playing nations.His performances in the 2011 ICC World Cup, particularly his career-best 119 against England, showcased his ability to shine on the biggest stage.Yet, despite his individual brilliance, ten Doeschate remains a quintessential team player, always prioritizing the collective over personal glory.As ten Doeschate looks set to join Gambhir and Nayar in the Indian coaching setup, the anticipation for the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka is palpable.With Gambhir's strategic acumen, Nayar's all-around expertise, and ten Doeschate's selfless spirit, Team India is poised to benefit from a diverse and experience-rich coaching team.","Former India all-rounder Abhishek Nayar and former Dutch international Ryan ten Doeschate could join Gautam Gambhir as assistant coaches.

What more do you expect from me?""During the 2019 edition, despite taking 14 wickets in fours matches, he was benched for the final league match against Sri Lanka and the semi-final against New Zealand, which India lost by 18 runs.Shami's bewilderment was palpable as he continued, ""I neither have questions nor do I have answers. I can only prove myself when I get the opportunity. You gave me a chance, and I took 13 wickets in three matches. Then we lost to New Zealand. Played four matches overall and picked 14 wickets. In 2023, I picked 24 wickets in seven matches.""In the 2019 World Cup, Shami was playing under the captaincy of Virat Kohli , with Ravi Shastri serving as the head coach.Shami's consistent performance when given the opportunity underscores the importance of utilizing players to their full potential, especially in critical tournaments like the World Cup.","Mohammed Shami expressed his confusion over team management's decisions to bench him during crucial stages of the tournaments.

However, the departure of Louis for 17 runs, caught by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith off Chris Woakes, initiated a rapid decline for the visiting team.This was followed by a series of dismissals that saw the West Indies lose five wickets within a span of 35 deliveries, dramatically reducing their score to 82-5. Notably, Kirk McKenzie was caught by Smith off Bashir for a single run, and shortly after, Brathwaite was dismissed for 47 runs by Woakes, caught by Smith once again.The middle order and tail of the West Indies lineup failed to stabilize the innings, with Kavem Hodge, who had scored a century in the first innings, being dismissed lbw by Bashir without scoring. Alick Athanaze also fell to Bashir, caught by Joe Root in the slips for one run.Subsequent batsmen, including Kevin Sinclair and Joshua Da Silva, were unable to contribute significantly, with Sinclair being caught off Mark Wood and Da Silva lbw by Gus Atkinson. Atkinson also dismissed Alzarri Joseph for a duck, further deepening the West Indies' predicament.Shoaib Bashir continued his dominance by dismissing Jason Holder for 37 and Shamarh Brooks for eight, completing his five-wicket haul with figures of 5-41. This performance was pivotal in dismantling the West Indies batting lineup and securing the victory for England.West Indies, on the other hand, showed initial resilience but were unable to maintain momentum, ultimately succumbing to the pressure exerted by England's bowlers, particularly Bashir.","England cricket team achieved a commanding 241-run victory over the West Indies on the fourth day, thereby securing a decisive 2-0 series lead.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has strongly criticized Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami for his ' cartoon-giri ' comments about Inzamam-ul-Haq ’s reverse swing allegations.Ali, speaking on his YouTube channel, expressed his disapproval of Shami's choice of words, describing them as 'behuda' (indecent) and disrespectful.""When Shami talks about Inzi bhai and calls him a cartoon, that's not right.Inzamam has led this country and captained it. Shami, your choice of words isn't good. We praise your bowling, but you should have chosen your words better. You didn't pick your words well, and that hurt me,"" Ali said.""If you think Inzi bhai said something wrong, say it nicely. Don't call him a cartoon and all that. Have some respect. He's a senior. You should respect your seniors. If you don't, cricket will make you cry 300 days out of 365 and only make you happy for 65 days. So, please don't do this, it's a personal request,"" he added.Shami had previously lambasted Inzamam’s claims that Team India was involved in ball-tampering during the T20 World Cup .The 33-year-old also dismissed allegations from former Pakistani players that he used a modified ball with a chip embedded in it. Shami responded to these accusations with a blunt critique, calling such claims ""cartoonish"" and accusing Inzamam of attempting to deceive the public.Ali, known for his candid opinions, was visibly upset by Shami's remarks. He emphasized the need for respect towards senior players, asserting, “Be a bit more careful, you can't just say anything anywhere. Whatever question is asked, you keep giving 'behuda' (indecent) answers. I'm using the right word, 'behuda (indecent)'. Aapne behuda zabaan use kiya hai (You've used indecent language). Your elders probably never taught you this.""During the T20 World Cup that India went on to win, Inzamam questioned the timing of reverse swing deliveries by Indian bowler Arshdeep Singh in the Super Eight match against Australia, suggesting that the ball appeared to be prepared for reverse swing too early in the innings. The comment sparked Shami’s reaction, which Ali feels undermines the dignity of cricketing discourse.""Arshdeep Singh, when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. Is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over. Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things...If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball) this would have been a big issue. We know reverse swing very well and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before,"" Inzamam told a Pakistani news channel.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has strongly criticized Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami for his'cartoon-giri'comments about Inzamam-ul-Haq.

NEW DELHI: Former Team India batting coach Sanjay Bangar feels a 'little injustice' has been done to Hardik Pandya following Suryakumar Yadav 's appointment as captain of T20I side for the upcoming white-ball tour to Sri Lanka.Despite Hardik's commendable leadership and strong performances, Suryakumar, earlier this week was named T20I captain while Shubman Gill was appointed as vice-captain for both the T20I and ODI squads.In a discussion on Star Sports, Bangar highlighted Suryakumar’s experience in leadership within domestic cricket but expressed that an injustice had been served to Hardik.""It is not that Suryakumar Yadav has played less domestic cricket before playing international cricket. So he has a lot of experience, I think he has led Mumbai in domestic cricket as well and knows how to extract the best from the players,"" Bangar said.""So there is nothing wrong in Suryakumar being made the captain. I fully believe that he will do a good job but I still feel a little injustice has been meted out to Hardik,"" added the former Indian all-rounder.Bangar expressed his surprise at Hardik not being the captain, because to him, it seemed like had Rohit not been the captain for a series against Afghanistan earlier this year when Hardik was injured, the all-rounder would have continued as a captain anyways.""I am a bit surprised as far as Hardik not being the captain of the T20 team is concerned because even before the previous T20 World Cup it seemed like if Rohit had not become the captain and Hardik had not gotten injured at that time, Hardik only would have become the captain,"" said Bangar.Hardik previously captained the T20I side post the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 and during his tenure he led India in 16 T20I matches, winning 10, losing five, and drawing one.Pandya's removal comes despite his stellar performance in the recently concluded T20 World Cup, where he scored 144 runs in six innings at an average of 48.00 and a strike rate of 151.57, along with taking 11 wickets in eight games at an average of 17.36 and an economy rate of 7.64.Suryakumar Yadav, on the other hand, has captained India in two series following the 50-over World Cup 2023 final loss to Australia.He led India in seven matches, securing five wins and two losses.

Bangar expressed surprise that Pandya was not given the captaincy.""I am a bit surprised as far as Hardik not being the captain of the T20 team is concerned because even before the previous T20 World Cup it seemed like if Rohit hadn't become the captain and Hardik hadn't gotten injured at that time, Hardik only would have become the captain,"" Bangar said on Star Sports.""The Indian team had started going in that direction. The selectors had also found that path. I find this sudden U-turn slightly troubling. We have certainly read that the chairman of the selection committee and the coach have spoken to Hardik Pandya,"" he added.Pandya has demonstrated a strong leadership record, having led the Indian team to 10 victories in 16 T20Is. Yadav has captained Team India in seven T20Is, winning five of them.""It's not that Suryakumar Yadav has played less domestic cricket before playing international cricket. So he has a lot of experience, I think he has led Mumbai in domestic cricket as well and knows how to extract the best from the players,"" Bangar said.He continued, ""So there is nothing wrong in Suryakumar being made the captain. I fully believe that he will do a good job, but I still feel a little injustice has been meted out to Hardik.""While acknowledging that selectors and coach Gautam Gambhir might have explained their reasons to Pandya, Bangar opined that the all-rounder would still feel hurt by the decision.""As a player, you are always understanding what the selectors are trying to do, what the new coach is trying to do but deep within himself, I am pretty sure that Hardik will be deeply hurt that he is not being considered for T20 captaincy,"" Bangar stated.",Suryakumar Yadav has been appointed as India's T20I captain for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka. Former India cricketer and batting coach Sanjay Bangar has expressed dissatisfaction with the decision. Bangar believes that all- rounder Hardik Pandya has been unfairly overlooked.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111899188,imgsize-56136,width-400,resizemode-4/111899188.jpg"

Panaji:

Manolo Marquez ’s coaching staff with the national team will comprise those who he has worked with in the past, except for Indian assistant Mahesh Gawli, already contracted with the All India Football Federation ( AIFF ).Manolo, 55, was named the head coach of the national team on Saturday and has now been asked to choose his coaching staff.According to sources, the Spanish coach – who will continue to be with FC Goa till the end of the season – will have Benito Montalvo as his assistant and Jose Carlos Barroso as the strength and conditioning coach, both working with Goa at the moment.Montalvo, a former Argentinean footballer, trained to become a coach in Barcelona and was head coach at the RCD Espanyol Academy Helsinki. He met Manolo during training camps in Finland and Sweden during the Covid-19 pandemic, and has been with him since his first season at Hyderabad FC in 2020.Barroso was part of Cesar Ferrando’s coaching staff at Jamshedpur and has extensive experience of working in India.The only new member of Manolo’s coaching staff, outside Goa, would be goalkeeper’s coach Marc Gamon , who worked for two seasons with the Spaniard at Hyderabad FC before taking up a job in Belgium.Manolo is already preparing for his first assignment with the national team in Sept and will most certainly skip the Bhausaheb Bandodkar Memorial Trophy where part of the dates clash with the international window.“The AIFF will confirm the teams for the Sept window in the next couple of days but most certainly the two opponents will be from Africa and Oceania,” said a senior official. “Since it’s already late in confirming the teams, they won’t be from the top 100. In fact, most certainly lower ranked than India.”The AIFF is expected to host the matches in Hyderabad.For the October window, India will travel to Vietnam for a friendly tri-nation series which also involves Lebanon. As per the latest FIFA rankings, Vietnam (116) and Lebanon (117) are placed ahead of India (124).“Manolo has to strike a balance between club and country commitments, but he’s taken up the job knowing he is ready for it. For the first few windows, there will be little time for preparations since the Indian Super League (ISL) will be in progress. He has to be ready for the challenge,” said the official.The experienced Spanish coach has trained teams at all levels, including grassroots, youth, third division, second division and the LaLiga with Las Palmas in 2017. He has taken up a national team job for the first time in his over two-decade long coaching career.","Manolo Marquez will have Benito Montalvo as his assistant and Jose Carlos Barroso as the strength and conditioning coach, both working with Goa at the moment.

Manolo Marquez to coach club and country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/manolo-marquez-to-coach-club-and-country/articleshow/111896728.cms,"Manolo Marquez is contracted with FC Goa till May 31, 2025

Panaji: The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has confirmed the appointment of Manolo Marquez as head coach of the national team, while allowing him to continue with FC Goa with whom he is contracted till May 31, 2025.The arrangement helps ease the financial burden on the AIFF, given the strain on its resources and the compensation battle with Igor Stimac.Despite two years left on his contract, the former India coach was sacked without notice and is now seeking the full value of approximately Rs 6 crore.Manolo, 55, arrived in India in 2020 as a replacement for Albert Roca, who quit Hyderabad FC to take up an offer with Barcelona as a fitness coach. The Spanish coach’s arrival saw him take the bottom-placed club to the top in just two years and he’s now been handed the India job, given his record in producing players for the national team.Players like Mohamed Yasir, Akash Mishra, Liston Colaco, Chinglesana Singh, Ashish Rai, Hitesh Sharma, Nikhil Poojary and Jay Gupta are some of the players who either made their debuts or made comebacks into the national team, with Marquez as club coach.“It's an honour for me to be the coach of India, a country I consider my second home,” Manolo said after his appointment on Saturday. “India and its people are something I feel attached to and I feel a part of since I first came to this beautiful country. I want to do my best to bring success to the millions of fans. I am very grateful to FC Goa for allowing us the flexibility to help the national team during the coming season while I am still the club’s head coach. I'm grateful to the AIFF for this opportunity and we hope to do great things for football.”Manolo is understood to have signed a three-year contract. While for the first year, he will work with Goa and the national team, he will take up full-time India duties from June next year. Should he take India to the Asian Cup, his contract will be automatically renewed.Besides Manolo, the executive committee also discussed Antonio Lopez Habas, the most successful coach in the Indian Super League . He won the ISL Shield with Mohun Bagan Super Giant last season, but at 67, and with health complications, his chances lessened.If AIFF were to appoint an Indian as coach, Sanjoy Sen and Santosh Kashyap were the shortlisted candidates.In the past, popular coaches like Sukhvinder Singh, PK Banerjee, Syed Nayeemuddin and Armando Colaco have all handled dual responsibilities. Manolo, though, will become the first foreign coach in India to work for the national team while still being employed with a club.Senior AIFF officials said India is not the first country to have a coach who will do both the jobs. Rinus Michels (Barcelona and Netherlands in 1974), Sir Alex Ferguson (Aberdeen and Scotland in 1985), Guus Hiddink (PSV Eindhoven and Australia in 2005-06; Russia and Chelsea in 2009), Dick Advocaat (AZ Alkmaar and Belgium in 2009) are some examples of big-name coaches handling dual responsibilities.The AIFF received 291 applications for the India coach job, following the dismissal of Stimac for his failure to take India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers. The applications were then trimmed to approximately 150 and from there 17 were asked if they still had interest in the job.Former World Cup-experienced coaches Philippe Troussier and Winfried Schaefer, besides former Real Madrid coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caro, were among those who made it to the final list. Foreign coaches with experience in India like Adrian Boothryod (Jamshedpur), Cesar Farias (NorthEast United) and Nelo Vingada (NEUFC/Kerala Blasters) also made the cut.“Given the financial situation of the AIFF, it was not possible to rope in high-profile coaches,” said another official. “Manolo is our best and safest bet. He has the experience of working in India and his record is impressive.”The experienced Spanish coach has trained teams at all levels, including grassroots, youth, third division, second division and the LaLiga with Las Palmas in 2017.Manolo’s first assignment will be in September with AIFF yet to confirm the opponents. In October, India will be up against Vietnam and Lebanon in an away tri-nation tournament, but the big test will be in March next year when the battle to qualify for the Asian Cup 2027 resumes.","Manolo Marquez has been appointed as the new coach of the India national team.

The current technical panel, chaired by the esteemed IM Vijayan, was apparently not consulted in the decision-making process.""I have been chairman of AIFF technical committee in the past (2013 to 2017) and involved in coach appointments like in case of Stephen Constantine. It is the job of the technical committee to shortlist the candidates who have applied and recommend the suitable person to become coach.

The process was followed in the past but not this time.""If you are going to bypass the technical committee in the head coach appointment, why are we for. I said in the executive committee meeting that since the technical committee was not involved, there was no value of technical committee, then why are we for. So, I said I am resigning from technical committee membership.""Bhutia expressed his strong opposition to the special committee, led by AIFF vice president NA Haris, that was tasked with finding a replacement for Stimac. He firmly stated his disagreement with the committee's actions and involvement in the process of selecting a new coach for the national team.""I completely opposed the constitution of the special committee. There is a technical committee already in place and how come you formed a special committee to discuss the appointment of the coach.""The process itself is wrong.

He emphasized that a high-profile candidate will not be chosen without careful consideration.The AIFF Executive Committee is scheduled to convene in the near future to determine the replacement for Igor Stimac, who recently stepped down from his position as head coach.Stimac's resignation came after a disappointing run of results, with India suffering nine defeats and managing only two draws in his last 12 matches at the helm.“I believe the result matters a lot. We will be looking at someone who can develop Indian football. And whoever gets appointed as chief coach, we want him to add a lot of potential to the national team's performance,” Chaubey told PTI videos in an interview.The newly appointed head coach will face crucial tasks, including leading the team in a tri-nation tournament scheduled for October. The competition, which will take place in Vietnam, will also feature the host nation and Lebanon as participants.Chaubey expressed his optimism that the incoming coach will be able to deliver positive outcomes from these upcoming engagements.“We are looking to utilise all the FIFA windows which we have in the month of September, October, November and March next year,” he said.“No matter whether we play against a lower-ranked team or higher-ranked team, the aim is to win. It will also create more match-time for players. Yes, these matches will also give more international exposure to the players,” he added.Without revealing the names of those who have applied for the role, Chaubey said the response shows there is a lot of interest in becoming India coach.“We have received a total of 291 applications and we have shortlisted 17 names from them.
