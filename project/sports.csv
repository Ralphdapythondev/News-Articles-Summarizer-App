The rest, including

Virat Kohli

, don't. With the team expected to stick to the template which has got them this far, one final hurdle now remains against the formidable South Africans. India will hope things fall into place at the Kensington Oval today...

Reserve day for final

BRIDGETOWN (BARBADOS): 'Chokers'.It's a tag that's bound to hurt. With cricket fans, exuberance spills over to anger every time their team loses a knockout game. There's a tendency to forget that a team that comes so close so often must be very good.South Africa have lived with this tag for a very long time and Rohit Sharma 's India would surely hate such a tag with all their heart.Since the 2013 Champions Trophy, success in ICC events has kept eluding India even as they have come agonizingly close time and time again.Many Indian fans had decided that they wouldn't watch cricket anymore after Nov 19, 2023, but such is the lure of the sport that it's impossible to stay away from it for long. The Indian team gives you enough reasons to come back to it, dream again, and hope that better days are around the corner.Kensington Oval on Saturday definitely promises to be one such day. Rohit and Co. came into this World Cup with a steely determination and a concrete plan. They didn't overdo it through the United States leg and the Super-8s, but simply kept at it.Virat Kohli hasn't scored runs. Shivam Dube hasn't quite set the stage on fire. Even the ever-reliable Ravindra Jadeja isn't at his usual best. But the team management is absolutely fixated about a template when it comes to West Indies conditions and it has worked like magic so far.""In the game against Bangladesh, most of us got 20s and 30s. Only one guy (Hardik Pandya) got a half-century. Yet we reached 196. That's the perfect performance for me,"" Rohit had said, and that's exactly what he wants his team to do against South Africa as well.He knows the pitches in West Indies have enough in them in a day game where his spinners Kuldeep Yadav , Axar Patel and Jadeja can keep any batting lineup to below 160. And then of course, there is Jasprit Bumrah . Never in the nine years that he has been playing international cricket has Bumrah looked so unplayable.With 15 off four Bumrah overs becoming par - add to that a couple of wickets - India are virtually turning every match into 18-over contest. Opposition batters are almost obligated to attack the other bowlers to make up for it, and the left-arm spin trio is just too good for that.Despite taking everything into consideration, there is a slight twist to this South Africa tale in the final. Forget the eight wins they have notched up so far. Just like India, South Africa, too, are a bat-first team. Even though they blew apart Afghanistan bowling first in the semis, the strength of the Proteas lies in going berserk at the top, courtesy IPL superstars like Quinton de Kock , Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller and a few others.Almost all the teams have been wary of taking first strike against India but this South African bunch will surely bat if they win the toss. The last time that happened was in the game against United States at the Nassau County ground and a chase of 110 didn't look straight-forward for a while.It's almost a given though that India, too, will like to bat first and take South Africa out of the contest. The Proteas pace-attack has a bit of venom to it and it is important that Kohli gets a few runs in this game. ""We understand his class. Form is never a problem when you've played for 15 years. Probably he is saving for the final,"" said Rohit, showing confidence in a long-time colleague.Friday was bright and sunny in Bridgetown but there is a likelihood of thunderstorms on Saturday. In case of a washout, the final will be played on the 'reserve day' Sunday.",India face South Africa in the T20 World Cup final at Kensington Oval. Captain Rohit Sharma's side are looking for their first World Cup win since 2007. South Africa have won all eight of their matches so far. The Proteas are known for going berserk at the top.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111354207,imgsize-56334,width-400,resizemode-4/111354207.jpg"

He played an unbeaten 91-run knock in the final. His six over long on off Kulasekara is etched in everybody's mind. That's why I think Virat Kohli has a great chance to become a hero. He must forget that he is in poor form. He had hit a century when India last played South Africa in the ODI World Cup at Eden Gardens. He was brilliant that day and played very well but he wasn't slogging that day but was playing the ball on merit with proper cricket shots.""Kais adds, ""So I think in the final, he should play the ball on merit with proper cricket shots, he should not slog by exposing his wickets, he's a great player.

'Six months ago he was not even MI captain': Sourav Ganguly backs Rohit Sharma to end India's ICC trophy drought,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/six-months-ago-he-was-not-even-mi-captain-sourav-ganguly-backs-rohit-sharma-to-end-indias-icc-trophy-drought/articleshow/111344625.cms,"India a dominant force by its performance

NEW DELHI: Former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly praised Rohit Sharma 's captaincy skills on Friday, attributing them to India's undefeated streak in the current T20 World Cup . He encouraged the team to approach the final against South Africa with an unrestrained mindset, aiming to conclude an 11-year drought without an ICC title.The highly anticipated championship match between India and South Africa will take place in Bridgetown, Barbados.The Indian team is determined to secure their first international trophy since their triumphant campaign in the 2013 Champions Trophy.""I'm very happy for Rohit Sharma. Life comes full circle. Six months ago he was not even the captain of Mumbai Indians and the same man is now leading India to a World Cup final, unbeaten,"" Ganguly said, as quoted by PTI, after being roped in as the brand ambassador of Veedol.The former BCCI president Ganguly disclosed that Rohit was hesitant to assume the captaincy responsibilities following Virat Kohli's decision to step down from the leadership role.""He has played two World Cup finals where he has gone into the final unbeaten. That speaks of his captaincy and leadership quality and I'm not surprised because he became captain when I was the BCCI president and when Virat didn't want to captain India anymore.""It took a lot of time to make him captain because he was not ready to captain. It took a lot of pushing from all of us to make him captain and I'm very happy to see the progress of Indian cricket under him.""Ganguly expressed that securing victories in the Indian Premier League (IPL) can occasionally be a more demanding task due to the extended length of the competition.""Rohit has the record of winning five IPL titles, which is a huge achievement. Winning an IPL sometimes is more difficult. Don't misquote me, I'm not saying IPL is better than international cricket.""But you have to win 16-17 (12-13) matches to win an IPL; here you need to win 8-9 matches to win a World Cup. The honour is more in winning the World Cup, and I hope Rohit does it tomorrow.""""I don't think he can lose two World Cup finals in seven (six) months. He will probably jump into the Barbados ocean if he loses two finals under his captaincy in seven months. He has led from the front, batted brilliantly, and I hope it continues tomorrow. Hope India finishes on the right side, and they should play with freedom.""They have been the best side of the competition. I wish them luck, I wish they win. Hope they have a little bit of luck tomorrow because that is required to win big tournaments,"" Ganguly added.India's journey since their triumphant Champions Trophy campaign has been marked by a series of near misses in major tournaments. They fought their way to the final of the 2014 T20 World Cup, showcasing their prowess in the shortest format of the game. However, they fell short at the final hurdle, unable to clinch the coveted title.""I look at it differently. At least we are getting to the finals, we can only win once we get to the final,"" he said.""The positive thing is India is not getting eliminated. Secondly, they are dominating. You saw the World Cup in India seven months ago; they were the best side in the competition, although they lost to Australia in the final.""They were a better side than Australia right through the tournament; they just had one bad day,"" he pointed out.Ganguly expressed his views on South Africa's historic achievement of reaching the World Cup final for the first time since their reintegration into international cricket in 1991.""It's a huge moment for South African cricket. Imagine a team that came back to international cricket in 1992, and it took them 32 years to play in a World Cup final. So, it's going to be a big day for both teams,"" he said.Kohli has been experiencing a relatively average performance in the current World Cup while opening the batting order. However, Ganguly believes that Kohli should maintain his position and not shift to the No. 3 spot in the lineup.""Virat should continue to open. He just had a World Cup of 700 runs seven months ago. He is human. Sometimes, he will also fail, and you have to accept it.""People like Kohli, (Sachin) Tendulkar, (Rahul) Dravid, they are institutions for Indian cricket. Three-four matches don't make them weaker players. Don't rule him out in the final tomorrow,"" added Ganguly.Former England captain Michael Vaughan has expressed disapproval of the ICC. He alleges that the governing body has given India an advantage by selecting a venue for the World Cup semifinal in Guyana that is conducive to spin bowling.Furthermore, Vaughan has leveled accusations against broadcasters, claiming that they have consistently allocated India the desirable 8pm IST time slot for all of their matches in the tournament.Dismissing such claims, Ganguly said: ""Michael Vaughan is a very dear friend of mine. I don't know how ICC helps India win cricket matches by keeping the broadcast at 8 pm IST in the evening. I don't know how broadcasting wins you cricket matches. You still have to play in the middle and win.""""Secondly, I don't know why Guyana is thought to be a venue for winning when they have gone around and won everywhere.""Ganguly emphasized his stance, asserting that India's unwavering performance in matches has established them as a formidable power in the sport.""Yes, India are a dominant force in world cricket, by its performance, by its broadcast, and by the money it brings to the table.""You know if you own 80 percent of a company's shares, you will get more dividends and profits than others. It's the rule of life. India are the same,"" he said.",Sourav Ganguly praises Rohit Sharma's captaincy skills. India aiming to end 11-year drought without an ICC title.

NEW DELHI: India and South Africa are set to face off in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados on Saturday. As the two unbeaten sides in the tournament gear up for the finale, here's a look at 5 key contests that could determine the course of the match.Rohit Sharma's contest against Marco Jansen will be critical. While it is not yet a well-known rivalry, Rohit’s vulnerability to left-arm pace, revealed previously by Pakistan's Mohammad Amir and Shaheen Shah Afridi, offers Jansen a chance to exploit this weakness.Jansen has been in excellent form during the tournament and could disrupt India's early momentum with his line outside off-stump.Numbers show a slight edge for Rohit, who has faced Jansen in nine T20I innings, scoring 113 runs and being dismissed only once.Virat Kohli's performance in the World Cup has been below par with just 75 runs from seven matches at an average of 10.71. Kohli will face a formidable opponent in Kagiso Rabada during the title clash. Rabada, with 12 wickets from eight matches, has an impressive economy rate of 5.88, considering his frequent bowling during the Powerplay and death overs.In their T20I meetings, Rabada has dismissed Kohli four times in 13 innings, conceding only 51 runs.This is a crucial matchup and Kohli will need to be cautious with Rabada’s incoming deliveries, particularly while attempting his trademark swat-flick.Another key battle involves Rishabh Pant and Keshav Maharaj. Pant has accumulated 171 runs from seven matches at a strike rate of 129, while Maharaj has taken nine wickets in the same number of matches. Pant, batting at No.3, is likely to face Maharaj within the first 10 overs.Maharaj will need to bowl with utmost accuracy to curtail Pant’s unconventional shots. Notably, Pant has been dismissed thrice while attempting the reverse sweep and paddle shot.Jasprit Bumrah versus Quinton de Kock is another anticipated duel. De Kock, who is the highest run-scorer for South Africa in this tournament with 204 runs from eight matches at a strike rate of 143, has given South Africa an edge in some low-scoring games. However, de Kock will confront Bumrah, who is considered one of the best bowlers in the world currently.Bumrah has taken 13 wickets from seven matches with an extraordinary economy rate of 4.12. De Kock will need to be at his peak to score runs off Bumrah or even to avoid losing his wicket.Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav will be up against Heinrich Klaasen. While Klaasen has a reputation for being a destructive player against spin, he has only managed 138 runs from eight matches in this World Cup at a strike rate of 112.Klaasen will need to rediscover his range-hitting abilities to provide momentum for South Africa in the middle overs, whether they are setting or chasing a target.Both teams carry different strengths and weaknesses into this decisive match, and the performances of these players will likely determine which side comes out on top.",India and South Africa face off in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados.

Sharma led the way with a fifty, helping his side overcome the defending champions. Spinners Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav were instrumental in India's success, each claiming three wickets to dismiss England for 103 All Out at the Guyana National Stadium in Providence on Thursday, June 27.The Caribbean, particularly Barbados, is experiencing significant disruptions due to rain, affecting the T20 World Cup 2024. Both teams and officials faced delays of nearly six hours at the Grantley Adams airport due to rain, according to ESPN Cricinfo. Most matches in the Caribbean and the USA have encountered rain interruptions , leading to some games being washed out entirely or shortened.The weather remains a concern for the T20 World Cup 2024, with a storm warning issued for the final on Saturday, June 29.There is a special provision for the final match day, offering an extra advantage to ensure the title clash can proceed despite the weather forecast. Further information on the T20 World Cup 2024 final rain rules will be crucial as the event progresses.If rain interrupts play or there is a delay during a match, the game can be completed using an additional 190 minutes. To constitute a match in the knockout stages, a minimum of 10 overs must be bowled to the side batting second, unless a result is achieved earlier.If both teams do not get a chance to play a minimum of 10 overs each, then the match will be moved to the reserve day, according to the guidelines.

This reserve day setup is similar to the one used for the first semi-final in Trinidad.There are some rules that will be followed if the reserve day is going to be used due to a wash out on the scheduled match day.In accordance with the playing conditions set by the ICC, a Super Over will be utilized to decide the victorious team should the final match end in a tie. However, if the Super Over cannot take place, and no winner is determined on the reserve day, the match will be considered a no result. Furthermore, if weather conditions hinder the completion of the Super Over, or if the match is abandoned or results in a no result, both teams - India and South Africa - will be declared as joint winners and will share the trophy.The weather forecast indicates a cloudy, breezy, and humid day with a couple of showers and a thunderstorm expected in the early hours and afternoon. AccuWeather predicts a 20 to 47 percent chance of precipitation during the playing hours, with the weather remaining cloudy. Thunderstorms are anticipated from 3 AM to 5 AM local time and again from 3 PM to 5 PM local time.As the game is scheduled to be played from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM local time, there is a possibility of an uninterrupted match on Saturday (June 29) due to the forecast of only cloudy weather during the playing hours.

He pointed out that India's semifinal venue was predetermined even before they secured their spot in the last-four stage of the tournament.After India exacted a sweet revenge of their 2022 T20 World Cup semifinal loss against England with a thumping 68-run, Vaughan continued to remain defiant with his stand.""If England had beaten SA they would have got the Trinidad semi and I believe they would have won that game .. So no complaints they haven’t been good enough .. But Guyana has been a lovely venue pick for India,"" he wrote on X.But Vaughan's post did not sit well with former India star spinner Harbhajan Singh who handed him a reality check and enlightened him about the misery England suffered against India in all departments of the game.""What makes u think Guyana was a good venue for India ?

Literally it's that. You know that.

"Three ICC finals in 12 months testament to our consistency, hope luck is with us this time: Rahul Dravid",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/three-icc-finals-in-12-months-testament-to-our-consistency-hope-luck-is-with-us-this-time-rahul-dravid/articleshow/111347453.cms,"Dravid on Barbados familiarity

NEW DELHI: The outgoing India head coach Rahul Dravid commended the team's exceptional consistency in reaching three ICC finals within the past year. He expressed his optimism that a blend of intelligent gameplay and good fortune would enable India to secure a long-awaited ICC championship.Throughout the current T20 World Cup , India has demonstrated their superiority, mirroring their performance in the ODI World Cup held in their home country the previous year.However, in that tournament, they stumbled at the final obstacle against Australia.Rohit Sharma and his team are now set to face South Africa in the final at Barbados' Kensington Oval. They are determined to clinch a ICC title, a feat they last achieved during the 2013 Champions Trophy.""It is a good thing we have been consistently playing good cricket. We have been in finals in all three formats and credit goes to the players. If we play well and rub of the green goes (our way) we will surely win,"" Dravid, as quoted by PTI, said.As the final approaches, athletes often experience heightened pressure. However, given the mere 24-hour gap between the semifinal and final, India has limited opportunities for mental preparation.Despite the swift journey from Guyana to Barbados following their semifinal victory against England, Dravid expressed confidence in the team's mental readiness for the upcoming contest.""In terms of our preparation, we've just got one day in the middle, so it's unlikely we're going to be having practice.""It's just about all the guys getting into ensuring that physically, mentally, tactically we are ready for the game.""Dravid emphasized his team's readiness for the crucial encounter at the top.""Those are the things that we can control, that we are fresh, that we've looked after all our niggles, if there are any. We've done all our tactical preparation and we're mentally relaxed and excited and looking forward to the game.""We'll be looking to do that in the next 24 hours and try and get ourselves in the right frame of mind to be able to play that game,"" said the former India captain.In 2023, India suffered two devastating losses in ICC finals. They were defeated by Australia in both the World Test Championship (WTC) final and the ODI World Cup final.The question that arises is whether the Indian team has learned from these heartbreaking experiences.""No, nothing. I thought we were very well-prepared in Ahmedabad (ODI WC). We ticked all the boxes and, on that day, the other team played better. That's part of the sport.""The other team that's coming there to play has also obviously reached the final because they're a good team and they're playing very good cricket as well. So, they have as much right to win it as we do, but we hope that we'll play better cricket on the day,"" he said.India managed to score 181 runs in their Super 8 match against Afghanistan, despite the challenging pitch conditions that made playing on the up difficult. The team aimed to apply the lessons learned from that game in their upcoming encounter with South Africa, according to Dravid.The Indian team hoped to leverage their experience on a tricky surface and adapt their approach accordingly when facing the South African side.""Yeah, I mean, just the fact that we've played a game in Barbados is nice. It's nice that we have that familiarity of having played on that surface in the past.""But again, I think it's very hard to... We're not going to get exactly the same wicket that we got last time. I mean, it can be different, right?Dravid praised the team's collective effort in preparing for this prestigious event, highlighting their ability to adapt to various situations. He acknowledged the hard work put in by the entire squad leading up to the tournament.""I think what's really important is that we've done really well as a group. This whole tournament we have shown the ability to adapt, to recognize what is a good score. We played very differently in New York, then we played in St. Lucia, then we played even in Barbados when I thought that the game was quite slow.""I'm just hoping that whatever we come up against, we will have the ability to recognize it and be able to play accordingly, as we've done in the last three games,"" said Dravid.India demonstrated their capability to achieve substantial scores on challenging pitches, as exemplified by their performance in the semifinal at Guyana. Despite the low bounce of the surface, they succeeded in amassing a total of 171 runs.South Africa managed to break the long-running semifinal jinx in the World Cup and Dravid expressed his belief that the Proteas will enter the match unencumbered by any past disappointments or setbacks.""Not really, I mean it's not that the same players have been playing since 1991 and there's so many players that come and go. I don't think that really matters. I can't speak for them. But I don't think players go in keeping their baggage of the past.Likewise, Dravid expressed confidence in the Indian team's resilience and their capacity to bounce back from the setback they faced in Ahmedabad the previous year.""Players are very good at moving on from things, recognizing things. So, we will move on from Ahmedabad. I'm sure they will not be thinking about history. It'll be a fresh day.""Two good teams, two teams I think that everyone will agree will probably be the top two teams in this tournament. So, deserving finals for both the teams. And, hopefully, it's a great game of cricket. Hopefully, we fall on the right side,"" added Dravid.",Rahul Dravid hails India's consistency in reaching three ICC finals in the past year. India will face South Africa in the final of the T20 World Cup in Barbados.

According to Ganguly, former India batter Gautam Gambhir is a strong contender for the position after the conclusion of the T20 World Cup .""I think he will be the next coach (for Team India),"" Ganguly, as quoted by ANI, told mediapersons.As the T20 World Cup concludes, the BCCI finds itself at a crucial juncture regarding the future of the Indian cricket team's coaching staff. Rahul Dravid , who has been serving as the head coach, has made it clear that he does not wish to extend his contract beyond the tournament.""Every game I have coached for India is important. This is the last tournament in job. I have enjoyed coaching India, it is great to work with these boys. It is a special job. But there are schedules where I find myself that at this stage of my life, I won't be able to apply,"" Dravid had said earlier.Gambhir has emerged as a leading candidate for the position of head coach. During the 2024 season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Gambhir served as the team mentor for the Kolkata Knight Riders.Under his guidance, KKR achieved remarkable success, securing their third IPL title. Gambhir's experience as a player and his proven leadership skills have made him a strong contender for the head coach role.Ganguly lauded the India team for reaching the T20 World Cup final. ""To get to two World Cup finals in 7 months speaks volumes about the capability & strength of the team...They will not make any changes to the team and this is Rohit Sharma 's leadership style. It will be the same team...I wish they win it tomorrow,"" the 51-year-old added.India will take on South Africa in the T20 World Cup final on Saturday at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados.",Former India skipper Sourav Ganguly says Gautam Gambhir is a strong contender for the position.

Nothing taking away from their (Indian) batters today; they were phenomenal,"" news agency PTI quoted Tucker as saying in the post-day press conference.Although the Proteas managed to keep Shafali silent during the preceding ODI series, as she managed only 52 runs in three outings, Tucker felt that the Test format gave the Indian ample time to settle down and find her range.""It's a different format, and obviously, she (Shafali) has more time (to settle down). She gave her all and made the most of the opportunity since she is a great batter,"" said Tucker.""Yes, we were a bit off from our lines (with the ball) and wish we could have been better. But, nothing to take away from her as she did (bat) really well.""The pitch was expected to favor spin, but that was not evident on the first day.Misfields and overthrows further compounded South Africa's troubles.Tucker admitted South Africa could not fully execute their strategies and that the city's hot weather also played a role.""We did try a few things when Smriti and Verma were batting. We switched to around the wicket and changed the field. We were happy with it for some time, but they took it away,"" she acknowledged.""We could have definitely been better on the field. Yeah, it's hot out there. Also, overthrows and misfields are not the best of things. But, staying positive and sharp could help in avoiding those misfields.""However, Tucker observed that the pitch had begun to offer some turn, which they hoped to capitalize on Day 2.""We knew this wicket was going to be good for spin and there was early movement upfront. There was more spin after lunch and we need to take more advantage of it tomorrow,"" she said.Explaining a significant challenge, Tucker pointed out that South Africa does not have a proper red-ball setup at home, with no multi-day competitions, making the transition to Test cricket tougher despite thorough preparation.""We (SA Women) are still young (in) Test cricket, so we are still getting used to it. It's tough unlike T20s and ODIs, but we are still learning.""I don't think we did too bad.

Additionally, Panesar made a bold prediction regarding struggling Virat Kohli .As the tournament reaches its climax, with the undefeated teams of India and South Africa set to face off in the final, Panesar has placed his faith in the Indian side led by Rohit Sharma to emerge victorious.Furthermore, he forecasted that Kohli, who has been experiencing a lean patch, would rise to the occasion and score a century against the formidable South African team.""India will win the T20 World Cup final , and Virat Kohli will score 100,"" Panesar told ANI.Kohli's recent performances in the T20 World Cup have been a far cry from his stellar run in the IPL 2024 season with the Royal Challengers Bengaluru. The former Indian captain, who had been in sublime form during the IPL, has found runs hard to come by in the ongoing international tournament, struggling to find his rhythm at the top of the order alongside Rohit Sharma.In the IPL 2024, Kohli had a phenomenal season, amassing 741 runs at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of 154.69, with a century and five half-centuries, ultimately claiming the Orange Cap for the most runs scored in the tournament.However, Kohli's fortunes have taken a drastic turn in the T20 World Cup. Across seven matches, the experienced batsman has only managed to score 75 runs at a dismal average of 10.71, failing to make a significant impact for his team throughout the tournament.Rohit expressed confidence in his fellow Indian player's ability to deliver an impressive performance when facing South Africa in Barbados on Saturday. In addition to Panesar, the skipper believes his teammate has the potential to put on a remarkable display during the upcoming match against the Proteas.""He (Kohli) is a quality player. Any player can go through that. We do understand his class, and we do understand his importance in all these big games. Form is never a problem.

They are outright match-winners in spin-friendly conditions,"" Sarandeep told PTI Videos on Friday.""We are having at the world's best spinners at the moment. Look at the way Kuldeep and Axar came in, they are winning all the games. They are unplayable. Everyone is talking about Kuldeep. He is going to destroy the South African middle order.""He has done it against Australia (in Super 8s) and England (in semifinals). Now it's the turn of South Africa. Axar is also a very dangerous slow left-arm orthodox bowler. An outright match-winner. Indian spinners will win the final.""Both India and South Africa come into the final without having lost a single match in the World Cup. South Africa have won all their eight games, while India emerged victorious in seven, with their match against Canada in Florida being washed out due to rain.Sarandeep, who played three Tests and five ODIs, emphasized that the spin-friendly conditions at Bridgetown would work well in favor of Kuldeep and Axar. He pointed out how effective Axar has been, especially when he begins taking wickets from the sixth over, thus easing the pressure on the rest of the bowling attack.""Axar starts getting wickets from the sixth over. It's not easy for Axar to bowl in powerplay. He comes, bowls, and makes things easy for the rest of the bowlers. Kuldeep and Axar are complementing each other so well.""The wickets in West Indies are not easy to play especially if you have world-class spinners like Kuldeep and Axar. It was not easy for England, it will not be easy for South Africa as well,"" Sarandeep observed.The former India off-spinner added that skipper Rohit Sharma was spot on in his assessment of Caribbeans conditions and opted for four spinners.""Rohit opted for four spinners but (Yuzvendra) Chahal is not in the scheme of things. The reason is, others have done their job exceedingly well. (Ravindra) Jadeja is the senior-most player but he is not coming into powerplay. Axar knows how to bowl in these conditions. He is the best option for us to bowl into the powerplay. He is giving the results as well,"" he added.On whether South African spinners Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi could also trouble the Indian batters, Sarandeep said, ""Yes they will. Keshav and Shamsi are also very good. Let's see how Indian batsmen handle the spinners.""India has a very strong middle order. India has left-handers like Rishabh Pant, Shivam Dube, Axar, and Jadeja. Four left-handers in the middle order. It will be interesting to see how Maharaj and Shamsi are going to tackle them. And vice-versa. This will be a big challenge for them also.""Sarandeep further asserted that India boasts the best batting and bowling lineup in the world, highlighting the exceptional bowling economy of ace bowler Jasprit Bumrah throughout the tournament.""Bumrah's economy is 3.5 or 3.6. This is so unreal. Other bowlers go over 9 or 10. Even after eight games, his economy is 3.5. This is so unreal. What else can you ask from him? India is the favourites not only in batting but bowling as well.""The former cricketer played down Virat Kohli's lack of form. Virat has scored only 76 runs in seven innings.""Virat is waiting for the final to perform. He is a world-class player, no doubt. He is mentally very strong. He is a team man. He is playing for the team. And there is some plan given to him.""Normally he opens only in the IPL. But here he had been given a clear-cut role. Virat is trying to hit from the first ball and trying to put more pressure on the bowlers. But somehow he is getting out quickly. But I am not worried about him. He is a big-match player. And that big game is coming. His big innings is coming against South Africa.""",Former India spinner Sarandeep Singh believes that India's spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel will prove to be too much for the South Africans to handle.

Mithali's 214 had come off 407 balls and the former India skipper had achieved it during the drawn second Test against England at Taunton in August, 2002.After scoring a sparkling double ton, the 20-year-old said she enjoyed her power-hitting and termed the knock as a 'precious treasure'.""It's a special moment for me and I will savour it as a precious treasure for the rest of my life. It is my second favourite knock after the U-19 (T20) World Cup (title win),"" news agency PTI quote Shafali as saying in the post-day press meet.""I couldn't convert the starts I gained in the ODIs (vs SA in Bengaluru). Today, my plan was to take my time as the ball was moving initially, and they were also bowling well,"" said Shafali.""I was backing my strength and tried to gradually settle down. With God's grace, I have managed to get my first 100 and 200 at the same time, which is a tribute to my hard work, so really happy to contribute to the team.""Shafali cracked 23 fours and eight sixes during her beadthtaking knock and brought up her double-ton with consecutive sixes of off-spinner Delmi Tucker, followed by a single.The opener eventually got run out at 205 off 197 balls.The ton was Shafali's maiden international three-digit score across all three formats.The 20-year-old's previous best was 96 against England three years ago, and she admitted that there were a few jitters when she was in the 90s.""No one forgets getting dismissed on 96, and I remembered that moment while I was on 96 (today).

Diaz's powerful strike found the top corner, giving Colombia the lead.Colombia came close to doubling their advantage in the 37th minute when veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picked out Diaz at the back post with a precise cross.

This unexpected result has given the Slovaks belief that they can overcome their higher-ranked opponent and progress further in the competition.""The English have quality, but every opponent they have played were able to torment them,"" Slovakia midfielder Ondrej Duda told TV Markíza.Slovakia's head coach, Francesco Calzona , referred to his squad as the unexpected success story of the group stage following their victory against Belgium. Meanwhile, the underdog team from Georgia also exceeded predictions by stunning Portugal with a 2-0 win, demonstrating that no team should be underestimated.Although England supporters celebrated their team's placement on the more favorable side of the tournament bracket, potentially providing a less challenging path to the final, this advantage exists only in theory.""I think everyone has seen in this competition that there is not a favourable side of the draw,"" England defender Marc Guehi told reporters on Thursday. ""Every team, every opponent, is really tough to come up against. I think we need to remain calm.""England demonstrated some progress in the latter half of their goalless draw against Slovenia on Tuesday, with Kobbie Mainoo and Cole Palmer making a positive impact as substitutes.Although England's backline was a significant worry prior to the tournament due to the absence of experienced players like Harry Maguire, it has been the strongest aspect of the team's Euro performance . Throughout the group stage, England have conceded the fewest expected goals (xG) - a metric that quantifies the quality of scoring opportunities allowed to opponents.Southgate will be hoping for an improved display from Jude Bellingham , who excelled in the first half of their 1-0 victory against Serbia but faded in the subsequent two matches.Slovakia's key player is the skillful Napoli midfielder Stanislav Lobotka , whom Italian legend Andrea Pirlo described as ""the best playmaker in the Italian league.""Calzona, who had served as an assistant throughout his career before being named Slovakia's manager in 2022, stated that his team had already achieved their primary objective of reaching Euro.

Murray, a former world number one and a three-time Grand Slam champion, with two Wimbledon titles, has expressed his hope to compete in Wimbledon, albeit acknowledging the likelihood of participating in the singles event is slim.""The last week's been pretty tough. There's obviously a lot going on with me planning on finishing at the Olympics ,"" said Murray, as quoted by AFP.The tennis star has been advised by several surgeons to undergo immediate treatment for the cyst, which, if left untreated, could lead to further complications.Despite the surgery not being classified as major, the issue was deemed serious due to the potential for additional health concerns. Post-operation, Murray reported positive outcomes, mentioning his ability to hit balls again, though he remains uncertain about the timeline for his return to competitive tennis.""Although the surgery is not a major surgery, the problem was a serious problem because, if the cyst continues to grow -- obviously at Queen's I basically lost the strength, coordination and everything in my right leg on my way to the court -- you're likely to have other complications as well,"" he added.In light of the upcoming Wimbledon draw and the commencement of first-round matches, Murray and his brother Jamie were granted the final wildcard for the men's doubles by the All England Club.""It's complicated, and it's made more complicated because I want to play at Wimbledon one more time.
