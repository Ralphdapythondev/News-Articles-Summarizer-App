However, early overs could favor pacers, making them valuable picks.With 264 runs in 6 innings, Samson's consistent and composed batting has been a highlight of IPL 2024.

'Ricky Bhui and gulf between Ranji Trophy and IPL'

'Impact batter changing template of opening in T20Is'

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant will play ""every day of the week"" in head coach Ricky Ponting 's Indian squad for the forthcoming T20 World Cup , even though several well-known players are making a strong case with some outstanding performances in the current IPL Ponting was uncertain about Pant's ability to return to the field after the horrifying vehicle accident in December 2022.But given how he has been doing since getting back into the game and his incredible fortitude, the DC head coach is certain that he will be the player boarding the plane to New York by the end of the IPL.""Do I believe whether Rishabh should be there in the World Cup squad? Absolutely I do. He deserves to be in that T20 World Cup squad by the end of the IPL,"" Ponting told PTI in an exclusive interview.""I think we have seen Rishabh play the way we have seen him play in the last five or six years in the IPL, and now back playing for India,"" added the Australian batting great.Pant continues to be Ponting's first pick even though he recognised that Indian selectors have several alternatives when selecting a keeper-batter.""One thing we certainly know is that there is a lot of depth around Indian cricket. With keeper-batters, I feel some guys are in really good form at the moment. (Ishan) Kishan is playing well, (Sanju) Samson is playing well and KL Rahul is playing well.""There are a lot of options but if I was picking a team, I would have Rishabh Pant in it every day of the week,"" the 'Punter' made his call.Ponting and Pant have shared a special bond that has grown since his appointment as DC coach, and he gets a little emotional when he sees Pant performing at his best once again.""Rishabh's comeback to international cricket is nothing short of remarkable. I spent a lot of time with him during last IPL and a lot of us were actually sceptical about whether he will actually play the game again, such a horrific accident and I had spoken to him about it, I wasn't sure whether he would play again.""But like with all champions, Pant refused to throw in the towel.""There was never any doubt in his mind that he would be back playing again. As each game goes by, we are starting to see a better and better version of Rishabh Pant, his batting has had more impact in the last couple of games compared to the start of the tournament, he is starting to move well behind the stumps,"" the coach sounded ecstatic.The Delhi Capitals have often faced criticism for their domestic scouting practices since the majority of their uncapped players have not been able to light up the stage. One example is Ricky Bhui, who amassed an incredible 902 runs in the Ranji Trophy, but the Andhra captain seemed to be a work in progress during the IPL.Ponting attempted to justify the scouting procedure when questioned. However, he did provide some perspective, discussing the wide disparity and the difficulty of an uncapped local talent suddenly stepping up to the IPL's international standards.""Ricky Bhui's point that you make is a perfect example of that. He had a terrific season, looked incredible every time he has batted in the nets through last month, but when he comes up against Nandre Burger he has never seen fast bowling like that, never faced someone who could bowl high 140 kmph and executed perfect bouncer second ball, you feel for the players certainly but I don't think we have done anything wrong recruitment wise,"" Ponting said.For Ponting, one of the big problems was the absence of their number one auction pick Harry Brook.""You have to remember, Harry Brook, our No. 1 pick, decided not to come. We were a little unsure how much we were supposed to get out of Rishabh, if he plays at all, let alone keeping and batting.""A bit of our strategy was on finding a second keeper batter, which we did with Kushagra,"" he said.""Definitely, a big part of scouting is to identify guys who can make the next step up, and that too really quickly because it is a big step up from playing domestic cricket in India to playing IPL,"" he reasoned.Virat Kohli scored an IPL hundred this season off 67 balls, MI's Rohit Sharma completed his ton in 61 deliveries, while Travis Head needed merely 39 balls to reach the milestone.Is a 60-ball-100 by an opener in T20 slowly becoming a thing of the past? Ponting gave an insightful explanation.""Not necessarily that you have to score 40-ball 100 (every time). It also depends on scoring rate of other batters around you. It's no good getting 60-ball 100 if the guy at other end is also scoring at 100 strike-rate, and then you would often end up with 180 (MI 186/6 vs CSK),"" Ponting said.""Like Travis Head last night, he is becoming a very good white ball player, but if you don't have that eighth batter, which comes in form of Impact player, I don't know whether teams would be as attacking as they have been,"" Ponting concluded.","Rishabh Pant will play ""every day of the week"" in India's T20 World Cup squad, says Ricky Ponting. Ponting was uncertain about Pant's ability to return to the field after the horrifying vehicle accident in December 2022. Pant continues to be Ponting's first pick even though he recognised that Indian selectors have several alternatives.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109351142,imgsize-65026,width-400,resizemode-4/109351142.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Succumbing to a fifth straight defeat of the season, Royal Challengers Bengaluru once again had a tough night, this time against Sunrisers Hyderabad as they lost a record high-scoring encounter at the Chinnaswamy on Monday.With RCB bowlers getting ripped apart, Sunrisers raked up 287 for 3 -- the highest ever total in the history of the Indian Premier League.As the RCB bowlers took a beating of a lifetime, former skipper Virat Kohli was on an emotional roller-coaster with hurt written all over his face.As boundaries rained and ball flew into the stands for a record number of times at the Chinnaswamy, Kohli's disappointed reactions, on numerous occasions, said it all.And during RCB's chase as well, when Kohli kicked off in style, but then got out after scoring a quickfire 20-ball 42, his angered walk back to the pavilion -- punching his bat and screaming -- was another sight the franchise fans had to endure.Hyderabad, who were invited to bat first by hosts Bengaluru, went past the previous mark of 277 they made last month after a 41-ball 102 by Travis Head and Heinrich Klaasen's explosive 67.The new high was the second best in a T20 match after Nepal bludgeoned 314-3 against Mongolia in last year's Asian Games in Hangzhou.As RCB ended up with 262 for 7 in chase of a record 288, the match produced the highest aggregate for a T20 game with a tally of 549 runs.With the defeat, RCB remain at the bottom of the table with 6 losses and a solitary win in 7 matches.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru lose to Sunrisers Hyderabad in Indian Premier League.

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans ' batter B Sai Sudharsan has expressed confidence that his side is working hard on improving their catching and ground fielding, having dropped 12 catches in six IPL matches so far.Titans, who snapped Rajasthan Royals ' unbeaten run with a three-wicket win in a narrow chase, will return to action on Wednesday with a clash against Delhi Capitals in Ahmedabad.The IPL 2022 winners did manage to get over the line in a tense finish against Royals but their task would have been much easier had Matthew Wade held on to a chance to dismiss Riyan Parag early in his innings.Parag had a fortunate escape when he was on just six runs, courtesy of a missed opportunity by the Australian wicketkeeper-batter. Taking full advantage of this lifeline, Parag went on to play a remarkable innings. His knock of 76 runs came off a mere 48 deliveries, showcasing his attacking intent and ability to score quickly.""Every fielder who is fielding, he wants to take a catch. He wants to contribute in any such way possible. But even after the last game, we are a team which practice a lot, we field a lot actually, we field every day,"" Sudharsan told the media in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.""It didn't change like after the last game — we didn't try and field more or do all those kinds of things. It's just (about) being aware and being ready for the fight.""Titans' fielding has been a concern throughout the IPL season, with at least one catch being dropped in each game. However, the match against Rajasthan Royals saw them miss three chances, marking the second time they've had such a poor fielding performance.Previously, Titans had also dropped three catches, including a difficult one, in their encounter with Punjab Kings. That game took place at the Narendra Modi Stadium, where Kings managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, winning by a narrow margin of three wickets.""That (is something) we have definitely had a conversation that whatever happens, just be for the fight and give your 100 per cent in the field,"" Sudharsan added.Sudharsan disclosed that both Wriddhiman Saha , the wicketkeeper-batter, and David Miller , overseas star, have recovered from their injuries and are available for selection in the upcoming match against Capitals.When asked about the notion that Titans' batters have been starting their innings slowly and taking too long to finish the game, as seen in the match against Rajasthan, the left-handed batsman disagreed with the assessment.""(The) situation asked us to be deeper there. (The) situation asked us, to me, (to) the game deeper. Definitely if the situation rises, if the wickets are that great, (or) if we are chasing a bigger target, for sure we have to start getting runs from the first,"" he said.",Gujarat Titans have dropped 12 catches in six IPL matches so far.

NEW DELHI: Yuzvendra Chahal , Riyan Parag , Kumar Sangakkara , and other members of the Rajasthan Royals showered praise on their captain, Sanju Samson , as he celebrates a decade with the team on Tuesday.Dishant Yagnik, a former wicketkeeper for RR who was sidelined due to injury when Samson joined the team, expressed his joy at passing the keeping gloves to the then 18-year-old Samson.Yagnik, now serving as the team's fielding coach, recalled the moment fondly.Samson made his IPL debut for the Rajasthan Royals in April 2013 and has been an integral part of the team ever since.""I told him to carry forward the franchise as a wicketkeeper. And I told him that I knew that after playing in the IPL, he would play for India 100 percent,"" Dishant said.The team manager, Romi Bhinder, said the first page of Sanju's 'first chapter' was Rahul Dravid and Shane Watson, the two senior players and captains of the franchise when Sanju arrived on the Pink franchise.""Sanju had in mind to be a Royal like Rahul Bhai, Shane Watson and Shane Warne. That is when the colour started taking over him,"" he added.Young all-rounder Riyan Parag, who has been in a rich vein of form during the ongoing IPL season as a top-order batter following several underperforming seasons in the role of a finisher, said Samson was always there for him whenever he felt down and short of runs. He also said his skipper is emotional and is someone he would like to win matches for.""It has been six players with him, Sanju Bhaiya. He always had the presence of being an actual captain. He was always there. He was making those decisions on the field and off it. He was always a part of the leadership group. He is the captain I want to win matches for. That is the best captain you can have. The journey I had with RR, he had the same journey for a longer period of time. Whenever I was down, whenever I was not scoring, he was always open. He has got a lot of emotions, he wears them on his sleeve. You know when he is angry, happy. I like to see him happy most of the time,"" said Parag, who has scored 284 runs in six matches this season, with three fifties.Chahal said Samson is a chilled-out skipper and does not overthink ahead of the team's matches.""Last match, he had his 50th game as a captain. IPL is like that. You have a lot of ups and downs. When you win and lose, everything is on the captain. He is very chill, does not overthink on games and understands things,"" said the ace spinner.Sangakkara said people in the franchise have rooted for him all the time and the more people have seen of him, they realise how great a servant he has been for RR and could be for Indian cricket in the long run.""It is great to see so much people pour out their love and support for him. It has been a privilege to work for him. It is just the start, he is only 29, he has got eight to nine years left with this franchise. It is emotionally and professionally, his home,"" he added.Samson represented RR from 2013-15 and then from 2018 onwards, following a brief stint with the Delhi Capitals from 2016-17, when the franchise was banned for spot-fixing charges along with the Chennai Super Kings (CSK). He was appointed as the franchise's captain in 2021 and took them to the finals in 2022, where they lost to the Gujarat Titans.In 130 matches for the Royals, he has scored 3,475 runs at an average of 31.02 and a strike rate of 140.57.

NEW DELHI: The better use of the Indian Premier League 's ' impact substitute rule ' has been the key reason for the high-scoring matches in this season's Twenty20 competition, according to experts.The tournament has witnessed numerous scoring records being broken. Sunrisers Hyderabad achieved a new milestone by scoring 287-3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru , surpassing their previous record of 277-3 against Mumbai Indians set just three weeks ago.Travis Head's 39-ball century, which is the fourth-fastest in the tournament's 17-season history, was a standout performance for Hyderabad. Heinrich Klaasen 's innings, where he hit seven sixes in his 67 off 31 balls, also contributed significantly to the team's success.""Impact player makes a big difference,"" Klaasen said after his team's 25-run victory in Bengaluru.""It's nice to see our boys striking it nicely and our bowlers can at least defend 270, which is always a positive sign.""The impact player rule was introduced last year and allows the replacement of a player named in the starting team at any point after the toss.The rule states that teams batting first have the option to include an additional big-hitting batsman towards the end of the batting lineup, who, as the rule specifies, can be substituted by a bowler during the fielding innings. On the other hand, 'Alternatively a bowler can be replaced if they bat second.'""The impact player rule has definitely worked,"" former India women's captain Mithali Raj said in a Star Sports press meet on Monday.Five substitutes can be designated for selection, and the one utilized must be an 'Indian', unless the starting XI has less than 'four' overseas players. Teams have been leveraging the rule to increase the probability of 'quick runs' in the 'final few overs'.""We have seen how it has helped teams to post big totals and... especially it has helped teams in chasing,"" said Raj.Hyderabad's total was the second highest men's score in Twenty20s after the 314-3 scored by Nepal against Mongolia at last year's Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.Bengaluru fell short by 20 runs after their impact substitute Anuj Rawat hit a 14-ball 25 to help his team finish on 262-7.The 549-run aggregate in Monday's encounter was the highest in any T20 match.""It's the intensity that these guys are playing at now, it is the new way. These guys are not frightened,"" said former England batsman Kevin Pietersen during TV commentary.Hyderabad amassed their previous record of 277-3 against Mumbai Indians on March 27, but days later Kolkata almost eclipsed it with 272-7 in their 106-run win over Delhi Capitals.Kolkata opener Sunil Narine led the way with a fearless 85 off 39 balls and Delhi coach Ricky Ponting believes substitutes give the top order extra freedom to play shots.""I feel the impact players had a bit of an influence on that (total),"" Ponting said after the defeat.""The fact is that most teams have now got someone reasonably good that can bat at number nine, and sometimes even a specialist batsman at number eight.""That definitely helps, so it gives the batting team the extra freedom to go harder earlier.""But former India pace bowler Irfan Pathan said there was a flipside to the impact player rule with the role of all-rounders diminishing as they were often replaced after their batting or bowling stint.""Impact player rule is benefiting (the) entertainment part of cricket, which is high-scoring games,"" Pathan told reporters.""But Indian cricket will have to think about it going forward as far as all-rounders are concerned.""",Sunrisers Hyderabad achieve a new milestone by scoring 287-3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: In the IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bengaluru , the focus was primarily on hitting sixes rather than showcasing traditional batting skills, according to Aaron Finch , the captain of Australia's T20 World Cup-winning team.SRH posted a formidable total of 287 for three, surpassing their previous record of 277/3 against Mumbai Indians on March 27 in Hyderabad.This impressive score was largely due to Travis Head 's first-ever T20 century and Heinrich Klaasen 's destructive innings of 67 runs.In response, Dinesh Karthik played a blistering knock of 83 runs off just 35 deliveries for RCB . However, his efforts were not enough to secure a victory for his team.

It's a game where you talk about who hit the most sixes and that was the difference,"" Finch said on Star Sports.""They (RCB) had to start at 14 (runs per over). And if you have one bad over it goes to 16.""Finch said the Hyderabad side used the Powerplay segment well.IPL: Points Table ""They (SRH) were getting lucky in the first powerplay and they needed those sixes and Travis Head was the difference there.""He started off well, his intent to get the ball rolling and then a courageous move to keep Klaasen at No. 3 and say we need to keep going, we have a deep batting line-up and we are going to put the bowlers to the sword here,"" added Finch.The aggressive style of play demonstrated by these batsmen has led to significant changes in team strategies and has contributed to exciting matches and impressive victories, such as SRH's recent 25-run triumph.Finch observed that IPL teams have begun to adjust their tactics by promoting powerful strikers like Klaasen in the batting order. These players exhibit a fearless approach to the game.""A lot of times teams think that Klaasen has so much power to the back end, let's hold him back. Like (RCB's) Glenn Maxwell at times, you don't want to expose him right now because if he gets out, then we've got to rebuild. Teams don't think like that anymore.""(SRH coach) Dan Vettori has talked about that, play aggressive, play fearlessly and bear the consequence if it doesn't go right. If it does go right, you don't lose.""Dinesh Karthik once again underlined his value making a 35-ball 83 at a strike-rate of 237. Finch said the ability to strike the ball comes naturally to Karthik, given his more than two decades of experience in the game.""Well, once you've got 20-25 years of experience behind you, and you've got that bulk of balls you've hit throughout your whole career since you were five years old, you don't lose that ability to bat.""So, I think, it works in their favour because they train specifically for that role which they play for their team. They don't over train, they aren't trying to improve on their skills or they aren't trying to improvise anymore, they just train specifically,"" said Finch.The Victorian cricketer added that players like Karthik are examples for others preparing to be specific about their roles.""That should be a lesson for players around the world, that you have to be really specific with your preparation and how you go about it.""You can hit as many balls as you want, if you walk out to the middle with a clouded mind or are not fresh, you're going to find it hard no matter how well you're playing.""","SRH posted a formidable total of 287 for three, surpassing their previous record of 277/3 against Mumbai Indians on March 27 in Hyderabad. Travis Head's first- ever T20 century and Heinrich Klaasen's destructive innings of 67 runs. Dinesh Karthik played a blistering knock of 83 runs off just 35 deliveries for RCB.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109346648,imgsize-76828,width-400,resizemode-4/109346648.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting expressed his understanding and support for Glenn Maxwell 's decision to take an indefinite break from cricket due to mental and physical health concerns. Ponting acknowledged the immense pressure Maxwell faces as a key player for Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) and believed that the Australian all-rounder made the right choice in prioritizing his well-being.Maxwell has struggled with his form this season, scoring low in multiple matches. The constant expectations and demands of being a star player seem to have taken a toll on him. This marks the second time in Maxwell's career that he has taken a break of this nature to focus on his mental and physical health.The decision to rest Maxwell came at his own request, as he asked to be excused from the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday night.""For someone like Glenn in that team (RCB), he being one of the 'Big Dogs' along with Virat, a lot of pressure comes on couple of players playing in that team. If they don't perform, the results tend to not follow them,"" Ponting, who has seen Maxwell from close quarters, told PTI in an exclusive interaction.RCB find themselves at the bottom of the standings in the 10-team league, having suffered six losses in their seven matches played so far.IPL: Points Table ""If you see what they have done in the tournament so far, pressure builds up on individual player as well. I read that article today morning that Glenn wants to step aside, just have a few games off and try and refresh,"" Ponting said, adding that every individual has its own coping mechanism.""Every individual is different right. Some guys would want to get going and push through that and get some runs on board and thus that will change their way of how they think about the game and some guys need to step back and have a break,"" the legendary Aussie and three-time World Cup winner explained.Ponting feels it becomes very important for the coach of a team to prioritize a player's mental well-being.""That's why one needs to be really understanding as a coach now that anyone who is around the cricket team, their health and well-being and welfare of the players is something you think about first.""Ponting believes that for elite athletes, it is important to have their loved ones around them as they are central to their success and failure.""With more and more cricket being played, a lot of times you are away from home when you play international sport. You are away from all the things that make you happy, that certainly is the biggest part of what we do, coaching or playing.""I am lucky to have my family now and I have had them here for a few weeks. It makes it a bit easier for me having spent a lot of time away from my family,"" Ponting added.On Monday, Maxwell came for the press conference and revealed that he himself volunteered for a break.""For me, personally, it was a pretty easy decision. I have been in this situation in the past where you can keep playing and get yourself deeper into a hole"" Maxwell said on Monday night.

But Abdul Samad's knock was the final nail in the coffin,"" he added.The match saw a total of 38 sixes, with Sunrisers Hyderabad hitting a record-breaking 22 sixes and RCB striking 16 of their own.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool 's hopes for a Premier League title took a significant hit as Crystal Palace secured a 1-0 victory at Anfield on Sunday.This defeat marks Liverpool's first home loss in 29 league games, leaving Jurgen Klopp 's squad two points behind Manchester City and on par with Arsenal. Arsenal has the opportunity to claim the top spot with a win over Aston Villa later on Sunday.Eberechi Eze's early goal secured a crucial win for the Eagles in their fight for survival, pushing them eight points clear of the relegation zone.Yet, Liverpool's last season under Klopp appears to be unraveling.Just a few weeks ago, the League Cup champions were on track to achieve a quadruple.But after crashing out of the FA Cup to Manchester United, Liverpool succumbed to a first home defeat in any competition for 14 months when Atalanta stormed Anfield on Thursday to take a 3-0 first leg lead in their Europa League quarter-final tie.Klopp's men have now won just three of their last eight games in all competitions and are showing clear signs of fatigue after already having played 51 games this season.Slow starts have been a recurring theme of Liverpool's struggles of late and they were again forced to come from behind.Alisson Becker made his long-awaited return in goal for the home side but he had no chance when Eze was left with a simple finish from Tyrick Mitchell's cross.Palace were millimetres away from a second moments later when Andy Robertson produced a remarkable goalline clearance to deny Jean-Philippe Mateta after Virgil van Dijk's slip let the French striker through.Liverpool had to resort to set-pieces to put the Palace defence under pressure in the first half.Wataru Endo's scuffed effort came back off the crossbar.Dean Henderson then produced a stunning save to prevent Luis Diaz levelling at the back post with an acrobatic effort.Klopp reacted at half-time with the introduction of Dominik Szoboszlai and Trent Alexander-Arnold's return after two months out quickly followed when Conor Bradley went down injured.Diogo Jota and Cody Gakpo were also sent on for the rescue mission from the bench.Jota looked certain to equalise when picked out by Szoboszlai but the Portuguese forward's finish hit Nathaniel Clyne on the line with the goal gaping.At the other end, Alisson showed why he is one of the world's best goalkeepers with a remarkable stop to turn Mateta's strike over from point-blank range.Liverpool galloped immediately up the other end and Curtis Jones slotted wide with just Henderson to beat.Mohamed Salah had one final chance to at least snatch a point, but his goalbound effort was brilliantly blocked by Mitchell in stoppage time.Unless Liverpool produce a stunning fightback against Atalanta in midweek, Klopp will have just two more games at Anfield before his momentous reign comes to an end.But what looked like it could be a glorious goodbye is now at danger of turning into a damp squib.",Eberechi Eze's early goal secured a crucial win for the Eagles in their fight for survival. This defeat marks Liverpool's first home loss in 29 league games.
