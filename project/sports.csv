And the final score -- India winning by 7 wickets -- suggests that it was a one-sided affair.But it was not the case.The newcomers showed superb grit and determination and gave India a run for their money before succumbing to their first-ever defeat at the cricketing extravaganza.Aided by a tricky surface at the Nassau Stadium in New York, the USA team gave their all and won hearts despite the defeat.In chase of a below-par 111, India took 18.2 overs to cross the finish line and secure a spot in the Super 8s.With nothing to lose, USA came out in all attack mode, defending 110 and tasted early success.The third ball of the game saw left-arm Saurabh Netravalkar getting rid of star India batter Virat Kohlifor his first ever golden duck in the T20 World Cups.Stunning a sea of blue at the stadium, Netravalkar got Kohli to edge a delivery outside off to give India an early blow.The left-arm pacer then struck again, first-ball of his second over, this time sending back India skipper Rohit Sharma for 3.Stunned early in the chase, India found themselves reeling at 10 for 2 in the third over.Last-match hero Rishabh Pant and Suryakumar Yadav then tried to steady the chase as the US bowlers kept the Indians under pressure with some superb bowling.When it looked like India were back on course in chase, Pakistan-born pacer Ali Khan got rid of Pant for 18, once again putting pressure back on the chasing team.With runs hard to come by on a bowling friendly surface, Suryakumar and Shivam Dube struggled really hard in the middle.After the fall of Pant in the 8th over, India only managed a sole boundary till the final ball of the 14th over.And in between that, Suryakumar also got a huge lifeline when he was dropped in the 13th over by Netravalkar at short third.At the end of the 14th over in 111 chase, India were struggling at 67 for 3 as USA bowlers bowled their hearts out.The 15th over finally saw India batters breaking the shackles with Shivam Dube whacking Corey Anderson to release the building pressure.From there one India did not look back and both the set batters Surya and Dube looked at ease.USA getting docked 5 penalty runs as they went past 60 seconds-mark to start a new over 3 times in the innings -- new rule -- also didn't help their cause as India were now back in control.With a flurry of boundaries, Surya and Dube wrapped up the chase in the 19th over.",India beat USA by 7 wickets in T20 World Cup match in New York.

He will have time to settle and analyze the game. Scoring 50-60 runs would be great for him. His stats at this position in previous World Cups are impressive.

NEW DELHI: India survived early hiccups to overcome 'giant killers' USA and become the third team to qualify for Super Eight stage after Australia and South Africa.With a seven-wicket victory, India remained unbeaten with their third victory on the trot in Group A after defeating Ireland and Pakistan.Chasing 111, India found themselves at the spot of bother at 3/44 in 7.3 overs. Suryakumar Yadav (50*) and Shivam Dube (31*) restored parity with their unbeaten 67-run stand and took India past the finish line in 18.2 overs.India struggled to score runs on the challenging Nassau County track , as they reached 76/3 after 15 overs. Surya and Dube, who were at the crease, found it hard to connect with the ball due to the unpredictable nature of the surface.The match took an unexpected turn when the USA team committed a costly error, awarding India five penalty runs and reducing the equation from 35 off 30 to 30 off 30. This sudden shift in momentum proved to be a turning point of the game.The reason for the co-hosts to have been docked five penalty runs was because USA took more than a minute between overs three times. And per the new rules, that's a penalty.According to the updated regulations, if a team exceeds the allotted 60 seconds to commence a new over on three occasions within an innings, they will face a penalty of five runs being deducted from their total score.The umpires have enforced this rule, and as a result, USA have been docked 5 penalty runs. This decision was made due to the team's repeated failure to start their overs within the stipulated time frame. The penalty runs will be added to the opposition's total, putting the USA team at a disadvantage.",India become third team to qualify for Super Eight stage after Australia and South Africa.

"PCB proposes February 19 start for Champions Trophy 2025, rejects hybrid model for India’s matches",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/pcb-proposes-february-19-start-for-champions-trophy-2025-rejects-hybrid-model-for-indias-matches/articleshow/110947791.cms,"(With IANS inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has put forward a proposal for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 to commence on February 19 and be hosted entirely in Pakistan. The PCB has firmly rejected the idea of a hybrid model for India's matches, similar to the arrangement made for the Asia Cup 2023.According to the PCB's proposed schedule, the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 will span from February 19 to March 9, 2025, with all matches taking place in three major Pakistani cities: Karachi, Rawalpindi, and Lahore .Sources within the PCB have revealed that International Cricket Council (ICC) officials, who recently visited Pakistan to assess the preparations for the tournament, have expressed their satisfaction with the arrangements in place.Notably, the PCB has taken a strong stance against the idea of a hybrid model, particularly for India's matches, insisting that all games should be played on Pakistani soil.This stance is likely to elicit a focused response from the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ), which had previously suggested a hybrid model where India's matches would be played at neutral venues outside of Pakistan, similar to the arrangement made during the Asia Cup 2023, when India's matches were relocated to Sri Lanka.However, Pakistan remains firm in its position, desiring all matches, including those involving India, to be played within its borders.“We have not opted for the hybrid model. However, we have given this leverage that India’s matches can be played in Lahore only. This way, the team will not be required to move around cities within Pakistan and its security can be well maintained in Lahore”, said a source in the PCB.“India can be based in Lahore for the entire tournament. This would minimise logistical and security complications associated with their travel between cities”, the source added.The Indian team might find it more convenient and less challenging to participate in matches, as the special arrangement would allow them to play in a single city. This could potentially simplify their travel and logistical requirements throughout the tournament.“The proximity of Lahore to Wagah Border crossing is also going to be more suitable for the Indian fans. However, the question remains, if India would accept and participate in the event”, the PCB source said.According to the PCB's suggested itinerary for the Champions Trophy, Karachi will host a minimum of three matches, including the tournament opener and a semifinal.Lahore is set to stage at least seven matches, with the final being one of them. Rawalpindi will be the venue for no fewer than five matches, which includes a semifinal.It is worth noting that the Indian cricket team has not set foot in Pakistan since their participation in the 2008 Asia Cup. The decision regarding India's travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy will be made by the Indian government, which has been opposed to the cricket team crossing the border due to Pakistan's alleged involvement in supporting terrorism within India's borders.The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy will mark the first time Pakistan has been the sole host of a major international cricket event. In the past, Pakistan shared hosting duties with India and Sri Lanka for the 1996 Cricket World Cup, and prior to that, co-hosted the Reliance Cup alongside India in 1987.","The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has put forward a proposal for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 to commence on February 19 and be hosted entirely in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Arshdeep Singh has etched his name in the history of the T20 World Cup by accomplishing a feat that no Indian bowler has ever achieved before.The young left-arm fast bowler became the first player from India to claim a wicket on the very first delivery of a match in the tournament's history.Opening the bowling for India, Arshdeep struck on the very first ball to trap USA opener Shayan Jahangir plumb in front in the Group A match in New York on Wednesday.The delivery was a tricky one, darting back sharply after pitching. It surprised Jahangir, who was caught in the crease. The ball struck him around the knee-roll, and the impact was clearly in front of the off-stump.Jahangir came in as a replacement of skipper Monank Patel who missed out this match with a left-shoulder injury.Arshdeep added to USA woes with another strike in the same over by dismissing in-form Andries Gous .Apart from Arshdeep, the other three bowlers who have reached this landmark are Bangladesh's Mashrafe Mortaza, Shapoor Zadran of Afghanistan and Namibia's Ruben Trumplemann.Arshedeep's accomplishment placed him alongside Trumpelmann and Afghanistan's Fazalhaq Farooqi, who also managed to secure two dismissals in their respective first overs during the tournament.","Arshedeep Singh becomes first Indian bowler to pick a wicket on first ball of T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: The USA cricket team set an unfortunate record in the annals of T20 World Cup history by recording one of the lowest powerplay scores against India during the 2024 T20 World Cup match in New York on Wednesday.Team USA managed to score just 18 runs for the loss of two wickets in the first six overs. This was also the USA's lowest powerplay total in T20Is.This performance stands as the lowest powerplay score against India in the history of the tournament, underscoring the challenges faced by the USA batters against the formidable Indian bowling attack.Left-arm Indian seamer Arshdeep Singh made an immediate impact when he opened the bowling against the USA in the Group A encounter. His first delivery resulted in the dismissal of USA opener Shayan Jahangir , who was adjudged leg before wicket, for duck. The young Indian seamer continued his impressive spell by claiming another wicket in the same over, removing Andries Gous (2).Team India has a history of stifling opponents during the powerplay in T20 World Cups. For instance, in 2014, the West Indies team, despite not losing any wickets, could only manage 24 runs in their powerplay in Mirpur.Similarly, in the 2022 T20 World Cup, South Africa faced a daunting task against India in Perth. The Proteas were restricted to just 24 runs for the loss of three wickets during their powerplay. This performance highlighted India's knack for taking crucial early wickets while keeping the run rate in check.Ireland, too, struggled against India in the 2024 T20 World Cup match in New York. The Irish team scored only 26 runs for the loss of two wickets in their powerplay overs. This match further illustrated India's consistent ability to dominate the early stages of the game, setting the stage for a controlled bowling performance throughout the innings.These instances of low powerplay scores are a testament to the Indian bowling unit's effectiveness in T20 World Cups. The bowlers have repeatedly demonstrated their capability to apply early pressure, restrict scoring opportunities, and capture key wickets, leading to India's success on the global stage.","Team USA managed to score just 18 runs for the loss of two wickets in the first six overs.

NEW YORK: India’s New York assignment is over and it’s been quite outstanding, to say the least. But there’s a slight hint of cloud developing as India go on their further assignments, as they move to Miami for the second leg.There’s nothing about the opposition that is going to worry them at Fort Lauderhill — minnows Canada should be easy meat. But there’s a storm brewing over Miami, and there could be a case where the game may not be played at all.In fact, flights have started getting cancelled as flood alerts keep coming and even before India entered the ground for their match against the United States, everyone was keeping tabs on Miami’s weather forecast for the next few days.More than the game, India will not get the two intense sessions of practice in Miami, that may just hurt them as they gear up for the more difficult leg of their World Cup sojourn — the West Indies.“We hope that the weather clears up on time so that we get a game. But if we don’t, there’s not much that we can do about it,” Team India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey said on Wednesday.India’s game against Canada is on June 16 while their first game in West Indies is on June 20. Every game in the Super 8 is a must-win and India’s potential opponents— Australia, England, Afghanistan and New Zealand — have all been playing in the West Indies. It has given them enough time to get used to the Caribbean conditions, which should stand them in good stead in the Super 8s.India, on the other hand, have been playing on quite unique conditions in New York and with a probable four-day gap before they get to work in the Windies, the break could be unwanted for a team that is looking to build momentum.Mhambrey, though, didn’t want to read too much into it, because he insists that “the team has experience” to deal with such difficulties.“I think the good thing is that we have already played in the West Indies — a couple of series out prior to this. So, more or less know what kind of a surface we’ll encounter out there. We have played in those conditions in India as well. If you travel in India, Wankhede is different to Gujarat or Delhi, so it’s not exactly alien conditions for us,” the bowling coach said.The pace bowlers have enjoyed themselves in New York, but that doesn’t mean that India will stick to the tried-andtested in West Indies as well. If there is some help in the pitch, Mhambrey said that Kuldeep Yadav can very well come into the equation.“He was in very good rhythm in the IPL and has been bowling well in the nets. He completely understands why he isn’t playing here, but that doesn’t mean he will not be in our equations in West Indies,” Mhambrey said, stressing on the flexibility that the India is aiming for to lift the trophy that they last won in 2007.","India are in Miami for the second leg of the T20 World Cup. The game against Canada is on June 16 while their first game in West Indies is onJune 20.

NEW DELHI: After suffering a 7-wicket defeat against India in the ICC T20 World Cup in New York, USA's stand-in captain Aaron Jones expressed that a total of 130 runs would have been a challenging target for the 'Men in Blue' to chase down.India's unbeaten streak in the T20 World Cup continued as they secured a 7-wicket victory over co-hosts USA in their Group A encounter at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday.Arshdeep Singh's impressive pace bowling, coupled with a 72-run partnership between Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube , ensured India's place in the Super 8 .Jones commended his team's bowling performance, acknowledging that they made India work hard for every run scored. The world's top-ranked T20I side faced a potential upset when they were reduced to 10/2 while chasing a target of 111, with star openers Virat Kohli (0) and Rohit Sharma (3) dismissed early by Saurabh Netravalkar .Ali Khan further added to the pressure by dismissing Rishabh Pant with an outstanding delivery, but the USA couldn't capitalize on these breakthroughs.""10-15 runs short. If we got 130 then it would have been a tough total, that's how it goes sometimes. The boys were very disciplined and really proud of the bowling unit,"" Jones said in a post-match presentation.Looking ahead, Jones emphasized the need for restructuring and stated that the team will hold meetings before their next match against Ireland at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Florida on Friday.""Feels good, this is what we wanted for USA cricket, enjoying it. We will recalibrate now, have a few meetings and come back strong,"" he added.Commenting on the playing conditions, the 29-year-old batter noted that the pitch in New York was challenging and more conducive to seam bowling, which explained the absence of spin in the match.Jones also provided an update on captain Monank Patel, who missed the clash against India due to a minor injury, stating that he should be fit for their final group stage match.""The wicket was a bit tricky, more suited for seam bowling. That's why there is no spin. Mostly he (Monank Patel) should be fit for the last game, just got a slight niggle,"" he added.The USA will face Ireland at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Florida on Friday, aiming to secure a spot in the Super 8 stage of the tournament.","USA's stand-in captain Aaron Jones expressed that a total of 130 runs would have been a challenging target for the 'Men in Blue' to chase down.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma , the captain of the Indian cricket team, acknowledged the challenges posed by the newly-laid drop-in pitch at Nassau County ground in New York during the ongoing T20 World Cup . The surface offered varying pace, making batting difficult throughout the match.Despite the tough conditions, India managed to secure victories in all three of their matches at this venue.India achieved the highest successful chase at this ground, reaching a target of 111/3 in response to the USA's 110/8.Key contributions from Arshdeep Singh , who took 4 wickets for just 9 runs, Suryakumar Yadav 's unbeaten 50, and Shivam Dube 's crucial unbeaten 31 runs helped secure the victory for the Indian side.“We knew it would be tough. Credit to us for the way we held our nerve and got that partnership. Credit to Surya and Dube for showing maturity and taking us through,” Rohit said after the match.The Indian captain appeared to be more relieved than ecstatic after his team successfully overcame the initial challenge in the international tournament. The win marked an important milestone for the Indian side, as they progressed to the next stage of the competition with renewed confidence and determination.“Being in the Super Eight is a big relief — playing cricket here wasn't easy (as) it could have been anyone's game. We had to stick through till the end in all three games. We will take a lot of confidence from these wins,” he added.Rohit commended the vital contributions of three players in the team's recent victory. He particularly lauded Suryakumar for adapting his typically aggressive batting style to play the role of an anchor during the run chase.“He (Suryakumar) showed he has a different game to him, that's what you expect from experienced players. Credit to the way he stuck through today to take the game deep and win it for us,” he said.“We knew the bowlers had to take the lead (as) run scoring was difficult. All the bowlers did the job, particularly Arshdeep,” said Rohit after India qualified for the Super Eight.Rohit explained that the team's decision to allow Dube to bowl was based on the anticipation of seamers playing a dominant role in the match.“You want options and we should be able to use them as and when we can. Today, the pitch favoured the seamers so I wanted to use him,” he said.“(A) lot of these guys have played cricket together, very happy to see their progress. Saw them last year in MLC as well, they are all hard-working guys,” Rohit said while talking about USA cricketers.Arshdeep, who achieved the best T20I bowling figures for India, expressed his desire to capitalise on the pitch that offered assistance to seam bowlers.“In the last two games, I gave away a few more runs, (and I) wasn't happy with that. The team always shows belief in me and keeps backing me, I had to deliver for them,” he said.“The wicket is very conducive to fast bowlers and it's helping us get some seam movement. The plan was simple, pitch it in the wicket and let the ball do the talking. Don't give easy balls to score, our batsmen are also facing difficulties to score runs,” he said.Talking further about his bowling plans, the left-arm bowler said, “The plan was to hit the hard lengths. In conditions like this, you can use the wicket more.”Aaron Jones, who served as the stand-in captain for the USA, believed that his team put up a respectable performance but ultimately fell short of the required total.“(We were) 10-15 runs short. If we got 130 then it would have been a tough total, that's how it goes sometimes. The boys were very disciplined, really proud of the bowling unit,” he said.“(It) feels good, this is what we wanted for USA cricket, enjoying it. We will recalibrate now, have a few meetings and come back strong,” he added.Jones stated that the USA's regular skipper, Monank Patel , is expected to recover and be ready to play in their final Group match against Ireland.“Mostly he should be fit for the last game, just got a slight niggle,” Jones said.","India achieved the highest successful chase at this ground, reaching a target of 111/3 in response to the USA's 110/8.

JAIPUR: The 2024-25 domestic season is set to unfold with Duleep Trophy starting from September 5, but Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) is in complete disarray. The six-member ad-hoc committee, appointed by registrar co-operative to manage the day-to-day affairs of the association and conduct fresh elections, will complete three months on June 28 and they have failed to accomplish any of the assigned tasks.

With no election dates announced so far, a few former RCA officials feel that there is likelihood that the Board of Control For Cricket in India ( BCCI ) might appoint an ad-hoc panel to ensure the state’s participation in the upcoming domestic season.

Sources in the know also cite a possibility of the matter reaching the high court if a player or players decide to appeal fearing their career is being put on stake.

The procedure to hold the elections requires issuing of a notice 21 days prior to the decided polls’ date, but there is no time left now.

“The ad-hoc panel has failed in every aspect. The members could neither hold the elections nor could help the players prepare for the new season. Looking at the situation right now, BCCI might intervene,” said a former state cricket official.

The ad-hoc panel coordinator Jaideep Bihani said that at the moment the focus is to get the process of 2024-25 season started.

“Right now we are not thinking about the elections. There is still time for June 28 to come. The main thing right now is to get the 2024-25 season done as we don't want players to suffer. We have written to the BCCI asking them to release funds, so that we can hold the season. We will also go and meet the BCCI officials in Mumbai. And another important task is related accounts. On Tuesday, we accessed the RCA office and record room, but the officials of the previous regime have taken all CPUs along and they haven't left any record behind,” said Bihani.

He added that they will first themselves try to find out a solution to it and if need be, they will reach out to the state government for help.

A district cricket association official on condition of anonymity said that lack of funds should not become a reason for failure to hold the camps and organise matches. “Ad-hoc panel should get sponsors or take loan,” he said.

NEW DELHI: Arshdeep Singh delivered a stellar performance, recording his career-best figures of 4/9 as India limited the United States of America to a modest 110 for 8 in their Group A clash of the T20 World Cup in New York on Wednesday.The USA batters, who had shown resilience in their previous two victories, found the Indian pace attack to be a class above in terms of quality and execution. The hosts were under constant pressure throughout their innings.Despite the challenging circumstances, the USA managed to score 42 runs in the first 10 overs and added another 68 in the remaining 10, thanks to valuable contributions from Nitish Kumar (27), Steven Taylor (24), and former New Zealand international Corey Anderson (15).Arshdeep's early breakthroughs, including a first-ball wicket of Shayan Jahangir, set the tone for the Indians, who maintained their intensity throughout the innings, mixing fuller deliveries with back-of-length ones. The left-arm pacer was exceptional, bowling an impressive 17 dot balls.The Powerplay yielded only 18 runs, and skipper Aaron Jones (11) could only hit one six off Mohammed Siraj before Hardik Pandya(2/14 in 4 overs) dismissed him with a short delivery.The match also provided an opportunity for Rohit Sharma to assess Shivam Dube (0/11 in 1 over), who is considered the weakest link in both batting and bowling departments.Opener Taylor hit a big six off Axar Patel but was soon dismissed, while Nitish Kumar (27 off 23 balls) proved to be a thorn in India's side with some impressive shots.However, a superb catch by Siraj at the mid-wicket boundary brought an end to Nitish's innings, and with his dismissal, the USA's hopes of reaching 120 also faded away.","India limited the United States of America to a modest 110 for 8 in their Group A clash of the T20 World Cup in New York.

However, their season ended on a disappointing note, with only three wins in their last 17 league matches, despite being close to Inter at the start of the year.Allegri's dismissal came after his explosive behavior during the team's Italian Cup triumph, which the club deemed ""incompatible"" with its values.He was sent off in the final minutes of the 1-0 win against Atalanta for arguing with match officials and was also accused of manhandling and threatening the chief editor of newspaper Tuttosport. His actions led to an investigation by the Italian Football Federation's disciplinary authorities.During his two spells as Juventus manager, the 56-year-old Allegri won 12 trophies, including five Serie A titles, and reached two Champions League finals.","Juventus appoint Thiago Motta as their new head coach.

After three decades of heading the club’s administration, renowned doctor Pronab Dasgupta decided to step down with city-based industrialist Murari Lal Lohia taking over as the new president.

The club also announced Rupak Saha as the new secretary after Kalyan Majumdar also decided to bow out from the post on health issues after serving it for 22 years.

“While we continue to strive for being the best in the country with our senior football team, we need to have a meaningful roadmap for the future to make East Bengal among the best in Asia,” Lohia said, hailing him as “an East Bengal fan since childhood”, after the new executive committee’s first meeting at a city hotel on Wednesday.

While Dasgupta has been named the club’s new chief advisor, Majumdar will stay in the club’s administration as one of its vice-presidents.

Speaking on the occasion, Goswami — a former ICC Women’s player of the year and No. 1 bowler in women’s ODIs — said that becoming part of East Bengal’s ExCo was never in her “wildest dream.” “I will give my best with the limited experience that I have,” she said.

According to senior club official Debartata Sarkar, the new ExCo is facing immediate challenges on two fronts — making the club financially more stable and focus on youth development programmes.

"Chathunni, the man who shaped India’s finest football careers, dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/chathunni-the-man-who-shaped-indias-finest-football-careers-dies/articleshow/110947582.cms,"KOCHI: “When I die, I want people to keep football on my body and not garlands. Those balls would at least be useful to kids who want to play football,” TK Chathunni , the eminent football coach, had said.The statement epitomized Chathunni , the player-cum-coach who lived football every moment of his life, before he passed away on Wednesday morning at a private hospital in Karukutty near Thrissur after battling cancer. He was 79.Hailing from Chalakudy, Chathunni was a dependable defender at Services and Vasco Goa. He also donned the Indian jersey on six occasions.But he found his true calling once he decided to end his playing career as he went on to become a much sought-after coach in the ’90s. He was a strict disciplinarian and played a pivotal role in shaping the careers of some of India’s best. “Chathunni sir made IM Vijayan,” said an emotional Vijayan. “He knew how to spot talent and get the best out of them. Chathunni sir moulded me into the footballer that the country knows me as today,"" added Vijayan.Though Chathunni’s first major assignment as head coach of Kerala in the Santosh Trophy in 1979 came to a disappointing end, with the team bowing out even before reaching the semis, he reignited his managerial career by making the Kerala Police team a force to reckon with on the national stage. Their maiden Federation Cup triumph in 1990 also made Chathunni a hot property of clubs in Goa and Kolkata.After stints at MRF Sports Foundation and Dempo SC in Goa, he reached Salgaocar SC. The club at the time was on the verge of shutting down, and Chathunni weaved his magic to guide them to their first Federation Cup title in 1997. “He used to put a lot of pressure on us. He kept on shouting from the sidelines and was very aggressive. All these things were new for us as the Goan style of play was to take everything at a slow pace,” Jules Alberto Dias, who was part of that title-winning Salgaocar side, told TOI from London. “Chathunni sir taught us to play the game aggressively. He was more than a coach for many of us,” added Jules.A year later, Chathunni moved to Kolkata. He remained in Kolkata for just one year but left an everlasting memory as he helped Mohun Bagan clinch their first National Football League title in the 1997-98 season. However, the stay in Kolkata was not easy for Chathunni. His decision to leave Salgaocar soon after winning the Federation Cup, without serving his contract period, to join Bagan ruffled many feathers. The Salgaocar management took him to court for not serving the contract period, and Bagan, to avoid controversies, asked him to keep himself out for a couple of matches.However, his side lost to Salgaocar in the Super Cup that same season, which paved the way for his ouster from the Kolkata club. “I wish we could have had him here in Kolkata for a longer period of time,” said former India international Satyajit Chatterjee, and a key member of Mohun Bagan’s NFL-winning squad under Chathunni. “It’s not easy for an outsider to get adapted to the demands of Kolkata football and live up to expectations. But he took charge of a Bagan team which was left behind by Amal Da (legendary coach Amal Datta) and eventually took them to the pinnacle of success,” added Chatterjee.In 2023, Chathunni received the Kerala government’s prestigious GV Raja award. A couple of days after receiving the award, he suffered a stroke which left a part of his body paralyzed. “When I met him three weeks ago, he said that his biggest regret was not being able to go out and coach the children,” said Victor Manjila, his former teammate.Chathunni is survived by his wife and two daughters. Chathunni’s funeral will be held in Chalakudy on Thursday, and it will be fitting if his final journey is adorned with footballs.",Chathunni passed away on Wednesday morning at a private hospital in Karukutty near Thrissur after battling cancer. He was a strict disciplinarian and played a pivotal role in shaping the careers of some of India’s best. His funeral will be held in Chalakudy on Thursday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110947574,imgsize-30724,width-400,resizemode-4/110947574.jpg"

Taking the lead against a formidable opponent like Qatar demonstrated attacking intent and tactical discipline. However, conceding a controversial equalizer and ultimately succumbing to a late winner exposed defensive vulnerabilities and a lack of concentration in crucial moments.In the aftermath of the defeat, newly appointed captain Gurpreet Singh Sandhu took to social media to address the disappointment and offer a message of hope for the future.""We had the belief, we had the chance to make amends even after everything. The boys gave everything on the pitch last night to make it happen but yet it didn’t.

However, it was Osaka who presented Swiatek with the most formidable challenge she encountered throughout her campaign on the clay courts.""My match against Iga was really amazing for me even to play. I just need to play tighter matches like that because I felt like I was playing well,"" she said.","Naomi Osaka defeated Elise Mertens 6-2, 6-4 in the second round of the Libema Open in s'Hertogenbosch.

French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz says he has the game for all surfaces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/french-open-champion-carlos-alcaraz-says-he-has-the-game-for-all-surfaces/articleshow/110892230.cms,"The only defense Carlos Alcaraz knows is all-out attack. The 21-year-old sets up points, creates openings, and goes for high-risk shots; the stage of the match if he’s leading or trailing is irrelevant. Drop shots that skim the net, racy winners that go around the pole and outrageous forehands. He can run a marathon and win a sprint.The Spaniard plays every shot in the book and thinks up new ones on the run. He smiles during matches, sometimes dazzled by his own brilliance, other times in disbelief. An expression that says, why? Not really.Alcaraz, who won his third Grand Slam title on Sunday, his first at Roland Garros , is 11-1 in five-set matches. Against Alexander Zverev in the final of the French Open and world No.1 Jannik Sinner in the semifinals, Alcaraz motored from a 1-2 deficit in sets, not by keeping the ball in play, but by going for his shots. And like his last two opponents, Alcaraz was also running on reserve in the fourth and fifth sets, but he understood the only way he was crossing that finish line first was by winning it, not waiting for it.“He’s a beast. He’s an animal,” Zverev said of the 21-year-old. “The intensity he plays with is different to other people.”Alcaraz’s long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero talks as fast as the Spaniard charges the court, the duo is quite the vibe. Ferrero hurls instructions at the dynamo in the middle that leaves one wondering if he’s actually reminding Alcaraz of the defense they may have practiced a 1000 times.“I’m trying just to be aggressive, to go for it, play my style -- go to the net, dropshots, hitting big shots,” said Alcaraz . “If I lose it, if I miss it, my feelings are really good. If I lose, it doesn’t matter if I miss it, because when I go for it, the feelings are much better than if I go defensive and lose. My team is telling me to go for it.”Alcaraz is at No.2 in the rankings now which spreads the field for the new guard at Wimbledon, with Sinner and Alcaraz likely bookending the draw.“My game suits very well for every surface because I practice it (like that),” Alcaraz said. “I wanted to develop my style of being aggressive all the time, practicing the defense and all that stuff...but my main goal is being aggressive as much as I can. On grass, I have to play like that almost every time, but on all surfaces too.”Alcaraz — the youngest man to win a Grand Slam on three different surfaces after his triumphs on hard courts at the 2022 US Open and grass at 2023 Wimbledon – put a number against his achievements.“Obviously winning the US Open, when I reached for the first time the No. 1 ranking, is something that I dreamt of since I started playing tennis , getting my first Grand Slam was pretty special,” Alcaraz said. “But the way that I won Wimbledon, beating Novak Djokovic in five sets, has been a great achievement for me.”“Right now, lifting the Roland Garros trophy, knowing everything that I have been through the last month with the injuries...” he said. “Probably this one is the moment that I’m really proud of myself, because of everything that I have done the last month just to be ready for this tournament with my team. It has been really difficult for me.”“So I’m going to say that this one, Roland Garros,” he said, looking up at the packed media room, “is the one I’m most proud about.""","Carlos Alcaraz is the youngest man to win a Grand Slam on three different surfaces.
