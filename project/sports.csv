NEW DELHI: On Sunday afternoon, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are gearing up to clash with the struggling Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) in their fourth home game of the season. As the teams prepare to face off, the stakes are high.KKR currently sits comfortably in the third position on the IPL 2024 points table , boasting four wins in six games. In contrast, RCB finds itself languishing at the bottom as their IPL match result is not impressive with just one win in seven outings, desperately seeking a turnaround in fortunes.Also see: IPL live score When it comes to head-to-head encounters, KKR holds a notable advantage over RCB. Having crossed paths 34 times in the tournament thus far, KKR has emerged victorious on 20 occasions, while RCB has managed 14 wins.In their most recent encounter earlier this season in March, KKR demonstrated their dominance by clinching a convincing victory, defeating RCB by 7 wickets with a substantial 19 balls to spare. This history may give KKR an added boost of confidence as they enter this crucial match, while RCB will be looking to defy the odds and stage a comeback.Eden Gardens, renowned for its lively atmosphere, has indeed been a haven for batters in this IPL season. With four out of six innings witnessing 200-plus totals, it's evident that the pitch has been a paradise for run-scoring.However, recent history suggests a potential twist in the tale. During RCB's previous visit to Eden Gardens, their batters struggled notably against spinners on the same surface. This memory might influence the Kolkata Knight Riders' decision to tailor the pitch to suit their spinners' strengths, potentially adding a new dimension to the game.As the teams strategize, the pitch conditions could play a pivotal role, offering an intriguing battle between bat and ball, and setting the stage for an enthralling contest between KKR and RCB.In the three matches played at the venue so far, the teams batting first have won one match, while the teams chasing have emerged victorious in the other two.The average first innings total at the ground has been 197, mirroring the average second innings total, highlighting the ground's reputation as a high-scoring venue.The highest total recorded at the venue stands at 224/8, achieved by the Rajasthan Royals against the Kolkata Knight Riders. Conversely, the lowest total recorded is 161/7, registered by the Lucknow Super Giants against the Kolkata Knight Riders.1. Recent matches at the venue have seen high-scoring affairs, with 447 runs scored in 40 overs in the last game, indicating a favourable pitch for batters. As a result, impactful batters from both teams should be prioritised in your fantasy XI.2. Despite the batting-friendly conditions, spinners are expected to play a significant role, potentially exceeding expectations. Including a couple of spinners in your fantasy XI could prove beneficial.Virat Kohli's stellar performance stands out as the shining beacon for RCB. The Indian maestro has been in sublime form, consistently racking up runs with finesse. With an impressive tally of 361 runs in just 7 innings, Kohli currently reigns supreme as the holder of the coveted orange cap Sunil Narine emerges as the standout performer for KKR this season, showcasing his prowess as a dynamic West Indian all-rounder. His ability to accumulate points consistently in both batting and bowling makes him an indispensable asset in fantasy contests. With a century already under his belt, Narine exudes confidence, further solidifying his status as a must-have player in fantasy lineups.Phil Salt's season has been a mix of ups and downs, but his performances at Eden Gardens have been a bright spot. Showing adaptability to the pitch, he has looked promising whenever he's batted here. Given his comfort on this wicket, Salt could emerge as a crucial factor in fantasy contests.Shreyas Iyer (c), Rinku Singh, Phil Salt, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Venkatesh Iyer, Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun Chakaravarthy, Mitchell Starc, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Ramandeep SinghFaf du Plessis (c), Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, Anuj Rawat, Dinesh Karthik , Will Jacks, Mahipal Lomror, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Akash Deep, Reece Topley, Yash Dayal, Lockie Ferguson,Dinesh Karthik, Phil SaltVirat Kohli (C), Faf du Plessis, Shreyas IyerAndre Russell, Will Jacks, Sunil Narine (VC)Mitchell Starc, Reece Topley, Harshit Rana","Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) face Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB) in their fourth home game of the season.

During an Indian Premier League ( IPL ) match against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), RCB conceded a staggering 222 runs.Conceding 200 runs or more in a T20 innings is a rare and remarkable feat, albeit one that teams strive to avoid.But on Sunday, RCB again ended up on the wrong side in Kolkata, and this was not the first time it's happened, as the IPL franchise has created an unwanted record of doing it 29 times, surpassing English County side Middlesex , who had done it 28 times, followed by Punjab Kings (27), Kent (26) and Somerset (24).RCB also registered another unfortunate record of conceding 70-plus runs on most occasions during a single IPL edition. In the first six overs of the powerplay, RCB conceded 75 runs. This was the fourth time this season that they conceded 70 runs or more in the powerplay, the most by a team in a single IPL edition.These milestones, while unwelcome, underscore the challenges faced by bowlers in the fast-paced and high-scoring format of T20 cricket.For a team renowned for its star-studded lineup and explosive batting prowess, RCB's struggle to contain the opposition's onslaught reflects the demanding nature of T20 cricket.RCB, known for its passionate fanbase and high expectations, will undoubtedly analyse this performance meticulously, seeking areas for improvement and striving to bounce back stronger in future matches.While conceding such a high number of runs is undoubtedly disappointing, it serves as a reminder of the unforgiving nature of T20 cricket, where fortunes can change swiftly and unpredictably.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) conceded 222 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) RCB has now conceded 200 runs or more in a T20 innings 29 times, surpassing Middlesex.

NEW DELHI: In a high-octane IPL clash between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Kolkata, opener Phil Salt's aggressive knock of 48, combined with skipper Shreyas Iyer 's composed half-century, laid the foundation for KKR's imposing total of 222 for six. Despite a notably improved bowling effort from RCB, KKR's batting prowess shone through.While Sunil Narine struggled to find his rhythm, Salt, ranked as the world's No.2 T20I batter, blazed a trail with three sixes and seven fours, providing KKR with a blazing start. Iyer's anchoring innings of 50 runs off 36 deliveries, embellished with seven boundaries and a six, consolidated KKR's dominance.In the latter stages of the innings, Andre Russell's unbeaten 27 off 20 balls and Ramandeep Singh's quickfire 24 off 9 balls injected further momentum into the home side's innings, ensuring they finished with a commanding total.Despite the daunting total set by KKR, the beleaguered RCB bowling unit displayed resilience, managing to restrict KKR to 75/3 by the end of the powerplay. During a pivotal middle-phase, KKR suffered a setback, losing four wickets in just 26 balls, courtesy of a spirited effort from the RCB bowlers.Venkatesh Iyer (16) and Rinku Singh (24) failed to convert their starts as RCB kept chipping away at the KKR batting order.But Iyer held his nerves to produce his 20th IPL fifty, his first fifty this season, as KKR kept moving along.He got out in the next ball after reaching 50 in 35 balls.Russell was unusually quiet during his 27 from 20 balls (4x4). It was Ramandeep Singh's cameo of 24 from nine balls with two fours and two sixes that lifted them to their third successive 200-plus total at the Eden Gardens.Mohammed Siraj bowled wisely with his yorkers and wide yorkers for his 1/40, while Cameron Green was the best among RCB bowlers returning with 2/35.Yash Dayal also picked 2/56 but was gave away one too many runs.Fresh from his maiden T20 century, Narine struggled to get going as RCB bowlers kept him quiet with a mix of yorkers both at his pads and outside off.Narine took eight balls to get off the mark, and Dayal nailed him with a toe-crushing yorker leaving him in pain in the second over.But it was business as usual for Salt as KKR went past the 50-run mark in 3.5 overs.The Englishman was particularly ruthless against Lockie Ferguson in the fourth over that yielded 28 runs.Salt dealt only in boundaries, smacking the New Zealand pacer for two sixes and four fours in one over.Siraj finally brought an end to Salt's assault, dismissing him two runs shy of a well-deserved fifty as the right-hander failed to clear square leg boundary to be caught by Rajat Patidar.Dayal's twin breakthrough of Narine and Angkrish Raghuvanshi in the last power-play over put the home team in disarray, even as their 12-plus run rate was a big respite.Narine was beaten by a slow ball and ended up skying a catch to Kohli at long on, while it was Green's blinder of a catch that yielded Raghuvanshi's wicket.","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL clash.

He was let go by the team which discovered him, he went to another franchise. After winning 3-4 titles with them, he left. He must have felt a little bad; that will be there.

You don't think it hurts him? It hurts him. It hurts any human being. How many people actually know the reality of it? Hardik is dealing with mental health issues, for sure. We, as people, I understand, as Indians, we are emotional. But it is not right to impose this kind of treatment on any human being. It is unbecoming as a society for us to do that to someone and be okay with it. We should not be laughing along with it. We should not be forwarding these memes.""It's our job, yes it's passion too, but it's what puts the food on the table for me. My job is on display for you to criticise. A corporate person's job is not on television to criticise, or have an opinion about either. When that is the case, you have to exercise a certain amount of empathy and dignity to the other person to allow them to fail. One of the most beautiful things we did as a country is our expression of love, and our reaction to our Indian team after we lost the World Cup. That's how we should be as a society, and as Indians,"" said Uthappa.In the first 7 matches this season, Hardik has 141 runs to his name at an average of 23.50 with no half-centuries.On the bowling front, Hardik has bagged a mere 4 wickets and has leaked runs at an economy rate of 11 RPO.","Hardik Pandya has been subjected to constant on-field booing by the spectators.

Former India pacer Varun Aaron emphasized the pressing need for Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's ( RCB ) domestic players to lift their performance this IPL season, lessening the team's reliance on Virat Kohli .Kohli has undeniably been the driving force for RCB, leading the batting charts with 361 runs in 7 innings and donning the Orange Cap. His exceptional strike rate of 147.34, coupled with a top score of 113 not out, highlights his immense contribution to the team.""It's just that RCB are not finding the rhythm, the domestic players are just not stepping up,"" reckoned Aaron whiel speaking on Star Sports.Aaron, who was acquired by RCB for Rs 2 crore in 2014, retired from first-class cricket earlier this year.""If you have to be anywhere at the top of the table or the middle of the table at this point, you have to have domestic players who are firing and you cannot always rely on Virat Kohli. The other guys have to step up and also all their money is sitting in the dug-out. You can't spend that much cash on players and not have them play,"" said Aaron.According to Australia's former limited-overs captain, Aaron Finch, RCB require a dynamic middle-order batsman to support Kohli effectively.""He's (Kohli) scored a lot of runs everywhere. He's a modern day great. And I think the fact that he's getting runs and RCB are still not making it is a positive sign in one degree. It's that when Virat is playing well, that genuinely carries the rest of the players with him.""They just need to find a partnership with him, they need to find an explosive middle order player who is in form, Lomror has been in and out, so it ( KKR vs RCB ) has got all the makings of an epic game,"" Finch said.RCB are scheduled to play KKR at the Eden Gardens on Sunday.Regarding Travis Head's explosive 89-run innings for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Delhi Capitals in Delhi on Saturday, Finch remarked that the left-handed opener has truly taken ""fear of failure out of his mind'.""It's always been in him, the ability to play like this. I guess the freedom to express himself and be able to deal with the ups and downs of playing such an aggressive and high-risk brand of cricket, I think has just released him to a new level.""And I think if you look back at the World Cup final, he kept playing his shots even when there was wickets falling around him, the ball was moving. Because he's taken the fear of failure out of his mind.""If he misses out five or six times in a row, it doesn't bother him because he knows he's one shot away. He's the type of player that needs one ball in the middle. And that's all it will take for him to get going again,"" Finch said.In a high-scoring match where over 460 runs were scored, seamer T Natrajan concluded with remarkable figures of 4/19. Finch suggested that despite Natrajan's outstanding performance, his wickets coming in the late stages of the game, when the result was already evident, likely hindered his chances of receiving the Man-of-the-Match award.""When 460 runs are scored in a game and a guy gets 4 for 19, that's a special performance. I think the thing that didn't give him the 'Man of the Match' is that the four wickets were right at the death when the game was done and dusted.""Set an imposing target of 267, DC were stopped at 199.""I think the ability of Delhi to get that run rate under 12 an over was extraordinary and at that stage of the innings, they were in the box seat to win it.""The wicket slowed up a bit just like Pat Cummins talked about and the ball got a little softer and made it easier for the slower bowlers to grip. It was just one of those things where they couldn't sustain it,"" Finch said.(With PTI inputs)","Royal Challengers Bengaluru need domestic players to step up, says Varun Aaron.

But the defenders, on both sides, looked to have brought a little more of it on the pitch as they denied attacks to be reflected on the scoreline.While Odisha ended up with better possession in the first half, the only shot on goal came from Blasters’ Hormipam Ruivah in the 22nd minute when he headed a superb cross from Freddy Lallawmawma straight into the hands of Amrinder Singh in Odisha goal.Odisha once again relied on their talisman Ahmed Jahouh to keep creating moves from deep but all those attacks were foiled by the Marko Leskovic and Milos Drincic-led Kerala defence inside the D. The story was being played in the same vein at the other end too, with both teams missing that final touch or shot in the final third in search of a breakthrough.The highlight of the opening 45 minutes was the drama that followed Mourtada Fall sending in the ball with a casual back heel on connecting with a Jahouh cross from the left of the box. While it was first given a goal by the referee, after consultation with the linesman and vehement protests from Blasters, the decision was overturned with Jahouh and Fall both found to be offside.Despite some desperate attempts from both teams to change the scoreline, they left the field for the break with the first knockout of the playoff stage goalless.Jahouh kept sending in measured crosses into the centre and the flank after the change of ends as Amey Ranawade and Jerry Mawihmingthanga kept attempting to make a goal out of them.

Aimen sent a pass to the Lithuanian after a delicate first touch as Cernych made no mistake in finding the corner of the net to the right of Amrinder.It was a well-deserved goal for the visitors but they could only maintain the lead for 20 minutes.With Blasters’ injured custodian Lara Sharma taken off field in a stretcher and replaced by Karanjit Sharma, Odisha took advantage of the lapse in focus of the opposition defence as Diego Mauricio scored his 11th goal of the season. He turned in a delectable cross from the right from current top scorer Roy Krishna and brought the home team back in the game and took it into extra time.And it was a replay of the equaliser in the seventh minute of extra time with Jahouh, once again, the conductor of the move.

However, his persistent reactions towards the French fans led to a bizarre incident where he was initially shown a second yellow card, seemingly resulting in a red card and subsequent dismissal.Remarkably, Martinez was reprieved due to a rule that states yellow cards awarded during regular time are not carried forward to penalty shootouts.

Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective. ""If I were the coach or the captain, and if I find my No. 1 player not performing, I would put my No. 3 or any other player in,"" Bal, a former Davis Cup player, said.""Try something different, think out of the box. It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players. The captain, the coach and the support staff are appointed by the executive committee of the AITA,"" he said.Both captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule did not respond to request for a comment.",India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week. The All India Tennis Association believes the players have to step up. Captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule did not respond to request for a comment.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109410672,imgsize-44456,width-400,resizemode-4/109410672.jpg"
