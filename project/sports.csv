snares three as India thump Bangladesh by 280 runs

CHENNAI: In a few years' time, when we will look back at the India vs Bangladesh Test at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in the September of 2024, we will remember it as the 'Ashwin Test'.From the second session of the first day to the time when India wrapped it up in the first session of Day 4, it was Ashwin all the way.A century on Day 1, his 37th five-wicket haul to equal Shane Warne , another Man of the Match award, his father, wife, kids, former coaches and many friends in the galleries, the stage might have been incredibly tempting for the 38-year-old to announce that it was his last at his beloved home ground.He didn't. ""Who knows if this was my Chepauk swansong in Tests? But if it was, what a swansong it was,"" Ashwin left it open-ended, soaking in all the adulation after another match-winning spell of 6-88 as India won the Test by 280 runs to go 1-0 up. When the fourth day started, the result of the Test was never in doubt. The challenge for India was to wrap it up as early as possible before the team leaves for Kanpur in the search of the second of their four wins that will book them aWorld Test Championship Final berth.One felt that on a tired pitch here on Day 4, captain Rohit Sharma might bring Ashwin and his spin twin Ravindra Jadeja into action right from the start. But he waited, allowed the effect of the roller to wear off, and let the Bangladeshi batters Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan get used to the pace of the quick bowlers.Just when it seemed the two lefthanders might just stretch the game a bit, Ashwin and Jadeja were brought in. Ashwin, coming in from round the wicket and bowling with a 5-4 offside field to the left-hander, chose to take the middle-stump line rather than off. It took the cut and the reverse sweep out of the equation and the master offie was looking to bowl a little slow through the air, to get maximum purchase out of a pitch which hadn't shaped up into a vicious turner.The skill of the bowler had to come into play and that's exactly what happened when Ashwin induced an inside-edge off Shakib's bat and the forward short-leg fielder completed a good catch diving to his left.That was the beginning of the end as Ashwin and Jadeja looked more and more dangerous. Litton Das, a super success in Pakistan recently for Bangladesh, didn't have the quality to deal with the spin duo and Jadeja (3 58) sent him back.The ball pitched on the middle and turned just a little bit and the edge was a regulation at slip. At this point, the only point of interest was whether Bangladesh captain Shanto (82) could complete his century. But with wickets falling at the other end, the left-hander who had batted with a lot of belief till then, tried a big shot against Jadeja and gave his wicket away.Jadeja, though, was made to wait for his milestone 300th wicket, stopping at 299, when he had the last man Hasan Mahmud bowled 15 minutes before lunch. In a way, it was fitting as well, because Jadeja was equally instrumental in this win, scoring 86 with Ashwin, taking the two big wickets in the first innings, and now, finishing things off in a hurry, the way he has been doing on Indian soil over the years.""Jadeja is such an inspirational story…My admiration for Jadeja keeps on increasing as I realize I will never be able to beat him,"" Ashwin paid his comrade the ultimate compliment as India truly looked like a happy family.",India beat Bangladesh by 280 runs to go 1-0 up in the Test. Ravindra Jadeja takes his 300th Test wicket. Ashwin takes 6-88 to equal Shane Warne's record of 37 wickets. India will play in the World Test Championship Final in Kanpur.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113583068,imgsize-91588,width-400,resizemode-4/113583068.jpg"

Daniel Dubois knocks out Anthony Joshua to retain IBF world heavyweight title,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/boxing/daniel-dubois-knocks-out-anthony-joshua-to-retain-ibf-world-heavyweight-title/articleshow/113562589.cms,"(Reuters Photo)

Daniel Dubois successfully defended his IBF world heavyweight championship by delivering a devastating fifth-round knockout against fellow Briton Anthony Joshua in a thrilling encounter at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night. The event drew a passionate crowd of 96,000 spectators.From the opening bell, the 27-year-old champion asserted his dominance, flooring the former two-time heavyweight titleholder on multiple occasions.Dubois had previously expressed his resolve to ""legitimise"" his reign as IBF champion, having been awarded the title vacated by Oleksandr Usyk in June.The challenger's powerful performance raises serious doubts about Joshua's boxing future, although his promoter, Eddie Hearn, indicated that he anticipates Joshua will seek a rematch.Despite entering the fight as the underdog, Dubois relentlessly pursued his renowned opponent from the outset, with his heavy punches visibly affecting the 2012 London Olympic champion throughout the contest.In a gripping fifth round filled with intense action, Dubois landed the fight-ending punch, having weathered some concerning moments himself as Joshua finally found his rhythm.The victory solidifies Dubois' position as a formidable force in the heavyweight division.""Are you not entertained?"" he said, speaking to DAZN after the biggest win of his 24-fight career. It's been a journey and I'm grateful to be in this position. I'm a gladiator, I'm a warrior until the bitter end. I want to get to the top of this sport and reach my full potential.""Before the explosive fireworks display over Wembley, Liam Gallagher of Oasis energized the eager audience with a three-song live performance.In a thrilling opening round, the British opponents clashed, culminating in Joshua being rescued by the bell after being knocked down by a vicious overhand right.Joshua, weighing 1.8 kilograms more than his younger rival, was in complete survival mode in the second round. Dubois floored him again in the third round with a left hook that caused his legs to give way.Following a standing eight count, the bell rang, and as the fourth round commenced, Joshua hit the canvas for the third time, despite his objection that it was not a valid knockdown.The fifth round was action-packed, with Dubois briefly stunned by two right hands. As Joshua attempted to capitalize on the situation, he was caught by consecutive right hands and found himself on the canvas once more, this time unable to beat the count.Both boxers stepped into the ring with the goal of securing a chance to face Tyson Fury or Usyk for the undisputed world championship.Usyk achieved a historic feat in May by becoming the first boxer to hold all four major heavyweight titles simultaneously, including the IBF, WBO, WBC, and WBA belts, after defeating Tyson Fury.Instead of facing the mandatory IBF challenger, Dubois, Usyk opted for a rematch with Fury. Dubois won the interim IBF title in June and was elevated to world champion status when Usyk vacated the belt.Joshua had aspirations of joining the prestigious group of three-time heavyweight champions, which includes legendary figures such as Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, and Evander Holyfield. However, Joshua's career took a significant hit after suffering defeats against Andy Ruiz in 2019 and two subsequent losses to Usyk.Despite bouncing back with four consecutive victories, Joshua aimed to reclaim his position at the top of the heavyweight division.Following his devastating loss to Dubois at Wembley, which marked his fourth defeat in 32 professional bouts, Joshua suggested he would continue his boxing career, but the setback will undoubtedly require introspection and careful consideration of his future in the sport.""We came up short as a team,"" he said. ""You know I'm ready to kick off in the ring but I'm going to keep it respectful. Before I came here, I always say to myself I'm a fighter for life. You keep rolling the dice. I had a fast and sharp opponent, a lot of mistakes from my end.""","Daniel Dubois successfully defended his IBF world heavyweight championship by delivering a devastating fifth-round knockout against fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.

Top Picks For You India vs Bangladesh, 1st Test: Gill, Pant strike centuries before Ashwin grabs three to leave Bangladesh facing heavy defeat

CHENNAI: Stats don't necessarily reveal the entire story, but they do leave an indicator. So, when Rishabh Pant matches MS Dhoni 's six-Test-centuries feat — achieved over 90 Tests — in just 34 games, it's a very special achievement indeed. The Pant story is all the more special because of the cruel turn that life had taken on a wintry morning in 2022.Lucky to be alive after a car accident, not too many gave him a chance to play top-flight cricket again, let alone play Tests.Pant's comeback story is well documented. His return in the last IPL was a tale of determination while his role as a No. 3 batter on the most difficult pitches of the T20 World Cup spoke volumes of his grit. There were still doubts whether his body would be able to take the rigours of five-day cricket, but after Saturday, all those speculations have been put to rest. The comfort with which he batted against the Bangladesh bowlers showed that the cobwebs in the mind have been taken care of. Shubman Gill , who has seen him from close quarters and shared a 167-run partnership on Saturday, said that it was special to see Pant score the comeback ton. ""I've spent a lot of time with him on and off the field and watching him score his first 100 after his comeback gives me so much pleasure. I've seen him work so hard for it when he was coming back from the injury and I think he also must be feeling really good,"" Gill said.A couple of months ago in New York, as India were preparing for a game against Pakistan, the pitch in one of the nets had so much variable bounce that most batters refused to bat there. But Pant asked the throwdown expert to hurl the white ball at him from 18 yards on that pitch. He kept getting hit on the body, but connected a few as well with the bat. While Pant was trying to get used to the short ball, he was also trying to test his pain threshold, and now we can see all the hard work has paid off.While former coach Rahul Dravid was effusive in his praise of Pant, current boss Gautam Gambhir , too, had a lot of good things to say about the dynamite that he possesses in his arsenal. ""He's got runs everywhere around the world, and not many wicket-keepers of that age have done it so consistently in red-ball cricket . It is always good to have someone like him who can open the game for us, and more importantly, can bring a lot of impact as well,"" Gambhir had said before the Test.As we keep discussing about Pant the batter, sometimes we forget how well he has kept on Indian pitches as well. In this Test too, he has looked in top shape and his glovework has been on point. ""Probably his batting overshadows his 'keeping many times. It's not easy to keep against the likes of Ashwin, Jadeja and Kuldeep on Indian conditions and what he has done behind the stumps has been remarkable as well,"" Gambhir said.For Pant, things can only get better from here and we all believe the best is yet to come.",Rishabh Pant matches MS Dhoni's six-Test-centuries feat in just 34 games.

India's two centurions from day three of the first Test against Bangladesh in Chennai, Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill , not just entertained the crowd at the MA Chidambaram Stadium but also had a good time on the crease teasing each other, besides pummeling the bowlers.In one such incident shared by Shubman Gill after the close of play on Saturday, whenever either of them hit a boundary, Pant would hit Gill's bat hard with his.While that's normal for a batsman to do as a way of congratulating his partner in the middle, Gill had his reasons to ask Pant to stop doing it.""I was telling him not to because I was playing with a bat that I played the England series with, so my bat is quite old actually,"" said Gill at the press conference after play ended.But Pant, who is a character that keeps his teammates entertained, didn't listen.""He was hitting my bat so hard, I was telling him that I am trying to save my bat. But if he didn't middle it (hit well), he would say 'no, let's do it again'. Bro, calm down!"" a smiling Gill said, much to the delight of the reporters in the room.The duo added 167 runs for the third wicket, with Pant making 109 on his return to Test cricket since his car accident in December 2020.

On Sunday at his home ground, he equalled one of his heroes Shane Warne on the five-wicket haul count in Tests. Ashwin's 37th five-wicket haul was one of the many records that he has achieved in an international career of 13 years, and there's one still that he had said earlier that he wanted to break.That's Anil Kumble 's record of 619 Test wickets --the highest by an Indian.But Ashwin, who is at the back-end of his career insists that he isn't exactly chasing anything.""Look, I don't think of any goals. I just wanted to enjoy my game, be the best that I can be, seek excellence. I am not ambitious at this point of time. I love my game and want to play as long as I can,"" the champion offie said after a match-winning effort with the bat and the ball over the last four days.Ashwin isn't getting any younger - at 38, the body has to deal with a lot as he looks to go from one peak to the other. ""Yes, it's a challenge. It's not the same when you are 25 …Every bit of work that you put in, you have to put doubly hard to earn the right to be there,"" Ashwin said.He explained how he has changed his training regime so that he doesn't stress himself out, especially when there's a dodgy knee to deal with as well. ""To be fair, I have reduced my strength training sessions. I work differently on my mobility and other aspects of life. I am living life, do a bit of yoga,"" he said, the smile intact.There's another growing interest in Ashwin's life --chess. The offspinner is a fan of Magnus Carlsen , he himself plays the sport and now owns a team in theGlobal Chess League as well. As Ashwin went on with his exploits at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai boys D Gukesh and R Praggnanandhaa took India towards a gold in Chess Olympiad.While Ashwin is following them with a lot of intent, the allrounder felt this success has a lot to do with what Viswanathan Anand did for Indian chess. ""Without any history of chess coming out of this country, we produced a legend like Anand, which is something fantastic. This morning also, I saw Hikaru Nakamura tweet about it. It is just amazing, I think he is someone who is under-praised a lot, he hasn't got his due,"" Ashwin said.It was at the MA Chidambaram Stadium 11 years ago against Australia that Ashwin had cemented his place in the Indian Test team with a seven-wicket haul. With his six-fer and the century against Bangladesh and his family, friends and coaches at the ground, it seemed life had come to a full circle for him. Test cricket will probably return to Chennai after three years and he will be 41 by then.Will he get to see him again playing in India's whites at his home ground again?""Maybe, maybe not. Who knows? Like I said, every day, every Test match I am playing is a big grind. And you never really know what is next when it comes to Test matches…I haven't thought too far ahead, but if that was my swansong, what a swansong,"" Ashwin left it at that, still smiling.","R Ashwin equalled Shane Warne on the five-wicket haul count in Tests. Ashwin's 37th five- wicket haul was one of the many records that he has achieved in an international career of 13 years. The allrounder is a fan of Magnus Carlsen, he himself plays the sport and now owns a team in theGlobal Chess League.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113584137,imgsize-40748,width-400,resizemode-4/113584137.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Veteran Ravichandran Ashwin delivered an all-round masterclass while swashbuckling Rishabh Pant had an emotional and memorable Test return as India thrashed Bangladesh in just over three days in the series opener in Chennai to go 1-0 up in the 2-game series on Sunday.Kicking off the new and a gruelling Test season in style, Rohit Sharma and co. were absolutely clinical, securing a massive 280-run win to hand 'Guru' Gautam Gambhir his first triumph as a Test coach.After a long break, India did have a jittery start to the game, but local boy Ashwin (119) first came up with a majestic first innings ton and then weaved his magic with the ball in the fourth innings to hand India a comfortable win.To go with that, Pant marked his Test return after the 2022 horrific car accident, with a dazzling ton and rising star Shubman Gill too hit a century, making the win a memorable affair at the Chepauk.The win was India's 7th in 10 games in the current World Test Championship cycle and saw the hosts achieve quite a few remarkable feats as a team and on individual levels as well.Here's a close look at the numbers in India's clinical win over Bangladesh:- India achieved a historic milestone in their 92-year Test cricket history, recording more wins than defeats for the first time. It took 580 Tests for India to achieve a win/loss ratio greater than 1 for the first time. Till date India have drawn 222 Tests.- Before the Chennai Test, Rishabh Pant had last played Test cricket against Bangladesh in December 2022 in Dhaka before he suffered a horrific car crash forcing him out of action for over one and a half years. After a title-winning run at T20 World Cup earlier this year, Pant made a successful Test comeback at the Chepauk, scoring a superb second innings ton -- 109.- The Rishabh Pant 6th Test ton in Chennai was also special as he helped him level with the legendary MS Dhoni for joint-most centuries by a wicketkeeper-batter for India in the format. While Dhoni managed 6 centuries in 144 innings, Pant did it in just 58.- Aging like a fine wine, Ashwin, aged 38 years and 2 days, became the oldest man to claim a fifer for India in the longest format. Before Ashwin, Vinoo Mankad held the record, bagging a fifer aged 37 years and 306 days in 1955 Peshawar Test vs arch-rivals Pakistan.- With the fifer in the second innings after a ton with the bat in the first, Ashwin became the oldest player to achieve a double (100 and 5-wicket haul) in the history of men's Test cricket.- Ashwin now has a ton and a fifer in a Test at one venue twice, making him the only cricketer to have such a feat. He had scored a century and had a five-wicket haul against England at Chepauk in 2021 as well.- With his 6 for 88, Ashwin reached the milestone of 750 international wickets. He is now only the fourth spinner to achieve this after Muttiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne , and Anil Kumble.- With 6 wickets in the Test, Ashwin moved up to the eighth spot on the all-time leading Test wicket-takers list, surpassing Courtney Walsh's 519 wickets in the format.- Ashwin now has a hundred and a fifer in the same Test 4 times. And he is only behind England great Ian Botham, who had achieved the same feat 5 times.- Ashwin bagged his 37th five-wicket haul in Tests, helping him tie with spin great Shane Warne for joint second-most fifers in the format. The only one ahead of Ashwin is Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan, who has 67 five-wicket hauls.- Ashwin now has 7 five-fors in the fourth-innings, the joint-second most, alongside Warne and Muralidaran.- As Ashwin claimed a six-for on Sunday, he surpassed Anil Kumble on the list of most wickets by an Indian in the fourth innings. Ashwin now has 99 fourth-innings wickets while Kumble has 94. Bishan Bedi bagged 60 while Ishant Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja are joint-fourth on the list.- Ravindra Jadeja now has a 50-plus score and five or more wickets in a Test 12 times. Ian Botham did it 16 times in the format while Shakib Al Hasan and Ashwin have done the same on 11 occasions.- At 37, star Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan logged his most expensive bowling figures in his Test career, leaking 129 runs in 21 overs while failing to take a single wicket across two innings. It was the fifth time in his career that he went wicketless in a Test match after bowling at least 20 overs.- The second day of the Test saw the fall of a staggering 17 wickets, which is now the most at the Chepauk. In the 1979 Test between India and West Indies, Day 3 of the Chepauk Test saw a fall of 15 wickets. In the 2021 India vs England Test, Day 2 and Day 4 also saw the fall of 15 wickets respectively.- India's Yashasvi Jaiswal is now fourth on the list of batters with most runs after first 10 Tests. Australia's Don Bradman had scored 1446 runs while Everton Weekes (West Indies) and George Headley (West Indies) scored 1125 and 1102 runs respectively after the first 10 Tests. For India, the record was previously held by Sunil Gavaskar -- 978 runs. Virat Kohli scored 6 and 17 in the two innings of the Chepauk Test and now has 18 dismissals vs spinners since 2021 in Tests. He has 499 runs at an average of 27.72.",India beat Bangladesh by 280 runs to go 1-0 up in the 2-game series. Ravichandran Ashwin (119) and Rishabh Pant (109) starred in India's clinical win. Ashwin became the oldest player to achieve a double (100 and 5-wicket haul) in men's Test cricket.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113572991,imgsize-52084,width-400,resizemode-4/113572991.jpg"

Tom Latham (28), Kane Williamson (30), and Tom Blundell (30) all made starts but failed to convert them into significant scores.While New Zealand's target is still achievable, Sri Lanka will rely on their spinners to capitalize on the day five pitch and secure the victory.","Sri Lanka remain on track for victory against New Zealand in the opening Test in Galle, despite a determined effort by Rachin Ravindra.

The seasoned spinner enjoyed his stint on the pitch in Chennai, known for its pacer-friendly characteristics due to steep bounce.Ashwin's exceptional figures of 6 for 88 were instrumental in India's 280-run victory on Sunday.At 38, he has amassed 522 wickets from 101 Tests, underscoring his prowess in varying conditions.Highlighting his adaptability, Ashwin explained that his success came from leveraging the bounce on the pitch rather than waiting for spin assistance.""Look, I think this pitch, even if you bowl good balls, you will go for runs. But the bounce is going to be quite daunting. The beauty about red soil is you put revs on it, there is value and there is bounce,"" PTI quoted Ashwin as saying to reporters in the post-match press meet.The Chennai-based cricketer expressed his preference for playing on red-soil pitches over black-soil ones.""You play on some black clay surfaces around the country, and without naming them, you have to do a lot of hard work, put a lot of revs and see nothing come out of it.""He elaborated on the complexities of different soil types and the experience he has gained from them over the years.""Sometimes it's better to not put revs on it in certain places. So, to even understand all these, and talk about it is a fair amount of learning for me. It's happened over the years. Like I said, this one's got solid bounce. I will any day play on a surface like this and get hit than play on other surfaces.""Lamenting the prevalence of black-soil pitches in the country, Ashwin noted that red-soil pitches have historically been crucial for Test cricket in India.""The surfaces react very differently at different times of the year. We've lost a lot of red soil pitches over the years, which was a key component of playing Test cricket in India.""He advocated for preserving pitch variety rather than standardizing them.""Sometimes around the country, people do make the mistake of terming India as a whole. I actually think India has a lot of foreign soil in its own nature. Sometimes, you go to Eden, it doesn't feel home. Then you go to Dharamshala, all of a sudden, it doesn't feel home.""Addressing misconceptions about Indian pitches, Ashwin emphasized their diverse nature.""For some wild reason, people don't seem to assimilate this because the nature of soil is different, the weather is different.""He concluded by highlighting the lack of uniformity in India's cricket calendar compared to other countries.""It's not like Australia where every Boxing Day Test match happens at Melbourne. We don't do that. The Pongal Test doesn't happen in Chennai always.""","Ravichandran Ashwin took six wickets in India's 280-run victory over Bangladesh. Ashwin played on a red-soil pitch, known for its pacer-friendly characteristics.

Guardiola has previously asserted that some of City's rivals are hoping for a guilty verdict, and he seems convinced that they would expect the punishment to be harsh.He raised the issue unprompted before the upcoming match against Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium, while discussing the tendency of people to excessively criticize isolated poor performances.""During a season, you can say, 'Oh, it was a bad season',"" said Guardiola. ""But for performances some people say, 'Oh, it's a disgrace, it is a disaster, it's unacceptable'.

In Kolkata:

In Jamshedpur:

KOLKATA: The way Mohammedan Sporting players sat on the Kishore Bharati Stadium turf after the final whistle on Saturday — some looking blank and others with faces buried in their knees — said it all.For the second game running, Andrey Chernyshov ’s black-and-white brigade conceded a goal in stoppage-time. Unlike their loss against NorthEast United FC in the opener, the ISL debutants managed to eke out a 1-1 draw against FC Goa But it was a victory snatched away from under their feet at the death.Having controlled the proceedings against Manolo Marquez’s visitors, Alexis Gomez became Mohammedan Sporting’s first goalscorer in ISL history when he deservedly put his team in front in the 66th minute, converting a penalty earned by his Brazilian striker Carlos Franca .Spurred on by the partisan crowd, Chernyshov’s team looked headed towards a victory until FC Goa came calling in the fourth of the six-minute stoppage-time and spoiled the hosts’ party. Armando Sadiku — who joined the Goan outfit after being released by Mohun Bagan SG — turned out to be the party pooper, planting substitute Akash Sangwan’s cross with a powerful header from close.While FC Goa — who lost 1-2 to Jamshedpur FC at home four days ago — escaped another defeat, Mohammedan Sporting faced another reminder of the adage that nothing gets over in football until it’s over.Goa started on the front foot but the hosts gradually grew in confidence as the game wore on. Franca was a constant threat to the Goa box, drawing a couple of saves from the rival goalkeeper Laxmikanth Kattimani and hitting the cross piece on another occasion in the opening 45 minutes.FC Goa hold the record of scoring maximum away goals (124) in ISL history but they appeared to have got cold feet in the face of Mohammedan Sporting’s relentless pressure even after the break.Franca — who again missed a couple of sitters — finally earned a penalty when FC Goa's Spanish defender Odei Onaindia pushed the Brazilian from behind, leading referee Aditya Purkayastha to point to the spot. Alexis made no mistake to convert the resultant penalty.Still Goa came calling when Muhammad Nemil rounded goalkeeper Padam Chhetri but Mohammedan Sporting’s defender Zuidika came up with a vital block to deny him.The home fans thought it was enough to clinch the issue. But the next time Goa stormed the box, Sangwan whipped in an inviting cross and Sadiku rose to the occasion to bring home the equalizer for his team and plunge the hosts into another round of stoppage-time ‘heartbreak’.Mohammedan SC 1 (Gomez 66) FC Goa 1 (Sadiku 90+4);Jamshedpur FC 3 (Murray 36, Javi 44, 50) Mumbai City 2 (Karelis 18, Van Nieff 77).",ISL debutants Mohammedan Sporting eke out a 1-1 draw against FC Goa.

Kylian Mbappe , who has now scored in four straight matches for the club, added a late penalty to put the result beyond doubt.Meanwhile, league leaders Barcelona, boasting a 100% record with five wins from five games, face a tough test on Sunday as they visit fourth-placed Villarreal, who are yet to taste defeat this season. Hansi Flick's men will be looking to reestablish their four-point cushion at the top of the table.""It was hard for us to score goals in the first half but we made so many chances,"" midfielder Luka Modric told Real Madrid TV, as quoted by AFP. ""The team played well... we had a great game and we can be happy, but we have to continue (like this).""The win marked 38th game in a row where Real Madrid did not get defeated. It's been a year since they lost, which was in September last year when Atletico Madrid beat their city rivals.""That says a lot, not losing games in so many weeks is really nice, but we have to continue,"" added Modric. ""It's quality, character, commitment from the team, everyone is ready when called on... those are the key factors.""Carlo Ancelotti, the coach of Madrid, decided to rest Vinicius for the start of the match, given the team's busy schedule. Instead, he chose to play Arda Guler alongside Mbappe and Rodrygo.Throughout the first half, Madrid dominated the game but failed to score. Mbappe was heavily involved, seeking his sixth goal of the season across all competitions. Joan Garcia, the Espanyol goalkeeper, made an impressive save at his near post to deny Mbappe's attempt from a tight angle.Following the corner, Eder Militao's header narrowly missed the target. Mbappe had another long-range effort stopped and also sliced a shot off-target. Growing increasingly frustrated, Mbappe received a booking for arguing against a decision made against him.Jude Bellingham struck a powerful shot from the edge of the box, but Garcia saved it comfortably, resulting in a goalless scoreline at halftime. Madrid has only managed to score one first-half goal in eight matches this season.In the second half, Carlos Romero's off-target strike provided a glimmer of hope for the newly-promoted visitors, but Madrid continued to dominate possession and create chances.However, in the 54th minute, Madrid were left stunned as Courtois inadvertently deflected Jofre Carreras' cross into his own net, giving the underdogs a surprising lead.Ancelotti quickly introduced Vinicius, but it was Carvajal who equalized just four minutes later, tapping in on the line after Bellingham's cross eluded the previously unbeatable Garcia.As Madrid intensified their pressure, Espanyol's defense eventually crumbled. Vinicius showcased his skill with a sublime outside-of-the-boot cross, setting up Rodrygo for Madrid's second goal.The Brazilian then turned provider, unselfishly playing Vinicius through on goal to score the third. Mbappe capped off the resounding victory by converting a late penalty, securing a comfortable win for the home side.","Real Madrid beat Espanyol 4-1 to close gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona to one point.

If you win, you will get this much as a bonus, and if the team wins this much extra.""The committee then decided to authorize the captain to discuss it with the player.""Rajpal refused to comment on the matter but another member of the executive committee who attended the meeting confirmed, without revealing details, that Nagal's request was agreed to.An AITA source familiar with the subject said, ""It ($50,000) is roughly Rs. 40-45 lakh for two ties in a year. So essentially, he has asked for Rs. 20 lakh per tie, which I think is fine. A (No. 1) player gets anywhere around Rs. 7 to 12 lakhs at the moment.""As a standalone figure it might seem exorbitant, but to put it in perspective, a player earned $100,000 simply for turning up in the singles first round at the US Open this year. At the French Open, a first-round appearance made a player richer by 73,000-euros.It is also understood that Nagal had requested for a change in support staff attached to the Indian Davis Cup team. It is not clear whether he wanted both Rajpal (as captain by Mahesh Bhupathi) and Zeeshan Ali (as coach by Somdev Devvarman ) to be replaced, or only the latter. Devvarman is Nagal's mentor.The AITA subsequently appointed Ashutosh Singh as coach after Ali resigned.Nagal issued a detailed statement on the subject while also responding to the attack from the AITA that he skipped the Stockholm sojourn despite being fit.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup, as playing for the national team is a moment I cherish deeply. However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team’s chances,"" said Nagal, who on Thursday pulled out of the ATP 250 event in Hangzhou.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""","Sumit Nagal had asked to be paid $50,000 a year for playing Davis Cup.

However, Nagal defended this by stating that it is common practice for athletes to be compensated for their participation.Nagal had opted out of the recent Davis Cup tie against Sweden, citing a back strain. This injury had also forced him to withdraw from the US Open men's doubles competition last month.Without a singles specialist, India lost 0-4 to Sweden on their home turf.The team, primarily composed of doubles players and debutants, failed to win a set in the World Group I tie.On Thursday, AITA expressed its displeasure, claiming top players like Nagal, Yuki Bhambri , and Sasikumar Mukund had refused national duty.Nagal was scheduled to play in the ATP 250 Hangzhou Open but withdrew, again citing his back issue.""You tell me why should a player be asking for money to play for the country. This is a big question. He had demanded an annual fee of $50,000 (approx 45 lakh) and said if he is not paid, he will not play,"" Dhupar told PTI.India plays only two ties per season in the World Group I, typically in February and September.""Let the country decide if it is right or not. Then, it is the decision of the government and everybody. The players are also paid by TOPS. And it's not that they don't get paid for playing the Davis Cup. They do get paid,"" Dhupar insisted.Dhupar was referring to the prize money that AITA receives from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) for Davis Cup participation, which is distributed among team members.For a World Group I tie, AITA receives around Rs 30 lakh, of which 70 per cent is distributed among participating players. The remaining 30 per cent is kept for administrative expenses by the national federation.The prize money decreases for lower group ties.""No other player asked for additional money over and above their share of the ITF prize money.""A former Indian Davis Cupper confirmed that there have been past instances where leading players asked for money to play Davis Cup and those demands were accepted.Nagal did not deny AITA's claim. He defended his stance through a statement on social media.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""AITA was displeased that Nagal skipped Davis Cup by citing injury but seemed to recover in time for the Hangzhou Open.

I had informed AITA well in advance about my inability to participate.""It was learned that Captain Rohit Rajpal took Nagal's proposal to the AITA Executive Committee. After initial reluctance, the committee agreed to pay him, but requested the captain to renegotiate the figure.However, before an agreement could be reached, Nagal withdrew from the tie and the discussion ended without progress.During the tie, Nagal criticized AITA on social media, stating that many team members were there only to enjoy junkets.He justified his break further.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Nagal reaffirmed his commitment to representing the country.""I look forward to future opportunities to wear the national colours and make my country proud, both on and off the court.""Nagal had also skipped the tie against Pakistan earlier this year, stating that the grass court surface did not suit his style of play as well as hard courts do.Skipper Rajpal faces criticism on social media, with many questioning his suitability as Davis Cup captain.Rajpal was appointed captain in 2019, replacing Mahesh Bhupathi , who hesitated to travel to Pakistan due to security concerns.A team official noted that receiving payment like cricketers is acceptable, but tennis players should also be willing to go through a selection process.""They want contracts, but do they play Nationals? Do they come to the national side through selection trials like shooters and badminton players? Tennis players get paid through Davis Cup prize money and are also funded by the government through TOPS,"" he asserted.","All India Tennis Association ( AITA) claimed Sumit Nagal demanded an annual fee of $50,000 to play Davis Cup ties for India.

Sinner's stellar record this year includes 55 wins and just 5 losses.However, his journey to winning the US Open was not without issues. Before the tournament, an independent tribunal cleared him of any wrongdoing related to a case that had drawn significant public and player attention.Allegations suggested that tennis' anti-doping authorities treated Sinner differently from other players, leading to a divided locker room atmosphere.In March, Jannik Sinner tested positive for Clostebol, a banned substance, twice. However, it was determined that the presence of the steroid was accidental, caused by a massage from his former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi.Naldi had unknowingly transferred Clostebol to Sinner while treating his own finger with a spray containing the substance, provided by Sinner’s ex-fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara. The investigation cleared Sinner of intentional doping, and he faced no suspension.Despite these distractions, Sinner stayed focused and demonstrated his skill on the court. His victory in New York extended his winning streak to 11 matches.Top players such as Novak Djokovic , Carlos Alcaraz , Alexander Zverev , and Daniil Medvedev have faced Sinner's strong performance first hand.These victories underscore Sinner's prominent role in tennis, continuing to impress both fans and competitors.In the video, Jannik Sinner faced off against 21-year-old Carlos Alcaraz.

Even Djokovic was impressed by Sinner's shot.Jannik Sinner's recent victories have solidified his position as a leading figure in tennis. At a young age, his achievements reflect his talent and commitment.
