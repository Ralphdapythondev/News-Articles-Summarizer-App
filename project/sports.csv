He joins his esteemed teammates Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in bidding farewell to the format.Jadeja, widely regarded as one of the world's best fielders, stated that he will continue to represent India in ODIs and Tests.Since making his T20I debut against Sri Lanka in 2009, he has played 74 matches, scoring 515 runs and taking 54 wickets.“With a heart full of gratitude, I bid farewell to T20 internationals. Like a steadfast horse galloping with pride, I’ve always given my best for my country and will continue to do so in other formats . Winning the T20 World Cup was a dream come true, a pinnacle of my T20 International career. Thank you for the memories, the cheers, and the unwavering support,"" Jadeja wrote on his Instagram handle.In the T20 World Cup final on Saturday, India secured their second title in the tournament's history by defeating South Africa by seven runs.Following the triumph, both Rohit and Kohli announced their retirement from the T20I format.His retirement marks the end of an era, leaving behind a legacy of stellar performances and memorable moments on the T20I stage.Jadeja, fondly known as ""Jaddu"" and ""Sir Jadeja,"" was born on December 6, 1988, in Jamnagar, Gujarat. He made his mark in the fast-paced world of T20 cricket after his India debut against Sri Lanka in 2009, just before the T20 World Cup that year.Jadeja's ascent in the format, however, began with the Rajasthan Royals' historic IPL victory in 2008.

His performances earned him the nickname ""Rockstar"" from his then-franchise captain, the late Shane Warne.In 2012, Chennai Super Kings acquired Jadeja for around Rs 9.8 Crore, making him the most expensive player in that year's auction. He went on to win three more IPL titles with CSK, including being named player of the match in the 2023 final against Gujarat Titans after hitting the winning four off the last ball.In his international career in the shortest format, Jadeja played 74 matches, scoring 515 runs and taking 54 wickets. His precision and subtle variations made him a challenging opponent for batters looking to score freely, especially in the middle overs. Throughout his T20I career, Jadeja consistently provided breakthroughs for his team at crucial moments, turning matches in India's favor with timely strikes.Apart from his bowling, Jadeja's fielding set him apart as one of the finest all-rounders of his generation, known for his lightning-fast reflexes and athletic prowess. His exceptional catches, direct hits, and game-changing run-outs will be a significant part of his T20I legacy.Jadeja's all-round abilities were further highlighted in the 2014 World T20, where his economical bowling (five wickets at an economy of 7.36) and crucial lower-order contributions helped India reach the final.The retirement of Rohit, Kohli, and Jadeja signifies the end of an era in T20Is for India, with BCCI President Roger Binny acknowledging that it would take at least two years from now for the side to settle down.","India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja announces retirement from T20 Internationals.

'Player of the Tournament' Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional 18th over, in which he conceded only two runs and picked up a wicket, further tilted the balance in India's favour.Arshdeep then bowled the penultimate over and kept the pressure on the Proteas by giving away just four runs.The defining moment of the match came at the start of the 20th over when Suryakumar Yadav took a spectacular catch at the boundary off Pandya's bowling.

Timely departure of big guns gives space to groom players for 2026 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/timely-departure-of-big-guns-gives-space-to-groom-players-for-2026-world-cup/articleshow/111385255.cms,"NEW DELHI: The retirement of Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma , and Ravindra Jadeja from T20 cricket signifies the conclusion of a remarkable chapter in Indian cricket history. However, their decision to step away at this juncture is well-timed, as it provides the selectors and incoming team management with ample opportunity to strategize for the upcoming World Cup, set to take place in India in 2026.Jadeja's announcement came as no surprise, following closely on the heels of Rohit and Kohli's decision to bid farewell to the T20 format, just a day after the team's triumphant World Cup victory.Filling the void left by these three exceptional players in the starting lineup will undoubtedly require time and effort. Nevertheless, the transition process is set to commence as early as the following week, when a second-string Indian squad will face off against Zimbabwe in a series of five T20Is, beginning on July 6.During this well-deserved break, Hardik Pandya , who has been given a rest from the series, is anticipated to take over the reins as the T20I captain from Rohit. He will be closely monitoring the progress and performance of the fringe players during this period.“The 2026 T20 World Cup is a long time away. Very happy for Rohit and Virat. Two giants of Indian cricket who thoroughly deserved this,” said Hardik after holding his nerve with the ball in the final over on Saturday against South Africa.The Indian cricket team faces the challenge of filling the void left by the retirement of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the opening slots. The squad for the Zimbabwe tour includes four openers: Yashavsi Jaiswal, a member of the World Cup winning team, Shubman Gill , Ruturaj Gaikwad, and Abhishek Sharma. It is expected that Gill and Jaiswal will be the opening pair for the first T20I in Harare on Saturday.Ravindra Jadeja's retirement positions Axar Patel as the primary spin-bowling all-rounder in the Indian team. During the World Cup, Axar demonstrated his versatility by batting in the middle-order and taking on the challenging task of bowling in the powerplay.His crucial 47 off 31 balls in the final against South Africa helped India recover from a subpar powerplay, and he delivered a man-of-the-match performance in the semi-final against England.However, Jadeja's role in the tournament was limited, as he bowled the fewest overs among the spinners and batted in the lower-order.Jadeja's retirement opens up more opportunities for the injury-prone Washington Sundar in the T20 setup. Abhishek Sharma, despite being an opener, has a better chance of establishing himself as a spin all-rounder in the middle-order, given the abundance of options at the top of the batting order.Roger Binny, the BCCI president and a member of the 1983 World Cup winning team, witnessed India's second T20 World Cup triumph at the Kensington Oval and remains optimistic about the team's future prospects.“There is so much talent in the IPL. Lot of cricketers are coming through but it is going to take some time to bridge the gap (after the retirement of Rohit and Kohli from T20Is),” Binny told PTI.“They have contributed so much. It's going to take time. We will probably see in the next two-three years, the team coming back into its own without them,” he added.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja retire from T20 cricket.

Ravindra Jadeja: A thoroughbred who found his own course,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/ravindra-jadeja-a-thoroughbred-who-found-his-own-course/articleshow/111384032.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ravindra Jadeja recently concluded his T20I career with the World Cup, where he was often overshadowed by his more illustrious teammates. Throughout his career in white-ball formats, the spotlight tended to shine on Jasprit Bumrah and the spin duo Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal. In Tests, Ravichandran Ashwin was often seen as the lead spinner.Jadeja never publicly complained or shared cryptic social media posts about his role. Even as he concluded his T20I stint, Jadeja remained in the shadows of cricket icons like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.At 35, Jadeja's decision to retire from T20Is may have been influenced by the recognition that any announcement concurrent with Kohli and Sharma might have been overlooked. During India’s eight matches in the Americas, Jadeja's contributions were minimal, scoring 35 runs and taking one wicket across 14 overs. However, he garnered more attention during India's victory parade at Kensington Oval after their historic win over South Africa in the final.Jadeja's performance in T20Is did not reach the heights of his contributions in other formats. Over 74 T20Is, he accumulated 515 runs and took 54 wickets at an economy rate of 7.1. These statistics may seem underwhelming for someone known for his consistent bowling and batting abilities.In the recent World Cup, Axar Patel emerged as a key player for India, often filling Jadeja’s usual role by bowling more overs and batting higher in the order. This was not a reflection of the team management's view of Jadeja's abilities. Instead, Jadeja was kept in reserve as an insurance for potential top or middle-order collapses that eventually did not occur.Under coach Rahul Dravid, who concluded his tenure with the World Cup, selection metrics for the Indian side went beyond mere numbers. Dravid appreciated what Jadeja brought to the team across all formats.“If you look at the numbers, we look at stats, we look at data, we look at it quite a lot, and Jadeja has been exceptional.“Our seamers are often fantastic upfront, so, the performances of people like Jaddu and Kuldeep (Yadav) have probably gone slightly unnoticed,” Dravid had said.Jadeja struggled as a batsman during the T20Is, often coming in at No. 7, a challenging position for someone who isn't a natural hitter like Hardik Pandya.In the semifinal against England in Guyana, he demonstrated his ability to make crucial runs down the order. Jadeja scored an unbeaten 17 off 9 balls, helping India strengthen their total from 146 for six to 171 for seven, laying the groundwork for a 68-run victory.Despite Jadeja's performance, Rohit's fluent 57 off 39 balls overshadowed his contribution. Additionally, Jadeja was economical in his three overs, conceding just 16 runs, yet it was Axar who bagged the player of the match award for his three wickets for 23 runs.That match exemplified Jadeja’s typical performance—he fulfilled his role effectively, but the spotlight remained on others.“As an allrounder, my role is to make an impact in tough situations. When you need the crucial 30-40 runs or when there is a partnership going on and you need a wicket. Change the game,” he had said.Jadeja altered the game's dynamics with precise mathematical strategies and keen understanding of cricket angles. His adeptness lies in comprehending the geometric aspects of the sport. The effective application of angles and calculations distinguishes his gameplay.",Ravindra Jadeja recently concluded his T20I career with the World Cup.

Brazil Vs Paraguay: Vinicius Junior nets brace in Brazil's 4-1 Copa America victory over Paraguay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/vinicius-junior-nets-brace-in-brazils-4-1-copa-america-victory-over-paraguay/articleshow/111354745.cms,"NEW DELHI: Brazil displayed a convincing 4-1 victory over Paraguay in their second Group D match of the Copa America on Friday, with Real Madrid 's Vinicius Junior playing a pivotal role by scoring two goals. The result helped Brazil bounce back strongly from a disappointing opening performance.Vinicius, who had a subdued outing in the previous game, was a constant menace down the left flank throughout the match.His movement and trickery caused significant problems for the Paraguayan defence.His first goal, arriving in the 35th minute, exemplified Brazil's fluid attacking play. A well-worked team move culminated in Lucas Paqueta delivering a precise first-time pass to Vinicius, who calmly slotted the ball home.Brazil doubled their lead shortly after through Girona winger Savio, who reacted quickest to a rebound inside the penalty area. Vinicius then added his second and Brazil's third just before half-time, capitalizing on a defensive error by Omar Alderete .The Paraguayan defender's attempted clearance struck Vinicius's outstretched leg and deflected into the net.Paraguay showed resilience early in the second half, pulling a goal back through a spectacular long-range strike from Alderete. However, any hopes of an unlikely comeback were dashed when Lucas Paqueta atoned for an earlier penalty miss by converting a spot-kick in the 68th minute.This victory leads Brazil to second place in Group D with four points from two matches. Colombia currently lead the group with a perfect record of two wins from two, securing their place in the quarter-finals. Costa Rica, on the other hand, occupy the third spot with one point, while Paraguay sit at the bottom of the table with two losses.","Brazil beat Paraguay 4-1 in their second Group D match of the Copa America.

On the other hand, Gareca was late in bringing on a player at halftime during Chile's match against Argentina on Tuesday.CONMEBOL cited articles 104 and 145 of the tournament's regulations, which stipulate that teams must take the field on time for the scheduled start or restart of play. Failure to do so has resulted in the one-match suspension for both Scaloni and Gareca, preventing them from being present on the substitutes' bench during their respective teams' final group stage matches on Saturday.In addition to the suspensions, the Argentine and Chilean football federations have each been fined $15,000 as a consequence of their teams' tardiness.As things stand, Argentina currently top Group A with six points and have already secured their place in the quarter-finals. They will face Peru on Saturday without the presence of Scaloni on the sidelines.Meanwhile, Chile, with only one point, will take on group runners-up Canada in their final group match, also without the guidance of Gareca from the bench.While the suspensions and fines may seem harsh, they serve as a reminder to teams and coaching staff of the need to respect the established rules and schedules, ensuring the smooth and timely progression of the competition.","The South American football governing body, CONMEBOL, has taken disciplinary action against the coaches of Argentina and Chile, Lionel Scaloni and Ricardo Gareca.

The goals from Luis Diaz , Davinson Sanchez , and Jhon Cordoba ensured that Colombia finished in the top two positions in Group D.With this win, Colombia extended their unbeaten streak to 25 games, a remarkable achievement that dates back to February 2022 when they suffered a defeat against Argentina.Nestor Lorenzo's well-drilled side displayed a composed and organized performance, never allowing Costa Rica to threaten their unbeaten record.The opening goal came in the 31st minute when Liverpool's Luis Diaz converted a penalty kick with authority after Costa Rican goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira committed a reckless challenge on Jhon Cordoba near the edge of the penalty area. Diaz's powerful strike found the top corner, giving Colombia the lead.Colombia came close to doubling their advantage in the 37th minute when veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picked out Diaz at the back post with a precise cross. However, Diaz's attempted cutback across the face of the goal narrowly evaded the outstretched Davinson Sanchez.Sanchez made amends for the missed opportunity in the 59th minute, glancing in Jhon Arias's left-wing cross to extend Colombia's lead to 2-0. Three minutes later, Cordoba scored the third goal with a clinical finish, latching onto Rodriguez's incisive through ball and firing a low shot across the goalkeeper and into the far corner.With this comprehensive victory, Colombia will qualify for the quarter-finals as group winners if they can secure at least a point against Brazil in their final group game on Tuesday.

This unexpected result has given the Slovaks belief that they can overcome their higher-ranked opponent and progress further in the competition.""The English have quality, but every opponent they have played were able to torment them,"" Slovakia midfielder Ondrej Duda told TV Markíza.Slovakia's head coach, Francesco Calzona , referred to his squad as the unexpected success story of the group stage following their victory against Belgium. Meanwhile, the underdog team from Georgia also exceeded predictions by stunning Portugal with a 2-0 win, demonstrating that no team should be underestimated.Although England supporters celebrated their team's placement on the more favorable side of the tournament bracket, potentially providing a less challenging path to the final, this advantage exists only in theory.""I think everyone has seen in this competition that there is not a favourable side of the draw,"" England defender Marc Guehi told reporters on Thursday. ""Every team, every opponent, is really tough to come up against. I think we need to remain calm.""England demonstrated some progress in the latter half of their goalless draw against Slovenia on Tuesday, with Kobbie Mainoo and Cole Palmer making a positive impact as substitutes.Although England's backline was a significant worry prior to the tournament due to the absence of experienced players like Harry Maguire, it has been the strongest aspect of the team's Euro performance . Throughout the group stage, England have conceded the fewest expected goals (xG) - a metric that quantifies the quality of scoring opportunities allowed to opponents.Southgate will be hoping for an improved display from Jude Bellingham , who excelled in the first half of their 1-0 victory against Serbia but faded in the subsequent two matches.Slovakia's key player is the skillful Napoli midfielder Stanislav Lobotka , whom Italian legend Andrea Pirlo described as ""the best playmaker in the Italian league.""Calzona, who had served as an assistant throughout his career before being named Slovakia's manager in 2022, stated that his team had already achieved their primary objective of reaching Euro. ""Everything else,"" he told UEFA , ""is icing on the cake.""""One of the goals now will certainly be to play beautiful football and make these people proud, because we've had a great following at recent matches,"" he said.England faces a challenging match against Slovakia, who are expected to adopt a defensive approach. The English side has had difficulties breaking down teams that employ a low block defensive strategy.However, England can take comfort in their historical record against Slovakia, having never lost to them in six previous encounters, including five victories and a goalless draw during the group stage of Euro 2016.Both teams had impressive Euro qualifying campaigns, with Slovakia securing seven wins and a draw in their 10 matches, while England emerged from their five-team group with six wins and two draws.The victor of this encounter will progress to the quarter-finals, where they will face the winner of the match between Italy and Switzerland.","England face Slovakia in Euro 2024 last-16 match.

The comprehensive win puts Uruguay on the brink of securing a quarter-final berth.From the outset, Uruguay showcased their attacking prowess, taking an early lead in the eighth minute. A well-executed set piece culminated in Facundo Pellistri finding the back of the net with a decisive header.Maintaining their offensive pressure, Uruguay doubled their advantage just past the 20-minute mark.Darwin Nunez , continuing his impressive scoring streak, unleashed a powerful left-footed strike that beat Bolivian goalkeeper Guillermo Vizcarra. This goal marked Nunez's seventh consecutive international match finding the scoresheet.Despite a period of reduced intensity at the start of the second half, much to the visible frustration of manager Marcelo Bielsa , Uruguay reignited their attacking momentum. In the 77th minute, Maximiliano Araujo effectively sealed the victory, capitalizing on a precise through ball from Nicolas de la Cruz to score from close range.Uruguay's dominance continued into the closing stages of the match. Federico Valverde extended the lead to 4-0 just four minutes after Araujo's goal. Substitute Rodrigo Bentancur added the final touch to the rout, heading home Uruguay's fifth goal in the 89th minute, marking his first touch of the game.With this victory, Uruguay are firmly in control of their Copa America destiny. A draw or better against the United States in their final group stage match on Monday will guarantee them top spot in Group C and a place in the quarter-finals. Even a defeat might see them progress, given their superior goal difference.For Bolivia, the loss marks their second in as many games, leaving them with a slim mathematical chance of avoiding a fourth consecutive group stage exit.The match also provided a platform for Uruguay's emerging talents. Darwin Nunez further solidified his position as a key player, netting his 13th international goal.Meanwhile, the legendary Luis Suarez, Uruguay's all-time leading scorer, made a late appearance as a substitute, immediately assuming the captain's armband.","Uruguay beat Bolivia 5-0 in their Copa America Group C encounter at New Jersey's Red Bull Arena.

"'I want to go for the title', says Novak Djokovic ahead of Wimbledon",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/i-want-to-go-for-the-title-says-novak-djokovic-ahead-of-wimbledon/articleshow/111385369.cms,"LONDON: Jelena Djokovic posed a question to her husband as he fast-tracked his recovery from knee surgery , rushing to compete at Wimbledon , where he is already a seven-time champion.Mrs Djokovic, a constant presence at courtside, only verbalised the query on every connoisseur’s mind.The 37-year-old Serbian, who has won 24 major titles, but is yet to win an Olympic gold, earlier in the year labelled the 2024 Summer Games a priority for himself.Yet, here he was, seeking counsel – from Taylor Fritz to Stan Wawrinka to champion Alpine ski racer Lindsay Vonn – after his right knee went under the knife to repair a torn medial meniscus in Paris, in a highway-chase to match fitness.There should be more Wimbledons for Djokovic in the next couple of years, but who knows if there’ll be another Olympic Games for him?Why the rush then? Why the unnecessary risk?Djokovic conceded that the question, when posed to him again at his pre-championship press-conference, was fair.“I wouldn't call it a fear of missing out,” Djokovic argued. “It’s this incredible desire to play, particularly because it is Wimbledon. The thought of me missing Wimbledon was just not correct. It's probably less of a rational or logical explanation, but more of an inner feeling of a great desire to play Wimbledon.”Djokovic, seeded two, faces Czech qualifier Vit Kopriva in the first round.“I wanted to see how fast I can recover, be in a condition to compete at best-of-five on grass,” Djokovic said. “I didn't come here to play a few rounds and prove to myself that I can actually compete in one or two matches. I want to go for the title.Djokovic, who finds himself in an unlikely situation, as he’s yet to win a title this season at the halfway stage, is aware that his next tournament is the Olympics on clay.“We put in a huge amount of hours into rehab in the last three weeks, raising the level of intensity of training and rehab every single day,” he said. “I haven't had any setbacks. If I had one setback, I would be then questioning whether I should be here or not. But I haven't had a single one. Why not give it a shot?”Djokovic -- who could play Tomas Etchebverry in the third round, and Holger Rune in the fourth is projected to meet seventh seed Hubert Hurkacz in the quarter-finals -- arrived in this leafy suburb a week ago, sporting a knee brace.“It's been a good week of training, particularly the last three days. I played practice sets played with (Jannik) Sinner, Frances Tiafoe, (Daniil) Medvedev and Emil Ruusuvuori and Holger Rune,” he said. “The knee has responded very well so far, that’s why I decided to be in the draw.The Serbian, seeded to play fourth seed Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals, is in the lighter half of the men’s draw, which gives him an opportunity to play himself into the tournament.Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and the world No.1 Jannik Sinner headline the top–half and are seeded to meet in the semifinals.",Djokovic faces Czech qualifier Vit Kopriva in the first round of Wimbledon.

The 37-year-old emphasized that skipping the prestigious event would not have been the right decision.Djokovic, who is on a quest to match Roger Federer 's record of eight Wimbledon titles and become the oldest champion in the modern era, attributed his participation to his ""incredible desire to play and compete"".The injury occurred during the French Open earlier this month, where Djokovic was compelled to withdraw before his quarter-final match. He subsequently underwent surgery to repair the damaged meniscus in his right knee and has not competed since then.""I do have something that is described as a feeling of not missing out at a Grand Slam while I can still play and while I'm still active and at this level,"" AFP quoted Djokovic as saying.""I wouldn't call it a fear of missing out.

The Serbian player, known for his dominance on the court, has yet to secure a title in the current season.In a surprising turn of events, the young Italian sensation, Jannik Sinner , not only claimed Djokovic's Australian Open title but also dethroned him from the world number one spot. At just 22 years of age, Sinner has emerged as a formidable force in the tennis world.To add to Djokovic's challenges, Carlos Alcaraz , who had previously ended the Serbian's reign at Wimbledon last year, has now achieved another significant milestone. The rising star from Spain recently clinched the French Open title, further solidifying his position as a top contender in the sport.""I'm confident about the health of my knee and just the general physical state is really good,"" said the Serb who is chasing a 25th Grand Slam title.""I haven't had any setbacks.

Alcaraz referred to the Serbian star as ""superhuman"" on Saturday, acknowledging his incredible resilience and determination.However, Djokovic revealed that his inspiration came from another player, American Taylor Fritz , who underwent a similar knee operation in 2021. Fritz sustained his injury during the French Open and required assistance from a wheelchair to leave the court.Remarkably, Fritz made a swift comeback, returning to action at Wimbledon a mere 21 days after his surgery. Despite the short recovery time, he managed to reach the third round of the prestigious tournament, showcasing his tenacity and dedication to the sport.""I think Taylor Fritz is a superhuman,"" insisted Djokovic.""His situation really gave me optimism that I can make it, too.""Three weeks is just making the cut, so to say. It's not ideal, maybe in the eyes of the doctors and specialists that would normally tell you it's normally between three and six weeks.""But it's also individual. It's very subjective.

After Roger came Rafa, Novak, Andy. I really feel it's different this year.""For over two decades, Wimbledon was ruled by a select group of tennis greats. Following Lleyton Hewitt's triumph in 2002, the prestigious tournament witnessed the rise of the 'Big Four'.Roger Federer amassed an impressive eight titles, while Novak Djokovic secured seven. Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray each claimed two victories during this era.However, the 2023 championship match marked a significant shift in the tournament's history. Carlos Alcaraz , a rising star, managed to overcome Djokovic in a thrilling encounter, effectively ending the 'Big Four' dominance that had persisted for so long.As the tournament approaches, both Djokovic and Murray, now 37 years old, find themselves recovering from recent surgeries.Djokovic underwent a procedure on his right knee, while Murray required an operation to remove a cyst from his back. Despite these challenges, they remain determined to compete at the highest level and add to their impressive legacies at Wimbledon.""It's the first time I really feel like I'm here to be a competitor, to maybe win the title,"" said Zverev.""I didn't feel like that in previous years when I came here. I didn't feel like I was capable. I didn't believe I was capable.""Zverev has experienced two devastating losses in Grand Slam finals, both of which left him feeling shattered.At the 2020 US Open, he surrendered a two sets lead against Dominic Thiem while at this year's French Open, he slipped to a five-set loss to Alcaraz from two sets to one up.His fourth round exits at Wimbledon in 2017 and 2023 were also grueling five-set battles, against Milos Raonic and Felix Auger-Aliassime respectively, adding to his disappointment at the prestigious grass-court tournament.""This is a tournament where maybe I need a bit more luck and maybe a few things to go my way, a few things to happen,"" he added.""More than maybe at other Grand Slams. If those things all come into place, if all those things maybe go my way for once, do I believe I can win? Then yes, I can.""After concluding his Wimbledon journey, Zverev will head back to the French capital to compete for his second consecutive Olympic gold medal at Roland Garros.""The Olympics is probably the most difficult trophy to win in tennis for us because we have that tournament once every four years,"" said Zverev.""If you're not performing during that week, you have to wait another four years.
