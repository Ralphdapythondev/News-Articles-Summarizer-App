Algerian boxer Imane Khelif advances to gold medal match amid gender row at Paris Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/algerian-boxer-imane-khelif-advances-to-gold-medal-match-amid-gender-row/articleshow/112331675.cms,"NEW DELHI: Imane Khelif , the Algerian boxer at the center of a significant gender controversy during the Paris Olympics , emerged victorious in her semi-final bout on Tuesday. Competing in the women's 66kg category, Khelif secured at least a silver medal after defeating Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng, the 2023 world silver medallist, by a unanimous points decision.The match took place in front of an enthusiastic crowd at Roland Garros, who passionately chanted Khelif's name throughout the contest.In a separate weight class, Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, another boxer involved in the eligibility controversy, is also assured of winning at least a bronze medal. Both Khelif, 25, and Lin participated in the Tokyo Olympics three years prior without any controversy and did not secure medals at that time.The two boxers faced disqualification from the world championships last year after failing to meet gender eligibility requirements. However, they were subsequently cleared to participate in the Paris Olympics.""I am focusing on the competition and other things are not important. The important thing is that I am in the final now,"" Khelif told BeIN Sports.""I am very proud of this new achievement. I gave everything I had. We worked as a team for years and the dream has become a reality. I hope to focus and be up to the responsibility in the dream final.""Khelif, the Algerian boxer, received a thunderous ovation as she stepped into the arena at Roland Garros, which is typically known for hosting Grand Slam tennis tournaments.The venue was packed with a considerable number of Algerian fans waving flags and chanting ""Imane, Imane"" throughout the bout.Khelif's opponent, the Thai boxer Janjaem, who was visibly shorter, took a standing count in the third round after feeling the full force of the Algerian's superior skills.Despite the intense atmosphere, the two fighters showed great sportsmanship at the end of the fight, warmly greeting each other and shaking hands.Khelif celebrated her victory with a dance in the center of the ring, eliciting even more cheers from the crowd.She will face Yang Liu for the gold medal, after the Chinese boxer defeated Taiwan's Chen Nien-chin on points in the other semi-final.The gender controversy surrounding Khelif and another boxer, Lin, began when Khelif defeated Angela Carini in just 46 seconds during her opening bout. Carini, who suffered a severe nose injury, was reduced to tears and forced to abandon the fight. The 2023 world championships, from which both Khelif and Lin were expelled, were organized by the International Boxing Association (IBA). However, due to concerns over the IBA's financial, governance, and ethical practices, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has taken charge of the sport at the Olympic Games.IBA president Umar Kremlev, who has ties to the Kremlin, made a controversial claim during a chaotic press conference, stating that both fighters had undergone ""genetic testing that shows that these are men.""The IOC has strongly defended Khelif and Lin, with president Thomas Bach emphasizing that they were born and raised as women and hold passports reflecting their gender.",Imane Khelif beats Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng in women's 66kg semi-final. The 25-year-old will now face China's Yang Liu for the gold medal. The match took place in front of an enthusiastic crowd at Roland Garros.

She made quick work of Livach, employing her technical acumen to secure a decisive win just when it was needed most.Facing Cuban opponent Lopez in the semi-final, Phogat exhibited strategic brilliance. She waited for the right moment to exploit her opponent's mistake, using a single-leg hold to gain the upper hand. The semi-final was a testament to her tactical prowess and her ability to stay calm under pressure, earning a crucial win to advance to the finals.It was more than just the matches that made this journey remarkable. Off the mat, Phogat had been fighting a far tougher battle. Her credibility was constantly questioned, and she underwent knee surgery less than a year before the Olympics , causing many to doubt her chances of success.But for 18 minutes on Tuesday, Vinesh didn't have the option of failing. After all, she came here as a representative of all those women who have been severely wronged by the wrestling establishment.When Phogat overcame Susaki, she let out a cry of relief and lay flat on her back, a moment of release after immense pressure. In contrast, her coach, Woller Akos, stood teary-eyed on the sidelines. Akos has been by Phogat's side through thick and thin, offering support and serving as a confidant throughout her battle for justice.The past year and a half of Phogat's life have been tumultuous. She became a prominent figure in the protest against former Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has faced allegations of sexual harassment.The semi-final bout saw Vinesh maintaining her balance, not allowing the Cuban to get her leg. Her feet were positioned perfectly to avert any crisis.Phogat earned a point for passivity in the first round of her semi-final, which proved beneficial. However, she also received a warning in the second round for not being aggressive enough. True to her nature, Phogat fought back fiercely, targeting Lopez's right leg to gain two points and finishing the match with a leg hold.Vinesh's final is scheduled for tomorrow.",Vinesh Phogat becomes the first Indian woman wrestler to reach the final of the Olympic Games.

She was pitted against Japanese grappler Yui Susaki in the Round of 16 who never tasted a defeat at the international level.Vinesh, however, had a different plan as she caused the most stunning upset of the Olympic Games by bringing an end to the undefeated streak of Sasaki, the world's top-ranked wrestler and the defending Olympic gold medalist, which had spanned an impressive 82 matches.In the first six minutes, the wrestling community was left stunned by her performance.

It’s not like earlier times when our players lacked facilities and funds. So, it’s high time our players step up and win as expected,” Padukone told reporters, as quoted by IANS.“I am a little disappointed in our performance that we could not even get a single medal from Badminton. Like I have said before, we were contenders for three medals so at least one would have made me happy. But having said this, this time the Government, Sports Authority of India, and Sports Ministry everybody has done their best and I don't think anyone could have done anything more than what the Government has done so I think the players also need to take responsibility,"" added the veteran.Sen's journey, though historic, ended in a heartbreaking 13-21, 21-16, 11-21 defeat. Despite a strong start in the final match, Sen faltered in the latter stages, allowing Lee Zii Jia to seize control.Padukone attributed the loss partly to Sen's discomfort playing on the faster side of the court.“He played well but of course, I am a little disappointed, he could not finish it yesterday too, he was in a winning position in the first game, and could have probably made a difference yesterday itself. After winning the first game he was leading 8-3 today, he has always been a little uncomfortable playing on the faster side so he has to work on that,” explained Padukone.Other Indian shuttlers also faced early exits.

Neeraj Chopra: Paris Olympics: Defending champion Neeraj Chopra ready to begin his quest for another gold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/paris-olympics-defending-champion-neeraj-chopra-ready-to-begin-his-quest-for-another-gold/articleshow/112303973.cms,"PARIS: A phone call woke me up early in the morning. This was in July of 2016. ""You must meet this guy. He is tall, he is good looking, he is humble. Above all, he is your future athletics superstar. Javelin phekta hai. It will be a great photo-op too."" Neeraj Chopra ? Javelin? The name didn't ring a bell. Sounded like a PR pitch. We let that pass.A few days later, this Chopra boy won the World junior javelin gold in Poland with a huge throw of 86.48m.It was a junior world record to boot. Any elite thrower would be proud of that in a Diamond League competition. He was just 18.He returned home a hero. The photo-ops and interviews did happen. Journalists scrambled to find where Khandra village was on Haryana's map; what he ate, when he slept.After the initial buzz, the excitement died down. The sponsors stayed away; the media was lukewarm. The army stepped up and offered him the job of a junior commissioned officer (JCO) as naib subedar. The boy from humble beginnings was relieved. The future had been secured. Neeraj could have lost his focus there, the hunger inside him could have been satiated by a government job, as has happened way too often with many talented athletes in the past. But he knew that it was just the beginning of his journey. The script was different. This man was different.That was then. Cut to the present, Neeraj Chopra is a superstar. Rockstar, if you like. Yes, he is tall, good looking and humble. He is also the best in his business, in the world.Neeraj's story of how he picked up sports as a young boy to fight obesity is well documented. It is well known that he loves choorma made by his mother. It is well known that he loves eating dal and can have bowls of it at a go. That's not important today.Neeraj has come here with an unprecedented load of expectations. He has won it all – from Asian Games gold to Commonwealth Games gold. He is the defending Olympic champion and a world champion too. He is just 26, at the peak of his prowess.The past eight years have not been easy for Neeraj, though. The journey of an elite athlete never is. After the Poland spark, Neeraj suffered a back injury. After recovering from that, he won the Asian athletics championship gold with an 85-plus throw. The world championship next was below expectations and then, injury struck again. A groin injury.He was also forced to part ways with his Australian coach Gary Calvert, the man who honed his skills and made him a world athlete. Calvert's contract was not renewed by the government. He left for China and later died there in 2021.Neeraj had to move on. Now, he was training with Werner Daniels in Germany. After a slight tweak in his technique, Neeraj was ready for bigger challenges. He won the Commonwealth Games gold medal first in May 2018 and followed it up with the Asian Games gold with a best effort of 88.04m. He had become a national star.The focus was now the Tokyo Olympic Games 2020. Neeraj was shaping up well and then suffered another injury. He had to undergo surgery to remove bone spurs in his right elbow in Mumbai in May 2019. There were doubts whether he would be the same on his return.After a six-month rehab and recovery programme, Neeraj joined hands with German biomechanics expert Klaus Bartonietz and went to South Africa to prepare for the Tokyo Games. He returned to competition in January 2020, won it and qualified for the Olympics Due to the pandemic, the Games were postponed. Neeraj returned home and trained at NIS, Patiala and in Bhubaneswar. He then went to Sweden for training and competition and then went to Japan. A throw of 87.58m was enough to get him the gold. He made it look so easy. He was now just the second Indian after Abhinav Bindra to win an individual Olympic gold.After Tokyo, Neeraj crossed the final frontier. He won the World athletics gold with a throw of 88.17m. The second Asian Games followed, and his personal best followed. 89.94m, at the Stockholm Diamond League in Sweden in June 2022.All this while the talk had centred around the 90m-mark. When will that come? It was the question he faced everywhere he went. He would take a deep breath and say, it is around the corner. Deep inside, he knew it was irrelevant. It is the medals that matter, not small, little numbers.This year has been a quiet one for Neeraj. He took part in only three competitions on the road to Paris. He finished second in the Doha Diamond League in May with 88.36m and was first in the Paavo Nurmi Games in June with 85.97m. In between, he returned home to take part in the Federation Cup in Bhubaneswar in May.Neeraj's preparations were hampered by an adductor muscle issue early this year. Is he fit enough to go for gold, or at least a medal? His coach had said a month ago that the adductor niggle was gone. ""It is fine, it is looking good. He is having full throwing sessions,"" Bartonietz had said.Neeraj is on track. He is ready. The nation will hold its breath and keep fingers crossed when he competes on Thursday here at the Olympic Stadium. Before that, there is this small routine of competing in the qualifications today.","Neeraj Chopra is the defending Olympic champion and a world champion too. He has won it all – from Asian Games gold to Commonwealth Games gold. He is just 26, at the peak of his prowess. Neeraj has come here with an unprecedented load of expectations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112304192,imgsize-46594,width-400,resizemode-4/112304192.jpg"
EXPLAINED: Why India will play Paris Olympics hockey semifinal against Germany with 15 players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/explained-why-india-will-play-paris-olympics-hockey-semifinal-against-germany-with-15-players/articleshow/112273951.cms,"WHY ROHIDAS GOT A RED CARD

ONE-MATCH SUSPENSION FOR ROHIDAS

HOW ROHIDAS'S ABSENCE AFFECTS INDIA

The Indian men's hockey team has received a jolt ahead of their Paris Olympics semifinal against Germany and are already at a disadvantage in their quest for a place in the final after 44 years.The Tokyo Olympics bronze medallists will have only 15 players available to play the last-four clash instead of a full squad of 16 after defender Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match following his red card in the quarterfinal against Great Britain.The 31-year-old Rohidas was spotted swinging his stick across the face of British forward Will Calnan in the second quarter of the match on Sunday. The on-field umpire did not rule the offence as serious to get a red card, but Rohidas was shown red and given the marching orders after a video referral.Subsequently, India played the British team with 10 players for more than 40 minutes. However, the Harmanpreet Singh-led side defended heroically, thanks largely to PR Sreejesh's presence in the goalpost, to hold onto the 1-1 scoreline and take the game to a shootout.Goalkeeper Sreejesh once again turned out to be the star, saving two attempts by the GB team in the one-on-one shootout to help India earn a dramatic 4-2 win and a second successive entry into the semis at the Olympics.After the match, India officially raised a concern ""about the quality of umpiring and decision-making"" and citied ""several inconsistencies in officiating"" that ""potentially influenced the game's outcome"".Among the issues raised by India were ""inconsistent video umpire reviews, particularly regarding the red-card decision"" and the fact that the British goalkeeper was being coached from behind the goalpost during the shootout.""Hockey India calls for a thorough review of these matters to uphold the integrity of the sport and ensure fair play in future matches,"" the complaint read.However, later in the evening, the tournament's organising committee handed Rohidas a one-match ban for breaching the FIH Code of Conduct, which means India will have one player less in their usual squad of 16 men for the semifinal against Germany.“Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match for a breach of the FIH Code of Conduct which occurred during the India vs Great Britain match on August 4,” read the official statement by the FIH.“The suspension affects match No. 35 (India’s semi-final match against Germany), where Amit Rohidas will not participate and India will play with a squad of 15 players only.”Rohidas's absence will seriously hamper the Indian defence, their options of drag-flickers on penalty corners and rolling substitutions. Most importantly, the team will miss the rushing skills of Rohidas.He is considered one of the best rushers in the world when it comes to penalty-corner defence, and his absence will force India's chief coach Craig Fulton to alter India's short-corner strategy against Germany.",Amit Rohidas has been suspended for one match by the FIH.

3rd ODI: Will India stave off Sri Lanka to keep a nearly three-decade long record intact?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/3rd-odi-will-india-stave-off-sri-lanka-to-keep-a-nearly-three-decade-long-record-intact/articleshow/112308862.cms,"The Indian batsmen will need to tactically navigate the spin challenge in the third and decisive ODI on Wednesday to prevent their first series loss to Sri Lanka in nearly three decades, 27 years to be precise. The path has been set by captain Rohit Sharma , and it is up to the rest of the batting lineup to follow the skipper.In his maiden ODI series as head coach, this is definitely not the start Gautam Gambhir would have envisioned, given his emphasis on winning.India were last defeated in a bilateral ODI series against the Lankans in 1997. India haven't lost for 11 series of 50-over internationals between the two teams since then.However, the visitors find themselves in an unfamiliar position, after a tie in the opening match and a 32-run defeat in the second. Winning the three-match series is now beyond India's grasp, and the team will be determined to avoid a defeat in the final match of the series at Colombo 's R Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday.This position of discomfort is brought upon the team largely by their batsmen, who seemed to have been plagued by indecisiveness on a pitch that offered plenty of turn to the spinners.Star batter Virat Kohli epitomized the team's fragility more than anyone else. Besides scoring only 38 runs in two matches, it's the nature of Kohli's dismissals that has raised concerns.Kohli has appeared subdued in the middle, after the explosive starts provided by Rohit in the two games. The master batter within Kohli remained dormant as he struggled against the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and Jeffrey Vandersay, who claimed six wickets, in the second, before eventually succumbing to them.Perhaps, Kohli should focus on the happier memories rather than allowing his mind to be shackled by the current challenges. India's success in the middle overs, whether chasing or setting a target, heavily relies on a free-flowing Kohli.Shivam Dube, India's designated spin-basher, failed to read a simple leg-break from Vandersay in the second one-dayer, resulting in an lbw dismissal. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, known for their prowess against spinners, have struggled to use their feet and wrists effectively against the Lankan slow bowlers.The solution possibly lies in observing Rohit's batting, not necessarily his approach, but the confidence and strategy behind his innings.Rohit's mastery over the Lankan bowlers, both pace and spin, has been remarkable. His 44-ball 64 was a display of well-calculated strokes that never seemed risky.The team management may reconsider Dube's position in the lineup when deciding the eleven for the match on Wednesday.Given the conditions in Colombo and the nature of the pitch, batting allrounder Riyan Parag's spin bowling can prove more useful than Dube's straightforward medium pace.On their end, the Indian bowlers need to step up their performance in the crucial stages of the game as the previous matches highlight their failure to bowl the hosts out for a low score despite reducing them to 142 for 6 and 136 for 6.","India were last defeated in a bilateral ODI series against the Lankans in 1997.

The skeleton bone test or the age-detection test will all be done under the guidelines of AIFF.""The skeleton bone test, commonly known as a bone age assessment, estimates a person's age, especially in children and adolescents, by analyzing their bones.This process typically involves taking an X-ray of the left hand and wrist, as this area contains bones that undergo predictable developmental changes with age. The X-ray is then compared to standard reference images, such as those in the Greulich-Pyle Atlas, to determine the bone's developmental stage, including the appearance of growth plates and the fusion of epiphyses.It is understood that 22 teams in the under-14 category were disqualified and did not participate in the Subroto Cup after failing the age-determination test last time. According to AIFF guidelines, if four or more players from a team are found to be over-aged, that team will be immediately disqualified and barred from the tournament.""Apart from that, all the players who have already registered through AIFF and CRS (central registration system), have their age verified. The people who are coming are less in numbers. So, in times to come, age fraud, which is prevalent in football, is likely to reduce,"" he ended on a positive note, sounding hopeful, as we all are, of a better future.","The Subroto Cup is an annual school football tournament held in India. The tournament, established in 1960, will enter its 63rd edition on August 5. It will host a jaw-dropping 111 teams across three categories. The organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112229089,imgsize-108216,width-400,resizemode-4/112229089.jpg"
