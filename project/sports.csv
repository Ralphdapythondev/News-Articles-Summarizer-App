"Paris Olympics: Rafael Nadal loses to Novak Djokovic, but gives memories to cherish",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/paris-olympics-rafael-nadal-loses-to-novak-djokovic-but-gives-memories-to-cherish/articleshow/112123275.cms,"Nadal

shows flashes of his fighting spirit at 'home' court but it's not enough to stop Novak

PARIS: The long, winding queue outside Roland Garros added to the sense of growing anticipation. Some locals and a Polish bunch were there for the Iga Swiatek-Diane Parry match. But even for them that clash was a mere footnote to the main action coming up at Philippe Chartier court here on a sunny Monday afternoon.It was all about two ageing, great champions of the game - Rafael Nadal , 38 and Novak Djokovic , 37 - meeting probably for the last time on this hallowed patch of clay.The Parisians love Nadal as their own. The Spaniard is the King here. 14 titles, 112 wins, just 4 losses. Nadal was 8-2 against Djokovic here before the match; the Serb was ahead 30-29 in career head-to-head record.But Monday was not about numbers or records. His body ravaged by injuries over a two-decade career, Nadal willed himself to play here at the Olympics. He lost in the first round in the French Open three months back. Djokovic , also troubled by a knee injury, pulled out of the quarterfinals. But all that did not matter when the two greats met again, this time fighting for their respective countries.They walked onto the court to a loud roar from the 15,000-capacity crowd. The action started with Djokovic's serve. The Serb, knee strapped, raced to 40-0, then saw Nadal make it deuce. Djokovic somehow managed to hold on to his serve. Nadal started with 0-30, then drew level with a sublime inside-out forehand shot. However, he was broken when his return hit the net and went out.Djokovic won the next game at love, playing two superb drop shots in the process. 3-0. He looked to be in a hurry. Down 30-40 in the next game, Nadal pulled out a vintage drop volley that made it 40-40. He was fighting for every ball, the way he has all his life. But it was clear that he was not 100 % match fit.Djokovic, on the other hand, was playing with authority and ease, having sensed that his rival was not at his best. It was soon 4-0.Nadal made the final of the Bastad Open just last week. However, that outing was not enough to give him the momentum he needed against a player of Djokovic's calibre.Djokovic raced through the next game, holding his serve again at love. 5-0. It was looking desperate for the Spaniard, but he won the next one and pumped his fist. The crowd came alive. Djokovic lost the first point in the next game as Nadal passed him at the net. But after that it was again a cruise for him. Game done, set done. 6-1.Nadal started the second set with some promise but found himself at 40-40 once again on his serve. Two unforced errors made it 1-0 in the Serb's favour. Nadal seemed to be playing from memory. His mind was willing, his body was not.A magical backhand down the line by Djokovic was the talking point of the next game, which he sealed with an ace. 2-0.The crowd chanted 'Rafa, Rafa ', egging their favourite to fight back. He tried hard, catching up at 30-30 after losing two points. Then a double fault pushed him to the edge, but Nadal clawed back to make it 40-40. Djokovic refused to budge, breaking the Spaniard again. 3-0.There was no change in the script when Djokovic served. The Serb sealed it with a delicate volley. 4-0.Nadal then won his first game of the set and pushed hard for a service break in the next game. Nadal went up 40-30 on Djokovic's serve for the first time in the match. An uncharacteristic double fault by Djokovic gave Nadal the much-needed break, the first of the match for him. 4-2. Game on?The break did change Nadal's game. He suddenly looked pumped up. He won the next game without much fuss. The crowd roared its approval. 4-3. Up 40-30 in the next game, Nadal broke Djokovic again with a scorching forehand crosscourt shot. 4-4. The crowd was on its feet, singing, dancing, chanting. Their Rafa was back. Match fitness or not, he was not going to simply fade away.Down 15-30 on his serve, he recovered to 40-40 but Djokovic broke him with a drop volley. It was 5-4 in the Serb's favour.Serving for the set and the match, Djokovic made an unforced error but recovered with an ace to go up 30-15. Then came another unforced error: 30-30. Then Rafa made an unforced error. Djokovic needed no more prompting. He finished it with an ace. Game, set, match Djokovic.Nadal packed his bag quickly and walked away to loud applause.For those who care, it is now Rafa 8-3 vs Djokovic at Roland Garros and Djokovic 31-29 in career head-to-head. But that's just for the record, it's all about the memories.","Rafael Nadal beats Novak Djokovic 6-1, 6-2 in the quarterfinals of the men's singles at Roland Garros.

Paris Olympics: Sreejesh's 'bluff' was the moment India needed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/paris-olympics-sreejeshs-bluff-was-the-moment-india-needed/articleshow/112123607.cms,"PARIS: ""It's a bluff thing! Penalties are always a bluff."" Indian hockey 's resident philosopher was breaking down the art of facing penalties - the psychology , the deception and the trauma. PR Sreejesh , son-of-the-soil hero, effortless celebrity - you should see the Beatlemania kind of love and adulation the expats at the hockey venue here have for him - had just walked off the blindingly blue turf at the historic Stade Yves-du-Manoir.There was an added strut in his already heavy, padded walk - a kind of large land-sea mammal resplendent in yellow - and the jibes reserved for the hankering media in the mixed zone: ""Ah, I was talking, and you left me when the coach came. I saw that, I saw that. Not saying anything now, you guys always do this!""A little cajoling was what Sreejesh needed. Down one goal despite heavier share of the ball, India held their breath as Maico Casella stepped up to the penalty spot in a crucial phase in the game. ""We were a goal down. I knew if it went in, they would get a high, a two-zero lead would put them in a comfort zone, and more difficult for us in the coming games. It was just thinking of how to put pressure on the player,"" he said when asked what was going through his mind seconds before as Casella shaped up to shoot. Shoot, scoop, whatever, it actually didn't matter to Sreejesh.A loud slap of the gloves, resounding over the Indian-made din in the stands, the hockey stick resembling a chopstick, useless without the other one, probably made the statement that would deafen the Argentine inner silence and bend his will. It was all his for the taking, he fluffed his lines.""We prepare for such times,"" Sreejesh would explain his thinking. ""Most of the times they have their own specific area where they always try to push. That's why I gave him a dodge, just to try to give him some sort of doubt in his plan.""It worked. Sreejesh made Casella think he was going one side, but he was dragged away even further because he had already decided to hit to his right. He hit the ball wide, outside.Had not Sreejesh used his street smarts, it would have been a whole different conversation.Ask Sreejesh about how lonely a goalkeeper 's job is, even in the constant helter-skelter of current day hockey, and his observation perhaps offers an added insight into his coach's comments. ""It's not lonely, brother. We are there for them (outfield players) and they are there for us,"" he laughs.""But the only time it changes is when you concede a goal. Immediately afterwards, you are alone. You get enough time to think positive or negative. That's the only time when you feel like you're lonely.""","India goalkeeper PR Sreejesh breaks down the art of facing penalties.

Russian President Vladimir Putin 's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 triggered a swarm of political and economic fallouts. One of them was Russia getting banned from the Paris Olympics . However, the International Olympic Committee invited 36 Russian sportspersons to participate in the 2024 global games .Among them, 15 accepted the proposal. These athletes are now being described as AINs (Athlete Individuel Neutre, in French), which means Individual Neutral Athlete. In functional terms, they will be competing in the Olympics but will not display their national flag. Also, the national anthem won't be played if they win gold.But apart from this bunch of 15 select invitees, there is another category of Russian sportspersons taking part in the Paris Games that officially began on Friday. These Russian athletes have decided to represent another country even at the cost of being castigated by many at home, especially those in power.""Russia's sports ministry said last August that 67 athletes have changed nationality since the start of 2022. But some independent observers suggest that it is an understatement, putting the real number as high as 200, including some in non-Olympic sports like chess,"" Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported. Some of them, described by WSJ as ""the secret Russians"" will be in the race for a medal in Paris.Here are brief profiles of four such Russian athletes who are competing under another national flag:The 36-year-old was born in Yakutz, a frosty but rapidly expanding city in eastern Russia. She won the Moscow Marathon in 2017 and in 2018. Trofimova became a citizen of Kyrgyzstan in 2023 and won an Asian Games bronze the same year. ""Thank you, Kyrgyzstan, for the second life of my sports career,"" she posted on social media. As part of her Olympic preparation, Trofimova trained in Bosteri, a panoramic village in north-east Kyrgyzstan.The 28-year-old freestyle wrestler competes in the 65kg class. ""There is nothing in my mind except an Olympic medal,"" he told Australian news agency, AAP. Okorokov comes from the region of Yakutia in icy eastern Russia. As a youngster, he would travel far from his village to show up at his wrestling club. His early successes came as a Russian wrestler. But in 2017, he moved to Australia, where his potential was identified and he was made a part of the high-performance squad whilst assisting in upskilling local Australian wrestling talent. Competing for Australia from 2022, he is currently ranked 27th in the world.The 28-year-old Russian has been competing for Uzbekistan with success. ""I miss my homeland, but I subordinate it to my sporting goal,"" he once said in an interview.The triple European champion will be representing France. She has been living there for five years and trains in Martigues, a commune northwest of Marseille. Now 24, Kirpichnikova had earlier also participated in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games representing Russia sans flag. She finished seventh in the 1,500m final and eighth in the 800m final. She holds the Russian records in the 800m and 1,500m freestyle.","15 Russian sportspersons are taking part in the 2024 global games in Paris.

In the clip, he extends an invitation to the Indian team to come to Pakistan, reassuring them of their safety.""Sher hai hum log sher hai, hum log sher hai. Hum log tere mulk me aa ke khel ke gaye hai. Aake dikha....Hum toh kah rahe hai aake khelo. Security denge, sab kuch denge tum logon ko. Aao toh sahi ek dafaa [We are lions, we are lions. We came and played cricket in your country. Come here and show... We are inviting you to come and play. We will provide security, we will give you everything. Just come once],"" said Tanvir Ahmed.""Yeh sirf Pakistan ke playeron ka kaam hai, bhai. Sirf Pakistan ke player aate hai aur khelke chale jaate hai. Chahe jeete, chahe haare, jis tarah ki cricket khele. Woh India jaake khelke wapas aaye the. Isko kahte hai ek daler team aur daler players [It's only the Pakistan players who do this. Only Pakistani players come and play and go back, regardless of winning or losing, and no matter how they play. They went to India and returned after playing there. This is what you call a brave team and brave players],"" he added.Pakistan has assured that all matches involving the Indian team in the tournament will be held in Lahore, and the Indian team will stay at the same hotel throughout their visit. The idea behind this arrangement is to implement more effective and secure measures.Last year, the Indian cricket team refused to travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup , leading to India matches being staged in Sri Lanka instead. Since 2012, the two nations have not played any bilateral series, with the Indian government limiting cricket encounters between Pakistan and India to ICC or ACC events.","India has not played cricket in Pakistan for over a decade, and it is uncertain if this will change soon.

Paris Olympics 2024: India’s Olympics uniforms create a buzz for the wrong reasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/paris-olympics-2024-indias-olympics-uniforms-create-a-buzz-for-the-wrong-reasons/articleshow/112073510.cms,"Bigger isn’t always better— the cliché was proved right during the Olympics opening ceremony. In Paris, the world’s fashion capital, it was Team Mongolia’s Seine-sensational gold-embroidered ensemble that scored big.Haiti (super arty), Czechia (splattered trench coats) and Sri Lanka (white silk) wowed too even though the US (Ralph Lauren) and Italy (Emporio Armani) pulled out the big guns.As for India, let’s say if there was a medal for the best ceremonial uniform, we wouldn’t even be close. Though India’s ikat-inspired kurta-bundi and sarees were designed by no less than Tarun Tahiliani, many thought it was a missed opportunity to celebrate Indian craftsmanship. While it’s rare to see a polarized social media agree on something, this time the criticism was almost unanimous.“Today, the Indian fashion industry is talked about for its traditional yet modern clothing. This was an opportunity to make something unique and creative.,” says Delhi-based fashion designer Shilpi Gupta.This was also the first time a designer had been roped in to design the official ceremonial attire for Team India.Fashion commentator Shefalee Vasudev says the debate shouldn’t be about print vs handwoven as Tasva, a collaboration between Tahiliani and Aditya Birla Group, was contracted to design the contingent uniforms. “Tasva is into quality mill-made fabric. It’s not a handloom brand. If someone had wanted a hand -loom imprint, the contract would have been given to those known for their handloom signature,” says Vasudev. But she adds that even within the mandate, the aesthetics did not come together.Responding to the comments, Ashish Mukul, brand head of Tasva, told TOI that the ceremonial attire for Team India was crafted with a sense of national pride and an aim to balance tradition with modernity. “Our intention is to create an attire that represents India’s rich heritage and ensure our athletes feel comfortable and confident,” Mukul said, adding that the fabrics, including cotton and viscose crepe, were selected for their practical and aesthetic qualities.Nutritionist Nandita Iyer, who does not consider herself a fashion expert, says she was left dissatisfied as a connoisseur of Indian textiles, crafts and handlooms. “Any such global event is a stage for us to proudly show -case our heritage and history and doing it with viscose fabric and Ikat print tackily stitched as a border seems like hasty work,” says Iyer.However, others pointed out the challenges of creating uniforms that balance aesthetics, functionality, and cultural representation. In a post on Instagram, Susan Thomas, ex-director of NIFT Bengaluru, pointed out that viscose is used for uniforms as “ Olympics is a performance-driven event that hinges on fitness.”Designer Rina Dhaka pointed out that there are budgets and briefs to fill. “When we do productions on this scale, digital is used over weaves to give consistency and quality,” says Dhaka. For her, badminton player PV Sindhu’s beautiful smile lifted the ensemble.",Team Mongolia's Seine-sensational gold-embroidered ensemble scored big.

Their next match, crucial for advancement, is against the Indonesian pair of Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto on Tuesday.The Indonesian pair, former world number ones and current world number seven, have won world championship bronze medals in 2019 and 2022 and were part of Indonesia’s 2020 Thomas Cup-winning team. The Indian and Indonesian pairs have faced each other five times, with the Indian duo holding a narrow lead with three wins.

"For Manu Bhaker's village, the Olympic bronze medal feels like gold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/for-manu-bhakers-village-the-olympic-bronze-medal-feels-like-gold/articleshow/112095722.cms,"GORIYA ( Jhajjar ): As Manu Bhaker aimed for bronze at the Paris Olympics on Sunday, sitting at 6500 kms away — her relatives saw to it that everything stayed quiet at home, avoiding any celebration till the medal was secured.Just before Manu’s fight for a medal began, her village home wore a deserted look, her parents being in Faridabad. But as the drama unfolded, people started streaming in.When TOI visited the shooter’s home, her grandmother Daya Kaur explained that the family follows a ritual of not watching her match as they believe it brings good luck for their girl.“We sat in a prayer with our eyes closed for about half an hour during the shooting event. But today since so many came home, we made an exception to switch on the TV,” said the octogenarian Daya. “Manu, my granddaughter, might have missed the gold medal today, but bronze is no less. I will make up for the missing gold by garlanding her with a golden chain when she returns,” she said with a smile.As hard as Daya tried to keep the excitement of the kids under control as Manu fought tooth and nail for a medal, she struggled.“Go for gold, go for gold, go for gold… Manu,” her young fans shouted. And when the medal happened, it was joy unbound. Laddoos were distributed and they broke into impromptu dance steps.“This is just a trailer. We will give her a grand welcome when she comes back to the village,” Manu’s uncle, Mahendra Singh said.While Manu was shooting her way to a historic medal, her parents Ramkishan and Sumedha cheered for their daughter. Ramkishan highlighted his daughter’s bend towards spirituality post the Tokyo Olympics, where her pistol malfunctioned and dented her medal chances.“She is spiritually inclined. She saw her mother recite shlokas from the Bhagavad Gita, and she also started reading the holy text. Doing that makes her mind calm and sharpens her focus. She knows exactly what to do to achieve her target. We, as parents, back her through all ups and downs,” her father said.“Her medal has also come as a major boost for the sport in the country after we couldn’t win any medal in shooting at the 2016 Rio Olympics and 2020 Tokyo Olympics.“I am confident our shooting contingent in Paris will take this medal as a shot in the arm and bag more medals in the ongoing Olympics. Manu has two more events left, and we expect her to do better,” he added.Manu’s mother Sumedha said she backs her daughter through thick and thin – whether she comes home from any championship with a medal or not.“I just want my daughter to be happy and feel good about herself. I also want to say that the media has always supported my daughter. Back in the days when my husband had to run from pillar to post to get pistol license for Manu, the media highlighted the issue and that helped our cause.”Uncle Mahender, who runs a private school in the village where Manu began her shooting career, said about 35 children practise shooting there, inspired by the numerous medals the young champion has won.“Manu is their role model, and whenever she has time, she visits the school to train them,” he said.Reflecting on Manu’s early shooting days, Mahender mentioned her unwavering focus. “We would make her work really hard, but she didn’t mind. That extra effort must have helped her,” he said.","Shooter Manu Bhaker won bronze at the Paris Olympics on Sunday. Her parents were in Faridabad, while her grandmother was in Jhajjar.

Brendon McCullum says England have 'harder feel' after West Indies clean sweep,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/brendon-mccullum-says-england-have-harder-feel-after-west-indies-clean-sweep/articleshow/112116998.cms,"NEW DELHI: England's head coach Brendon McCullum is of the opinion that the revamped Test team has developed a ""harder feel"" following their dominant 3-0 series victory against the West Indies, which marked the beginning of their home season.The 4-1 defeat in India prompted England to, in McCullum's words, ""refine"" their aggressive strategy and overhaul their red-ball team.This led to the international retirement of James Anderson , England's all-time leading wicket-taker, while experienced wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow , who has over 100 caps, and Ben Foakes were both surpassed by Test debutant Jamie Smith.During the West Indies series, England also handed debuts to fast bowler Gus Atkinson and spinner Shoaib Bashir , who replaced Jack Leach as the team's primary spin option.The young trio of Smith, Atkinson, and Bashir all made significant contributions as England secured an innings and 114-run victory at Lord's, followed by a 241-run win at Trent Bridge, and finally wrapped up the series with a 10-wicket triumph at Edgbaston on Sunday.""No changes are ever easy, are they?,"" said England red-ball boss McCullum, as quoted by AFP. ""But we knew we needed to make a couple of improvements as a side and we brought in some new faces.""The former New Zealand captain added: ""You don't ask for instant gratification when it comes to them but the way the series played out you'd say the guys have certainly shown they're good enough at this level.""What we've seen from Gus Atkinson, from Shoaib Bashir and Jamie Smith, is that international cricket is where they belong and they've performed accordingly.""Sometimes when you lose you have a period of reflection and what we've seen is a team which has bounced back with a bit of a harder feel to it. I think we're a stronger team now than we may have been in the past.""Anderson retired after the series opener at Lord's with 704 Test wickets, the highest tally by any fast bowler in the 147-year history of the format. Only spinners Shane Warne (708 wickets) and Muttiah Muralitharan (800 wickets) have more wickets in the all-time rankings.England, however, have retained Anderson's services as a fast-bowling mentor, with a grateful McCullum saying: ""What Jimmy's given in the past couple of matches is quite incredible. He's fitted seamlessly into our group of coaches.""It's never easy but he seems really content right now, it's great to have him and I feel very lucky that he's part of our group.""England would be eager to bring a group of authentic fast bowlers with them to Australia as they aim to reclaim the Ashes in the 2025/26 series.""With the bowlers now we've got some pretty good ammo (ammunition) that we are going to need on flat wickets when times arise,"" said McCullum.""Gus has touched 90mph (145kmh), been able to jag the ball off a good length and also been able to operate a bumper plan for a period of time.""The way Chris Woakes bowled was outstanding. Then you add the speed of Mark Wood, which is quite frightening really.""Shoaib Bashir and Stokesy (England captain Ben Stokes ) are in there too... We're not the finished article but this series is a step forward.""Meanwhile, speculation continues to surround the future of England white-ball coach Matthew Mott, with the Australian's position under threat as director of cricket Rob Key conducts a review following the limited-overs team's lacklustre defence of both their 50-over and T20 World Cup titles.""I don't know how it's going to work out to be honest, I haven't really followed it because you're worried about doing your own job,"" said McCullum.""Motty is a good bloke and a very good coach. Whatever happens he'll be fine.""","England coach Brendon McCullum says red-ball team has developed a ""harder feel"" England defeated the West Indies 3-0 in a series which marked the beginning of their home season.

In between Hardik's heroics, 'Player of the Tournament' Jasprit Bumrah (2 for 18) and left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh (2 fo 20) kept the pressure on the South Africans in the dying stages of the run-chase.Soon after India's win, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli announced retirement from T20 internationals. Upon arrival home, the team received a memorable welcome in Mumbai where people came out on the streets in lakhs during the champions' victory parade aboard an open-top bus, which concluded with a felicitation ceremony at the Wankhede Stadium.One month since that day, the joy for the Indian fans is far from settled as some of the posts on X (formerly Twitter) suggest. Take a look.The win ended India's 11-year wait for another International Cricket Council (ICC) title, since winning the Champions Trophy in 2013.Also, it took India 17 years to win another T20 World Cup, after MS Dhoni's team did it first in the tournament's inaugural edition in 2007.The historic win also marked the end of Rahul Dravid's tenure as India's head coach, with his former teammate Gautam Gambhir named as replacement a few days later.","India's T20 World Cup win in Barbados on June 29, 2024, completed one month today.

'He should not need any motivation...': Ravi Shastri's advice to Hardik Pandya on captaincy snub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/he-should-not-need-any-motivation-ravi-shastris-advice-to-hardik-pandya-on-captaincy-snub/articleshow/112100836.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Indian head coach Ravi Shastri set the future course for star all-arounder Hardik Pandya after he was passed over for the T20I captaincy . He advised him to play as much as possible and draw motivation from his team's recent heroics at the ICC T20 World Cup , which ended the Men in Blue's 11-year ICC trophy drought.As Rohit Sharma 's deputy during India's victorious ICC Men's T20 World Cup campaign, Pandya was among the favorites to inherit the role after Rohit departed from the competition.But when the team for the current tour of Sri Lanka was revealed, Hardik was just mentioned as a player. Shubman Gill was chosen vice-captain and Suryakumar Yadav as India's T20I skipper.In the end, Hardik's continued fitness problems were the main reason he lost the captaincy. Ajit Agarkar , the chief selector, tipped the scales against Hardik by stating at the pre-tour press conference that they favored a player whose availability was consistently dependable.In the latest edition of The ICC Review, Shastri offered valuable advice to Hardik on how he can return to his peak performance.""I think (it is) very important that he continues to play,"" Shastri said while speaking to host Sanjana Ganesan, as quoted by the ICC, as per ANI.""I believe match fitness is very important. So whatever T20I cricket there is, he should play as much as he can. And if he feels strong and fit, then obviously he comes into the side for the one-day game as well.""""But then again, the bowling becomes important. If you have someone coming and bowling just three overs in where you have to bowl 10 in a one-day game, then the balance of the side takes a hit.""""If you can bowl consistently eight to 10 overs every game and then bat the way he does, I think he'll play in one-day cricket as well,"" he concluded his point.From 2018, Hardik has struggled with serious injuries for an extended period of time.That year, in India's intense Asia Cup match against Pakistan in Dubai, Pandya was stretchered off the field after collapsing from a bowling strike, gripping his back in pain. After a stress fracture was identified, surgery and prolonged rehabilitation were required.Pandya made the decision to heal naturally, and he was able to recuperate in time for the 2019 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup. Later on in the year, though, his back problems returned, necessitating surgery.In a recent match between India and Bangladesh for the Cricket World Cup 2023, Hardik hurt his ankle trying to field the ball on follow-through.He was out of the game for a long time due to this injury, and he didn't play for his country again until the T20 World Cup.After coming back, Hardik showed everyone just how good of an all-round player he is, taking significant wickets and making big runs throughout the competition.India's 11-year trophy drought came to an end in the final thanks to Hardik's performance under duress, which included the important wickets of David Miller in the final over and the dangerous Heinrich Klaasen .In order to further highlight his abilities, the 30-year-old took two wickets and hit a crucial 22* during India's series-clinching victory over Sri Lanka on Sunday in Pallekele.According to Shastri, Hardik would have enough desire to return to full fitness based on his recent performances.""So I think it is up to him really, more than anything else,"" Shastri added.""He understands his body better than anyone. And I am sure, this will inspire him, especially with the way he did in the World Cup, the way he performed at the right times for India and the World Cup, so that should really get him going. He should not need any motivation to get his fitness right at the top,"" he concluded.",Ravi Shastri advises Hardik Pandya to play as much T20I cricket as possible. Pandya was passed over for the captaincy after Rohit Sharma's departure.

This decision was met with some controversy, since it was perceived that local Americans were being overlooked.""I don't think starting at 10:30am was a problem for me, honestly. We are in the entertainment business, which caters to people who want to watch the sport. I had absolutely no problem with it,"" Dravid said.According to the former Indian captain, the early start really made sure that the game was ""even-steven"" for both teams.""As a coach, the conditions were quite even because dew becomes a factor in a lot of day-night games. The toss can become a big factor, as we saw in Australia. But for 10:30, it was not a problem; it was even-steven for both teams.""From a coaching perspective, I didn't mind the 10:30 game,"" he said.Dravid praised the government for its bold decision to bring the World Cup to the United States while speaking with ICC CEO Geoff Allardice.""It was a great effort by the ICC to take the game to the USA and expose that audience to the game.

With the series already secured following dominant victories in the first two games, India remain determined not to ease up.In the second T20I, India achieved a confident seven-wicket victory in a rain-shortened match, thwarting Sri Lanka's attempts to recover.Throughout the series, Sri Lanka's struggles have been evident, particularly with their batting collapses in the middle overs. Despite promising starts, the hosts faltered under pressure and failed to maintain momentum against India's formidable side.On the same day, the Sri Lankan women's team celebrated their maiden Women's T20 Asia Cup title with a victory over India in Dambulla. However, this success had little impact on the men’s side, continuing to face persistent issues.Team India has displayed their superiority, with Suryakumar Yadav leading effectively both in strategy and performance. He has made impactful bowling changes and contributed significantly with the bat, scoring 58 and 26 in the previous matches. India's aggressive approach from the start has been fruitful, including a formidable 200-plus score in the opener and a slight tweak in the batting order in the second game, leading to a seven-wicket win and sealing the series.Vice-captain and opener Shubman Gill, who missed the second game due to a stiff neck, remains a key player to watch. Sanju Samson, his replacement, had an unfortunate outing with a golden duck, but India will be seeking improved performances from the experienced batter.Yashasvi Jaiswal has been a standout performer, scoring 70 runs in two matches and posing a significant threat to Sri Lankan bowlers. For Sri Lanka, Pathum Nissanka , with 111 runs, and Kusal Perera, with 73, have shown promise at the top, but the middle order’s recurrent failures remain a concern.Indian spinner Ravi Bishnoi had a crucial impact in the second game with figures of 3/26, highlighting Sri Lanka’s difficulties against spin.""They play spin really well but I do not know what has happened, they are collapsing in the middle overs,"" Bishnoi remarked, suggesting a potential lack of skills and aptitude among Sri Lankan players across formats.Sri Lanka's bowlers, particularly Matheesha Pathirana, who had an expensive return of 4/40 in the first game, need significant improvement to salvage pride in the final match.As India aim for a whitewash, their aggressive gameplay and strategic execution will be closely watched, while Sri Lanka seek to avoid a clean sweep and conclude the series on a positive note.","India set to pursue a series whitewash against Sri Lanka in the third and final T20I on Tuesday.

When Miller attempted a powerful shot, the ball reached Suryakumar close to the boundary. To make the catch lawfully, he first moved outside the boundary and then inside it.Commentator Ian Smith praised the player for his incredible athleticism on the catch, which shifted the balance of power to India, who won the match by seven runs. India last won an ICC trophy in 2013, the ICC Champions Trophy, hence this victory put an end to their 11-year trophy drought.In a video posted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on X, Suryakumar said, ""This will stay with me forever because I have done those things in my practice sessions a lot. But I did not think that it would come at that moment, World Cup Final and that situation. I am very grateful for that, to be doing something special on a special occasion. But yeah, as you said, that will remain with me forever.

'We have taken steps to fix that': USA Cricket chairman Venu Pisike on ICC notice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/usa-cricket-addresses-icc-notice-by-appointing-jonathan-atkeison-as-ceo/articleshow/112097674.cms,"Top Picks For You USA Cricket appoints Jonathan Atkeison as CEO to meet ICC requirements

NEW DELHI: USA Cricket has appointed Jonathan Atkeison as its Chief Executive Officer, effective August 1. This move aims to address mandatory requirements set by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to retain its status as an ICC Associate nation and potentially achieve National Governing Body (NGB) status for inclusion in the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games.The ICC previously issued a notice to USA Cricket for lacking a CEO and failing to comply with governance norms set by the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC).In an interview with Cricbuzz, USA Cricket chairman Venu Pisike discussed the ICC’s notice of suspension, the adoption of USOPC guidelines, internal board issues, and allegations of conflict of interest and corruption. He outlined several steps taken to address compliance issues, including timely submission of the 2023 audited financials and progress in hiring a CEO.""We are waiting for a written notice from the ICC CEO. However, we addressed several compliance issues and clarified inaccuracies before the AGM,"" Pisike said. The chairman emphasized that the timely submission of the 2023 audited financials was a critical step, noting it was the first time in five years this requirement was met. There has also been progress in hiring a CEO and improving USOPC status.The ICC's term ""fit for purpose"" primarily referred to having an operational structure, Pisike explained. ""We didn't have a CEO for the last few months, but we are very close to making an announcement. This will solve the operational structure, and the CEO will take over immediately,"" he added.Addressing governance and internal issues, Pisike noted that accusations made by some USAC directors contributed to the problem. These directors bypassed proper processes, creating an impression of non-compliance with governance standards. ""We have taken steps to fix that. The ICC has given us twelve months to demonstrate that we have an operational structure and proper governance,"" he stated.The chairman also highlighted some specific complaints from the ICC, pointing out minor and inaccurate issues. One such issue was the assumption that USAC did not have an accountant. ""We did have a part-time consultant in 2023, and we engaged them full-time this year. The ICC assumed otherwise,"" he clarified.Discussing the USOPC NGB application process, Pisike acknowledged its long and complex nature. ""There are several policies, including athlete safety, governance, and financial policies, that we need to adapt. We have already amended our constitution to incorporate athlete representation as required by the USOPC,"" he said.USA Cricket plans to increase board composition to include four player directors, ensuring 33% athlete representation. This change, along with the establishment of an Athlete Advisory Council, aims to align USAC with USOPC guidelines. Pisike noted that while these changes will take time, USA Cricket is committed to implementing them.USA Cricket is taking significant steps to address ICC requirements and secure its future in international cricket and the Olympic Games.

We can’t afford to underestimate them — it’s time to put in the work and make our home advantage count.”The team has been putting in the hours and began their preparation midway into July.

It helped us develop overall. The coach gave us a lot of confidence and hence I am thankful to the team who supported me and delivered good individual performances,"" Arjun added.However, the absence of key players may pose problems for Muthoot FA.

So even if some players leave the group, we still have two or three players ready to fill that gap,"" said Anazil.During the farewell function, the new jersey of Muthoot FA was released by actor Fahadh Faasil, and directors of Muthoot Pappachan group Thomas Muthoot and Hannah Muthoot.","Muthoot FA will only be the second team from Kerala to participate in the Next Generation Cup after Kerala Blasters Academy.

Will support national team by developing players at Inter Kashi: Habas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-support-national-team-by-developing-players-at-inter-kashi-habas/articleshow/112029904.cms,"Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.

However, Anees noted that the transfer window has seen seven of their players move to ISL clubs, presenting both a setback and an opportunity for other players to step up and fill the void.""Since the transfer window began, seven of our players have moved into ISL clubs. So we had a lot of players getting transferred to other clubs. It's a setback for us and a bit difficult for us to have the same quality of players to compete at the higher levels.

"Opted to play Durand Cup with reserves, club wanted 6-week pre-season for first team: Chennaiyin assistant coach Noel Wilson",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/opted-to-play-durand-cup-with-reserves-club-wanted-6-week-pre-season-for-first-team-chennaiyin-assistant-coach-noel-wilson/articleshow/112019717.cms,"What was the reason behind fielding the reserve team for the Durand Cup?

Five first-team players – Samik Mitra, Bikash Yumnam, Vincy Barretto, Alexander Romario and Irfan Yadwad – have been included in the camp. What is the plan for them?

What do you make of the youngsters in the squad?

How has the preparation been so far?

Coyle is well known for his positive brand of football. Will the reserve team have a similar style of play going forward?

You have reunited with Coyle, after having worked at Jamshedpur FC. How does it feel?

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC ’s newly appointed assistant coach Noel Wilson said the club opted to play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure that the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL). In an interaction with TOI at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium – Chennaiyin’s current training base – Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team, Durand Cup preparation and more.Excerpts:You (first team) need to have a six-week pre-season (ahead of the ISL), which is about one-and-a-half months. I think, after the Durand Cup, there is going to be a gap of two months. You cannot be stagnant in that period. Coyle will have better ideas. He does not want the main team to play in the Durand Cup as there are chances of players getting injured. Maybe he does not want to take risk with the main-team players. He knows what is right.The players who have come here did not get much game time last season. When you play competitive matches, your confidence level will increase. After playing here, they will perform better once they return to the main team.There are some young players who have good quality. They need the experience and exposure of playing with the bigger guys (seniors). The difference between playing in a reserve team and a senior team is huge. But I can see that there is potential.Besides players from the main and reserve teams, we have shortlisted a few players from the trials. The team is good; the young boys are working hard. No matter what the team is (opponent), you will win if you play well. That is what I believe in. I have asked the boys not to worry about the opponents, whether they are from the ISL or I-League.It is difficult to implement a style of play when you have only a month to prepare. We began training at the start of the month and our first match is on July 31. But in general, I like it when the boys keep the ball in the front (attacking areas). I do not want the boys to keep the ball at the back for a long time. I do not want them to do that because it might create problems; errors at the back could lead to goals. I would rather expect the players to take the ball forward and play in the opponent’s half. That will be safer for us.Coyle is a wonderful coach; we can see it in his personality and coaching. Last season, he got Chennaiyin to the playoffs. It is always good to work with good coaches. As an Indian coach, we always try to learn something which will help us in the future.",Chennaiyin FC will play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL) Assistant coach Noel Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112019695,imgsize-827309,width-400,resizemode-4/112019695.jpg"

Following these events, Bev Priestman , the head coach of the Canadian team, announced her decision to abstain from participating in the team's opening match of their Olympics gold medal defence against New Zealand.This series of events unfolded after French authorities detained a staff member for piloting the drone over New Zealand's training, an act aimed at gathering intelligence on their tactical preparations.The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) has been informed of a second similar incident involving New Zealand, prompting an official complaint from the latter to the IOC integrity unit, seeking clarification and action from Canada.In response, the COC has engaged with both the IOC and FIFA.

But the rival goalkeeper failed to judge the ball's trajectory as it sailed over him and nestled into the far corner of the net.Having broken the deadlock, East Bengal looked in control of the proceedings with more focus and hunger in the second half. Second-half substitute Ajad Saheem saw his shot blocked by the goalkeeper soon after his arrival. He came calling again, on the back of a sweeping move down the right before laying it off for Tanmay Das, who was denied by the goalkeeper again.
