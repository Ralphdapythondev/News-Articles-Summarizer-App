NEW DELHI: On Sunday afternoon, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are gearing up to clash with the struggling Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) in their fourth home game of the season. As the teams prepare to face off, the stakes are high.KKR currently sits comfortably in the third position on the IPL 2024 points table , boasting four wins in six games. In contrast, RCB finds itself languishing at the bottom as their IPL match result is not impressive with just one win in seven outings, desperately seeking a turnaround in fortunes.Also see: IPL live score When it comes to head-to-head encounters, KKR holds a notable advantage over RCB. Having crossed paths 34 times in the tournament thus far, KKR has emerged victorious on 20 occasions, while RCB has managed 14 wins.In their most recent encounter earlier this season in March, KKR demonstrated their dominance by clinching a convincing victory, defeating RCB by 7 wickets with a substantial 19 balls to spare. This history may give KKR an added boost of confidence as they enter this crucial match, while RCB will be looking to defy the odds and stage a comeback.Eden Gardens, renowned for its lively atmosphere, has indeed been a haven for batters in this IPL season. With four out of six innings witnessing 200-plus totals, it's evident that the pitch has been a paradise for run-scoring.However, recent history suggests a potential twist in the tale. During RCB's previous visit to Eden Gardens, their batters struggled notably against spinners on the same surface. This memory might influence the Kolkata Knight Riders' decision to tailor the pitch to suit their spinners' strengths, potentially adding a new dimension to the game.As the teams strategize, the pitch conditions could play a pivotal role, offering an intriguing battle between bat and ball, and setting the stage for an enthralling contest between KKR and RCB.In the three matches played at the venue so far, the teams batting first have won one match, while the teams chasing have emerged victorious in the other two.The average first innings total at the ground has been 197, mirroring the average second innings total, highlighting the ground's reputation as a high-scoring venue.The highest total recorded at the venue stands at 224/8, achieved by the Rajasthan Royals against the Kolkata Knight Riders. Conversely, the lowest total recorded is 161/7, registered by the Lucknow Super Giants against the Kolkata Knight Riders.1. Recent matches at the venue have seen high-scoring affairs, with 447 runs scored in 40 overs in the last game, indicating a favourable pitch for batters. As a result, impactful batters from both teams should be prioritised in your fantasy XI.2. Despite the batting-friendly conditions, spinners are expected to play a significant role, potentially exceeding expectations. Including a couple of spinners in your fantasy XI could prove beneficial.Virat Kohli's stellar performance stands out as the shining beacon for RCB. The Indian maestro has been in sublime form, consistently racking up runs with finesse. With an impressive tally of 361 runs in just 7 innings, Kohli currently reigns supreme as the holder of the coveted orange cap Sunil Narine emerges as the standout performer for KKR this season, showcasing his prowess as a dynamic West Indian all-rounder. His ability to accumulate points consistently in both batting and bowling makes him an indispensable asset in fantasy contests. With a century already under his belt, Narine exudes confidence, further solidifying his status as a must-have player in fantasy lineups.Phil Salt's season has been a mix of ups and downs, but his performances at Eden Gardens have been a bright spot. Showing adaptability to the pitch, he has looked promising whenever he's batted here.

Former India pacer Varun Aaron emphasized the pressing need for Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's ( RCB ) domestic players to lift their performance this IPL season, lessening the team's reliance on Virat Kohli .Kohli has undeniably been the driving force for RCB, leading the batting charts with 361 runs in 7 innings and donning the Orange Cap. His exceptional strike rate of 147.34, coupled with a top score of 113 not out, highlights his immense contribution to the team.""It's just that RCB are not finding the rhythm, the domestic players are just not stepping up,"" reckoned Aaron whiel speaking on Star Sports.Aaron, who was acquired by RCB for Rs 2 crore in 2014, retired from first-class cricket earlier this year.""If you have to be anywhere at the top of the table or the middle of the table at this point, you have to have domestic players who are firing and you cannot always rely on Virat Kohli. The other guys have to step up and also all their money is sitting in the dug-out. You can't spend that much cash on players and not have them play,"" said Aaron.According to Australia's former limited-overs captain, Aaron Finch, RCB require a dynamic middle-order batsman to support Kohli effectively.""He's (Kohli) scored a lot of runs everywhere. He's a modern day great. And I think the fact that he's getting runs and RCB are still not making it is a positive sign in one degree. It's that when Virat is playing well, that genuinely carries the rest of the players with him.""They just need to find a partnership with him, they need to find an explosive middle order player who is in form, Lomror has been in and out, so it ( KKR vs RCB ) has got all the makings of an epic game,"" Finch said.RCB are scheduled to play KKR at the Eden Gardens on Sunday.Regarding Travis Head's explosive 89-run innings for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Delhi Capitals in Delhi on Saturday, Finch remarked that the left-handed opener has truly taken ""fear of failure out of his mind'.""It's always been in him, the ability to play like this. I guess the freedom to express himself and be able to deal with the ups and downs of playing such an aggressive and high-risk brand of cricket, I think has just released him to a new level.""And I think if you look back at the World Cup final, he kept playing his shots even when there was wickets falling around him, the ball was moving. Because he's taken the fear of failure out of his mind.""If he misses out five or six times in a row, it doesn't bother him because he knows he's one shot away. He's the type of player that needs one ball in the middle. And that's all it will take for him to get going again,"" Finch said.In a high-scoring match where over 460 runs were scored, seamer T Natrajan concluded with remarkable figures of 4/19. Finch suggested that despite Natrajan's outstanding performance, his wickets coming in the late stages of the game, when the result was already evident, likely hindered his chances of receiving the Man-of-the-Match award.""When 460 runs are scored in a game and a guy gets 4 for 19, that's a special performance. I think the thing that didn't give him the 'Man of the Match' is that the four wickets were right at the death when the game was done and dusted.""Set an imposing target of 267, DC were stopped at 199.""I think the ability of Delhi to get that run rate under 12 an over was extraordinary and at that stage of the innings, they were in the box seat to win it.""The wicket slowed up a bit just like Pat Cummins talked about and the ball got a little softer and made it easier for the slower bowlers to grip. It was just one of those things where they couldn't sustain it,"" Finch said.(With PTI inputs)","Royal Challengers Bengaluru need domestic players to step up, says Varun Aaron.

He suggested, ""I wouldn't suggest any changes to a cricket bat because they are all within regulations, but I have been saying this for a long time, increase the size of the boundary at every ground.""

Gavaskar emphasized the importance of extending the boundary ropes, especially at smaller venues, to provide bowlers with a fair chance against power-hitting batters.

Gavaskar further illustrated his point by highlighting the space between the advertisement boards and the fence where the stands begin, stating, ""Look at this ground today, there is enough space to take it back a little more by a couple of metres. It can often prove to be the difference between a catch and a sixer.""

He emphasized that pushing the boundary back by a few meters could significantly impact the outcome of matches and provide bowlers with a much-needed respite.

Expressing his frustration with the current state of affairs in T20 cricket, Gavaskar criticized the prevalent trend of power-hitting, likening it to a final net session.

""What we have been seeing in T20 cricket over the last few days is that this is batting like the coach tells in the nets, 'This is the last round,' and everybody starts swinging their bat around bang, bang whether they get out or not.""

He underscored the diminishing excitement beyond a certain point, stressing the need for a more balanced contest between bat and ball.","Legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has voiced concerns over the plight of bowlers in the ongoing Indian Premier League 2024.

In the first 7 games, MI only have three wins under new skipper Hardik.And former T20 World Cup winner and opener Robin Uthappa recently made a big statement on Hardik, saying that the booing has resulted in 'mental health issues' for the all-rounder.Taking Hardik's side and backing his decision to return to MI, Uthappa said that the treatment he has been receiving from fans has been unfair.""He is a guy who has got the calibre and potential to be an all-time great for the Indian team. He was let go by the team which discovered him, he went to another franchise. After winning 3-4 titles with them, he left. He must have felt a little bad; that will be there. He went to GT, won a title and finished runners-up in another. Then the conversation began,"" Uthappa said on The Ranveer Show on YouTube.""The mocking, trolling, the memes about his fitness. You don't think it hurts him? It hurts him. It hurts any human being. How many people actually know the reality of it? Hardik is dealing with mental health issues, for sure. We, as people, I understand, as Indians, we are emotional. But it is not right to impose this kind of treatment on any human being. It is unbecoming as a society for us to do that to someone and be okay with it. We should not be laughing along with it. We should not be forwarding these memes.""It's our job, yes it's passion too, but it's what puts the food on the table for me. My job is on display for you to criticise. A corporate person's job is not on television to criticise, or have an opinion about either. When that is the case, you have to exercise a certain amount of empathy and dignity to the other person to allow them to fail. One of the most beautiful things we did as a country is our expression of love, and our reaction to our Indian team after we lost the World Cup. That's how we should be as a society, and as Indians,"" said Uthappa.In the first 7 matches this season, Hardik has 141 runs to his name at an average of 23.50 with no half-centuries.On the bowling front, Hardik has bagged a mere 4 wickets and has leaked runs at an economy rate of 11 RPO.","Hardik Pandya has been subjected to constant on-field booing by the spectators.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi showcased his brilliance by scoring twice and setting up another goal for Sergio Busquets , leading Inter Miami to a 3-1 victory over Nashville on Saturday in a captivating Major League Soccer encounter and maintaining their top spot in the Eastern Conference .Miami faced an early setback when defender Franco Negri inadvertently deflected a corner into his own net in the second minute, giving Nashville an early lead.However, Messi quickly turned the tide in Miami's favor, equalizing in the 11th minute after Luis Suarez directed a loose ball back to him following a parried shot.Despite hitting the post shortly afterward, Messi continued to orchestrate Miami's attacks, providing opportunities for his teammates and creating chances with his exceptional playmaking skills. In the 39th minute, his former Barcelona teammate Busquets nodded in a fine glancing header from Messi's corner to put Miami ahead just before halftime.The home side suffered a setback as Paraguay international Diego Gomez was stretchered off with an ankle injury just before the break, adding to Miami's injury woes.Nashville pushed for an equalizer in the second half but failed to capitalize on their dominance in possession.

But the defenders, on both sides, looked to have brought a little more of it on the pitch as they denied attacks to be reflected on the scoreline.While Odisha ended up with better possession in the first half, the only shot on goal came from Blasters’ Hormipam Ruivah in the 22nd minute when he headed a superb cross from Freddy Lallawmawma straight into the hands of Amrinder Singh in Odisha goal.Odisha once again relied on their talisman Ahmed Jahouh to keep creating moves from deep but all those attacks were foiled by the Marko Leskovic and Milos Drincic-led Kerala defence inside the D. The story was being played in the same vein at the other end too, with both teams missing that final touch or shot in the final third in search of a breakthrough.The highlight of the opening 45 minutes was the drama that followed Mourtada Fall sending in the ball with a casual back heel on connecting with a Jahouh cross from the left of the box. While it was first given a goal by the referee, after consultation with the linesman and vehement protests from Blasters, the decision was overturned with Jahouh and Fall both found to be offside.Despite some desperate attempts from both teams to change the scoreline, they left the field for the break with the first knockout of the playoff stage goalless.Jahouh kept sending in measured crosses into the centre and the flank after the change of ends as Amey Ranawade and Jerry Mawihmingthanga kept attempting to make a goal out of them. But Blasters soon took charge of the game with a barrage of attacks near the Odisha goal.Mohammed Aimen and Saurav Mandal displayed the youthful vigour that Ivan Vukomanovic’s team rode this season but it was Fedor Cernych who broke the deadlock in the 67th minute. Aimen sent a pass to the Lithuanian after a delicate first touch as Cernych made no mistake in finding the corner of the net to the right of Amrinder.It was a well-deserved goal for the visitors but they could only maintain the lead for 20 minutes.With Blasters’ injured custodian Lara Sharma taken off field in a stretcher and replaced by Karanjit Sharma, Odisha took advantage of the lapse in focus of the opposition defence as Diego Mauricio scored his 11th goal of the season. He turned in a delectable cross from the right from current top scorer Roy Krishna and brought the home team back in the game and took it into extra time.And it was a replay of the equaliser in the seventh minute of extra time with Jahouh, once again, the conductor of the move.

NEW DELHI: Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez emerged as the hero, guiding his team to the semi-finals through a dramatic penalty shootout victory over French club Lille in a thrilling Europa Conference League quarter-final second-leg encounter.The match itself was a rollercoaster ride, ending 3-3 on aggregate after Lille's 2-1 win on the night.However, the real drama unfolded during the penalty shootout, where Martinez found himself at the center of attention.Martinez, known for his antics and mind games, saved two crucial penalties, showcasing his exceptional goalkeeping skills. However, his persistent reactions towards the French fans led to a bizarre incident where he was initially shown a second yellow card, seemingly resulting in a red card and subsequent dismissal.Remarkably, Martinez was reprieved due to a rule that states yellow cards awarded during regular time are not carried forward to penalty shootouts. This allowed him to continue his heroics, ultimately proving instrumental in Villa's 4-3 shootout triumph.Aston Villa manager Unai Emery praised Martinez's mentality and leadership, acknowledging his importance to the team both on and off the pitch.

The girls have had the opportunity to get a lot of points, and we had organised a camp in China.""And they were all playing well. Ankita had just won a tournament (in doubles) in Japan just the week before.""Dhupar, however, brushed aside the questionable team combinations fielded by the captain and the coach.After entering Sahaja Yamalapalli in singles and pairing Rutuja Bhosale with Prarthana Thombare against the strong Chinese team, the team's think-tank opted to put Rutuja in singles and hand Ankita the additional duty of doubles for the remaining three ties.It proved to be disastrous as it left Ankita with little time to recover with only a 30-minute gap between second singles and the decisive doubles matches. Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective. ""If I were the coach or the captain, and if I find my No. 1 player not performing, I would put my No. 3 or any other player in,"" Bal, a former Davis Cup player, said.""Try something different, think out of the box. It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players.

We could have qualified for Billie Jean King Cup playoffs: Rutuja Bhosale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/we-could-have-qualified-for-billie-jean-king-cup-playoffs-rutuja-bhosale/articleshow/109380108.cms,"PUNE: It was personally a successful week for Rutuja Bhosale but the 28-year-old felt the Indian team ""could have qualified"" for the Playoffs of the Billie Jean King Cup women's team tennis competition.The Indian team suffered an agonising 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round of the Asia-Oceania Group 1 matches in Changsha, China, last Saturday to finish third in the six-team duel.The top two teams -- hosts China and South Korea -- advanced to the Playoffs in November while India and New Zealand stayed in Group 1. Chinese Taipei and Pacific Oceania were relegated to Group 2.Rutuja won all her four matches in singles and her only loss of the week came in the one doubles match she was paired with Prarthana Thombare against the all-conquering Chinese.""For me, it was a very positive week, especially after the ankle injury I had in Mumbai (during the WTA 125K Series event),"" Rutuja said from Shenzhen, where she continued her exploits to win her first-round match in the $40K ITF event.""I didn't think I would be playing singles, but Sahaja had blisters and the captain ( Shalini Thakur ) and the coach (Radhika Tulpule Kanitkar) thought I had the experience, they trusted me.""In contrast to Rutuja's 100 percent record in the week, India No. 1 Ankita Raina had a below-par outing by her standards, winning just one of her five singles matches, although the World No. 255 had to double up for doubles duty as well.Two of Ankita's singles losses came against players whom Rutuja had beaten -- South Korea's Sujeong Jang (World No. 267) and New Zealand's Lulu Sun (167).""We could have qualified. The last day was very stressful. Ankita was a little bit tired, and it rained, so matches were moved indoors,"" Rutuja said.""It was clay but not the best like the one we played outdoors. The clay was coming off and you could see the (hard) surface beneath. We had to stay focussed.""And New Zealand (doubles team of World No. 5 and US Open winner Erin Routliffe and Paige Hourigan) played their best match of the week.""We had seen them play in the previous matches, and we were wondering if they were really World No. 5.""But against Ankita and Prarthana, they took the first set 6-1 in no time and went up 5-1 in the second. We made it 5-5 but they didn't really allow us to get back into the game.""It was a tough week but everyone gave their best.""Rutuja praised Ankita for showing courage to play back to back matches each day, but felt resting her a day could have helped the player's as well as the team's fortunes.""It was stressful for her. But credit to her, she stepped up to play both singles and doubles. Against Chinese Taipei, she had a long singles match (nearly two and a half hours) and then played doubles (after a 30-minute gap),"" Rutuja said.""Shalini ma'am and Radhika ma'am asked her if she could play, and she said she was ready.""She could have been rested one day, maybe against Korea (the day after playing Chinese Taipei). There were a lot of options.""","Rutuja Bhosale says Indian team ""could have qualified"" for the Playoffs of the Billie Jean King Cup.

Despite the hiatus, he showcased glimpses of his customary brilliance, delivering a solid performance that hinted at his enduring prowess on the court.""It was a good start -- when you return you can't get rid of the doubts in one day, above all, on a physical level,"" Nadal told TVE.""Within what it could be, it was a good first round.

Though Cobolli managed to break back in the third game, Nadal quickly regained the advantage with another break for a 3-1 lead, aided by Cobolli's third double fault. Nadal efficiently served out the set to secure the triumph.Despite his victory, Nadal's performance on serve was solid yet subdued, lacking in aces and explosive power, yet effective enough to outmaneuver his opponent and claim the win.""I've gone months without being able to serve, (and) although I've got a lot of excitement to play here and do the best I can, I'm not going to go crazy with the serve,"" added Nadal.""I have to serve with caution that the moment I'm in dictates... there are moments in which I feel more liberated and others in which I'm more careful.""","Rafael Nadal beats Flavio Cobolli 6-2, 6-3 in first round of Barcelona Open.
