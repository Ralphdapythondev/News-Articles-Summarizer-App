India vs Zimbabwe: Abhishek Sharma's secret? A borrowed bat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/india-vs-zimbabwe-abhishek-sharmas-secret-a-borrowed-bat/articleshow/111563982.cms,"Abhishek Sharma announced his arrival on the international stage with a sizzling century in the second T20I of his career against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club on Sunday, and he did it with a borrowed bat.After scoring 100 off 47 balls, which powered India to a mammoth 234 for 2 and eventually helped the visitors win by 100 runs to level the five-match series at 1-1, the 23-year-old Abhishek revealed that he did with skipper Shubman Gill 's bat.""Today I played with Shubman Gill's bat...whenever I think there is a pressure game or this is a match where I should perform, I usually take his bat,"" said the batting sensation, who, like Gill, hails from Punjab and is also mentored by India great Yuvraj Singh.Coming out to open, Abhishek smashed 8 sixes and 7 fours in his innings that came at a strike rate of 212.77, before being dismissed by left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza.Ruturaj Gaikwad contributed an equally blistering 77 not out off 47 balls, followed by Rinku Singh who smashed an unbeaten 48 off 22 balls.Pacers Avesh Khan and Mukesh Kumar then took three wickets each to complete India's big win.Abhishek and Gill have been playing together since their under-12 days.“It has been quite beautiful, starting as kids of 11-12 years...When I was selected for the country, the first call I received was from Shubman,” said Abhishek in the post-match press conference.Abhishek said it's not the first time he borrowed Gill's bat.“It happened from the under-12 days, as whenever I play a pressure game I ask him for a bat. It had happened in the IPL as well. Today was no exception as it went well as it usually happens,” said Abhishek, who played IPL 2024 for Sunrisers Hyderabad and knocked on BCCI selectors' doors with his big-hitting prowess.The left-handed opener credited his father and Yuvraj for his success and ability to play fearlessly.“Yuvi paaji has made a big contribution. I don't consider myself as sixer-king or something like that. Special thanks to my dad for allowing me to play lofted shots. Generally, coaches don't allow a young batter to hit lofted shots. But my dad always said if you wanted to play a lofted shot, then it should go out of the ground. So I wanted to follow that,” he added.India lost the first match of the series, where Abhishek made his debut and got out for a duck. However, he said he didn't feel any pressure.“I think the IPL plays a big role in this (handling pressure). We did not feel much pressure when we came here to represent the country as debutants. Unfortunately, we didn't start well in the first match. But my mindset and approach were pretty much similar – to show the right intent,” he explained.“Of course, my execution was better today (in the 2nd T20I ) than yesterday. I was just calculating the risk that I should take in the first over, or whether to play according to the merit of the ball. Whenever I get boundaries or sixes in the first few balls, then I believe that it's my day,” he concluded.",India beat Zimbabwe by 100 runs in second T20I at Harare Sports Club. Abhishek Sharma scored 100 off 47 balls and hit 8 sixes and 7 fours. India captain Shubman Gill's bat was used in the innings.

His innings included eight sixes and seven fours, making Ruturaj Gaikwad ’s supportive but impressive 77 not out off 47 balls seem subdued in comparison.Their 137-run partnership for the second wicket was key as India amassed a gigantic total.Gaikwad, during the mid-innings break, admitted having difficulty feeling set on the pitch, contrasting sharply with Abhishek, who appeared unfazed despite his debut disappointment of a duck. Abhishek never looked under pressure on the track which his senior partner and current CSK skipper Gaikwad found it a bit 'difficult'.Abhishek also had a lucky escape when Wellington Masakadza dropped him at 27 off a ball from Luke Jongwe. He capitalized on this reprieve, pulling a six off Brian Bennett to start his scoring spree. His fifty came with another pulled six off Dion Myers, who conceded 28 runs in a single over, opening the floodgates for the Indian innings.Among Abhishek's numerous impressive shots, one inside-out six off rival skipper Sikandar Raza particularly stood out. He lofted Raza's off-break over the extra cover boundary with finesse.Abhishek’s inning was a combination of elegance and brute power. He got to his milestone hundred with three back-to-back sixes against Masakadza. Upon returning to the dugout after his dismissal on the next ball post his century, Abhishek was congratulated by skipper Shubman Gill, who had another underwhelming performance.Meanwhile, Gaikwad continued where Abhishek left off, forming an 87-run partnership off 36 balls with Rinku Singh , who impressed with 48 not out off 22 balls, including five sixes.The total of 234 for two is India's highest against Zimbabwe in T20 Internationals, surpassing their previous best of 186. This score was a significant comeback following an unexpected batting collapse in the first game.Zimbabwe tried to fight back, but Indian pacers Mukesh Kumar and Avesh Khan delivered decisive blows. Mukesh took out two batsmen with back-of-the-length off-cutters, while Avesh stunned opposition skipper Sikandar Raza with a bouncer. Ravi Bishnoi and Washington Sundar then sealed Zimbabwe’s fate with regular wickets in middle over.With the series now tied at 1-1, speculations arise about possible team changes for the upcoming match on July 10. Sanju Samson is expected to replace Dhruv Jurel behind the stumps, Shivam Dube may take over from Sai Sudharsan, and Riyan Parag might be replaced by Yashasvi Jaiswal.Abhishek’s performance positions him firmly in the playing XI, raising selection dilemmas for skipper Gill and stand-in coach VVS Laxman.",India beat Zimbabwe by 100 runs in the second T20I in Harare on Sunday.

captain talks to TOI on why India will move on quickly from the retirements of Kohli, Rohit and Jadeja in the shortest format...

Excerpts from an exclusive chat...

How do you see the next generation taking Indian cricket forward?

Who are the players from the India squad that you'll keep an eye on in Zimbabwe?

What are your expectations from Zimbabwe?

As the head coach of RCB, you've seen Virat Kohli from close quarters. Did you have an inkling he was going to retire from T20Is?

According to a survey, the T20 World Cup is gaining in popularity, even among players, and is on course to becoming the most important ICC event...

We had an IPL where 250-plus scores were achieved with regularity, and then the T20 World Cup where bowlers held sway...

(Watch India tour of Zimbabwe (5-match T20I series, July 7 onwards 4 PM IST) live on Sony Sports Ten 5 channels)

NEW DELHI: After their T20 World Cup triumph, India are back in action with a T20I series against a feisty Zimbabwe side. Nearly all the main team players have been rested from the India squad for this trip, while three heavyweights in Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja have retired from the format.Andy Flower , former Zimbabwe captain and current RCB head coach, spoke to TOI about what to expect from the five-game series.This India-Zimbabwe series is going to be really interesting. It's a very strong side the Indian selectors have put out. All these guys have not only shown a lot of talent in the IPL but also have the attitude required to play international cricket. There are readymade replacements for the guys who've retired, even though they are genuinely great cricketers. The strong domestic structure in India means there will always be readymade replacements. It's certainly nothing to be scared of. India will keep producing these greats. There is always someone ready to come in. Whenever some of the great cricketers have retired, you think they won't be and cannot be replaced. But people move on very quickly. All eyes adjust and focus on the next talent that comes along.If I put my IPL coaching hat on, then I'll have to keep a keen watch on the players. (Yashasvi) Jaiswal didn't play a single match in the T20 World Cup but he is an incredible option. Shubman Gill , by his standards, had a quiet IPL but he looks a very intelligent player. He plays in a similar way to Virat Kohli. I'm looking forward to Abhishek Sharma performing. I really like the look of Dhruv Jurel. Watching him in the Test series against England, he did brilliantly. Riyan Parag has the swagger that you need in international cricket.Their biggest player is Sikandar Raza even though he is 38 years old. He has been quite a late bloomer. I want to see how Blessing Muzarabani, a very tall, right-arm fast medium bowler, performs. Muzarabani with his bounce can trouble the Indian batters.I hadn't thought about it (Kohli's retirement). I was a little surprised. I really enjoyed working with Virat in the IPL last season. I have utmost respect for him, obviously as a player but also the way he supported Faf du Plessis and myself and Mo Bopat, the director of cricket. He is a brilliant role model. He is an outstanding professional sportsperson. He looks after himself really well. He is disciplined without being robotic. He laughs and has fun, has a cheeky sense of humour and takes the mickey out of people. He always mixes in with team gatherings and he is very approachable. He has a very good cricket brain and can think out of the box too.I'm surprised. I think the 50-over World Cup, because it's played every four years, holds more importance. I think there's a danger in playing a T20 World Cup every two years... it becomes commonplace. I wouldn't like anything called the 'World Cup' to be a commonplace. I like the rarity of a World Cup. But I also do feel that T20 World Cups help in growing the game globally. Two of the best stories to come out of the recent World Cup would be Afghanistan and the USA.The next IPL may see big scores again. I'm not sure what'll be done about the 'Impact Player' rule. It wasn't a favourite in the dressing room. The tempo and the power game is going to continue in the IPL. In the World Cup, some of the small scores were mainly due to the pitches on offer. The ICC will need to be careful about the surfaces that are being provided for marquee tournaments like the World Cup. In cricket, there should always be a healthy balance between the bat and ball.","Andy Flower, former Zimbabwe captain and current RCB head coach, spoke to TOI about what to expect from the five-game series.

JAIPUR: A day after Rohit Sharma , Suryakumar Yadav , Shivam Dube and Yashasvi Jaiswal were felicitated by Maharashtra government for winning the T20 World Cup , Chirag Shetty lashed out at the authorities for giving badminton step-motherly treatment.One of the chief architects of India's historic Thomas Cup triumph in 2022, Chirag came down heavily on the state govt for ignoring his achievement after the Indian badminton squad won the prestigious team championships stunning Indonesia 3-0 in Bangkok.""Thomas Cup is equivalent to winning the World Cup. I was part of the Indian badminton team which won its maiden title, shocking champions Indonesia in the final. I was the only Maharashtra player in the Indian team. When the govt can honour World Cup-winning cricket stars, they should have also recognised my efforts. Government should treat any other sport equally,"" Chirag told TOI on Saturday.Mumbai's Chirag, who is preparing for the Paris Olympics with his doubles partner Satwiksairaj Rankireddy at the national camp in Hyderabad under experienced coach Mathias Boe of Denmark, made it clear that he has nothing against cricket or cricketers.""I have nothing against cricket. In fact, we all badminton players watched the T20 World Cup final live on TV and celebrated enthusiastically. We are happy and proud about their sensational win against South Africa in the final. Similarly, we had also achieved something remarkable a couple of years ago, but the state government did not even felicitate me, leave apart giving any cash rewards. Before 2022, the Indian badminton team had never even reached the semifinals but we created history by winning the title,"" said the 27-year-old, a recipient of Khel Ratna Award.The Maharashtra government announced a cash prize of Rs 11 crore for the T20 World Cup-winning Indian team on Friday.Chirag and Satwik were the first Indian men's doubles pair to reach world No. 1 ranking a few months ago.

1st T20I: Bowlers shine as unfancied Zimbabwe stun India by 13 runs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-zimbabwe/1st-t20i-bowlers-shine-as-unfancied-zimbabwe-stun-india-by-13-runs/articleshow/111541579.cms,"NEW DELHI: A spirited Zimbabwe stunned a youthful India by 13 runs in the series opener in Harare on Saturday, registering their first win against cricketing powerhouse in eight years.Pulling of an upset of gigantic proportions, minnows Zimbabwe, who had failed to qualify for the recently concluded T20 World Cup, handed India them first T20I defeat of the year.Despite restricting Zimbabwe to just 115 for nine, India was bowled out for 102 in 19.5 overs, thanks to a determined effort by the Zimbabwean bowlers, led by Tendai Chatara (3/16) and skipper Sikandar Raza (3/25).India, having recently won the T20 World Cup with a different squad, were expected to easily handle the Zimbabwean but failed to do so, folding for their fifth joint-lowest T20I total.India's bowlers, led by leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (4/13), performed commendably on a pitch with some extra bounce and carry. Off-spinner Washington Sundar (2/11) also played a pivotal role as Zimbabwe struggled to build meaningful partnerships.Zimbabwe began their innings briskly, reaching 40 for two in the Powerplay. However, soon after that their batting frailties soon emerged.Following Kaia’s early dismissal, Wessly Madhevere (21 off 22 balls) and Brian Benett (22 off 15 balls) added 34 runs quickly before Benett was outfoxed by Bishnoi's googly. Bishnoi repeating the trick later claimed the wickets of Madhevere, Blessing Muzarabani, and Luke Jongwe, reducing Zimbabwe to 74 for three.Zimbabwe's middle and lower-order batters seemed to lose their way with their innings punctuated by runouts and soft dismissals. One such moment saw Jonathan Campbell, son of former Zimbabwe captain Alastair Campbell, involved in a mix-up that led to his dismissal. Campbell pushed an Avesh Khan delivery to the covers and set off for a single but changed his mind as his partner Dion Myers crossed the crease, eventually forcing Campbell to walk back.Despite the setbacks, Zimbabwe’s innings was buoyed by Clive Madande’s 29 not out off 25 balls, pushing their total past the 100-run mark. This resilient effort proved critical, as those extra runs became decisive.India's chase started poorly, faltering in the Powerplay itself. Abhishek Sharma , one of the three debutants alongside Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel , fell without scoring in the very first over. Sharma's cross-batted attempt off Brian Benett was caught in the outfield by Wellington Masakadza.Ruturaj Gaikwad (7) was next, succumbing to a slightly bouncier delivery from Blessing Muzarabani, which was edged to Innocent Kaia at first slip.Tendai Chatara then delivered a double blow, removing Parag (2) and Rinku Singh (0) within three balls in the fifth over. Parag’s attempt to loft over mid-off went to substitute Brandon Mavuta while Rinku Singh fell to a short-pitched delivery.Skipper Shubman Gill briefly steadied India with a sensible knock of 31 off 23 balls, including five boundaries.However, Raza soon disrupted his composure, bowling him out with a skidding delivery that breached Gill’s defense. With India at 84 for eight and soon 86 for nine, the chase seemed all but over.Avesh Khan (16 off 12) and Washington Sundar (27 off 34) added 23 runs for the eighth wicket, offering some hope, but Avesh's dismissal—caught by Raza at long-off off Wellington Masakadza’s full-toss—ended any prospects of recovery. India needed 16 runs in the final over, but could muster only two, as Zimbabwe celebrated a famous victory.Bishnoi’s career-best performance of 4/13 was a highlight for India’s bowling attack, which had otherwise managed to keep Zimbabwe largely under control.Bishnoi received significant support from Washington Sundar’s two wickets. Zimbabwe’s dissolution from a somewhat promising position of 74 for three to 115 for nine was primarily due to these two spinners, alongside the pace attack's contributions.The Indian team will need to regroup quickly with the second match of the series set for Sunday.The defeat calls for introspection, primarily concerning their batting approach under pressure. Despite the disappointment, the Indian bowlers showed promise and effectiveness, an area they would be keen to capitalize on in the upcoming clashes.","Zimbabwe stun India by 13 runs in T20 series opener in Harare.

After a defeat in the first T20I, India made four changes to their XI.Their fielders were swift in slippery conditions, and the bowlers were accurate in their line and length despite struggling to grip the ball. The SA women got off to a brisk start but the hosts put the brakes on with timely strikes.During Powerplay, the visitors were completely dominant; in a span of 10 deliveries, they hit six boundaries – skipper Laura Wolvaardt struck a hattrick of fours.In the absence of Renuka Singh, Pooja Vastrakar (2-37) was the new-ball operator and the change paid dividends as she sent Wolvaardt packing.Spinner Deepti Sharma (2-20) removed Tazmin Brits and Marizanne Kapp . When the runs stopped flowing after the Powerplay, Kapp, who was deadly while going straight down the ground, decided to take the aerial route again. But this time she mistimed it as the ball flew off the toe end of her bat and went straight into the hands of Sajana at mid-off. The in-form batter Brits (52), who notched up her second successive half-century, used her wrists well and came up with some glorious drives and cuts.She was given a reprieve on 5 by debutant wicketkeeper Uma Chetry, but when the latter found another opportunity, she made no mistake.

Eventually, the umpires decided to abandon the match.Tazmin Brits scored a measured fifty to help South Africa reach a challenging total after India chose to bowl first.

The retired England fast bowler described Anderson as an ""addict of the art of bowling "" in recognition of his exceptional skills and dedication to the craft.Throughout their careers, Anderson and Broad established themselves as a formidable bowling partnership, playing a crucial role in England's success, particularly in home conditions. The duo's ability to consistently perform at the highest level for over a decade has been a testament to their talent and work ethic.With an impressive tally of 700 wickets from 187 Tests, Anderson's contributions to English cricket have been immense. His retirement marks the end of an era, leaving behind a legacy that will inspire future generations of fast bowlers.""He loves the rhythm of running into bowl, the control of the technique of his action, the tactical side of whether he's bowling away swing, inswing, wobble seam,"" Broad wrote in his column for The Times.""When you talk about professionals who have had longevity, you often talk about their dedication to training, their discipline in the gym and their diet.""And of course, you don't play to 42 unless you have that, but the thing that makes him different is his genuine love of the art of what he does. Addict is generally used as a negative word, but I'd say he is an addict of the art of bowling,"" Broad wrote.Stuart Broad has praised James Anderson's exceptional skill in seaming the ball, particularly in challenging sub-continental conditions. He believes that Anderson's prowess in this area has not received the recognition it deserves.Anderson, at the age of 41, has achieved a remarkable feat by claiming 92 Test wickets in Asia, surpassing all other English bowlers in the format's history.""He doesn't get enough credit for his reverse swing, which has been crucial to his great record in the subcontinent. His line and length are so immaculate and that makes him lethal,"" Broad added."" Dale Steyn was phenomenal and quicker than Jimmy, but Jimmy is certainly the best reverse-swing bowler I've played with and probably the best I've witnessed in the flesh outside of Steyn.""Broad, who has grabbed 604 wickets from 167 Tests, also lauded Anderson's ability to adapt.""(His) ability to adapt and learn is why he has been so successful for so long. In professional sports, you have to be continually improving because there is always a younger bowler trying to get your shirt.""It is that genuine love for the art of bowling that has made him want to improve and learn new deliveries. It's why he will go out at Lord's this week as England's greatest-ever bowler,"" concluded Broad.","James Anderson will retire from international cricket after the first Test against the West Indies at Lord's starting on July 10.

Uruguay now face Colombia in the semi-finals as they continue their pursuit of a record-extending 16th Copa America title.""It was a very tense match, against a very tough opponent, suffering in the last minutes a man down.

I will savour this a little even if we have another game coming up.""Mbappe struggled to find his rhythm throughout the match, as he continues to adapt to playing with a protective mask covering his recently fractured nose, an injury sustained during France's initial encounter against Austria.Despite the setback, the young forward will have another opportunity to showcase his talents in the upcoming semi-final. On the other hand, Ronaldo, at the age of 39, seems to have made his final appearance in the European Championship.This tournament marked Ronaldo's sixth European Championship, but he was unable to contribute to his record-breaking tally of 14 goals in the competition, having failed to find the back of the net in all five of Portugal's matches in Germany.Although Ronaldo successfully converted his penalty, which was Portugal's first, Roberto Martinez's squad has been eliminated after failing to score in over six hours of play. They advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating Slovenia on penalties following a goalless draw in the round of 16, but this time, they fell short in what turned out to be a lackluster match in Hamburg.""In the same way that it was maybe cruel for Slovenia in the last 16, today it was cruel for us. That's football ,"" Bernardo Silva told CNN.France and Portugal, both underperforming in the tournament, faced off in a match that lacked intensity but had moments of excitement in the second half.Portugal started to threaten with midfield runners getting into the box, as Bruno Fernandes and Vitinha tested Mike Maignan, who was determined to maintain his clean sheet in open play. Ronaldo nearly scored from close range, but Maignan reacted quickly to deny him.France countered with Kolo Muani and Kounde combining, but Ruben Dias made a crucial interception.Deschamps brought on Dembele, who immediately set up a golden opportunity for Camavinga, which the midfielder missed. The game drifted towards extra time, where Ronaldo missed a good chance from Francisco Conceicao's cutback.Mbappe, France's captain, watched the end of extra time from the bench as Maignan denied Nuno Mendes at the very end of 120 minutes, leading to a penalty shoot-out.The shoot-out took place at the Portugal end of the Volksparkstadion, with Maignan not making any saves but not needing to. Despite Diogo Costa's heroics in the previous round, saving three Slovenia penalties, he could not stop any this time.","France beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties in Euro 2024 quarter-final match. The game ended 0-0 after 120 minutes, with France prevailing in the shoot-out. France will now face Spain in the semi-finals. Cristiano Ronaldo made his final appearance in the tournament.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111526909,imgsize-104804,width-400,resizemode-4/111526909.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Portugal and France are set to clash in the European Championship quarterfinals on Friday, with the match featuring a showdown between soccer superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé . The victor will advance to the semi-finals, facing either Spain or tournament host Germany . The game is scheduled to kick off at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT) in Hamburg.Despite being pre-tournament favourites, both teams have struggled to impress. Portugal has failed to score in its last two matches, losing 2-0 to Georgia and drawing 0-0 with Slovenia before prevailing in a penalty shootout. Similarly, no French player has scored from open play at Euro 2024 , with their goals coming from two own-goals and a penalty by Mbappé.Ronaldo, appearing in his record sixth European Championship, broke down in tears after missing a penalty in extra time against Slovenia. At 39 years old, he has yet to score in the tournament, but if he does, he would become the oldest goal scorer in the competition's history. Meanwhile, Mbappé will continue to wear a protective mask due to a broken nose sustained in France's group opener against Austria. Coach Didier Deschamps suggested that Mbappé might need to wear the mask for months.The match holds historical significance, taking place exactly 18 years after the nations' meeting in the 2006 World Cup semifinals, where Zinedine Zidane scored the winning penalty. Ronaldo played the entire match, while the player of the match was Lilian Thuram, whose son, Marcus, is expected to feature for France in Hamburg.France will be without suspended midfielder Adrien Rabiot, likely prompting Antoine Griezmann to drop back into central midfield, with Ousmane Dembele potentially joining the forward line. Portugal coach Roberto Martinez has a full squad available, with no suspensions or injuries. Both Mbappé and Ronaldo, along with several of their teammates, risk missing the semifinals if they receive another booking.France has been defensively solid, conceding only one goal at Euro 2024 – a retaken penalty by Poland's Robert Lewandowski. Mbappé, at 25 years old, has scored 48 goals for France, while Ronaldo holds the men's record with 130 international goals.This marks the teams' third consecutive meeting at a European Championship, with a 2-2 draw in the group stage in 2021 (Ronaldo scored two penalties) and Portugal's 1-0 victory in the 2016 final.Ronaldo, set to make a record 212th appearance for Portugal, has taken 20 shots without scoring at Euro 2024.The UEFA European Championship 2024 quaterfinals between Portugal and France is set for July 5, Friday.The UEFA Euro 2024 fixture will be held at Stuttgart Arena in Stuttgart, Germany. The match is scheduled to start at 12:30 AM (Saturday) Indian Standard Time.

I was kind of surprised,” the 23-year-old Pole said after her 21-match win streak was snapped.Putintseva, who hadn’t even won a set in their previous four meetings, was riding on the confidence gained from her success in Birmingham, used the court strategically, drawing the top-seed out of her comfort zone at the baseline.The 29-year-old Kazakh kept her opponent on her toes.“I know what I did wrong, after Roland Garros I didn’t really rest properly.

I didn’t really do that well. I need to recover better after the clay court season, physically and mentally.” Swiatek, whose best results at Wimbledon came in 2021(fourth-round) and 2023 (quarters), plans to take a vacation and ‘literally do nothing’ next year at the end of the clay court swing.","World no.1 Iga Swiatek beaten by Yulia Putintseva in Wimbledon third round.

Wimbledon: Gritty Carlos Alcaraz keeps rolling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-gritty-carlos-alcaraz-keeps-rolling/articleshow/111564974.cms,"MADISON KEYS’ RUN ENDS IN HEARTBREAK

LONDON: Carlos Alcaraz was racing around the court, covering ground like a hare on steroids. He went back and forth, corner to corner on set point (second set) in his Wimbledon fourth-round match that at one point he had reached so far wide he was doing splits like a gymnast in the middle of a floor routine, going down on the grass. He was back on his feet in time to play the next ball which was wide on his backhand after which he sprinted to the net for a short ball.Ugo Humbert , the 16th seeded Frenchman, positioned at the net, sent a pickup long to allow the Spaniard to take a two-set lead. Centre Court was on its feet and the defending champion turned to them, raising his index finger as much to salute his own effort as to acknowledge their celebration.Alcaraz, the third seed, who shut down the challenge of the free-hitting left-hander 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 to make his ninth major quarterfinal said he’d have described the sequence as ‘unbelievable’ had he been in the commentary box. He punctuated the description with a smile that lent a sparkle to the grey skies. The lightness of being Carlos Alcaraz.“I just tried to fight for every ball,” Alcaraz said.“It doesn’t matter which part of the court I’m in, just giving myself the chance to stay alive in the point. On set point, that was a really important point for me, it didn’t matter what he was going to do, I’m going to be there, fighting until the last ball.”Alcaraz, a three-time major champion, having already won a Grand Slam on all surfaces, had 45 winners in his near three-hours in the middle.When the 21-year-old wasn’t rollerblading around the rectangle, slamming winners, he was either trying his distinct range of trick shots or smiling and laughing with fans.His attitude has charged the tennis landscape, especially the women’s locker-room.American Coco Gauff took a leaf out of the smiling Spaniard’s book last fall when she turned her season around in stellar fashion, saying, “If he can smile, he has all this pressure, then I can do it too.”Briton Emma Raducanu said when you watch the Spaniard you want to emulate him on the court.“The last couple of matches I’ve been following Carlos, it’s just good to watch before your match,” she said.“In certain moments you try to emulate certain shots.” In another fourth-round clash played under the roof, world No.1 Jannik Sinner stopped big serving American Ben Shelton 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (9) to make the quarterfinals.After two hours and 23 minutes of action, the Wimbledon fourth-round showdown between the big-hitting Madison Keys and the No. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini was evensteven at 5-all in the third set.So the scoreboard said.

Both opponents present formidable challenges, with Dimitrov's crafty all-court game and Medvedev's relentless baseline prowess posing distinct threats to Sinner's aspirations.Sinner's best performance at Wimbledon to date came in 2023 when he reached the semifinals before succumbing to the legendary Novak Djokovic.As the world number one, Sinner carries the weight of expectations and the hopes of his nation on his shoulders.
