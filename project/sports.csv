working hard to rediscover his game vs spin

BENGALURU: The noise surrounding Virat Kohli's struggle against spin has been mounting, only getting shriller as his ordinary numbers against tweakers has burgeoned. In the past 28 Test matches, Kohli has been dismissed by spinners on 21 occasions, with off-spinners doing the bulk of the damage.Like always, Kohli may have chosen to ignore the clatter, but given his penchant for detail and work ethic, he perhaps has been hard on himself. It showed on Monday at the M Chinnaswamy stadium when the former India skipper spent considerable time facing spinners in the nets. There were the odd deliveries where he second-guessed himself, but there were plenty of assured cuts and hoists over the infield, all of them executed with impeccable footwork.While making his mark in red-ball cricket as a youngster, Kohli found comfort at this venue. Back in 2012 against New Zealand, he clobbered a century (103) and an unconquered 51, runs that eventually proved crucial in India's five-wicket win.Staying with back stories, over the past eight years, Kohli has played against New Zealand in four home matches and, barring Trent Boult and Neil Wagner , none of the pacers managed to dismiss him. But he has faltered against the Kiwis' assembly line of spinners - Jeetan Patel, Ajaz Patel, Mitchell Santner and Rachin Ravindra .The recent series against Bangladesh again underscored Kohli's woes against spin. In four innings, he returned 99 runs and fell to off-spin twice. The tendency to play early or play against the spin has done him no favours.If ever Kohli needed a comfort zone, then this venue must offer that. This, after all, is his 'home' ground with Royal Challengers Bengaluru and the odds are that it could help him rediscover his mojo against spin.As Kohli looks to climb back among the runs, he's found a staunch supporter in head coach Gautam Gambhir . Speaking on his stuttering top-order bat, Gambhir said on Monday, ""You don't keep judging people after every game. It's not fair on them. It's a sport. People fail all the time. Everyone doesn't have the best days every day. My job is to back players and select the best playing 11.""Another subplot to the Kohli story is milestones. The 35-year-old is 53 runs shy of 9,000 runs, yet the 10,000 landmark is already being spoken about.While Gambhir didn't take the milestone bait, he outlined Kohli's hunger to excel.""He is a world-class cricketer,"" Gambhir said. ""He has performed for such a long period. And he is as hungry as when he made his debut. That is what makes him a world-class cricketer. I am sure that he will be hungry to get runs in this series, and probably moving forward to Australia as well. Once he starts scoring, he can be very consistent. I'm sure that he will be looking forward to these three Test matches and the series in Australia.""","Virat Kohli has been dismissed by spinners on 21 occasions in past 28 Test matches. In recent series against Bangladesh, he returned 99 runs and fell to off-spin twice. Royal Challengers Bengaluru head coach Gautam Gambhir has backed Kohli.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114232531,imgsize-80574,width-400,resizemode-4/114232531.jpg"

The Pakistan women's team collapsed like a house of cards on Monday while chasing a victory and a place in the T20 World Cup semifinals, getting bowled out for just 56 against New Zealand in the penultimate group match of the tournament.After restricting New Zealand to a manageable 110 for 6, Pakistan first slipped to 28 for 5 and then crashed from 52 for 6 to 56 all out in 11.4 overs in an effort to win quickly to improve their net run rate and secure a semifinal berth.However, it's Australia and New Zealand who reached the semis from Group A, while India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were eliminated from the race.The win upset former Pakistan players and cricket experts, including ex-batsman Basit Ali .""It seemed like Pakistan were playing badminton, not cricket,"" said the 53-year-old Basit. ""Pakistan women's cricket chairperson is a badminton player. Badminton ki player cricket ki chairperson.""Tania Mallick, the Head of Women's Cricket in Pakistan, is a former national badminton champion.""I haven't seen such a team. You may lose 10 out of 10 matches, but I haven't seen a team dropping catches like that,"" said Basit about the butter fingers of the Pakistan team.""Mashallah, 11-12 catches chhorey, easy. Dolly, dolly, dolly!"" he said in sarcastic tone in a video on his YouTube channel.Basit praised Pakistan captain Fatima Sana who had lost her father a few days ago and went on to contribute the most runs (21) in her team's embarrassing collapse.Basit criticised the team's shot-selection and the drastic changes in the batting order in an effort to score quickly to win at the earliest.""Who got out on a good ball? Muneeba (Ali) played a cross-batted shot. They were getting run-out, playing bad shots. Sana Fatima lost her father recently; she played the best knock,"" he said.Extending his sarcasm to Pakistan men's defeat in the first Test against England despite scoring more than 500 in their first innings, Basit said that defeat possibly shook the women's team also.""I think the way Pakistan lost the first Test, it shocked the women's team as well and they too couldn't play...We know our team is weak, everybody knows that. But to lose like that...56 all out in 11.4 overs. It hurt me, personally,"" he said.""The way they changed the batting order, it was beyond me to comprehend.""","Pakistan women's team collapsed like a house of cards on Monday while chasing a victory and a place in the T20 World Cup semifinals.

'Slanderous'

PARIS: Kylian Mbappe is being investigated for rape by Swedish police, according to a newspaper report in Sweden following a visit by the Real Madrid star to Stockholm, which Mbappe denounced as ""fake news"".After Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported that an alleged rape had been reported to police but did not say who was accused, Expressen newspaper said 25-year-old Mbappe was the suspect.""According to information obtained by Expressen, police are investigating the star who is reasonably suspected of rape and sexual assault,"" the newspaper wrote.Swedish law enforcement differentiate the level of suspicion as either reasonable or probable, with reasonable being the lower degree of suspicion.Mbappe's entourage, when contacted by AFP, said it had no knowledge of a legal complaint made against him.The French international was not selected for his country's latest round of Nations League matches, so visited the Swedish capital with a group of people last Thursday.They dined at a restaurant before going to a nightclub, according to the Aftonbladet report. Mbappe and the group left Sweden on Friday.The newspaper said a rape was committed ""in Stockholm city centre"", citing a formal complaint made to police on Saturday that it had seen.Aftonbladet said the complaint was filed after the alleged victim had sought medical attention but did not say who was named in the accusation.Later, Expressen reported that Mbappe was the suspect.Mbappe himself claimed in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that there was a link between the Aftonbladet report and his hearing before a French league committee on Tuesday in his bitter dispute with his former club Paris Saint-Germain over what he says are unpaid wages.Mbappe claims he is owed 55 million euros ($60 million) by the Qatari-owned French champions.""FAKE NEWS !!!!. It's becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance,"" Mbappe posted.A prosecutor investigating the accusation told AFP: ""A probe is under way into a crime that was reported on October 10 in the centre of Stockholm.""Swedish police declined to give any further details.""In general, if we have received a complaint and decided to conduct interviews and we make it known (to the public), those involved in the case may take actions that delay and complicate the investigation,"" said police spokeswoman Carina Skagerlind.Aftonbladet published photos on its website on Monday showing police officers in front of the hotel where Mbappe and the group with him had stayed.Mbappe's entourage said in a statement sent to AFP: ""Today, a new slanderous rumour is starting to spread across the web from the Swedish media Aftonbladet.""These accusations are completely false and irresponsible, and their propagation is unacceptable.""In order to put an end to this methodical destruction of (the) image (of Kylian Mbappe), all necessary legal action will be taken to re-establish the truth and pursue any person or media involved in the moral harassment and defamatory treatment that Kylian Mbappe is suffering repeatedly,"" the statement added.A source close to Paris Saint-Germain told AFP it would ""ignore"" Mbappe's claim that there was a link between the report in Sweden and his dispute with the club.Mbappe joined Madrid in the summer after seven years at PSG.He has become one of the world's highest paid players after a stellar career.He joined Pele as the only teenager to score in a World Cup final when France beat Croatia 4-2 to win the 2018 edition and was voted Best Young Player of the tournament.Four years later in Qatar, he scored a hat-trick in the final against Argentina but finished on the losing side as Lionel Messi's side won in a penalty shootout.","Kylian Mbappe is being investigated for rape by Swedish police, according to a newspaper report.

Rachin Ravindra made his Test debut in 2021 against India in Kanpur, but the first Test of the series beginning in Bengaluru on Wednesday will hold a special place for the India-origin all-rounder, as it's the city from where his family belongs.""I guess it makes it extra significant because of the family connection,"" said Ravindra, who will turn 25 in November.The promising start to his international career has seen Ravindra scoring 672 runs in 9 Tests at an average of 50.98, including one century, when he scored 240, and three half-centuries.He has also played 25 ODIs and 23 T20Is.""It's amazing and I am very proud of my Indian heritage and to be able to play where a lot of my family is based is something very special,"" he said at the pre-match press conference.""There will be a bunch of them (family members) in the crowd, and I know dad will be here watching. Those moments, you pinch yourself on the journey and this is definitely one of them,"" added the left-handed batsman, who also bowls useful spin, which has yielded 10 Test wickets so far.Ravindra announced himself in a big way during the ODI World Cup in India last year, scoring 578 runs in 10 matches that included three centuries.He then went on to represent the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League earlier this year, scoring 222 runs.""Obviously when I was here last, there was the IPL and then before that it was the ODI World Cup. Two pretty cool experiences to have. (I was) part of two very good teams and had those experiences but I guess it's something different about playing a Test match. You are here for five days, it's tradition, Test cricket is the pinnacle. So it's always nice to play Test cricket, not just in New Zealand but also away,"" said the Wellington-born player.","Rachin Ravindra made his Test debut in 2021 against India in Kanpur.

NEW DELHI: What's India's greatest Test victory of all time? Every cricket fan has a personal favourite. Unlikely triumphs, wrenched out at Oval 1971, Port of Spain 1976, Kolkata 2001 , Brisbane 2021, and Kanpur 2024 too, for its audacity of imagination, are likely to figure in most lists.But for those of a certain vintage, India's nerve-jangling two-wicket win over Bobby Simpson 's Australia exactly 60 years ago-Oct 15, 1964 on Dussehra day-at Bombay's Brabourne Stadium ranks among the very best.""It was the most exciting Test seen in India since the 1948 (India vs West Indies in Bombay) one, some said the most exciting ever…Some Indians thought the Test compared with the tied Test (Australia vs West Indies in Brisbane, 1960),"" wrote Mihir Bose in his masterly chronicle, A History of Indian Cricket . The first line of The Times of India report summed up the national mood: ""Victory at last-And what a victory!""""It was a seesaw game,"" recalled Chandu Borde , regarded as the spine of India's middle-order in the 1960s. The pithy summary is precise. The Test, played on a freshly relaid pitch, wasn't about wildly fluctuating fortunes; it was a match of mini tremors and slow shifts. Nobody scored a century, nobody claimed a fiver in this Test won by collective enterprise and true grit.India had a bunch of notable performers. Captain MAK Pataudi entertained with 86 and 53. Vijay Manjrekar's 59 and 39 were vital. Leg-spinner BS Chandrashekhar, the other surviving member from the playing XI, scalped eight (4/50 and 4/73). And left-arm spinner Bapu Nadkarni's contributions with bat (34 & 0) and ball (2/65 and 4/33) were critical. But in the end, it was Borde and keeper KS Indrajitsinhji, who became heroes and were ""loaded with garlands"" and hoisted on shoulders by spectators.""The crowd rushed to the wicket, lifted and carried us to the pavilion,"" said Borde , now 90, on phone. He remained undefeated on 30 while forging a match-winning 32 run ninth-wicket stand with Indrajitsinhji. The keeper stonewalled the Aussie attack for 41 minutes contributing a priceless 3.In the post-match melee, someone filched Borde's brand new willow. ""One person took my bat and ran away. It was the bat I used to play in Lancashire (league). It was an English willow. That was stolen from me,"" Borde had told this reporter in 2020.The crowd's behaviour needs to be understood in the way the Test unfolded. Australia scored 320 batting first, India replying with 341. When the visitors were bowled out for 274 in their second knock, Pataudi's men-Dilip Sardesai, ML Jaisimha, Salim Durani , Hanumant Singh, among others-needed 254 to overhaul. India had never scored so many runs for a win in the fourth innings.All looked lost when six wickets fell for 122. Two of them were night watchmen, but even 50% of the target hadn't been reached yet. Then the improbable began to happen. Pataudi and Manjrekar put on 93 for the seventh wicket, before both fell within 10 runs of each other.Now it was left to Borde and Indrajitsinhji to take India home. ""There was a lot of tension on the ground. But I was okay on the pitch. And Indrajitsinhji gave me good support,"" said Borde.Every run was cheered. ""Though the faint-hearted could scarcely bear to look, Borde was playing his normal game. With seven runs wanted, offie (Tom) Veivers bowled an over-pitched ball which he off-drove for four, the next ball he drove wide of mid-on and India had won,"" wrote Edward Docker in ""History of Indian Cricket"".In 55 Tests, Borde scored 3,061 runs. He smashed five centuries, an unbeaten 177 against Pakistan in Madras being his highest. His leg-breaks fetched him 52 wickets. But it was the game changing cameo which earned him the adulation that every sportsperson dreams of.",Chandu Borde and KS Indrajitsinhji were hoisted on shoulders by spectators.

Indian coach

also wants bowlers to get their due

BENGALURU: Over the next nine months, India play 13 Test matches, starting with the series opener against New Zealand beginning Wednesday. While the focus will understandably be on workload management, Indian head coach Gautam Gambhir believes adaptability will play a huge role in the brand of cricket Rohit Sharma & Co. play.""We want to be a team that can make 400 runs in a day and bat for two days to draw.And that's called growth and adaptability. That's called Test cricket . If you play the same way, then it's not growth. We have a lot of individuals in the dressing room who can bat for two days. So, ultimately, the first motive is to win the match,"" said Gambhir, who began his red ball journey as a coach with a 2-0 series win over Bangladesh.India walked the talk against Bangladesh in Kanpur. With the first three days truncated due to rain, India pulled off a convincing seven-wicket win with plenty to spare.The former Indian opener also stressed on players being expressive on the field. ""We want players to go out there and play the natural game. If they can get 400-500 runs in a day, why not? We will play it that way. High-risk, high reward; High-risk, high failure. There will be days when we'll get bundled out for 100 and we'll take it. And we'll continue to back our players to play high-risk cricket. That's how we want to play and that's how we want to keep the game going forward,"" he elaborated.India, who are on an 18 Test match-winning spree at home since 2013, will start favourites against the struggling Black Caps , but Gambhir warned against complacency.""New Zealand is a completely different challenge. They're a very good team with high-quality players. They've got players who can hurt us and do the job for them as well. So, we respect them, but we don't fear anyone. We need to be switched on from ball one. And that is the responsibility of the support staff to keep the players switched on whether we are batting or bowling first,"" he added.Gambhir also called for a change in attitude toward bowlers and their contribution to a team.""This is the time of the bowlers. Batsmen only set up matches. Our batsman-obsessed attitude must end. If a batsman makes a thousand runs, there is no guarantee that he will win the Test match. But if a bowler takes 20 wickets, there is 99% chance of winning. So, I hope that this era or this time, we will talk more about bowlers as compared to batters. And I hope that this mindset will change in the future,"" said Gambhir.","India coach Gautam Gambhir believes adaptability will play a huge role in the brand of cricket Rohit Sharma & Co. play.

""I think Fakhar should talk to chairman Mohsin Naqvi. Otherwise, these guys will create problems for him,"" he said.Following Babar's exclusion from the Test squad, Zaman related the situation to Virat Kohli's lean phase and that India didn't drop their star batsman despite him losing his high-scoring touch.""It's concerning to hear suggestions about dropping Babar Azam.

Both are strong teams, and India put up a very good fight against Australia. The only lapse I could see was that Richa Ghosh should have come in to bat ahead of Deepti Sharma .

Was intent missing from the Indian batters?""I don’t think the intent was missing. If you look at Shafali, she was playing the way she usually does. Australia planned really well for Smriti Mandhana . They knew that if Smriti settled in, she could destroy them. It seems like Australia had something specific planned against Smriti, and it looked like she was trapped by them.

NEW DELHI: Even after an impressive debut Test series vs England earlier this year, Sarfaraz Khan has had to wait for a chance in the XI. India played KL Rahul in the two Tests vs Bangladesh and Sarfaraz was released to play Irani Cup for Mumbai. The middle-order batter hit a double hundred for Mumbai and Rahul too got crucial runs in the two Tests for India.Both players are now part of India Test squad for New Zealand series and it remains to be seen whether Sarfaraz gets a game in the three Tests.Former India cricketer and ex-selector Jatin Paranjape wants Sarfaraz to let his bat do the talking and wait for his opportunity.""There is nothing unfair about Sarfaraz’s situation. He was playing because someone else was injured. The competition for batting spots is so intense that, unfortunately, someone will always miss out. But for the guy who misses out, what can he do? He can just keep scoring runs, and Sarfaraz has been doing that in the Irani Cup. He needs to stay in good form, maintain his fitness, and his chances will come,"" Paranjape told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.The former selector has a feeling that Sarfaraz could be in the reserves for the upcoming Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia too.""I feel he might also be taken to Australia as a reserve player.

Pakistan squad for second and third Tests:

NEW DELHI: Babar Azam , who has been a key player for Pakistan across all formats, faced a major setback as the selectors decided to drop him for the second Test against England.

Vaughan wrote on social media.Babar, who recently stepped down as Pakistan’s white-ball captain, has faced criticism for his underwhelming form with the bat.

BENGALURU: Back in 2021, they were the first World Test Championship winners. One of the highlights of that 2019-21 cycle was New Zealand 's consistency. A trait which has been missing from the Black Caps' campaign this season.In the current WTC cycle, which ends in June next year, New Zealand are placed sixth with three wins and five losses are already out of title contention.While the New Zealand bowlers bowled extensively during their 0-2 loss to Sri Lanka recently, the batsmen have made heavy weather of every challenge, stumbling miserably against spin in particular. Hence, it is hardly surprising that New Zealand's young gun Rachin Ravindra stressed on the need to negate spin twins Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja ""India have consistent bowlers who bowl in an area for a long period of time. You see the two spinners who play consistently -Ashwin and Jadeja-they are two very accomplished bowlers, and they can bat too,"" pointed out Rachin.Outlining India's dominance at home, the all-round said, ""They're consistent and good to battle, especially in this part of the world. Obviously, we know how good India are in their own conditions. It shows how hard it is for a team to come and win here. So, it's difficult,"" conceded Rachin.In the build-up to the series New Zealand suffered a huge blow with Kane Williamson out of the initial part of the series. ""We're not sure. I guess he (Williamson) will play it by ear. Some news will come out soon enough,"" is all Rachin had to offer on Williamson's availability.Although born and raised in Wellington, Rachin shares a special relationship with Bengaluru-his parents' hometown.On the 'home' Test, Rachin said, ""This Test is extra significant for me because of the family connection. I was born and brought up in Wellington I'm a Kiwi all the way, but I'm very proud of my Indian heritage. To play where a lot of my family is based is something special. There will be a bunch of them in the crowd. I know my dad will be here watching the game.""",Rachin Ravindra says New Zealand need to negate spin twins Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindr Jadeja.

Brief Scores (In Guwahati):

Looking down the barrel at the end of Day 3, hosts Assam did a wonderful turnaround on the final day of their Ranji Trophy Group D opener to stave off defeat at the hands of Jharkhand in Guwahati on Monday.Trailing Jharkhand’s first innings total by 51 runs at stumps on Sunday after following on, Assam batters pulled off a stunning comeback to reach 355 at tea on the day.In process, the home side set Ishan Kishan ’s boys a 175-run target for an outright victory, which looked to be tough task with only the last session left.Jharkhand, led by an explosive captain, tried their best to push for the win with Kishan (16 off 12 balls) coming out to open the innings with Nazim Siddiquie (3). But both were dismissed in quick succession in the third and fourth over, respectively. No. 3 Virat Singh (27* off 27) and Kolkata Knight Riders all-rounder Anukul Roy (24 off 16) put up 47 runs in six overs before the latter lost his stumps to Assam pacer Mukhtar Hussain in the first ball of 11th over with the scoreboard reading 74/3.This led the Jharkhand camp to shake hands with their opponents thinking the target – still 101 to get from there – is not reachable in the remaining overs of the day.Earlier, Assam’s batting was led by their captain Denish Das ’s fighting 75, Akash Sengupta ’s 92 and Mrinmoy Dutta ’s 47-run cameo at No. 10. Sibsankar Roy could add only two to his unbeaten score of 15 but Das carried on from his 29 to reach 75 off 149 balls. But it was Sengupta and Dutta’s 88-run stand for the ninth wicket that took the game away from Jharkhand, who were in an advantageous position till the third day.Jharkhand take home three points by the virtue of first innings lead while Assam had to be content with just one point, but avoiding loss would give them much solace before the next game.Jharkhand 361 & 74/3 (Virat Singh 27, Anukul Roy 24; Mukhtar Hussain 2/28).

If from Rajasthan no batsman accelerated the innings, from Pondicherry the bowlers were late to trigger a collapse on the final day of their Ranji Trophy 2024-25 opener at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Monday.The hosts, with a first innings lead of 43 runs, finished with three points while the visitors had to contend with a single point.Chasing a tricky 239 on the last day, Rajasthan opener Abhijeet Tomar (87 off 149 balls) and wicketkeeper batsman Kunal Singh Rathore (59 off 126 balls), who was promoted to the third spot, slowly but steadily took the team closer to the target. But that was not enough to win the game and the match ended when Rajasthan were 19 runs short of the target.Resuming at the overnight score of 207/6, Pondicherry finished at 281 all out with a major chunk of runs coming from Aman Khan’s (55 from 116 balls) bat.Rajasthan’s left-hand batsman Mahipal Lomror who looked off-colour with the bat, was effective with the ball and played his part in folding Pondicherry’s second innings. He recorded figures of 4.5-0-15-3.Coming out to bat for the second time, Rajasthan's Tomar and Rathore collaced 138 runs in 236 balls before Rathore stepped out and missed the ball completely and was stumped off left-arm spinner Sagar Udeshi.At that point of the match, Rajasthan were 178/2 in 50.3 overs, requiring 61 more but Pondicherry had triggered a collapse. In the subsequent over, off-spinner Fabid Ahmed with his double strike, cleaning up a well-settled Tomar and Mahipal Lomror (3 off 4 balls), pushed the hosts on the back foot.Nervousness was palpable on both sides. But after Rajasthan skipper Deepak Hooda (17 off 21 balls) was run-out, surviving the remaining overs of the day became a task. By the 60th over, the hosts were 220/7 and the match ended because of bad light.Effectiveness of spinners made Pondicherry sense victory, but given the situation, they were left to rue the poor visibility that stopped the game.Tomar, Rathore played well: Pondicherry captain Arun Kartik applauded Tomar and Rathore’s effort, but also rued the lost opportunity of winning the match. “When we came out to bat, we thought 220-230 was a winning total. But the way Rajasthan opener and No. 3 batter batted, they did a tremendous job. On the last day it’s never easy. When that second wicket fell, the next five wickets fell in no time. They both played a great game.”He then added, “I wanted to bowl the spinners but the light was not conducive and the match had to end.”","Rajasthan's Abhijeet Tomar and wicketkeeper batsman Kunal Singh Rathore took the team closer to the target. The hosts, with a first innings lead of 43 runs, finished with three points while the visitors had to contend with a single point.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114224779,imgsize-31046,width-400,resizemode-4/114224779.jpg"

Coach Mauricio Pochettino made a successful debut in charge of the United States, leading them to a 2-0 friendly win over Panama on Saturday.Pochettino, who left Premier League side Chelsea in May after one season in charge, was appointed last month to replace Gregg Berhalter, following his dismissal after a humiliating early exit from the 2024 Copa America .The new boss spent much of the first half on the sidelines giving instructions to his team, who were unable to find the back of the net despite threatening chances, the closest coming from former Chelsea striker Christian Pulisic , whose shot after a quick breakaway was blocked by goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera.Pulisic, however, found his rhythm and showed glimpses of his scintillating start to the season with AC Milan when he delivered a fine cross for Yunus Musah to finish with aplomb four minutes after the break.Goalkeeper Matthew Turner helped the Americans maintain their advantage, denying efforts by Yoel Barcenas and Jose Rodriguez as Panama failed to equalise, and substitute Ricardo Pepi put the icing on the cake with a late goal in stoppage time.Having won his first game in charge, Pochettino will be looking to continue that streak when the U.S. travel to Guadalajara to take on Mexico on Tuesday.",Mauricio Pochettino made a successful debut in charge of the United States.

Farukh on target as India fight back for a draw against Vietnam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/farukh-on-target-as-india-fight-back-for-a-draw-against-vietnam/articleshow/114181682.cms,"India’s Farukh Choudhary celebrates after scoring against Vietnam on Saturday

India are still without a win in 2024, Manolo Marquez is yet to taste success after three games with the national team, yet the 1-1 away draw against Vietnam in an international friendly on Saturday was one of its better games over the last year.Bui Vi Hao expectedly put Vietnam ahead after 38 minutes at the Thien Trưong Stadium in Nam Dịnh, but India fought back with a goal from Farukh Choudhary (’58) in the second session.The visitors were under pressure in the last quarter but held on for a morale boosting draw with two players -- Aakash Sangwan and Lalrinliana Hnamte – making their national team debuts.The last time both teams faced each other, India were thrashed 3-0.A major part of the credit for the draw should go to goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu . The India captain watched in disbelief as the ball hit his leg and sailed inside in the first half. But for most part, he was simply unbeatable. He proved it with multiple saves, including an early penalty, and a stunning reflex late in the game. When the ball did move past him, Anwar Ali – another impressive performer – came to the rescue with a goalline clearance towards the closing stages.Farukh, too, deserves appreciation. Left out in the cold after his last game in October 2021 for India, Manolo handpicked the Chennaiyin forward after his impressive showing in the first three games for his club in the ISL. He didn’t disappoint and was lively with his movements. The first attempt on goal came from his left foot, a powerful drive from outside the box that went straight to the keeper.Another attempt from an acute angle, after Brandon Fernandes had cleverly picked him inside the box with a no-look pass, forced a low save from the goalkeeper, using his legs.Higher-ranked and technically superior Vietnam were the better side in the first half and forced mistakes from the India defenders. The pressure finally paid off in the 38th minute, when a clearance off a Vietnam corner fell to Vi Hao, whose attempt deflected off Anwar, then Gurpreet’s leg, before rolling in, despite a desperate dive.India are not known for their comebacks, particularly when playing away, but this team hit differently in the second session. It was midfielder Suresh Singh who created the goal out of nowhere: he sent a long ball from India’s own half that evaded Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai and Farukh showed remarkable composure to lob the ball with his left foot, over the stranded goalkeeper.The last time Farukh scored was against Nepal in Sep 2021. A month later, he played his last international game.Vietnam had chances to register a win at a venue they have won their last two games. India’s defence at times was brittle and were saved the blushes by Gurpreet’s inspired form.Only if Liston Colaco thought and finished better, India could have killed it on the counter in stoppage time.",Bui Vi Hao expectedly put Vietnam ahead after 38 minutes.

Manolo Marquez will have to wait for his first win as India head coach as his team played out a 1-1 draw in an entertaining international football friendly match against Vietnam here on Saturday. Vietnam took the lead in the 38th minute through Nguyen Hoang Duc before Farukh Choudhary equalised in the 53rd minute at the Thien Truong Stadium , around 100 km from Hanoi.In Marquez's two matches as head coach so far, India drew against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup in Hyderabad last month.Ranked 116th, Vietnam are 10 spots higher than India (126th) in the FIFA rankings .In an eventful first half, India goalkeeper and captain Gurpreet Singh Sandhu stopped a penalty kick awarded to Vietnam in the 10th minute after Rahul Bheke fouled a home side attacker. Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai's shot, however, went straight to Sandhu.Two minutes before that, Choudhary was let free in an Indian attack but his left-footer from just outside the box was stopped by Vietnam goalie Nguyen Filip.Vietnam were on the ascendency as the match progressed and Nguyen Van Toan's shot in the 17th minute went just wide off the mark.In the 27th minute, India also got a chance but again Choudhary's left-footed shot from a difficult angle off a pass from Brandon Fernandes could not beat the Vietnam goalkeeper.Chau Ngoc Quans almost gave Vietnam the lead in the 32nd minute when he outsmarted an Indian defender with his turn and his left-footed curler beat Sandhu but the ball went wide of the post by few inches.Vietnam's goal eventually came six minutes later. Bui Vi Hao's volley from inside the box deflected from an Indian defender and Gurpreet's outstretched leg was able to touch the ball but not enough to send it out of harm's way.All Nguyen Hoang Duc had to do was just push the ball into the open net from the goal-line.India played much better in the second half. They had periods of dominance and also found the equaliser in the 53rd minute.Defender Anwar Ali sent a long aerial ball from near the centre line and Choudhary won an aerial duel with Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai rather easily and he chipped the ball over an onrushing goalie Nguyen Filip into the empty net.Ten minutes later, Lallianzuala Chhangte 's chip into the Vietnam box almost found Choudhary's feet but the home side goalkeeper was able to lay his hand on the ball.India called the shots in the initial period of the second half and the Blue Tigers rattled the home team's defence quite often. In the meantime, Choudhary was substituted by Edmund Lalrindika.In the 71st minute, Chhangte's shot took a deflection and went out for a corner.But from there on, Vietnam came back strongly and dictated terms in the last 15 minutes. They created a series of scoring chances but could not convert any of them.In the 79th minute, Sandhu made a brilliant reflex save to deny Van Vu's snap shot from inside the box.Three minutes later, central defender Anwar Ali made a goal-line save as he headed out a goal-bound shot.Originally, India were to play in a tri-Nation tournament but Lebanon pulled out, citing difficulties in flying out of the country due to the ongoing crisis at home. The tournament was planned in the FIFA international match window from October 7-15.India were earlier scheduled to play against Vietnam on October 9 and against Lebanon on October 12 before Lebanon's pulling out left them to play just one match.",Vietnam took the lead in the 38th minute through Nguyen Hoang Duc. Farukh Choudhary equalised in the 53rd minute at the Thien Truong Stadium. India goalkeeper and captain Gurpreet Singh Sandhu stopped a penalty kick awarded to Vietnam in the 10th minute.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114174489,imgsize-49818,width-400,resizemode-4/114174489.jpg"

SEMI LOOMS

SHANGHAI: Former world number one Novak Djokovic , the last surviving member of tennis' ""Big Four"", said he does not plan on stopping any time soon but admitted that the retirement of rivals Roger Federer Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal has been overwhelming.Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray were dubbed the ""Big Four"" during a period of dominance when they won a combined 69 Grand Slam titles and were involved in some of the most memorable matches of the last two decades.Spain's Nadal, who won a record 14 French Open titles, announced on Thursday that he would call time on his career after next month's Davis Cup. Murray retired after this year's Paris Olympics and Federer bowed out in 2022.Speaking after beating Czech Jakub Mensik in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals on Friday, Djokovic said: ""(Nadal) has been my greatest rival. The rivalry I had with him has impacted me the most in my career by far.""We knew that that moment is coming sooner than later, but it's still a shock, you know.""Roger a few years ago, when he announced retirement and Andy as well this year. I mean, it's a bit overwhelming for me to be honest. I don't know what to make out of it. I still enjoy competing. But part of me left with them, a big part of me.""In his 6-7 (4), 6-1, 6-4 win over Mensik, who was born over a year after Djokovic played his first match on the ATP Tour in 2004, the Serb was pushed hard but fought back to clinch the win.It ensured his progression to a record-extending 78th ATP Masters 1000 semi-final - two more than Nadal.""These kind of matches, against teenagers, it's something that really motivates me,"" Djokovic told reporters after the win.""It keeps me going, and pushes me to really dig deep, and to show to the world that I still got it in my legs, that I can still go the distance with the young guys.""I'm super glad that I managed to win this very challenging match.""Djokovic faces world number seven Taylor Fritz in the semi-finals on Saturday after the American defeated Belgian David Goffin 6-3 6-4 earlier on Friday.""I'm going to have a big server opponent tomorrow, Fritz, so I have to be ready for another difficult match,"" the 24-times Grand Slam champion said.""Quick conditions, if you serve well it's quite a big advantage.""We are entering the last couple of matches of the tournament, and now is the time for me to really try to step it up even more, and hopefully I can get a chance to be in the finals.""","Novak Djokovic says the retirement of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal has been overwhelming.
