NEW DELHI: The Delhi Capitals (DC) will face off against the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Match 35 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 on Saturday. DC is currently in sixth place in the IPL 2024 points table with six points, while SRH is tied with Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings, and Lucknow Super Giants with eight points.In their previous encounters, DC has won 11 matches against SRH, while SRH has emerged victorious 12 times in the 23 matches they have played against each other.The upcoming match between Delhi Capitals (DC) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) marks the debut game of IPL 2024 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium . Historically, the pitch at this stadium has been slow and sluggish. However, with a fresh wicket expected for this match, we anticipate improved batting conditions initially. Nonetheless, as the game progresses, the spinners are likely to play a significant role due to the traditionally spin-friendly nature of the pitch.In the 84 matches played at the venue, teams batting first have clinched victory 37 times, while those batting second have emerged victorious in 46 matches.The average first innings total stands at 165 runs, whereas teams chasing have often faced an average target of 149 runs. The highest total ever recorded at this venue was 231/4 by Punjab Kings against Delhi Capitals, while the lowest total stands at 83/10 by Delhi Capitals against Chennai Super Kings.1. Batters can expect favourable conditions initially, but as the match progresses, the pitch will slow down, favouring spinners. Thus, batsmen adept at playing spin will be valuable assets.2. Bowlers will find assistance with the new ball, but as the game unfolds, spinners will come into play.IPL 2024 Stats: 253 Runs in 6 MatchesHeinrich Klaasen, the South African middle-order batsman, has been in exceptional form over the past 10-12 months. This impressive form has seamlessly transitioned into the IPL, where he has emerged as the linchpin of the Sunrisers Hyderabad batting line up. (Here's a list of updated Orange Cap list) IPL 2024 Stats: 9 Wickets in 6 MatchesThe SRH captain had a modest beginning with the ball. However, in the last match, Pat Cummins showcased his prowess by claiming three crucial wickets in a high-scoring encounter against RCB where nearly 550 runs were amassed in just 40 overs. (Here's a list of updated Purple Cap list) 235 runs in 5 inningsTravis Head is currently in outstanding form, providing strong starts to the Sunrisers Hyderabad's innings. His recent century in the previous match speaks volumes about his exceptional batting prowess, undoubtedly boosting his confidence for upcoming encounters.David Warner, Prithvi Shaw, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, Shai Hope, Rishabh Pant (wk/c), Tristan Stubbs , Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mukesh Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Khaleel AhmedAbhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan, Mayank MarkandeHeinrich Klaasen, Rishabh PantTravis Head, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Tristan Stubbs, David WarnerAxar Patel, Nitesh ReddyPat Cummins, Kuldeep Yadav, Khaleel Ahmed","Delhi Capitals (DC) will face off against the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Match 35 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 on Saturday.

What is Apple Watch Noise alert

As MS Dhoni , the revered Chennai Super Kings (CSK) icon, marched onto the pitch, a wave of electric anticipation swept through the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow. The legendary cricketer’s arrival was met with a thunderous ovation that resonated beyond the confines of the arena, stirring the souls of cricket enthusiasts.On this particular Friday, the atmosphere was charged with an intense emotion as Dhoni faced the Lucknow SuperGiants (LSG).The stadium, awash in a sea of CSK’s signature yellow, buzzed with the possibility that this might be ‘Thala’ Dhoni’s final IPL appearance in the City of Nawabs.Capturing the moment’s intensity, Sasha, the wife of cricketer Quinton de Kock , shared an Instagram story that spoke volumes. Her post featured a snapshot of her smartwatch alerting to “Loud Environment: Sound levels hit 95 decibels,” a testament to the roaring support for Dhoni that could potentially lead to temporary hearing loss after mere minutes of exposure.The crescendo of cheers set the stage for Dhoni’s masterclass in batting. The 42-year-old maestro unleashed a spectacular onslaught, hammering the LSG bowlers for an unbeaten 28 runs off just nine deliveries. His powerful performance, punctuated by three boundaries and two majestic sixes, captivated the audience and showcased his enduring prowess.This remarkable cameo not only electrified the spectators but also etched Dhoni’s name deeper into IPL history, as he crossed the milestone of 5,000 runs as a wicketkeeper-batsman in the league.Throughout the current IPL season, Dhoni has been in formidable form, maintaining an undefeated streak and amassing 87 runs with an extraordinary strike rate exceeding 255.

NEW DELHI: Travis Head is currently on the loose, hopping cities and murdering bowling attacks. At the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Saturday evening, it was almost spine-chillingly cold-blooded about the way he tossed his bat, opened his gloves before the ball had even hit the cover boundary off Mukesh Kumar on the last ball of the powerplay.By then, he brought up his half-century inside the first three overs of the match, killed the spirit of the Delhi Capitals bowling attack along with fellow opener Abhishek Sharma and helped Sunrisers Hyderabad score a jaw-dropping 125 runs in the first six overs.The tempo set by Head's 32-ball 89 and Abhishek's 12-ball 46 was enough for SRH to put up a daunting score of 266/7 with a little help of Shahbaz Ahmed 's unbeaten 29-ball 59 in the second half of the innings. This is the third time in the tournament that they have breached the 250-run mark. And expectedly, that was enough for SRH to register another emphatic 67-run win.In reply, Jack Fraser-McGurk tried to match the muscle game with a frenzied 18-ball 65 along with Abhishek Porel's 22-ball 42. But the pressure of the score posted by SRH took toll once McGurk's onslaught ended 109/3 in the seventh over. Capitals were bowled out rather tamely with captainRishabh Pant , coming in at No. 6 and struggling to find timing, scoring 44 off 35 balls. The difference was some sharp and accurate bowling by SRH captain Pat Cummins (0/35) and T Natarajan's smart spell of 4/19.Head has been ruling the stadiums in India since the ODI World Cup in Oct-Nov. He broke Indian hearts in the World Cup final in Ahmedabad but he has clearly won them back with his marauding form in the ongoing IPL . The packed Delhi stadium was thrilled to bits to watch him on a rampage and even cheered for the visiting SRH team.On the match eve, Capitals coach Ricky Ponting had claimed that his team was ready for a shootout. Head went about gunning down one Capitals bowler at a time right from the second ball of the game when he nonchalantly slapped Khaleel Ahmed over the mid-wicket boundary for the six. That echo off the bat clearly rattled the Capitals bowling attack. Off-spinner Lalit Yadav, trusted to slow down the pace against two left-handers, was given the second over and he ended up leaking 41 off his two overs.Be it Anrich Nortje, Khaleel, Mukesh or Lalit-all of them were guilty of pitching the ball too short on a pitch which resembled a concrete strip. Abhishek was mostly a bystander to the carnage off Head's bat but he took the onus of taking down Capitals' trump card Kuldeep Yadav . Nimble on his foot, he charged down to Kuldeep to smack three sixes.Capitals captain Rishabh Pant may have thought that his team had finally got on track with good bowling performances in the two preceding games. Little did he know that his attack was running into a rampaging SRH team with Head and Abhishek their hands on the wheel and foot on the gas. For the first 30 minutes, it seemed like the duo were chipping sixes-12 between them.The onslaught was so freakish that Kuldeep's comeback with four wickets--including the wickets of Head, Abhishek and Markram-and Axar Patel's 1/29 seemed like an anomaly in the game. These two spinners have been the saving grace for the Capitals through the tournament. Yet, their effort could do beyond containing Sunrisers to 108 runs in the last 10 overs of the innings.",Sunrisers Hyderabad score 266/7 to beat Delhi Capitals by 67 runs. Opener Travis Head scores 89 and Abhishek Sharma 46 in first six overs. Jack Fraser-McGurk scores 65 but Caps bowled out for 109 in seventh over.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109464564,imgsize-66820,width-400,resizemode-4/109464564.jpg"

In the first 7 games, MI only have three wins under new skipper Hardik.And former T20 World Cup winner and opener Robin Uthappa recently made a big statement on Hardik, saying that the booing has resulted in 'mental health issues' for the all-rounder.Taking Hardik's side and backing his decision to return to MI, Uthappa said that the treatment he has been receiving from fans has been unfair.""He is a guy who has got the calibre and potential to be an all-time great for the Indian team. He was let go by the team which discovered him, he went to another franchise. After winning 3-4 titles with them, he left. He must have felt a little bad; that will be there. He went to GT, won a title and finished runners-up in another. Then the conversation began,"" Uthappa said on The Ranveer Show on YouTube.""The mocking, trolling, the memes about his fitness. You don't think it hurts him? It hurts him. It hurts any human being. How many people actually know the reality of it? Hardik is dealing with mental health issues, for sure. We, as people, I understand, as Indians, we are emotional. But it is not right to impose this kind of treatment on any human being. It is unbecoming as a society for us to do that to someone and be okay with it. We should not be laughing along with it. We should not be forwarding these memes.""It's our job, yes it's passion too, but it's what puts the food on the table for me. My job is on display for you to criticise. A corporate person's job is not on television to criticise, or have an opinion about either. When that is the case, you have to exercise a certain amount of empathy and dignity to the other person to allow them to fail. One of the most beautiful things we did as a country is our expression of love, and our reaction to our Indian team after we lost the World Cup. That's how we should be as a society, and as Indians,"" said Uthappa.In the first 7 matches this season, Hardik has 141 runs to his name at an average of 23.50 with no half-centuries.On the bowling front, Hardik has bagged a mere 4 wickets and has leaked runs at an economy rate of 11 RPO.","Hardik Pandya has been subjected to constant on-field booing by the spectators.

NEW DELHI: Succumbing to a heavy 67-run defeat at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad at home, Delhi Capitals skipper Rishabh Pant on Saturday conceded his side was literally doing catchup after Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma 's record-shattering powerplay exhibition.As Sunrisers Hyderabad smashed 125 runs in the first six overs to create an IPL record, it helped the visitors to a towering 266 for 7 -- their fourth 250-plus total of the season.After getting ripped apart with the ball, Pant and co. did give a fight with the bat in the mammoth chase but eventually finished at 199 all out.Soon after the disappointing loss, legendary Sunil Gavaskar consoled Pant, asking him to never put his head down.""I never want your head down, there are lots of games so keep a smile always,"" Gavaskar told Pant during the post-match presentation.The DC captain was visibly moved by Gavaskar's supportive words and responded, ""I will try my best, sir"".Head (89, 32 balls) and Abhishek (46, 12 balls) took power play to a different level, erasing the previous record of 105/0 by KKR against RCB in 2017.""I think power play was the difference. We were just catching up throughout the match. That was the massive difference. Hopefully, we will come back with more thought process and clear mindset,"" said Pant, whose 'homecoming' was spoilt by Head and Sharma's 131-run partnership.The DC skipper also said he probably misjudged the dew factor at the Arun Jaitley Stadium and decided to bowl first after winning the toss.""The only thought process behind that (deciding to bowl first) was we thought there would be some dew but it didn't come. I thought if we could restrict them to 220-230, we would be in with a chance.""SRH bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar got just one wicket but his restrictive spell in the high-scoring match -- 33 runs in 4 overs -- played a vital role in the easy win.""Feeling good. Not among the wickets but the way I want to execute it is happening. Just a matter of time,"" said the pace-bowling stalwart.""When defending those many runs, you either go for plenty or you get wickets. We accepted that we'll go for plenty of runs when defending those many runs, but the plan was to keep executing,"" he added.Bhuvneshwar praised his fellow pacer T Natarajan's bowling, who was twice on a hat-trick in a single over and ended up with superb figures of 4/19 in four overs""Amazing. We know how good he is at yorkers. He keeps working hard, silent guy, goes unnoticed a lot. We know how important he is for Sunrisers,"" said Bhuvneshwar, adding that he is happy that SRH batting is finally clicking after several years.""For so many years, this is the first time our batting is clicking so much. As a bowling unit, happy to take the back seat. They (batters) are ruining us... when we defend 180 or so, it'll feel like less,"" he said.Bhuvneshwar added both Head and Abhishek bat in the same manner at nets.""Yes, same, especially Head and Abhishek, playing the same way. Batters sometimes play opposite (manner) in the nets, but they play the same way.""The pacer indicated that bowlers don't get their due despite all the hard work but, in the end, they win championships for teams.""Bowling is something... somebody says batting wins your sponsorship, but bowling wins you championship.

When Lucknow Super Giants' (LSG) fielding coach Jonty Rhodes was announcing the 'best fielder' award after the team's win over Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2024 on Friday, everybody in the dressing room expected him to pick the player who made a stunning effort to stop runs or take a catch. But instead he picked a dropped catch by Deepak Hooda because it kept MS Dhoni in the dugout for five more deliveries.While trying to catch an aerial hit by Ravindra Jadeja at the long-on fence, Hooda could only manage to tip it over the bar, and the ball landed over the boundary ropes for a six. But Rhodes analysed it as a good effort because it prevented Dhoni from walking in as the next batsman.""Fielding award is not just about brilliant performances, fielding is about awareness,"" said Rhodes in a video posted by LSG on microblogging platform 'X'.""In the yellow team (Chennai) they have this guy MSD.

Can Dinesh Karthik's finishing skills fetch him WC ticket?

Will the 38-year-old Karthik make the journey for the T20 World Cup?

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik once again demonstrated why he is considered one of the best finishers in the world. Karthik blasted an explosive 83 off 35 balls as RCB posted 262 runs while chasing a target of 287 against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Although his efforts didn't lead RCB to victory, the experienced batter's finishing skills have once again sparked discussions about his potential inclusion in India's T20 World Cup squad, which is set to be announced soon.Not just against Sunrisers Hyderabad, Karthik was at his majestic best against Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians when he smoked an unbeaten 53 off just 23. But RCB lost that match as well.Watching Karthik's onslaught during the match, Mumbai Indians star batsman and Team India captain Rohit Sharma was heard playfully teasing Karthik on the stump mic.""Shabash DK! T20 World Cup. (Well done DK! He is pushing for a spot in the T20 World Cup. His mind is occupied with the thought of the World Cup),"" Rohit was heard saying on the field while Karthik was batting.Karthik has played seven matches and six innings in the tournament so far, scoring 226 runs at an impressive strike rate of 205.45 and an average of 75.33. The 38-year-old has hit 16 fours and 18 sixes so far.As the 2024 edition of the tournament approaches, scheduled to begin on June 2 in the US and the West Indies, Karthik's name is again making the rounds, thanks to his impressive batting performance in this IPL.Karthik was a key part of the winning Indian teams in the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. He also participated in the ICC T20 World Cup in 2022 but managed to score only 14 runs in four appearances.Former India cricketer Irfan Pathan believes Karthik has been given ample opportunities, suggesting that the selectors should consider Rishabh Pant for the major tournament instead of the 38-year-old.""He is in great form. But at the same time, Indian cricket has tried Dinesh Karthik before and it didn't work for them. So they have the right guy at the moment who is in form, which is Rishabh Pant. As far as the wicketkeeping is concerned, as far as the middle order is concerned, he is amazing. I am sure selectors will be on the same page as well,"" Irfan, who is a cricket expert and commentator on Star Sports Press Room, told TimesofIndia.com.""They want to take someone like Rishabh Pant rather than thinking about Dinesh Karthik. He had his fair share of chances when it comes to playing for India. Unfortunately, in the last T20 World Cup, he didn't do that great whenever he got the opportunity. I feel Rishabh Pant is the guy we should take in that place,"" Irfan said.India will kick off their T20 World Cup campaign on June 5 against Ireland in New York.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik scored 83 off 35 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

'Mayank Yadav's body needs...': Former West Indies pacer on young LSG sensation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/mayank-yadavs-body-needs-former-west-indies-pacer-on-young-lsg-sensation/articleshow/109442981.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop has heaped praise on Lucknow Super Giants ' (LSG) emerging pace sensation, Mayank Yadav , lauding his rare combination of pace and control.Bishop emphasised the importance of managing Mayank properly through the expertise of medical professionals, strength and conditioning coaches, and nutritionists.Mayank made a stunning impact on IPL 2024 with his fiery pace during matches against Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).In these encounters, he showcased his talent by claiming six wickets and earning the 'Player of the Match' award in both games.Consistently touching speeds of 150 kmph, Mayank's exceptional control over line and length left spectators and pundits alike in awe. Although currently sidelined due to injury, his impending return has garnered anticipation from the entire cricket fraternity.Bishop acknowledged Mayank's extraordinary talent but cautioned against his injury history, emphasising the importance of managing his body and ensuring adequate strengthening to prevent future setbacks. This recognition underscores the need to nurture and safeguard the promising career of this young fast bowler.""Everybody agrees that Mayank Yadav is a special talent. It is very rare to have someone who can consistently bowl around 145 kph and go up to the mid-150s. Mayank has got something that you cannot buy: pace and control,"" said Bishop, as quoted by ESPNCricinfo in his column.""But he also has an injury history, and in this, he is not unique. We have seen several Indian fast-bowling talents break down. Rohit Sharma, I remember, had expressed his frustration about bowlers picking up injuries frequently.""""Mayank's body needs management and it needs great strengthening. How do we ensure his talent gets the chance to blossom fully?"" he concluded.Bishop said that he is a great American sports fan, in particular NBA basketball, and pointed out that in such tournaments, players invest in themselves through support staff and systems and national teams, franchises need to go the same route to preserve special talents.""I am a big American sports fan and I particularly follow the NBA, where the top players invest, or have others invest, in themselves to the tune of millions of dollars, in terms of having support staff and systems. Tennis players, too, do the same. I believe it is time for cricket to go that way - for the top franchises and national teams to preserve special talents like Mayank and support their growth,"" said Bishop.Bishop also pointed out that Australian skipper Pat Cummins , who was injury-prone as a youngster, struggled to deal with the stress of the game on his body. But over the years, he managed to build for himself an impressive career after years of working on his body and changing his technique. The former bowler said that it would be great if Mayank gets the same input that Cummins once had in his career, be it through LSG or the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).""Pat Cummins is a very good example of someone who came in as a teenager, and found that the stresses of the game were too much for his particular technique and his body. He had to come out, rehabilitate, make himself different technically, and come back a few years later. And as we've found out, Cummins has managed to build an exceptional career, where he has developed into one of the best fast bowlers and captains,"" said Bishop.""It would be a good idea for Mayank at the start of his career to have the input Cummins found he required. Whether it's Lucknow Super Giants, Mayank's IPL team, or the BCCI, they can undertake a project - not an experiment, mind you - to say, ""This guy is a diamond. Let us see if we can allocate some sort of funding and see where this goes,"" he added.Bishop said that Mayank should be given a personal strength and conditioning trainer for a year, along with some other medical and diet-related staff. In this way, Mayank will be able to give the game a ""decade of excellent fast bowling"". He also said that fast bowlers like him should have access to the ""right voices,"" like he had talks with Malcolm Marshall during the start of his career.""Mayank will still be playing cricket through this, to be clear; just that this person is attached to him. See how that pans out after a year. You have got the resources for an effort like this.Whether in the future Mayank plays a lot of red-ball cricket, whether he plays all formats, or whether you keep him as a white-ball option, you will be able to know after a year or two. So it is a worthwhile project, not only for India and LSG, but for the world game. This young kid, who is 21 now, by the time he is 23 or 24, when his body has matured, he can give you almost a decade of excellent fast bowling. That is one thing I would like to see happen.""""Alongside the physical development, it is also imperative that young fast bowlers like Mayank get to hear the right voices. I came through at a time when the great Malcolm Marshall was around. While I thought Marshall was one of the greatest tactical fast bowlers that I interacted with, I could only talk with him when we were on the field together or when we were in the dressing room together. Had I been able to access his insights more often, and while I was younger, it would have expedited my learning curve. I do not doubt that,"" he added.Bishop said that Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah should be made to interact with upcoming pace bowlers since he is a clear thinker and great communicator. He said that Bumrah could do some formal Zoom sessions with young pacers on bowling plans, preparations, variations, pace, lengths, etc.""I get a little frustrated that icons like, say, Jasprit Bumrah, are not made to interact frequently with young fast men. When we hear Bumrah speak, we know that he understands the game. He is clear in his thinking and he is a great communicator. For the next generation, the Under-19 guys, and even for those who are playing alongside him, you could organise some formal Zoom meetings and have him share his wisdom with them. Bumrah does not have to fly everywhere; just utilise technology,"" said Bishop.""Let him talk through formal bowling plans, preparation, and what he would do in certain situations. Let him talk through variations in pace and lengths, and how he sees the game. Expedite that learning curve. It does not have to be something that happens every month - half-yearly or quarter-yearly should work. And I can tell you that would not hurt anyone.""""It is like going to university, where you have guys who have been there and have done it before. MS Dhoni is a similar example. Excellent captain. If you want to bring in your next generation of leaders, why not tap into his expertise? I am not saying that these two gentlemen are the only people to talk to, but you get the drift,"" he concluded.Bishop said that he always picked up things from talking to Wasim Akram , Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding, etc., and he called them the ""university of fast bowling.""He said that Kartik Tyagi could talk to Bumrah after an IPL match for five minutes. He said that he thought that Tyagi was someone who could have pushed on, but he had injuries to deal with.""You do not have to tell a guy what to do right. But I can tell a guy what not to do because I have made the same mistake. I can tell him what to do to avoid that. We do not have to leave a lot of these things up to players finding out through trial and error.""""Let us not only leave these things to playing a lot of first-class cricket and learning as you go but let us supplement it from the outside as well. Let them play, but also let us help them with knowledge. It is time to start being a little bit more precise and determined in our development of players, especially if you have the resources for it,"" he concluded.","Former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop has heaped praise on Lucknow Super Giants'(LSG) emerging pace sensation, Mayank Yadav.

We need to keep that going. There was not much for the bowlers in the powerplay. It got better for the bowlers when the ball got softer.

Won't be surprised to see 300 breached very soon in IPL: Dinesh Karthik,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/wont-be-surprised-to-see-300-breached-very-soon-in-ipl-dinesh-karthik/articleshow/109462987.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Veteran wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik expressed confidence on Saturday that the 300-run mark will soon be surpassed in the IPL , emphasising the league's continually improving batting standards over its 17-year history.Currently, Sunrisers Hyderabad 's impressive total of 287/3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) holds the record for the highest team score in IPL history.However, the elusive 300-run milestone has been achieved only once in the history of the tournament.Karthik's assertion comes amidst an era where batting prowess has significantly evolved, leading to higher-scoring matches.He points out the remarkable instance of Nepal 's achievement, scoring 314 for three against Mongolia during the Hangzhou Asian Games last year, as a testament to the rising standards of batting in the shortest format of the game.""I think the ceiling is constantly getting reworked and they're pushing it much higher,"" Karthik said ahead of RCB's clash against the Kolkata Knight Riders in Kolkata on Sunday.""The number of 250s in the first 32 matches of the tournament has been the highest ever in the history of any tournament that's played across the world in this format.""It tells you that people are a lot more fearless, people take on the boundaries a lot more. I wouldn't be surprised if 300 is crossed very, very soon or in this year (of IPL) itself,"" he added.Karthik said the obvious reason was the impact player rule that has bolstered teams' batting.""You're batting much deeper, which puts that much more pressure on the bowlers. The freedom to keep playing shots has liberated a lot of the young boys who are out there and they're all playing some phenomenal shots.""The standard of batting if you take in the last 17 years this tournament has existed, it is unreal how well it's grown,"" added the cricketer-turned-commentator.With just one victory in seven matches, RCB find their playoff aspirations dwindling. To keep their hopes alive for a top-four finish, they now face the daunting task of winning all their remaining matches in the IPL.Karthik, however, said if their batters find form then ""sky's the limit"" for them.""The belief is definitely there. If there's no belief there is no point playing a tournament like IPL. Every year there will be a couple of teams at this stage trying to find their feet and there have been so many instances when they picked up and won matches.""We believe that if we can do something special we could get that momentum and use that to our confidence.""You need a lot of characters and players who are consistently doing well and the players who have not started doing well to find form. And when you get a few players firing then the sky's the limit for you,"" he added.RCB's string of defeats has not brought their confidence down and Karthik said they remain a close-knit unit.""The team is very closely knit as a unit. I think that's something that Andy Flower and Faf Du Plessis have tried really hard.""The best part about it is that Virat is such a good leader that he's doing all that he can to propel the team, keep it in good spirits, be it having a laugh and a joke or be it to speak to players and try and get their mood up a little bit.""We're trying our best, it's something that we can definitely tell and I think all our fans who are watching are aware that we're doing everything we can. That's the sport, not everything goes in your way always,"" he said.",Dinesh Karthik says the 300-run mark will soon be surpassed in the IPL.

But the defenders, on both sides, looked to have brought a little more of it on the pitch as they denied attacks to be reflected on the scoreline.While Odisha ended up with better possession in the first half, the only shot on goal came from Blasters’ Hormipam Ruivah in the 22nd minute when he headed a superb cross from Freddy Lallawmawma straight into the hands of Amrinder Singh in Odisha goal.Odisha once again relied on their talisman Ahmed Jahouh to keep creating moves from deep but all those attacks were foiled by the Marko Leskovic and Milos Drincic-led Kerala defence inside the D. The story was being played in the same vein at the other end too, with both teams missing that final touch or shot in the final third in search of a breakthrough.The highlight of the opening 45 minutes was the drama that followed Mourtada Fall sending in the ball with a casual back heel on connecting with a Jahouh cross from the left of the box. While it was first given a goal by the referee, after consultation with the linesman and vehement protests from Blasters, the decision was overturned with Jahouh and Fall both found to be offside.Despite some desperate attempts from both teams to change the scoreline, they left the field for the break with the first knockout of the playoff stage goalless.Jahouh kept sending in measured crosses into the centre and the flank after the change of ends as Amey Ranawade and Jerry Mawihmingthanga kept attempting to make a goal out of them. But Blasters soon took charge of the game with a barrage of attacks near the Odisha goal.Mohammed Aimen and Saurav Mandal displayed the youthful vigour that Ivan Vukomanovic’s team rode this season but it was Fedor Cernych who broke the deadlock in the 67th minute. Aimen sent a pass to the Lithuanian after a delicate first touch as Cernych made no mistake in finding the corner of the net to the right of Amrinder.It was a well-deserved goal for the visitors but they could only maintain the lead for 20 minutes.With Blasters’ injured custodian Lara Sharma taken off field in a stretcher and replaced by Karanjit Sharma, Odisha took advantage of the lapse in focus of the opposition defence as Diego Mauricio scored his 11th goal of the season. He turned in a delectable cross from the right from current top scorer Roy Krishna and brought the home team back in the game and took it into extra time.And it was a replay of the equaliser in the seventh minute of extra time with Jahouh, once again, the conductor of the move. The Moroccan sent an inch-perfect long ball to Krishna on the right of the box and Isak only had to tap it in past Karanjit to break Blasters’ hearts.",Isak Vanlalruatfela's extra-time winner earns Odisha FC a place in the two- legged semifinal against Mohun Bagan Super Giants.

'Mbappe arrival will make Real Madrid complete',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/mbappe-arrival-will-make-real-madrid-complete/articleshow/109452804.cms,"PANAJI: Julio Baptista was part of the famed Real Madrid squads of the 2000s era that had Galacticos or superstars jostling for the world’s attention. The Brazilian forward shared the dressing room with the likes of Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Raul. It perhaps proved too intimidating when he joined from Sevilla FC, as a season later he was loaned to Arsenal.On his return to Los Blancos, though, he scored the winner against Barcelona in El Clasico and helped his side win the 2007-08 league title.“I have been fortunate to be part of great teams and they’ve been important moments in my career,” Baptista told TOI during a global media interaction arranged by LaLiga . “There cannot be a comparison between the Galacticos and the current team. I feel that being at Madrid drives players (forward) since the (media) impact is so huge. It’s something that you may not have with other teams.”Real Madrid president Florentino Perez abandoned his ‘Galactico’ transfer policy to build sustainable teams but could break the bank to complete the transfer of Kylian Mbappe , who has been one of the best players on the planet for a number of years now.Should, as highly-expected, the transfer go through next season, Baptista feels Madrid will become even more stronger.“If a player of Mbappe’s level comes to Real Madrid, it will make this team even more dangerous. It will give them a broader range (of attacking options), make them complete and help breach that gap in attack,” said Baptista, referring to the exits of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema that have left a void upfront.Madrid have won LaLiga twice in the last four years and the UEFA Champions League five times in a hugely-successful decade. This season, there could be more. They are now in the semifinals of the Champions League and can have at least one hand on the LaLiga crown should they put it across Barcelona in El Clasico on Sunday.With seven games left to be played, Madrid enjoy an eight-point lead over Barcelona at the top of the table.“Any team can win, but I think Real Madrid have the advantage in terms of mental strength. The mental factor plays an important role in games like the Clasico and Barcelona’s Champions League exit will hurt. Madrid players are euphoric after making it to the semis,” said Baptista.Barcelona’s adventure in the Champions League came to a painful end at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), who overhauled the Catalans’ two-goal lead in the tie. Madrid, on the other hand, fought hard to stave off the challenge of Manchester City on penalties.“It hurts to exit the Champions League and see that your rivals have progressed and playing against the best teams in the world,” said Baptista. “Let’s see how Barca players feel when they come to Madrid. (Carlo) Ancelotti will have to make changes because the players put in a huge physical effort (against City) but they will still have a competitive team with players who can make the difference on their own.""","Julio Baptista was part of the famed Real Madrid squads of the 2000s era.

Emiliano Martinez's antics work as Aston Villa beat Lille to make Europa Conference League semi-final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/emiliano-martinezs-antics-work-as-aston-villa-beat-lille-to-make-europa-league-semi-final/articleshow/109417364.cms,"(Inputs from Reuters)

NEW DELHI: Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez emerged as the hero, guiding his team to the semi-finals through a dramatic penalty shootout victory over French club Lille in a thrilling Europa Conference League quarter-final second-leg encounter.The match itself was a rollercoaster ride, ending 3-3 on aggregate after Lille's 2-1 win on the night.However, the real drama unfolded during the penalty shootout, where Martinez found himself at the center of attention.Martinez, known for his antics and mind games, saved two crucial penalties, showcasing his exceptional goalkeeping skills. However, his persistent reactions towards the French fans led to a bizarre incident where he was initially shown a second yellow card, seemingly resulting in a red card and subsequent dismissal.Remarkably, Martinez was reprieved due to a rule that states yellow cards awarded during regular time are not carried forward to penalty shootouts. This allowed him to continue his heroics, ultimately proving instrumental in Villa's 4-3 shootout triumph.Aston Villa manager Unai Emery praised Martinez's mentality and leadership, acknowledging his importance to the team both on and off the pitch. Emery expressed pride in his goalkeeper's performance and the team's overall achievement.""He is very important for us. He has his personality and his personality in the dressing room is very important because he is a leader with his experiences,"" Emery said of his keeper.""He has a really brilliant mentality. And then on the pitch he has his personality and he played fantastic. He saved two penalty shots so of course I am very proud of him. I am very proud of all the players.""Villa's victory marked a significant milestone, as they became the first English team to reach a European semi-final since 1982. Additionally, they are now the sole remaining English representative in European competitions this season, following the exits of Liverpool and West Ham United from the Europa League.",Aston Villa beat Lille 4-3 on penalties in Europa League quarter-final second- leg.

ISL: Odisha plot a KO punch on Blasters at Kalinga,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-odisha-plot-a-ko-punch-on-blasters-at-kalinga/articleshow/109409898.cms,"KOLKATA: With the all-important League Shield finally grabbed by Mohun Bagan Super Giants following their dramatic 2-1 win over defending champions and leaders Mumbai City FC in the last league match this Monday, Indian Super League ( ISL ) enters the knockout stage on Friday with the one-legged playoff involving the two sides who were in the lead at different stages of the season.With three losses and a win and a draw each in their last five ISL outings, hosts Odisha FC and Kerala Blasters FC will vie to keep their championship hopes alive when they face off at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Friday.Odisha, fighting for the Shield till a few weeks ago, ended up fourth on the standings due to a sudden loss of form towards the end of league stage. Blasters, on the other hand, drifted away from the top spot gradually and finished fifth on the table despite having a great start. Inconsistency, coupled with injuries to important players at crucial juncture, have plagued the Blasters' performance.However, despite their recent poor form, Sergio Lobera's Odisha will start the first playoff as favourites simply because of their enviable home record this season. The Juggernauts have rolled on undefeated on home turf, having collected 27 points from 11 matches, with eight wins and three draws. And on Friday, they will be eager to notch their ninth win at home this season for a place in two-legged semis against the Mariners. Lobera will have a full-strength squad at his disposal for landing a knockout punch on their rivals in the do-or-die game.Asked about missing out on the Shield, Lobera said on Thursday, ""We need to finish the season to do a very good analysis. I am very proud of my players. We competed against the strongest teams in India and reached the final in Kalinga Super Cup.""In terms of the Shield, we did an amazing season. We competed till the end in a very good way. We need to focus on tomorrow's (Friday) game against Kerala Blasters and show we're ready to compete. There are no problems. We are competing against another team with the same targets. Hopefully, we can reach the semifinals and show everyone we are ready to compete against every team and in every competition,” the Spaniard added ahead of the game.Asked about having any advantage over the Blasters, whom they defeated in the last meeting at home, the gaffer said, ""The past is not helpful for the playoffs. We need to forget what happened before and focus on tomorrow's game. The team who is smarter, especially during bad moments, has more options to win. The message to the players is to enjoy this moment.""Blasters defender Naocha Singh Huidrom is unavailable for the clash as the 24-year-old was handed a three-match suspension by the All India Football Federation disciplinary committee for a headbutt incident during the game against East Bengal FC earlier this month.Asked about their preparations for the game, Blasters head coach Ivan Vukomanovic said, ""During the season we had to completely change the squad due to issues such as surgeries to key players and other uncontrollable factors. But after the season (league stage) the mentality is completely different in the knockouts, as you don't have to plan for the long term here.""",Odisha FC and Kerala Blasters FC will vie to keep their championship hopes alive when they face off at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Friday.

How could six teams from Bundesliga qualify for UEFA Champions League 2024/25 season?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/champions-league/top-stories/how-could-six-teams-from-bundesliga-qualify-for-uefa-champions-league-2024/25-season/articleshow/109400678.cms,"(Inputs from AP)

NEW DELHI: Bundesliga , Germany's top-flight football league, has found itself in a complex situation for determining the teams that qualify for European competitions, particularly the prestigious Champions League . The number of qualifying spots can vary depending on the performance of German teams in the current season's European competitions.Traditionally, the top four teams in the Bundesliga qualify for the Champions League.However, due to the revamped format of the Champions League, which will expand from 32 to 36 teams starting next season, Germany could potentially have five or even six teams in the competition.Two additional Champions League spots will be awarded to the leagues whose teams perform best in European competitions this season. Based on current standings, these spots are likely to go to Italy and Germany, whose teams have performed well in the Champions League and Europa League .The situation becomes even more complex when considering the potential scenarios involving teams like Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, who have reached the Champions League semifinals. If Dortmund were to win the Champions League but finish fifth in the Bundesliga, they would automatically qualify as the defending champions, and Germany would receive a sixth Champions League spot.The battle for European qualification in the Bundesliga is a moving target, with teams like RB Leipzig, Eintracht Frankfurt, and SC Freiburg vying for positions that could secure them a place in the Champions League, Europa League, or Europa Conference League. Even teams like Augsburg, currently seventh, could potentially qualify for the Champions League, depending on the outcomes of various matches and competitions.The Europa League and Europa Conference League qualifications are equally uncertain, as they depend on the results of the German Cup final and the final positions in the Bundesliga table. Remarkably, even second-division club Kaiserslautern could qualify for the Europa League if they manage to win the German Cup against Bayer Leverkusen While the top and bottom of the Bundesliga table provide some clarity, with Leverkusen already crowned champions and Darmstadt facing relegation, the battle for European qualification remains a complex and ever-changing scenario that will likely continue until the final weeks of the season and even after the Bundesliga campaign concludes on May 18.The uncertainty surrounding European qualification in the Bundesliga highlights the competitiveness and unpredictability of the league, as well as the impact of the revamped Champions League format on the qualification process. Teams and fans alike will have to remain patient and adaptable as the final standings and European qualifiers are determined in the coming weeks.","Germany's top-flight football league has found itself in a complex situation for determining the teams that qualify for European competitions.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one and two-time Grand Slam champion Garbine Muguruza announced her retirement from tennis on Saturday, following a hiatus of over a year without competing.Speaking at a press conference during the Laureus Awards, the 30-year-old reflected on her illustrious career, stating, ""The time has come to say goodbye. It has been a long and beautiful journey, but I feel that the moment to retire has arrived.""Muguruza's decision marks the end of a remarkable tenure in professional tennis, during which she achieved significant milestones and left an indelible mark on the sport.""It's a decision that I've been taking little by little.""Muguruza's last official match was at the Lyon Open in January 2023, marking her temporary departure from the sport. Following this event, she refrained from competing, leading to her eventual retirement announcement.""When I stopped competing, I returned home and I welcomed the break with open arms,"" said Muguruza who ends her career with 10 singles titles.""Every day that went by I felt better and I didn't miss the discipline and the difficulty of the life I had before, so it has been a progressive thing.""Muguruza's WTA main-draw debut occurred in 2012, marking the beginning of her professional journey. Her breakthrough on the Grand Slam stage came in 2015 when she reached her first final at Wimbledon , where she faced Serena Williams but was unable to clinch the title.However, she swiftly bounced back, securing her maiden Grand Slam victory at the French Open in 2016 by defeating Serena Williams. The following year, Muguruza continued her success by triumphing over Venus Williams to claim the Wimbledon title.These victories solidified her place in tennis history, as her French Open win made her the first Spanish woman to win a Grand Slam since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998, while her Wimbledon triumph made her the first Spanish female champion at the All England Club since Conchita Martinez in 1994.Martinez's influence played a significant role in Muguruza's success, as she coached her to the Wimbledon title. In a fitting turn of events, just two months after her Wimbledon triumph, Muguruza ascended to the number one ranking in the world, cementing her status as one of tennis's elite players.",Garbine Muguruza announces her retirement from tennis on Saturday.

I think after winning the first (singles) match against New Zealand, we should have won the tie,"" said AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar on Thursday.India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week.Winning the tie would have placed the team second in final standings, thereby securing them a spot in the Playoffs in November.""We are remaining in Group 1, but I was expecting to qualify,"" said Dhupar but then switched to highlighting the association's efforts in hosting tournaments through the season to help players gain ranking points.""The association has done everything. The girls have had the opportunity to get a lot of points, and we had organised a camp in China.""And they were all playing well. Ankita had just won a tournament (in doubles) in Japan just the week before.""Dhupar, however, brushed aside the questionable team combinations fielded by the captain and the coach.After entering Sahaja Yamalapalli in singles and pairing Rutuja Bhosale with Prarthana Thombare against the strong Chinese team, the team's think-tank opted to put Rutuja in singles and hand Ankita the additional duty of doubles for the remaining three ties.It proved to be disastrous as it left Ankita with little time to recover with only a 30-minute gap between second singles and the decisive doubles matches. Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective. ""If I were the coach or the captain, and if I find my No. 1 player not performing, I would put my No. 3 or any other player in,"" Bal, a former Davis Cup player, said.""Try something different, think out of the box. It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players. The captain, the coach and the support staff are appointed by the executive committee of the AITA,"" he said.Both captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule did not respond to request for a comment.",India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week.

Despite his sloppiness Ruud still took the set.The third seed looked to have sealed the match when he broke his French journeyman opponent in the third game of the second set.However, the world number six gave up four break points while serving for the match to allow 27-year-old Muller back in at 5-4.Ruud, though, was more clinical in the next game, breaking Muller to progress with his 25th victory in 2024 and will face Jordan Thompson in the next round.""This year is much better than last year, I'm having a good year,"" said Ruud, who defeated world number one Novak Djokovic last week.Monte Carlo Masters winner Stefanos Tsitsipas dispatched Sebastian Ofner in straight sets with a 6-4, 7-5 victory.(With AFP inputs)","Rafael Nadal says he will give his all at the upcoming French Open.
