Jaspal Rana

tell TOI what it took to win a double

Olympic Bronze

in

Paris

...

Excerpts from an interaction...

What are your thoughts now looking at the coverage of your medal wins?

Manu:

When you're shooting, do you ever think of something like this happening when you get back home?

Manu:

Jaspal, what did you tell her about your days as a shooter when you were hero worshipped after the

Asian Games

?

Jaspal:

Manu, we read somewhere that you have Maya Angelou's 'And Still I Rise' tattooed…

Manu:

How did it occur to you to get that done?

Manu:

What is the single biggest lesson that you learnt in Paris and what will it take to take you to gold in LA 2028?

Manu:

You may have read about what Prakash Padukone has said about athletes underachieving, there's been some controversy…

Jaspal:

After getting your medal, you were quoting the Gita. We believe you also read Mark Manson's 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck'…

Manu:

Are you a passionate reader?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Manu (interrupts):

Does music help you focus?

Manu:

So, sad songs for sad moments?

Manu:

How long do these feelings stay with you?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Can you tell us about your emotions in all the three events in the Olympics?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Shooting is not considered as a physical sport. How much emphasis do you put in physical fitness?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Manu:

What do you take from the Vinesh Phogat's journey - coming from protests to this winning position in the Olympics?

Manu:

Why didn't sportspeople stand up for them when they were protesting?

Manu:

With your progress what changes do you see in your native Haryana now?

Manu:

In the old days, the coach used to be like a command-and-control person. But now, it's a lot more give-and-take between the coach and the athlete…

Jaspal:

Manu:

We saw Turkish shooter

Yusuf Dikec

who shot without any gear on...

Jaspal:

Did you look at the memes on Dikec?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Manu:

Earlier, shooting was a very quiet sport. After rule changes, even loud music is played when shooters are in action. How do you adjust?

Manu:

In a sport where margins are so thin, how do you champions get themselves in the zone on the day that matters, especially on the Olympic stage?

Manu:

Do you have any techniques for honing the mental side of your game? Are these training methods secret?

Jaspal:

What do you do for mind training?

Manu:

India won a lot of bronze this time. To win silver, it's said you have to lose the gold, but for a bronze, you have to fight for the medal separately …

Manu:

At the Olympics, there was very little difference between bronze and a silver…

Manu:

What will you do to get gold in LA?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Manu:

Is the Tokyo chapter closed?

Manu:

Jaspal:

Do you see yourself shooting 10-15 years from now?

Manu:

Jaspal:

In Paris we had a 21-member contingent. What's your assessment about our performance?

Jaspal:

When you're saying protect a talent… what exactly do you mean?

Do you have Taylor Swift on your current playlist?

Manu:

What is your physical routine like?

Manu:

What have you been eating since returning from Paris?

Jaspal:

Manu:

Jaspal:

What do you crave for?

Manu:

Abhi tak toh ghar gayi nahi hu. Mummy ke hath ka khana nahi khaya hai maine

Abhi jaate hi I will be like ki give me a aalo ka parantha

'VOWED THAT MY DAUGHTER WOULD MAKE HISTORY'

""No, no, wait, wait."" Manu Bhaker stops Jaspal Rana in mid-sentence. It is normal, the interruption. No one minds really. If anything, it sums up best the relationship between the two, oscillating between the once ugly - after the debacle in Tokyo three years ago - to the good-natured banter that marked the double bronze high of Paris this past fortnight.Jaspal is, if you like, the Bela Karolyi to Manu's Nadia Comaneci. Sometimes father figure, most times back-slapping pal, full-time coach. Yet, this time when Manu interrupts him, she has something to say that is her own mind, not just a coaching mantra, however well-meant.Manu Bhaker didn't need to pick up a gun. Her easy, natural charm is disarming enough. Because when she talks, we are literally eating out of her hand, hanging on to every word, eager to find some elbow room in their private jokes. But with this interruption, Manu Bhaker, is thoughtful, perceptive, telling us how picking up the gun can bring about change in patriarchal and conservative mindsets in native Haryana, and much of India.""I think one event can bring about some change, but if you want to see bigger change, it has to be persistent,"" said the double Olympic bronze winner, somewhere fully aware that her own life has changed with that one last pull of the hair-trigger at the Chateauroux Shooting Centre, some 300km south of Paris, where they fed a goat tethered nearby each day back from the range, just to beat off boredom.""It takes a lot of time to see significant changes in society. Although we have seen over a period of time how India has changed, we need something to be very persistent in the society and only then we'll be able to see significant changes,"" she held forth, as everyone in the crowded hall nodded.Manu Bhaker didn't need to pick up a gun. But now that she has, we, a nation, are eternally thankful.I did not get to see the newspapers at all. But this is so heartwarming. It feels so good. I mean almost the entire page is dedicated to me. Thank you so much for this.When we are in the field of play, it's all about nervousness. So, performance was good although silver was possible. The journey from Tokyo to here has been full of ups and downs. Training and preparation were very good but there was a lot of nervousness on match day.She doesn't know anything about my days. This generation is ahead in terms of information and technology. They are way ahead of the 1990s and 2000s. Now everything is on the computer.I know (blushes). I didn't know whose it was, but now it's mine. I got it in Jan 2022. Now, only when people tell me that I have the tattoo, then I'm like, 'Oh, I have that tattoo!'After Tokyo Olympics, I was trying to move on, but it was getting difficult with each passing day. So, I was like, 'You know what? I'll get a tattoo'. The tattoo reminded me that I had to move on. I really love this tattoo and whenever people remind me of it, it just clicks in my head.Tokyo indeed taught me many things. Other than luck, I think it's just that how you build yourself during the training days, how you train, in what conditions you are able to sustain yourself. Of course, how you are as a human being also matters a lot. Olympics is about the day.There will always be controversy. It's about how you think. We also had a lot of difficulties. We also have a lot of problems, but we did not bypass them. We went through it. I knew that I would not be allowed in the Olympics to sit behind her. So, we started training for it. In all the trials, I was sitting at the back. Sometimes the problem makes you stronger.I think that was a long time back.I do have books with me. I always have something or the other to read. We are not allowed to carry phones. During flights and traveling, if I'm not sleeping, then I'll probably read or eat. So that's that. I really like Usain Bolt's book ('Faster Than Lightning'). But during the Olympics, we had a hectic training programme. It was like if you gave me 10 minutes, I would have probably fallen asleep.We went to meet the ambassador, and she got the Gita from there also. I think maybe some limited edition.He was talking about the book, and he was like, this is such a good book. I was like, 'are you gifting it to me?' Books will always be with me. And I mean flowers will last for hours or 2-3 days. But books always stay.Yes, I am a big music listener. Even if I'm driving, I need music. Otherwise, I won't be able to drive with patience. Same goes with the sports. Music calms me down.It depends how I want to feel. Sometimes I play emotional music and sad music like 'Maula mere lele meri jaan.' If I want to feel sad, then I'll feel sad and play sad music.If I feel sad about something, I will solve it. I will cry over it, I will solve it and then I'll put it in the past. I do not like to carry it with me for future events or in daily life.There's no time for this. Like the first medal, there were too many interviews and all. Next morning she had to be on the range by 7.I think this time around we put in equal amount of effort in all three events. We were training for 10m, we were training for mixed doubles, and training for 25m equally well. The workouts, the meditation and everything. I was always aware that I'll be shooting in three events.If you see her scores, I'm happier with the third event (25 metre pistol where she missed the bronze). It's about the day, the day decides.I'll give you an example. If you are writing an exam, you have to be very well prepared and you have to manage the time also. You practice that. And it's like you have to practice to be able to stand for a longer period of time. You have to practice to sustain for a longer period of time. Because in a sport such as shooting, we do not have major injuries, but we do have minor injuries. And minor injuries can affect your career badly. There was a scapula injury I was struggling with last year. And then we have elbow, knees, lower back injuries. We also have neck injuries. To maintain our posture and to be able to deliver for a longer period of time, you have to be fit.You need more strength to stand in one place for two hours than walking for two hours. They need to stand still till the last shot. So, you can imagine the kind of fitness they need.Physical health also affects your mental health. And I really believe that if you're physically fit, you will probably be more confident and feel mentally more stable.She has been a fighter. She had to struggle with many things. And even despite her previous journeys in the Olympics, she did not give up. She is not a kind of person who will give up on anything. I do not know the technicalities of those situations, the protests and the current situation. I do not know the deeper version of it. But to me, I have huge respect for her. She's been like an elder sister to me. It's the spirit that she carries that 'I'll fight, I'll fight till the end'. I go by that.I think many people did stand up. It also depends on person to person if they want to be engaged in something. We have back-to-back competitions and there's something happening in our lives also. I do not have phones with me. I do not carry anything. I do not get time to read newspapers and all. If something is going on, I'll be the last person to know.Earlier, sports was a kind of taboo, but I see that changing. Many parents are supportive of their daughters and their careers. But we have a long way to go. We cannot be like, 'Okay, one, two, three… parents are allowing their girls, and we have made a change.' Yes, there is a change, but we need to go even further.It's completely what she wants, and I have to mould myself around that - the training, the technique she has. It's her technique. I just work around her technique. Even my shopping style has changed because of her shopping. I spend more time in the ladies' section because she stays in the gent's floor for about five minutes. We need to protect them; we need to take care of a lot of things.(Laughs) What will I do in the gents section?It's a matter of practice. I shot 10-15 years without gear. But when you want to get better, you need these (equipment). Manu never used shooting glasses but I forced her to do it. We try to get the best technology because you are up against the best players. Every now and then somebody comes up and shoots without anything and becomes a winner and goes home a hero. But the point is when you fight, you need to be prepared.I'm aware. There were comparisons between the Korean shooter and the Turkish shooter, but that's how it is. The Turkish shooter is a natural. He is 52 and has had a long career. Every person has a style of shooting. Some people use caps, some use glasses, some earphones. Some use everything, some nothing. It's just a matter of how you get used to equipment. Earlier, like 30 years back, I don't know if shooters had access to this kind of technology.In 25m, they shoot with firearms, and gunpowder comes out. So, fire protection is required. You need to have earmuffs because after 50 you don't want to go deaf. We need every little protection provided.Plus 10m (air pistol event) doesn't require much protection.We have practiced every situation in training, everything that can happen during our matches. The atmosphere is different everywhere. During the trials before Paris, it was very quiet. We had no music. In international tournaments, sometimes the music is so loud or totally quiet.It's all in the mind. Your training talks during high-pressure situations. You have to work for it. Two months before the Olympics, we started training at exactly the same time of the qualification stage, the finals.It's not secret. If you are not able to see what people are doing, then it's a secret. Just like in journalism, you have to keep your eyes open.I read the (Bhagavad) Gita, usually. My physical fitness definitely helps me to be on my toes as well as be mentally fit. If anything bothers me, I talk to my mom, my dad, my brother. Even to (Jaspal) sir. I write journals. Meditate before bedtime. I read Gita before sleeping, it just stays with me. I have been reading the Gita since the last 7-8 years. Before that, my mother used to teach me, guide me, and keep mentioning the shlokas. For me, the ultimate one is focusing on your karma, not to think about the outcome.Yes, I've seen people not being happy with silver. But with a bronze they are kind of happy because they fought and they won. In the mixed team event, me and my partner Sarabjot actually fought for the medal. But yes, gold is gold, nothing like it.(Laughs) Yes, I see the headline here 'Manu misses silver' and then the report states 'Manu shot at 10.3, scored a 10.5'. So, there are very minor margins to win or to lose. In our sport, it's not him versus me or her versus me, it's more like how you as an individual are doing. That counts. Both medals are equally important. The second one was either you win third position or you lose. The first match was like, you have an opportunity to win the gold too. My scores were very good; however, I missed the silver by 0.1, the gold was also missed.It will be different, there will be the weight of expectation.That's fine. That's natural because that's what we train for. So, we will give our best and do better than this time.We have to push a little harder. With more pressure, there should be more effort. Experiment-wise, though, I don't think too much experimentation will succeed.The Tokyo chapter is an experience and will always be there with me. The experience will be there.What happened in Tokyo? (laughs)Yes, absolutely.Even I can, I will be 53, 52 (like Dikec) during the next Olympics.All of them shot brilliantly. If you see the skeet event, mixed team, Arjun Babuta, Sarabjot - all reached the final. So, we have several talented shooters. It's only about protecting them. How do we protect them? I think the authorities have to work on it… SAI, the federation, government, TOPS, everybody has to start working on it. Protecting a talent is a task.There will be a lean time for every sportsperson. It's during that time that you need to look after them. There is no talent protection in our country. Saurabh Chaudhary, you remember the name? What was Saurabh Chaudhary 's score in Tokyo? He was outstanding in Tokyo, just didn't win a medal. What did we do to protect him? Nothing.I mean, few songs of hers, yes, but it's like more like Karan Aujla, Diljit Dosanjh, Arijit Singh for me. And then the 1990s (looking at Jaspal).I take around like 2 hours in the gym every day. Every day, like five times a week. Or if my matches are going on, I'll work out every day. And the workout would be like, depending on the matches and all. So I will do my warm-up, then I'll do my rehab. Rehab for all the muscles and everything for injury prevention. Then I'll strengthen those small muscles for long-term injury prevention. And then I'll do the strengthening and then the cool down.She gave up the sugar two days back.Kal hi ice-cream khayi thi (I had ice-cream yesterday), samosas and all.But she's honest that way, that she doesn't cheat on exercise, training, eating and all.(I haven't been home yet, haven't eaten meals cooked by my mummy).""I always asked God for a daughter, and I vowed that if I had one, I would ensure she would do something that would go down in history,"" Manu's mother, Sumedha Bhaker told TOI. Manu's father, Ram Kishan, recounted that Manu was always a natural sportsperson. ""One day she'd be boxing, one day she'd be into karate. She used to be playing something or the other all the time."" Was it difficult to encourage their daughter's sporting interests in a conservative environment, TOI asked.""When Manu was still very young, I did the karva chauth fast. That day, I made my husband put his hand on my head and swear that he would let me move to a city with the children if we needed to. Whenever I did a fast, as a gift I always asked for something that would help the children,"" said Sumedha. ""I was determined to fulfill my vow.""She certainly did, and India owes her a debt of gratitude.","Manu Bhaker and coach Jaspal Rana tell TOI what it took to win a double. Bhaker: ""Shooting is not considered as a physical sport. How much emphasis do you put in physical fitness?"" Rana: ""It's a lot more give-and-take between the coach and the athlete""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112580375,imgsize-193600,width-400,resizemode-4/112580375.jpg"

So was my fate,"" she wrote, referring to the work she did with her team before the second day weigh-in.""To my team, my fellow Indians and my family, it feels like: the goal that we were working towards and what we had planned to achieve is unfinished, that something might always remain missing, and that things might never be the same again.""Maybe under different circumstances, I could see myself playing till 2032, because the fight in me and wrestling in me will always be there. I can't predict what the future holds for me, and what awaits me in this journey next, but I am sure that I will continue to fight always for what I believe in and for the right thing,"" she wrote.Vinesh's disqualification came after she was found to be 100 grams overweight during the second weigh-in on the morning of her gold-medal match.Her appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to overturn the disqualification and her request for a shared silver medal were both dismissed.The decision left Vinesh disheartened, prompting her to announce her retirement from the sport, stating that she no longer had the strength to continue.The Indian Olympic Association ( IOA ), led by President PT Usha, expressed ""shock and disappointment"" at the CAS decision, calling it a significant blow to Vinesh and the larger sporting community.The IOA criticized the stringent regulations that led to Vinesh's disqualification, arguing that they failed to account for the physiological and psychological pressures athletes endure, particularly female athletes.Despite the setback, the IOA remains committed to supporting Vinesh, exploring further legal avenues to ensure her case receives the attention it deserves.As Vinesh returns home from Paris, her future in wrestling remains uncertain, but her resolve to fight for justice and fairness in sports is unwavering.",Vinesh Phogat says she could have continued her wrestling career until 2032.

Manchester United beat Fulham in Premier League opener,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/manchester-united-beat-fulham-in-premier-league-opener/articleshow/112579456.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Premier League season began on Friday, and Joshua Zirkzee made his debut as a Manchester United hero by winning the game late to help the team defeat Fulham 1-0.Zirkzee, who cost £36.5 million ($47 million) to sign from Bologna last month, was not fit for the game and only appeared for the last 30 minutes, as per AFP.The Dutch international's header of Alejandro Garnacho's cross on minute 87 spared the Red Devils from a miserable evening at Old Trafford in Manchester.""To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn't be better,"" said Zirkzee.""I've been told (scoring at the Stretford End) is one of the best feelings at Manchester United. I'm so thankful and blessed I could experience it in my first game. It's an amazing feeling.""Thanks to his FA Cup victory, United manager Erik ten Hag made it through the conclusion of the previous season despite placing seventh in the Premier League.After a performance that hauntingly reminded of many of the games from last season, it remains to be seen if that shocking victory over rivals and English champions Manchester City in May maybe a springboard.""I have seen many spaces where we have to improve but that is normal,"" said Ten Hag. ""It (the win) is good to strengthen the belief.""With important players out due to injury or lack of match fitness, the Dutchman said the night before the game that his team was ""not ready"" for the new season, and it showed.In Rasmus Hojlund 's absence, Bruno Fernandes began as a center forward, and Zirkzee, who returned to preseason late after Euro 2024, was on the bench.This week, Noussair Mazraoui , who joined from Bayern Munich, was thrust into the starting lineup at left back.Even though it seemed if Ten Hag and the winger had made up, Jadon Sancho was left out of the starting lineup.During a disastrous season for United, Fulham defeated them at Old Trafford in February of last year for the first time in 20 years.In the first twenty minutes, the visitors seemed unfazed as Andre Onana did a good job of keeping Kenny Tete's dipping attempt from finding the top corner.However, United steadied themselves after a sluggish start.Mason Mount had not scored a goal since leaving Chelsea just over a year ago, but twice Fernandes blew excellent opportunities by shooting too near to Bernd Leno. This time, the German goalkeeper stretched himself superbly to deny Mason Mount a rare goal.""We created a lot of chances and we should have scored earlier,"" added Ten Hag. ""That is the only criticism of the team: kill in the box!""Seeking a winner, Ten Hag looked to Garnacho and Zirkzee, who were sitting on the bench.By doing so, Fulham had the opportunity to win another historic three points at the Theatre of Dreams, and United left themselves vulnerable.Alex Iwobi lost the opportunity to run clean through on goal due to Andreas Pereira's shoddy pass.Shortly after, Lisandro Martinez prevented a goal from being scored by clearing a risky low cross from Pereira.Rather, the home team took home all three points.Zirkzee was able to get a toe on Garnacho's poorly-hit ball from the right to deflect it past Leno and into the far corner.After Marcus Rashford's selfless ball, Garnacho had an open goal to aim at in stoppage time, and United should have had a second.However, United managed to hold on and give Ten Hag the much-needed winning start.",Manchester United beat Fulham 1-0 in their Premier League opener on Friday. Joshua Zirkzee scored the only goal of the game in the 87th minute. The Dutch international cost United $47 million from Bologna. United manager Erik ten Hag said his team was not ready for the new season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112579453,imgsize-64748,width-400,resizemode-4/112579453.jpg"

""I couldn't play.""I don't know what happened. Honestly, I couldn't, I couldn't control myself. I couldn't be better. It was impossible to win, and that's all.""The Spaniard added: ""I came here thinking I'm going to feel good. I'm going to put in a good tennis, because I know how to play on this court.""Alcaraz claimed that this match was the first time he had ever broken a racquet out of rage.The 2023 Cincinnati runner-up and current ATP number three is without a hardcourt victory going into next Monday's US Open, having only played one second-round summer cement match thus far.""It's really difficult to find some goodstuffs from this match -- I want to forget it and try to move on to New York,"" he said.""I'll try to practice well, to get used to those courts. And I will forget this match.""As the disgruntled number two seed was furious with his performance and would sometimes yell at his group, world number one Jannik Sinner quietly celebrated turning twenty-three, with a walkover as a gift from fate.Due to a rib injury, the Australian opponent Jordan Thompson withdrew prior to their match, allowing the Italian to proceed through to the quarterfinals with ease.The quarterfinal match that Sinner lost to Andrey Rublev in Canada last week will be rematched. After a rain-shortened encounter, the Russian defeated Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (7/5), 6-1.Alexander Zverev , the fifth seed, defeated Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain 7-5, 7-6 (8/6), advancing him to the round of eight.Felix Auger-Aliassime defeated seventh seed Casper Ruud 6-3, 6-1 in 68 minutes, extending the Norwegian's bad run of play. The Canadian hit 14 aces in the victory.Iga Swiatek , the top-seeded woman, easily defeated Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 6-2 to advance to the quarterfinals for the second time this season.The Pole is currently 3-0 in the rivalry without dropping a set after backing up her victory against the Ukrainian at Indian Wells in March of last year.Swiatek entered the court without following her customary warm-up regimen due to the rainy morning, but she appeared unaffected.After having to battle through three sets to defeat Varvara Gracheva in the previous round, Swiatek was able to wrap up the match with ease.In thirty-one minutes, Swiatek won the first set, and she breezed through the second.""I'm happy that I kept my intensity, in the first match, it got a little bit down,"" Swiatek said. ""But I was ready in every game.""I'm happy I was solid. I was disciplined with all the things that I wanted to take care of.""The number one added: ""I don't really care what my result is going to be here, just trying to do the work.""In her fourth quarterfinal at Cincinnati, third seed and three-time semifinalist Aryna Sabalenka defeated Monfils's wife, Elina Svitolina, 7-5, 6-2.The sixth seed Jessica Pegula defeated 2023 runner-up Karolina Muchova 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 in a postponed second-round match.Mother of two Caroline Wozniacki lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 7-5, 6-4 while continuing her WTA comeback attempt.Magdalena Frech of Poland lost to Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen 6-1, 7-5.

Internal turmoil hits IPL franchise Punjab Kings as Preity Zinta files appeal against stake sale: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/internal-turmoil-hits-ipl-franchise-punjab-kings-as-preity-zinta-files-appeal-against-stake-sale/articleshow/112573919.cms,"NEW DELHI: IPL franchise Punjab Kings franchise is facing internal turmoil as a dispute among its owners has reached the Chandigarh High Court.According to a Cricbuzz report, actress and co-owner Preity Zinta has filed a legal appeal seeking to prevent fellow owner Mohit Burman from selling a portion of his franchise shares.Zinta, who holds a 23% stake in the franchise through KPH Dream Cricket Private Limited, has alleged that Burman, who holds the largest share at 48%, is attempting to sell 11.5% of his stake to an unnamed party.This action violates an internal agreement among the owners, which mandates that any stake intended for sale must first be offered to existing promoters within a specific timeframe before being offered to external parties.While Burman has publicly denied any plans to sell his shares, Zinta's legal action suggests a breakdown in communication and trust within the ownership group.

"'Ye rankings deta kaun hai?': Ex-Pakistan cricketer lashes out at ICC over Babar Azam, Shubman Gill's spots",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ye-rankings-deta-kaun-hai-ex-pakistan-cricketer-lashes-out-at-icc-over-babar-azam-shubman-gills-spots/articleshow/112565825.cms,"In Advance Happy Independence Day | ICC Ki Babar Aur Gill Kay Sath Paki Dosti? | Basit Ali

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali recently took a swipe at the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) after Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam retained his top spot in the ODI rankings .India's rising star Shubman Gill , who has recently struggled for runs but still occupies the third spot in the rankings, also came under fire from Basit.Basit expressed his surprise and scepticism, noting that Babar has not played an ODI since November 2023, yet continues to hold the number one position.The rankings, which place Babar ahead of Indian cricket stars Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, and Virat Kohli , sparked Basit's criticism.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit questioned the ICC’s ranking system and suggested that it might be a tactic to pressure Babar.""When I saw the ICC ranking (for ODI batters), Babar Azam was at the top, number two was Rohit Sharma, number three was Shubman Gill, and then there was Virat Kohli at number four. I did not find it necessary to read the remaining names because I couldn't see Travis Head and Rachin Ravindra. I think the ICC wants that Babar doesn't perform. He would be happy with being the number one-ranked batter in ODIs. Who gives these rankings? On what basis are Babar Azam and Shubman Gill there?"" Basit said.Basit pointed out that the batters, who were standout performers in the World Cup, are conspicuously absent from the top ranks.Basit emphasized that during the 2023 World Cup, players like Rachin Ravindra of New Zealand, Quinton de Kock of South Africa, and Australia’s Travis Head made significant contributions, each scoring multiple centuries.Even Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman managed to notch up a century each.""Babar's last ODI was at the last year's World Cup. We saw the likes of Rachin Ravindra, Quinton de Kock, Travis Head and Virat Kohli at the World Cup. They scored three-four hundreds in the tournament. For Pakistan, Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman scored a century each. What kind of ranking do they give?"" he remarked.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali recently took a swipe at the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) after Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam retained his top spot in the ODI rankings.

If he evolved under MS Dhoni , Virat Kohli made him passionate about his job and Rohit Sharma has given him the freedom. Amid all that serious business, Bumrah never lost his sense of humour. ""There are great captains, but I'll take my name -- I am my favourite captain,"" he says.In a recent interview with The Indian Express, Bumrah reflected upon the captains he has played under and how each of them remained unique in their own way.While it seems he has been with the Indian team for eternity, the 30-year-old fast bowler has only played 36 Tests so far and is yet to touch the mark of hundred caps in ODIs and T20Is -- blame it on the Covid-forced break and trouble with his back. However, it puts his sublime skills and willingness to learn quickly into perspective.Bumrah credits that learning to what each of the captains he has played under brought to the team.""Rohit is one of the few captains who has empathy towards bowlers, despite being a batsman. He understands players’ emotions and knows what a player is going through. Rohit is not rigid, he is open to feedback,"" Bumrah told the newspaper about the 2024 T20 World Cup-winning skipper.Bumrah made his debut under Dhoni in an ODI in Sydney against Australia in January 2016 and gives credit to Dhoni for making him feel secure once his Indian Premier League heroics earned him an India call-up.""MS (Dhoni) gave me a lot of security, quickly,"" he said, suggesting that it helped him find his feet in the international arena. ""He has a lot of faith in his instinct, and doesn’t believe in a lot of planning.""Talking about Kohli as skipper, Bumrah credited him for putting a lot of emphassis on fitness. He said Kohli continues to lead the team in certain ways, while Rohit was the all-format designated skipper before retiring from the T20Is post the World Cup earlier this year.Rohit now leads in Tests and ODIs, while Suryakumar Yadav has been appointed the skipper for T20Is.""Virat is energy-driven, passionate, wears his heart on his sleeve,"" said Bumrah. ""He pushed us in terms of fitness and changed the narrative that way. Now Virat is not the captain, but he is still a leader. Captaincy is a post, but a team is run by 11 people.""","Jasprit Bumrah says MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are his favourite captains. The fast bowler has only played 36 Tests for India so far.

Their discipline paid off at the beginning of the final session.The Caribbean side rallied behind Seales (3 for 52) and left-arm orthodox spinner Motie (2 for 61), and the West Indies had an opportunity to dismiss South Africa before the end of the day.But Mulder, the all-rounder who had taken four for 32 in the West Indies first innings, was a resolute partner for wicketkeeper-batsman Verreynne, whose unbeaten fifty had come off 71 balls and featured seven fours. Verreynne was 34 not out alongwith Mulder's innings.Despite having to prioritize protecting their wickets, both players sought chances to score, and in the last two overs of the day, Mulder succeeded in hitting Motie and left-arm spinner Kavem Hodge for the first two sixes of his innings.",South Africa lead West Indies by 239 runs at stumps on second day of second Test.

'Playing India at World Cups is always a great challenge': New Zealand all-rounder Amelia Kerr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/playing-india-at-world-cups-is-always-a-great-challenge-new-zealand-all-rounder-amelia-kerr/articleshow/112571408.cms,"NEW DELHI: New Zealand all-rounder Amelia Kerr thrives on the unique challenges presented by playing against India in World Cup cricket . She highlights the fervent support Indian fans bring, regardless of location, and the crucial role spin bowling plays in their strategy. Kerr finds facing India's world-class batters, particularly in spin-friendly sub-continent conditions, a compelling test of her skills.“I think playing at World Cups, playing India is something I think that's always a great challenge because wherever you are in the world, they get a crowd that is supporting them.And spin is key for them.”“The ability to play spin well, especially in sub-continent conditions, I think that's a great challenge. And they’ve got some world-class (players), so I think for me that’s a key match-up and playing them is always a challenge,” said Amelia on the ICC 100% Cricket Superstars video, as quoted by IANS.Kerr's preferred mode of dismissal as a bowler is deceiving the batter in flight to induce a stumping, citing her dismissal of Indian captain Mithali Raj during the 2022 World Cup as a prime example.“My favourite (type of) wicket is when they haven't picked you. You beat someone through the gate. And I guess probably the wickets that mean the most is when they're game-changing, of one of the best players in the team, and you kind of make a breakthrough with something special,” she added.While initially a bowling all-rounder, Kerr has evolved into a dependable top-order batter. Her journey to the top of the order began at the age of 17 when her coach surprised her with an opening slot. This opportunity led to a historic unbeaten 232 against Ireland, the highest individual score in Women's ODIs, showcasing her remarkable stroke play.“The power game is probably not something I'm known for around the world. And, I mean, it's nice when you're batting with (New Zealand veteran) Sophie Devine, and you see her clearing the roof at the other end. But for me, it's about placement and timing,” Kerr noted.Representing New Zealand alongside her sister, Jess Kerr , holds profound significance for Amelia. Sharing moments like the national anthem evokes a special feeling.“To represent your country with your sister is amazing. We always kind of share that moment when we sing the national anthem together. There’s something that's really special for us. One game that stands out a lot was after the series I came back from mental health, and we played India at home, and we chased down 280. And I was batting in the middle of Jess and I got a hundred that day and Jess hit the winning runs. We kind of had a few tours not being together through her being injured and my mental health. So it just felt like a pretty special moment for the both of us and our family,” Kerr concluded.","New Zealand all-rounder thrives on the unique challenges presented by playing against India in World Cup cricket.

The BCB's request for a five-day extension to present a revised hosting plan, coupled with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) declining to step in as host due to monsoon season and a packed cricketing calendar, has accelerated the ICC's search for alternatives.The UAE, with its favourable time zone, predictable weather conditions, and established cricketing infrastructure, has emerged as a frontrunner.

However, the recent exodus of key BCB officials, including President Nazmul Hassan, due to political unrest casts a shadow over their efforts.Adding to the complexity, other nations, including Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, have expressed interest in hosting the tournament, presenting the ICC with additional options to consider.The ICC is expected to reach a decision by August 20th, coinciding with a pre-scheduled board meeting primarily focused on finalizing the terms of reference for an inquiry into the recent Men's T20 World Cup.With just over 50 days remaining before the tournament's start, the ICC faces a critical decision that will significantly impact the participating teams, fans, and the future of women's cricket .","The 2024 Women's T20 World Cup, originally slated to be hosted by Bangladesh, faces an uncertain future amid political unrest.

Furthermore, over the past few days, numerous former BCB officials and organizers have gathered at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium, demanding the resignation of Nazmul and his associates, whose term is set to conclude in October 2025.""One of our directors is in touch with him and, according to him, Papon bhai is ready to cooperate (with the government) and is also prepared to quit from the president's post to bring reform in the board,"" a BCB director, who attended the meeting, was quoted as saying in the report.A director of the BCB, who attended the meeting, mentioned in the report that an elected body running the board in the future would require complete support from the interim government.""If the president resigns, he can request to convene a board meeting for acceptance of his resignation and (for next) elections. He can do that,"" added another veteran director, who is present in the current board.Asked on what process would be followed if the BCB president Hassan resigns, the veteran director said, ""I can only talk to you about the constitution that is approved by the general council and apart from that I cannot say anything because I don't know anything.""If any board director or the president resigns, they have to resign to the board, because normally if anyone from the bank resigns it comes to the board, and the board accepts it or rejects it, According to our constitution, it is the same and if anyone resigns he has to resign to the board and the board has to convene and accept or reject that resignation letter.""""If we accept a resignation, there is a vacancy and the vacancy needs to be filled by an election.

Lifeline for Hyderabad as Jindal Group steps forward to acquire club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/lifeline-for-hyderabad-as-jindal-group-steps-forward-to-acquire-club/articleshow/112554962.cms,"Hyderabad FC have been troubled with players complaining of unpaid dues

PANAJI: After months of uncertainty over their future due to rising debts and multiple transfer bans, Hyderabad FC have been thrown a lifeline by the BC Jindal Group , one of India’s leading business conglomerates.Hyderabad have been troubled for more than a year now with players complaining of unpaid dues. Since January this year, at least eight players have terminated their contracts on just clauses after complaining on non-payment of salaries for multiple months.Notices to the club have not helped, leading to the departure of key players.Now, just before the August 15 deadline provided by the organisers of Indian Super League (ISL) to sort out the mess, Hyderabad have informed the All India Football Federation (AIFF) that they have executed a term sheet with the BC Jindal Group. The term sheet, a non-binding agreement that sets out the basic conditions for making an investment, was signed last week.“A term sheet has been executed for acquiring the club, but a lot of loose ends are still to be tied before the company completes the takeover,” a senior official told TOI. “The company has sought time till the end of the month to complete the deal. There will be legal and financial due diligence, and only if the diligence is completed satisfactorily, the deal will go through.”As part of the due diligence, the company will have a look at unpaid dues, besides, crucially, try and sort out the taxation issues that have dogged the club.The BC Jindal Group is one of India’s leading business conglomerates and engaged in a diverse portfolio of businesses as a manufacturer of packaging films, steel pipes, pipe fittings, power generation, cold rolled steel strips, galvanized sheets etc.Last year, Concatenate Advest, for and on behalf of BC Jindal Group with GWC Asset Holding -- an entity promoted by one of the promoters of TVS group -- as the consortium partner, had made a bid to launch a new I-League team from Delhi but backed out due to the financial terms. “Instead of a participation fee, the group wanted an equivalent amount be considered as compulsory investment into the club and football in Delhi,” said another source.Should the Jindal Group complete the takeover of Hyderabad, they will have to first clear all pending dues of players and ensure that the club can start signing players. For now, the club is “banned from registering any new players for two entire and consecutive registration periods”, which effectively means the former ISL champions cannot register players for the entire 2024-25 season.Hyderabad also do not have enough players on their roll. The club has not started pre-season training, and with the ISL set to kick off on Sept 13, less than a month away, it will be a race against time to complete the formalities and feature in this edition of ISL.","Hyderabad have been troubled for more than a year now with players complaining of unpaid dues.
