Rohit Sharma 's brutal attack against Australia 's bowling spearhead Mitchell Starc during the recently concluded T20 World Cup has become part of cricketing folklore, as it not just helped India beat the Aussies but also put them on the brink of an early exit from the tournament. For some, it was also revenge for the defeat in the ODI World Cup final last year.The loos against India hit Australia's chances hard as the 2021 champions failed to enter the semis, while India went on to win the trophy defeating South Africa in the final.India's win followed euphoric celebrations on the field in Barbados, in the dressing room and later upon their arrival home. The T20 world champions were invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, followed by an open bus parade at the Marine Drive in Mumbai that saw lakhs of fans coming onto the streets to join their heroes in celebration.While the win has started sinking in, the Rohit mania fails to cease as the India captain visited the US for a promotional event after a small family vacation in the UK, and was greeted by fans with shouts of ""Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Starc"".It was the fans' way of telling the skipper that they enjoyed him taking the Australian apart and will never forget the entertainment.The shouts drew Rohit's attention instantaneously. He replied, ""calm down, guys"" and followed it up with a cheeky smile while on the stage.India met Australia during the 'Super 8s' stage of the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, and Rohit played probably the best innings of the tournament, scoring 92 runs off just 41 deliveries.Starc bore the maximum impact of Rohit's onslaught, conceding 29 runs in one over where he was smashed for four sixes and a four.Reflecting later on that during an episode of Willow Talk podcast, Starc had said: ""I have played a lot against him. He had a good tournament, especially at the back end. I think he targeted that wind in St Lucia as well. It was the one end that went for a lot more (runs) than the other.”""I think I had five bad balls and he hit them all for six.""","Rohit Sharma hit Mitchell Starc for four sixes and a four during T20 World Cup.

There are assumptions that ICC may have incurred losses in ticketing as well in the USA leg. The tournament looked mismanaged.

Despite the team's efforts, they were unable to secure an IPL trophy during this period.Although the situation is still developing, there is a strong likelihood that Sourav Ganguly , who currently serves as the Team Director of DC, may take on the additional role of head coach in the upcoming season.“As you move on as our head coach, we are finding it incredibly difficult to put it down in words. The four things that you told us about in every huddle -- care, commitment, attitude and effort, they sum up our seven years together,” DC posted on their official 'X' handle.The franchise expressed their heartfelt sentiments in an emotional post, reflecting on their extensive partnership with the Australian. However, it has come to light that Ponting was unequivocally informed that his performance has failed to meet the expectations of the management, despite being granted an unprecedented seven-year tenure without delivering the desired results.Ponting, who led Australia to two World Cup victories, joined the franchise in 2019. Although the team reached its first-ever final in 2021, their performances in subsequent years have not lived up to the initial potential showcased during that promising run.“The top brass of Delhi Capitals has intimated Ricky that they aren't happy that the team didn't win a championship in seven years and they are trying to look at rejigging the support staff. He won't be continuing next year,” a source close to DC management told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The decision-makers want Ponting to be more involved in the auction process and team building, rather than just joining a couple of weeks before the start of the IPL.It remains uncertain whether DC will hire a new head coach or ask Ganguly to take on the head coach role.Praveen Amre , the diligent assistant coach, is set to continue.The DC co-owners, JSW and GMR group, are scheduled to meet either at the end of this month or early next month to discuss the future direction.Player retention is another issue up for discussion. If the retention limit remains at four, DC will have to release either Australia's Jake Fraser-McGurk or South Africa's Tristan Stubbs , as there is only one overseas slot available.Regarding the Indian core, retention choices are straightforward, with skipper Rishabh Pant , all-rounder Axar Patel, and wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav leading the list.A mega auction is anticipated ahead of the IPL 2025 , and there is a possibility that some retainable stars from each franchise might want to enter the auction pool to determine their true market value.","Delhi Capitals have ended their association with head coach Ricky Ponting.

And while the Knight Riders have played five matches, New York and the Unicorns have played three apiece.The match also saw a controversial moment in the first over of Washington's chase when Head was given not out while batting on six as a catch by Andre Russell off Spencer Johnson was ruled not clean after the third umpire took his time to look at various angles. Eventually he ruled it in Head's favour, believing that the ball had touched the ground.From thereon, Head stamped his authority on the game, though he survived another chance while batting on 32, when the ball burst through Spencer's hands at short third-man position.Head went on to complete his half-century in just 27 balls but fell soon after when paceman Shadley van Schalkwyk pegged the Australian's off-stump back.Rachin Ravindra (11) then added 29 runs with Smith, but the New Zealander fell to Spencer. Smith, however, ensured there were no more hiccups and took his team home.""I'm absolutely loving not having a bat, nice to give the body a bit of a break.

Football's Coming Home ,"" the anthem of the England soccer team, has echoed through the streets of German cities over the past month and will be sung with even greater enthusiasm in Berlin in the coming day.On Sunday, England will face Spain in the European Championship final, presenting the underperforming birthplace of soccer with an opportunity to secure a major men's title for the first time since their 1966 World Cup victory on home turf.""I'm not a believer in fairy tales,"" England coach Gareth Southgate said on Saturday, ""but I'm a believer in dreams.""Southgate has been a key figure in England's arduous journey, marked by painful exits, close calls, and national distress over the years.As England's coach since 2016, Southgate led the team to their first major final since 1966, only to suffer defeat against Italy in a penalty shootout during the 2021 Euro final .Twenty-five years prior, Southgate, then a modest defender, missed a crucial penalty in England's shootout loss to Germany in the Euro 1996 semifinals.The ""Football's Coming Home"" anthem originates from the "" Three Lions "" song, released before Euro 1996.One line in the song referred to ""30 years of hurt."" Now, it has been 58 years of hurt, and the fans continue to sing it.""It has been going on for years and years,"" remarked Justin Tucknott, a 54-year-old England fan and business analyst, as he enjoyed a beer at a bar near Olympiastadion on a sun-drenched evening in the German capital.""We're going to keep singing it until it does come home.

Southgate quickly dispelled this notion and instilled a different perspective in them.""We have tried to change the mindset from the start, tried to be more honest about where we were as a football nation,"" Southgate said. ""I travelled to World Cups and European Championships as an observer and watched highlights reels of matches that were on the big screens - and we weren't in any of them.""They only showed the finals and big games. We needed to change that.

Their tiki-taka style of play has captivated fans, with their creative forwards, including youngsters Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams , posing significant challenges to opposing teams.The Spanish side's attacking prowess is supported by a robust defensive unit, with Robin Le Normand and Aymeric Laporte anchoring the backline and Rodri providing additional cover.This solid foundation has allowed Spain to showcase their offensive capabilities, amassing an impressive 13 goals from 108 attempts on their path to the final.History favours Spain, as they boast three European championships, while England has yet to secure a title since 1966.

This final will mark the end of a month-long football extravaganza, during which Spain, led by their teenage prodigy Lamine Yamal, have been the standout team.Spain have already knocked out several of Europe's top teams while maintaining a perfect record of six wins on their way to the final. They are aiming to secure a record fourth European championship title, having previously triumphed in 1964, 2008, and 2012.England, on the other hand, have faced challenges against weaker opponents but delivered their best performance in the semi-finals, defeating the Netherlands 2-1 with a crucial goal from substitute Ollie Watkins.This marks England's second straight appearance in the European Championship final, as they seek to erase the painful memory of their penalty shoot-out defeat to Italy at Wembley in the previous edition three years ago.

They eventually progressed through the additional period before triumphing on penalties against Switzerland and narrowly defeating the Netherlands.As England prepares to face Spain, they will be confronting their most formidable opponent yet. The two nations have not met at a major tournament since Euro 96, when an England team that included current manager Gareth Southgate as a player emerged victorious on penalties in the quarter-finals.""The belief has grown as we've gone through the tournament,"" Kane said.""What we have been through with the late goals and the penalty shoot-outs builds resilience and builds belief.

Then, in the semi-finals, a breathtaking goal from Yamal helped them overcome a deficit to defeat Kylian Mbappe 's France.""Tomorrow is when I will ask the least of my team. They have been giving everything. Tomorrow is simply about enjoying it,"" insisted the 63-year-old De la Fuente.""We are two great sides, the best two teams.

However, Colombia is determined to thwart that ambition in a clash that sees the powerhouse confront the rising force in the championship match.The showdown will unfold on Sunday evening at Hard Rock Stadium, a venue that hosted two group stage encounters and is set to be the location for seven matches during the 2026 World Cup.In the lead-up to the game, both teams voiced apprehensions about security following an incident involving Uruguay's Darwin Núñez and several of his teammates. They entered the stands amidst a physical altercation between supporters at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, after Uruguay's semifinal victory against Colombia.Uruguay captain José Giménez stated that players went into the crowd to safeguard their families, while coach Marcelo Bielsa vehemently criticized tournament organizers for failing to adequately protect the families of players seated in the stands behind the Uruguay bench.“I’m concerned about what could happen tomorrow,” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said through an interpreter. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez added it “would be great if we could reinforce security.”CONMEBOL said in a news release that “any action that tarnishes a global football celebration will not be tolerated.”Argentina, the reigning champions of the Copa America in 2021 and the World Cup in 2022, has the opportunity to match Spain's achievement from 2008-12 by securing three major titles in a row.Despite Messi's leg injury, the Albiceleste reached the final without relying heavily on his dominant performances.The 37-year-old superstar, who has won the Ballon d'Or a record eight times, showcased his skills by weaving through defenders and creating chances for his teammates. However, his only goal came in the semifinal against Canada, where he deflected Enzo Fernández's shot past goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau, contributing to Argentina's 2-0 victory.Ahead of the final, Messi said he's battled discomfort at times throughout the tournament but assured it won't slow him down on Sunday.“In the final I’m going to feel better,” he said in an interview with DSports.Colombia is set to compete in its first Copa America final in 23 years, having extended its unbeaten run to a team-record 28 games, surpassing their previous best from 1992-94. This streak is currently the longest in men's international soccer.James Rodríguez has been Colombia's standout player and potentially the best in the entire tournament. With six assists to his name, he has set a new record for the most assists in a single Copa America since data tracking began in 2011, surpassing Messi's five assists in 2021.“James has had a great Copa America,” Colombia coach Néstor Lorenzo said through an interpreter. “We are lucky enough to have him at a very good level. The team has supported him. I can only hope that tomorrow his performance will be great.”Colombia's head coach, Lorenzo, commended the team's united effort in reaching the current stage of the tournament, which involved a hard-fought victory against 15-time champion Uruguay. He expressed gratitude towards the Colombian supporters, noting that their matches, alongside Argentina's, have drawn some of the largest crowds.However, Lorenzo emphasized that this level of performance should be the standard for the resurgent Colombian team, which secured its sole Copa America title on home soil in 2001, rather than an exceptional occurrence.“We’d love it if it wouldn’t be such a surprise to get to a final, so unexpected,” he said. “We’d like to be always on top. It’s not easy. ... Let’s hope this can last. Let’s hope we can keep on going.”The two teams previously met in the 2021 semifinal, where Argentina emerged victorious with a 3-2 win on penalties following a 1-1 draw in regular time. Colombia's last triumph over Argentina in the Copa America came during the group stage in 2019.“We are going to play our game,” Scaloni said. “You always have a plan, but the final is always a stressful game, and the one who is under the least stress will win.”",Argentina and Colombia will meet in the Copa America final on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: After an exciting tournament featuring 50 matches and the departure of 22 teams, England and three-time champions Spain are set to clash in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin on Sunday.The competition has showcased a promising new generation of footballers, such as teenagers Lamine Yamal, Arda Guler, and Kobbie Mainoo. However, several established players who were previously under the radar have also demonstrated their skills on the European stage.Here are five stars who have broken through with impressive performances at Euro 2024A 26-year-old midfielder for Spain, has been crucial to his team's success in the tournament. The 26-year-old is well-known in Germany after four years at RB Leipzig but has made everyone else stand up and take notice of his ability with a string of excellent performances in his adopted country. Despite starting only two of Spain's six games, Olmo has scored three goals, tied for the most in the tournament, and provided two assists.England's Marc Guehi, playing in his first major international tournament at the age of 23, has quickly become a key player in Gareth Southgate's defensive setup. Just 23, he has been calm and assured alongside John Stones in central defence, with England conceding just three goals in five games with Guehi on the park. Guehi's importance to the team was highlighted when he was suspended for the quarter-final against Switzerland, and he also contributed to the attack with an assist for Jude Bellingham's last-gasp equaliser against Slovakia in the last 16.A forward for the Netherlands, has been instrumental in his team's run to their first Euros semi-final in 20 years. The orange shirt seems to bring the best out of the 25-year-old, whose impressive performances at the Qatar World Cup came before a big-money transfer to English giants Liverpool. Gakpo scored crucial goals against Poland and Romania and forced a late own goal against Turkey in the quarter-finals.Georgia's goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has been a standout player for his country in their first-ever Euros appearance. Standing at nearly two meters tall, Mamardashvili made 30 saves in four matches, the second-most in Euros history. His performances have not surprised La Liga fans, as he has been among the best goalkeepers in Spain this season.Finally, Austria's Marcel Sabitzer has continued his stellar form from Borussia Dortmund's Champions League run at Euro 2024. The 30-year-old midfielder scored the winner against the Netherlands to secure top spot in their group and has been a constant goal threat, particularly from long range. His boundless energy has been key for Austria's high-intensity playing style under Ralf Rangnick.","England and Spain will meet in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin on Sunday.

""It's always nice to be around her in the locker room. I told her that I'm sorry because I knew that she wanted to win too. These moments, at the end of a match, are not pleasant, when you have someone at the other end who you like.

It was just very, very emotional to see me on a board right next to her,"" Krejcikova said of the Wimbledon honours board. ""I think she would be proud, she would be really excited that I'm on a same board as she is because Wimbledon was super special for her.""Krejcikova, who worked with Novotna for almost four years, until she passed away, said she still has dreams of her mentor.""I'm dreaming about her a lot and we are talking in these dreams,"" she said.As a child, Krejcikova had a little notebook in which she penned her tennis goals. When she was 12, she wrote that she would like to win the French Open one day.""It was quite a big dream for me to win the French Open,"" she said, ""Maybe like three-four months ago, I was looking through that notebook and I found it there.""""Things shifted a little bit when I met Jana, when she told me all the stories about Wimbledon, about the grass, how difficult it was for her to win the title and how emotional she was when she actually made it,"" she said. ""Since then I started to see Wimbledon as the biggest tournament in the world.""And now as the queen of the most famous lawns in the world, she has dotted the lines of her dreams.""It's great that I'm a two-time major champion.

""Djokovic is an unbelievable fighter, and I knew he was going to have his chances again, so I had to stay there. I tried to win the point with the serve, but I couldn't.""""It was difficult for me.

""But credit to Carlos for playing some complete tennis. From the back of the court, on serve, he had it all today. I tried to push him and saved the three match points, extended the match a little bit, but it wasn't meant to be.
