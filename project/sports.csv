' mercurial bunch in final today

|

CHENNAI: The year was 2012. Shah Rukh Khan 's daughter Suhana still hadn't reached her teens. After the first four years of struggle, as Kolkata Knight Riders won a magical final at Chepauk, beating two-time defending champions Chennai Super Kings, 'King Khan' couldn't control his emotions and was on the verge of jumping from the first floor balcony of the stadium.Suhana stopped her dad that moment, but the celebration (and pandemonium) that followed in the team hotel through the night was the experience of a lifetime for those who were there.Cut to 2024 and KKR are close to revisiting similar sensations. But standing in their way is an unpredictable Sunrisers Hyderabad team, who have lost twice to the Knights this year, the most recent being in the first Qualifier in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.Some of the key protagonists of that 2012 triumph for KKR are still there - then-captain Gautam Gambhir is now the mentor while Sunil Narine remains the No. 1 weapon for the Kolkata team, albeit in a different form.Now with a much-modified action, Narine, with an economy rate of 6.9, is still a bowler who is difficult to score runs off. But it's his no-holds barred batting at the top of the order that has become one of the talking points of this IPL The West Indian has the ability to clear the fence whenever the ball is in his hitting arc, which can be worrying for somebody like Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who banks on his swing early on at a pace of around 130 km/hr. For SRH, the best chance against Narine will be to try and bowl short at a good pace, something that skipper Pat Cummins can do if he chooses to.On Friday, SRH had two unlikely bowling heroes in left-arm spinners Abhishek Sharma and Shahbaz Ahmed on a black-soil pitch, but the track is going to be changed for the final. The game the wrist spinners should get a bit of help, provided the dew doesn't come in.Narine and his mystery spin partner C Varun, who has got 20 wickets in this IPL, could be crucial. Captain Shreyas Iyer stressed on that in the press conference just before KKR's practice schedule was halted by an afternoon shower.""Narine and Varun's roles are going to be important. They have been spot on in terms of executing their plans and have been able to control the runs in the middle overs. I hope they will be able to do that on Sunday as well,"" Iyer said.All the indications are that KKR will start the final as overwhelming favourites, but there's something about this SRH team that doesn't quite rule them out of the contest.While Cummins' astute captaincy is one of the crucial elements, it is the explosive nature of their opening duo of Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head that will keep KKR team management worried. Head didn't play the first time these two teams played against each other this season, while in Qualifier 1, he got a first-ball duck, unable to deal with the pace and swing of the ever-improving Mitchell Starc . But there's always an unpredictability about Head's game and captain Iyer will hope that Starc delivers the sucker punch once again early on.The second big hurdle that can come in KKR's way is in the form of Heinrich Klaasen, who was brilliant during his 34-ball 50 in the second Qualifier on Friday.He has everything in his batting arsenal to deal with the spin threat of Narine and Varun and add to that the confidence that he has gained from his Friday show.But KKR too are hungry. Their mentor Gautam Gambhir's ""obsession for success"" seems to have rubbed on and it will need an extraordinary performance from SRH to stop the marauding Knights from running away with their third title.","Kolkata Knight Riders face Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL final.

Ruturaj Gaikwad reveals MS Dhoni's leadership lessons: 'Being neutral and not getting too excited',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/exclusive-ruturaj-gaikwad-reveals-ms-dhonis-leadership-lessons-being-neutral-and-not-get-too-excited/articleshow/110431988.cms,"NEW DELHI: Young skipper with big responsibilities—that's how Ruturaj Gaikwad 's maiden captaincy stint with the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) can be defined. Ahead of IPL 2024 , the legendary Mahendra Singh Dhoni passed the baton to Gaikwad, who has been one of CSK 's most consistent batters.The task was daunting, but a calm Ruturaj grabbed the opportunity with both hands. He had a sense of security with the 42-year-old Dhoni still behind the stumps, guiding him in decision-making, field placements, and tactical use of bowlers in various situations.Despite Ruturaj's inability to guide the five-time champions to the playoffs in IPL 2024, his debut as Dhoni's successor earned him admiration as he showed promise that he will excel in the coming seasons.Ruturaj's team was eliminated from playoff contention after a crucial loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru. CSK finished fifth with seven wins, seven losses, and 14 points, missing out on the final four due to an inferior net run rate.""Felt good right from the start as it comes with responsibility and I like responsibility. As a captain I take up a balanced approach between both (batting and captaincy),"" Ruturaj told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.When Ruturaj stepped onto the field with a bat, he carried no burden of captaincy. He batted with the same ease and confidence instilled in him by the great Dhoni since his CSK debut. On the field, he was as calm as a cucumber.Ruturaj emerged as CSK's top run-scorer in the tournament, scoring 583 runs in 14 matches at an impressive average of 53.00. He maintained a strike rate of 141.16 and also notched up one century and four half-centuries.Instructing senior players like Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja , and Ajinkya Rahane may seem daunting to some, but Ruturaj handled it with poise.""I felt good right from the start (of the tournament). I am very approachable for all teammates whenever needed and they always support the team in whatever way the team requires.""""I wouldn't say it’s difficult as all of them are very understanding. All the senior players that are a part of the team are great to be with. Their experience always helps with match situations,"" Ruturaj said.Ruturaj was CSK's primary pick for captaincy, ensuring a seamless transition while Dhoni remained in the team.Despite the weighty expectations set by Dhoni, who led the Yellow Army to five title triumphs (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021, and 2023), Ruturaj remained unfazed by his leadership responsibilities.Instead, he expressed gratitude to CSK fans for accepting the change in the team's leadership.""Being neutral is something that I have learnt from Mahi bhai. Not getting too excited about anything or being down by anything is the right approach that I have picked up,"" Ruturaj said.""While batting irrespective of being captain or not, my approach is always the same. Doesn’t really change a lot. You cannot plan to become leaders so being good team players and putting the team first will always stand a good chance to be one,"" the CSK skipper added.On being asked about his association with Amrutanjan, Ruturaj said: ""I'm extremely delighted to be partnering with Amrutanjan Healthcare for Electro+ Rehydrate. Hydration and maintaining energy levels are crucial, not just for athletes like me, but for everyone in their daily lives"".","Ruturaj Gaikwad captained Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2024.

IPL Final: Pat Cummins breaks new T20 ground,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-final-pat-cummins-breaks-new-t20-ground/articleshow/110432250.cms,"CHENNAI: In any discussion about great cricket captains, Pat Cummins ' name is unlikely to get a mention. But the success that this humble Aussie paceman has achieved over the last one and a half years is simply unmatched.Australia broke Indian hearts in the World Test Championship final and ODI World Cup final last year, and now he is one step away from winning T20 cricket's biggest franchise event - the IPL. It was only MS Dhoni who had an ODI World Cup and an IPL title (in 2011) under his belt as captain at the same time, and Cummins knows he can do one better with Sunrisers Hyderabad ""Yes, it's been a great couple of years. But I haven't done much T20 captaincy before this, having captained in ODIs helped though,"" a relaxed Cummins said, taking his eyes off Dhoni as a re-run of a CSK game was being played on a screen inside the press-room.There's an understated nature about his captaincy, even though you can see that he is an astute reader of the game. The Indian team got a feel of his tactical acumen in Ahmedabad last Nov and that's probably one of the reasons the SRH management punted on him, picking Cummins up for Rs 20.5 crore from the auctions.""He is a very practical guy, very humble. He is empathetic towards his teammates and coaching staff. And he keeps it simple, our team meeting today (Friday) went on for like 35 seconds,"" SRH assistant coach Simon Helmot said after the team's win against Rajasthan Royals in the second qualifier.In this day and age, some of the captains are absolutely obsessed with data analysis, but Cummins is probably a little old school in this regard, even though he isn't closed to new-age technology.""I think data analytics play a role but it can take you so far, a captain probably needs to be intuitive. It's actually a balance of information you gather from objective data and your own intuition,"" Cummins said, analysis his methods of captaincy.It's interesting that only three foreign captains have won the IPL - Shane Warne (2008), Adam Gilchrist (2009) and David Warner (2016). It's not always easy for foreigners to understand how it works for Indian rookies, but Cummins, who isn't an IPL regular, seems to have taken to it like a duck to water.""There's a lot of pressure on the Indian guys in the IPL. So, instead of trying to change how they play, it's better to keep them encouraging and see how it works. And when the tough moments come, it is about rallying around each other,"" said Cummins.It's this simplicity in his approach that has taken his team so far and one more win on Sunday will ensure that Cummins holds an exclusive place in Indian cricket history.","Pat Cummins is one step away from winning T20 cricket's biggest franchise event - the IPL.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh managed to salvage some pride by defeating the USA by 10 wickets in the final match of the three-game series on Saturday in Houston. Mustafizur Rahman 's exceptional bowling performance, taking six wickets, restricted the Americans to a mere 104-9 in their 20 overs. The visitors chased down the target in just 11.4 overs without losing a wicket.Despite the loss, the United States claimed the series 2-1, having surprised their higher-ranked opponents by winning the first two games. This series victory serves as a significant boost to their confidence as they prepare to co-host the upcoming T20 World Cup with the West Indies.The American innings started well with Shayan Jahangir and Andries Gous putting on 46 runs before Gous, who had scored 27 off 15 balls with four fours and a six, was caught by Soumya Sarkar off Shakib Al Hasan 's bowling. Jahingir, who contributed 18 runs, followed soon after, caught by Tanzim Hasan Sakib while attempting to pull a delivery from Mustafizur. The hosts struggled to maintain their momentum, scoring only 14 runs while losing three more wickets. Mustafizur, bowling his second spell at the death, finished with his career-best T20I figures of 6-10.Bangladesh's chase was comfortable, with Tanzid Hasan scoring 58 off 42 balls and Soumya contributing 43 off 28 deliveries.

I think the plan we made before this match, everyone executed.""He acknowledged the disappointment of losing the series but emphasized the importance of finishing on a positive note and gaining valuable experience ahead of the World Cup.USA vice-captain Aaron Jones attributed the loss to poor shot selection by the American batsmen.

NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer-led teams have reached the IPL final twice in the last four years. However, the Kolkata Knight Riders skipper is unperturbed by not being widely recognized as a leader and yielding the spotlight to their mentor, Gautam Gambhir .Iyer led the Delhi Capitals to the IPL title clash in 2020 and has now guided KKR to this edition's summit match against Sunrisers Hyderabad, set to be played in Chennai on Sunday.When asked if he feels his leadership achievements have gone unnoticed, the straightforward Mumbaikar responded sharply.""The hype is definitely created by you guys (media). Where I stand (as a skipper) is definitely on you (to decide),"" Iyer replied to a query from PTI during the pre-match conference on Saturday.Regarding Gambhir's contribution as the mentor, Iyer described him as one of the finest readers of the game in the T20 format.""About Gautam bhai, I feel he has got immense knowledge about how the game is played. He has won two titles previously with KKR, and his strategies have been spot-on in terms of what execution we have to make against the opposition.""Iyer exuded confidence in KKR's victory over SRH , especially with Gambhir's invaluable inputs from the dugout.""Hopefully, we keep continuing with the same momentum with his knowledge.""The last six months has been quite a roller-coaster journey for the stylish right-hander, whose initial reluctance to play red-ball domestic cricket saw him lose the BCCI central contract.Iyer did come back and play the Ranji Trophy final against Vidarbha where he scored a 95 in the second innings.The 29-year-old had a middling IPL so far and also wasn't remotely in contention for a berth in the T20 World Cup side.The scars have not healed, and were evident when he spoke about how people didn't believe him when he talked about his struggles with a back injury, which seemed to have resurfaced.""I was definitely struggling after the World Cup in the longer format. When I raised my concern, no one was agreeing to it. But, at the same time, the competition was with myself,"" said Iyer, who has scored more than 4000 runs in 124 games across three formats.For Iyer, it was important to stay focused on the job at hand rather than thinking about what all had gone wrong.""When IPL was approaching, all I wanted was to put my best foot forward. Whatever planning and strategizing we did before it and executing it to the best of our abilities, and that's where we are right now,"" he added.Iyer had pulled out of the England Tests at home after the first two games and once he started training for the IPL.Unlike others who loosely use the word adjustment and adaptability, Iyer admitted that it was easier said than done.""The transformation from red ball to white ball is difficult as a batter and also as a bowler. So, it was difficult at the start, but once you get used to it, you pick up the pace and match on with the other players.""While Iyer did have a torrid time during February-March, he gradually started to get over his concerns about national selection once he appeared for Mumbai in the Ranji final.""We won the final. I was a part of the team and also contributed in the final. It gives me immense pleasure to be playing so well in the last few months,"" said Iyer, who headlined his team's chase in the Qualifier 1 against SRH with a well-timed unbeaten 58.""All I did was stay in the present and not think about what was going to happen to me or was worried about the selection process.""I just wanted to come and participate and play to the best of my abilities,"" he stated.",Kolkata Knight Riders skipper Shreyas Iyer is unperturbed by not being widely recognized as a leader. Iyer led the Delhi Capitals to the IPL title clash in 2020 and has now guided KKR to this edition's summit match against Sunrisers Hyderabad.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110424612,imgsize-73682,width-400,resizemode-4/110424612.jpg"

2nd T20I: West Indies secure series win over South Africa after Roston Chase's heroics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/2nd-t20i-west-indies-secure-series-win-over-south-africa-after-roston-chases-heroics/articleshow/110431918.cms,"(Inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: Roston Chase 's remarkable 38-ball 67 led West Indies to a 16-run victory over South Africa at Sabina Park, securing an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match T20I series. The home side's strong batting display saw them post 207-7, a total that proved too much for South Africa despite their quick start.The Caribbean team, coached by Daren Sammy , the captain who led West Indies to the T20 World Cup title in 2016, put in a solid all-round effort. West Indies captain Brandon King chose to bat first and led by example, scoring 36 off 22 balls. Kyle Mayers also contributed with an aggressive 32 off 16 balls, including three sixes, before falling in the ninth over with the score at 83-3. Both King and Mayers were dismissed by debutant leg spinner Nqabayomzi Peter, who impressed for South Africa.However, it was the 63-run partnership between Chase and Romario Shepherd that made the difference. Chase showcased his elegant stroke play, hitting seven fours and two sixes, but was denied strike in the final over when Lungi Ngidi picked up two wickets and conceded just three runs. Medium-pacer Andile Phehlukwayo had a challenging day, ending with figures of 2-51 off his three overs.South Africa's reply began with a blistering start, as openers Reeza Hendricks and Quinton de Kock amassed 81 in 4.5 overs before De Kock was bowled by slow left-armer Akeal Hosein for 41 off just 17 balls, having hit four fours and four sixes. Hendricks followed in the next over, bowled by Chase's off-spin for 34 off 18 balls with three sixes.Slow left-armer Gudakesh Motie kept South Africa in check, taking 3-22 from his four overs, including the crucial wicket of skipper Rassie van der Dussen , who had threatened with his aggressive 30 off 22 before hitting a wide full toss to Hosein at long-off.The tourists' tail struggled to keep up with the required run-rate in the final overs, allowing West Indies to secure the series win and serve as a reminder of their potential as two-time winners in the upcoming T20 World Cup.""It's an amazing feeling. Chase is very valuable. Very happy with his performance. They had a good start but it finished well for us. Play really good cricket - that's what we are focussing,"" said King.Van der Dussen acknowledged his seamers' role in allowing West Indies to set a high target, stating, ""We let them get too much again. The spinners bowled really well and Peter on debut was brilliant."" He added, ""We have one more chance and we are looking to bounce back tomorrow (Sunday).""After Sunday's game, South Africa will head to Florida for an intra-squad warm-up game at the Lauderhill venue, while West Indies will face Australia in a warm-up game in Trinidad on Thursday.","West Indies beat South Africa by 16 runs to take 2-0 lead in T20 series.

"'Struggled with back issues after World Cup, no one...': KKR captain Shreyas Iyer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/struggled-with-back-issues-after-world-cup-no-one-kkr-captain-shreyas-iyer/articleshow/110426972.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) final against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper Shreyas Iyer opened up about his struggles with back issues following the Cricket World Cup last year, noting the lack of understanding he faced.KKR and SRH will clash in the IPL 2024 final at Chennai's Chepauk Stadium on Sunday. KKR topped the league stage with nine wins, three losses, and two no-results, amassing 20 points. They secured a direct spot in the final by defeating SRH in the first qualifier. SRH earned their place in the final by beating the Rajasthan Royals (RR) by 36 runs in the second qualifier.It has been a challenging and mixed period for Iyer. After dealing with fitness and form issues last year, he made his comeback in the Asia Cup but again faced back problems. He returned for the ODI series against Australia just before the World Cup, solidifying his spot in the middle-order.Despite a rough start, Iyer had an exceptional World Cup campaign, scoring 530 runs at an average of 66.25, with two centuries and three fifties. He became the first middle-order batter in World Cup history to score over 500 runs. Iyer peaked near the tournament's end, with consecutive centuries against the Netherlands and New Zealand, the latter in a record 67-ball knock in the semifinals. However, he scored just four runs in the final, which India lost to Australia.Following the World Cup, Iyer had a disappointing Test series in South Africa. He prepared for the next challenge against England at home by playing in the Ranji Trophy but was dropped after poor performances in the first two Tests. He missed the Ranji quarterfinals due to back spasms but returned for the semifinals, scoring 95 runs in the final despite battling back pain. Despite playing a crucial role in Mumbai's 42nd triumph, Iyer's return to domestic red-ball cricket seemed too late, as he was dropped from BCCI's Central Contract list in February.In the IPL, Iyer has participated in all games and earned praise for his leadership, guiding KKR to the finals. In 14 matches, Iyer has scored 345 runs at an average of 38.33 and a strike rate of 146.18, with two half-centuries. His best score, 58*, came in the first qualifier against SRH.Speaking ahead of the final clash, Iyer said during the press conference, ""I was definitely struggling after the World Cup in the longer format (with back issues). When I raised my concern, no one was agreeing to it.""""But at the same time the competition is with myself. When the IPL was approaching all I wanted to see was that I have put my best foot forward and whatever planning and strategising we [KKR] did before it, basically if we could execute it to the best of our abilities, we would have been in a great spot - and that is where we are right now,"" he added.Former Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir, who led KKR to two titles back in 2012 and 2014, returned as a mentor for this year's tournament for the Knights after two underwhelming seasons spent near the bottom of the points table.Talking about Gambhir's return to the franchise, Iyer said hilariously, ""The hype is definitely created by you guys (about Gambhir's return).""He also lauded Gambhir's ""immense knowledge of the game"". ""His strategies have been spot on in terms of what we have to execute against our opponents. He adds a lot of cream to the team and hopefully we continue the same momentum in the final,"" he added.Talking about his preparations for the IPL, Iyer said that transitioning from red-ball cricket to the white-ball cricket after the Ranji Trophy final was difficult both for batters and bowlers.""It was kind of difficult at the start but once you get used to it, I think you pick up the pace and march on with the other players,"" he added.Iyer said that KKR being two-time champions and one time runners-up does not give them any advantage over SRH being a one-time champion and two-time runners-up.""It is on skill and mindset tomorrow. The best team is going to win,"" he added.On the playing surface, the wicket is different from what it was yesterday during the qualifier two between SRH and Rajasthan Royals (RR), said Iyer.""It is red soil, yesterday it was black. Looking through TV, we thought dew was going to play a role, but it did not the ball started spinning,"" he concluded.","Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper Shreyas Iyer opened up about his struggles with back issues following the Cricket World Cup last year.

NEW DELHI: England defeated Pakistan by 23 runs in the second T20 international at Edgbaston on Saturday, thanks to a stunning innings from captain Jos Buttler , who scored 84 runs.After Pakistan won the toss and chose to field, Buttler capitalized on the favorable batting conditions. He scored 84 off 51 balls, hitting eight fours and three sixes.The 33-year-old opener reached his half-century with his signature premeditated scoop shot, sending a yorker from fast bowler Haris Rauf over fine leg.Buttler received support from Will Jacks, who scored 37, and Jonny Bairstow, who added 21. Despite a middle-order collapse, Jofra Archer stepped up in the final over, hitting Mohammad Amir for a four and a six, helping England to a total of 183-7.Pakistan lost Mohammad Rizwan for a duck in the first over when Moeen Ali had him caught and his opening partner Saim Ayub holed out in the deep to leave the tourists reeling at 14-2.Fakhar Zaman and skipper Babar Azam (32) scored freely to stitch together a 53-run stand off 28 balls but Moeen struck again to dismiss Azam lbw. Zaman fell for a well-made 45 off 21 balls to leave Pakistan at 100-6.Iftikhar Ahmed (23) and Imad Wasim (22) provided resistance but the target proved to be out of reach for Pakistan's tail as they were dismissed for 160.England's Archer (2-28) got his first wickets after 14 months on the sidelines due to an elbow injury when he had both Azam Khan and Wasim caught in the covers.The first match of the four-game series was washed out without a ball bowled.

Manchester United win FA Cup title after beating Manchester City 2-1 in the final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/manchester-united-win-fa-cup-title-after-beating-manchester-city-2-1-in-the-final/articleshow/110426391.cms,"NEW DELHI: Erik ten Hag made a compelling case to avoid the sack as Manchester United stunned Manchester City with a 2-1 victory in the FA Cup final on Saturday.Despite reports that Ten Hag would be dismissed regardless of the outcome at Wembley, following what he himself termed a ""terrible"" campaign, United's hierarchy may reconsider after his tactical brilliance thwarted City's quest for history.City, heavily favored to secure a second consecutive Premier League and FA Cup double, were left disappointed as Ten Hag's strategy led United to an unexpected triumph.Yet Ten Hag found a way to neutralise Pep Guardiola's side as first half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo put United on course to win the FA Cup for the first time in eight years.Jeremy Doku squeezed an 87th minute strike past Andre Onana's weak attempted save but it was too late to rescue City.Having ended a turbulent season on a high note, if Ten Hag's two-year reign does end, his exit would provoke memories of fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal's Old Trafford departure.Van Gaal was fired just two days after United's FA Cup final victory against Crystal Palace in 2016.Ten Hag will hope a more apt comparison is Alex Ferguson's 1990 FA Cup final win against Palace, which kick-started his remarkable run after calls for his sacking earlier that season.Ferguson was in attendance as a match labelled Ten Hag's funeral turned into a triumph for the much-maligned Dutchman.United shareholder Jim Ratcliffe, who has control of football operations at Old Trafford, was also watching from the stands alongside co-owners Joel and Avie Glazer.Linked with Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino and Gareth Southgate, among others, there is still plenty for Ratcliffe to ponder after United finished eighth in the Premier League this season -- their lowest final position since 1990 -- and crashed out of the Champions League in the group stage.Ten Hag believes a lengthy injury list was the root of the problems and can point to the two trophies he has won in three cup final appearances with United as proof of what he can do when his team are at full strength.Ten Hag ended United's six-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup last year and has now avenged their 2-1 loss to City in the FA Cup final 12 months ago despite finishing 31 points behind the champions this term.United will also qualify for the Europa League, avoiding a first season without European action since 2014-15.They benefitted from an unusually tepid City performance as their double bid fell flat in their first domestic defeat since losing at Aston Villa in the league 171 days ago.Last weekend, City became the first team to win the Premier League in four consecutive seasons.But Guardiola's men looked hungover after the celebrations that followed their sixth title in seven years.City were furious when their strong penalty appeal was rejected inside the first minute after Lisandro Martinez's shove sent Erling Haaland sprawling.Content to sit deep with all 11 men behind the ball, United stifled City impressively and gleefully accepted their gift-wrapped opener in the 30th minute.Diogo Dalot's punt forward should have been dealt with by Josko Gvardiol, but the left-back hesitated as he looked for an offside flag.Gvardiol headed the ball over City keeper Stefan Ortega, who had rashly rushed off his line, leaving Garnacho with the simple task of tapping into the empty net as Ten Hag clenched his fist in celebration.Garnacho, 19, was the first teenager to score in the FA Cup final since Cristiano Ronaldo for United against Millwall 20 years ago.Just nine minutes later, the 19-year-old Mainoo punished more sloppy City defending.Garnacho advanced unchecked down the right wing and found Fernandes, whose superb first-time pass reached the unmarked Mainoo for a clinical close-range finish.City pushed harder after the interval but although Doku's shot slipped through Onana's grasp to set up a tense finale, it wasn't enough to deny United.As the final seconds ticked away, Ten Hag stood in the sunshine nervously waiting to celebrate a dramatic win that could earn an unexpected stay of execution or serve as his final fling.(With inputs from AFP)",Manchester United beat Manchester City 2-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley.

It has been proven more than once that a long camp always helps us. We are working on various aspects of the game, both offensive and defensive,"" said the head coach.""Our fitness levels are getting better each day, and now we enter the phase of working on our tactics.

PARIS: This could be Rafael Nadal ’s last dance at Roland Garros . Then again, maybe not.

“It's a big, big chance that it’s going to be my last Roland Garros,” Nadal said. “But if (you are asking me) that it's 100 percent my last Roland Garros, sorry, I cannot predict what's going to happen.”

“I have been going through a long process of recovery with a very difficult injury, almost two years of suffering, a recovery process that seems like I feel better now,” the 37-year-old said. “I’m not a guy that reacts because I lost there or somewhere else. I react about my personal feelings, and my personal feelings are better now than one month and a half ago.”

“I don't want to close 100 percent the door, because first thing, I’m enjoying playing tennis . Second thing, I’m traveling with the family. They are enjoying. I’m enjoying sharing all this process with them. And third thing, I was not able to explore yet the proper way of how I will be able to play again more or less healthy, playing without limitation.”

Nadal, who will turn 38 in the next few days, asked for time.

“Maybe in a month and a half I say, it's enough, I can't keep going,” he said. “but today, I cannot guarantee that it is going to be the last (Roland Garros).”

Rafael Nadal says he is feeling better,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/rafael-nadal-says-he-is-feeling-better/articleshow/110426163.cms,"PARIS: Rafael Nadal was in black-and-white practice gear, he was leaning on the grayscale, but that was all the vintage the 14-time Roland Garros champion sparked on an afternoon when the sun was in the shade.The 37-year-old’s shots were short of signature crackle and his stride was a mite slow.Nadal enters the Paris Grand Slam following an anemic match schedule courtesy a hip injury that kept him off his beloved terre battue last year for the first time after 18 consecutive appearances. The Spaniard played four matches in 2023 and has logged just four tournaments in 2024.Nadal, bidding to finish a storied career on his terms, at the very least end where he started it on the tennis court, will go up against the fourth-ranked German Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday.He’ll need to blast off the blocks. So, where exactly is Rafael Nadal, on a competitive scale?He is ranked outside the top-250 at No 276, but that, in this case, is just a number against a name. Not a measure of the legend.Nadal, who arrived in Roland Garros more than a week before the start of the fortnight, said he’s feeling better than he has in a long time on the tennis court.“This is the first week since I come back that I’m able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations. That has encouraged me,” said Nadal, who arrived for his pre-championship media interaction in an electric blue tee and a smile to match. “That does not mean that I'm going to play incredible on Monday, no?”The 22-time major winner, who has a glittering 112-3 win-loss record here, retraced his romance at this spectacularly stylish venue.“In some ways this place is magical for me,” he said. “So, if, in the bottom of my heart, I don't have any hope to have success here and to create a beautiful thing this year, I will not be here in front of you guys.”That declaration at once lifted the mood in the packed-to-capacity press room. Nobody wants one of the greatest champions this game has seen, one of the fiercest fighters in all sport, limp into the sunset. That would be a travesty.Nadal, who went down to Hubert Hurkacz in the second round in Rome in his last tournament outing, indicated that he’s able to push more physically.“I don't feel the limitations that I felt in Rome in terms of running,” he said. “I’m not thinking in terms of having amazing results here but thinking about giving myself a little bit more room to think about what can happen in the future.”This then, particularly the last three-four months, has got to be Nadal’s weightiest fight, chasing as he is a wafer-thin chance on the slippery slope of hope. Battling age and wrestling for time.“We did things to try to feel better, and we have been working without a stop to keep progressing, to try to arrive here in a proper way,” he said.Each time Nadal threads the needle with his mélange of heavily spun groundies on a practice court, he’s faced with questions.“I didn't play five-set matches since a long time. I haven’t played this level of opponents since a long time,” he said. “All these questions that you ask me, I’m asking to myself too.”Zverev, more than a decade younger than his opponent, is up to speed having claimed his biggest title in two years ago in Rome last weekThe German is looking to finish a match he couldn’t two years ago when he was wheeled off the court in the middle of their sea-saw semifinal with an ankle injury.“I wanted to play Rafa again, because I didn't want the last memory of me playing against Rafa to be me leaving the court on a wheelchair,’ the 27-year-old said. “For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. I expect him to be at his absolute best. I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time.”Bring out the popcorn, if only because there's hope yet.",Rafael Nadal says he's feeling better than he has in a long time on the tennis court.

Malaysia Masters: PV Sindhu enters women's singles finals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/badminton/malaysia-masters-pv-sindhu-enters-womens-singles-finals/articleshow/110420653.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The two-time Olympian PV Sindhu advanced to the USD 420,000 Malaysia Masters final on Saturday after defeating Thailand's Busanan Ongbamrungphan in a thrilling comeback match in Kuala Lumpur.In an 88-minute marathon semifinal match, world number 20 Busanan was defeated 13-21, 21-16, 21-12 by fifth seed Sindhu, who hasn't won a trophy in the last two years, as she moved closer to winning the BWF World Tour Super 500 title at the Axiata Arena.Sindhu placed second at the Madrid Spain Masters and won the 2022 Singapore Open the previous year.She had defeated the Indian just once in her career-during the 2019 Hong Kong Open-and this was her eighteenth victory over Busanan.In the summit match, world No. 15 Sindhu-who will be vying for her third Olympic medal at the Paris Games in two months-will take on Wang Zhi Yi of China, the second seed and current world No. 7.Though Sindhu has already defeated the Chinese twice in three meetings, the Chinese nevertheless defeated him at the Arctic Open last year.After appearing unmotivated since recovering from a knee injury early in the season, Sindhu-who won silver and bronze in the previous two Olympic games-appears to have regained her spark as she displayed some aggressivebadminton play this week.It has been a while since Sindhu has defeated big guns such as Carolina Marin, Tai Tzu Ying, Chen Yu Fei and Akane Yamaguchi -- whom she is expected to come across at the Paris Olympics. A title triumph here will provide her a major boost ahead of the Summer Games.Despite her overwhelming record against Busanan, it turned out to be a tough fight for Sindhu as she had to do the catching-up job, with the Thai dominating the proceedings in the opening game It was a physical battle as the two tested each other in some high-quality long rallies. In the opening game, the Thai was spot on with her executions whether it was the leap smashes or superb blocks, drops or precise drives.Busanan kept a good pace in the rallies to open up a 8-6 lead with the Indian making a couple of judgement errors at the backline and spraying into the net.A crisscross net shot, a forehand block gave Busanan a 10-7 lead before she took a two-point cushion at the break.The Thai constructed the rallies well, drawing Sindhu to the net and sending her to the flanks. Soon she led 15-9, which she extended to seven points at 17-10. In the end, Sindhu went to net twice to give seven game points to the Thai, who sealed it with an immaculate backhand block.In the second game, Sindhu lagged 2-4 but clawed back when Busanan found the net. Sindhu sent a stretched backhand into the net and then missed another one at the backline as Busanan led 6-4.A fighting Sindhu, however, managed to grab the lead at 8-7 with a smash and moved to the break with a two-point advantage, following a lethal cross court smash.At 12-10, a long rally ended with Busanan faltering with a cross court net shot. The Thai made some judgement errors but managed to keep breathing down Sindhu's neck at 12-14.Sindhu dished out a trademark cross court followed by another down-the-line return to move to a three-point advantage at 16-13.The Indian dominated another rally, leaving Busanan completely out of position to establish an 18-14 lead. Sindhu soon grabbed five game points and converted in her second attempt.Spectacular in the opening game, Busanan completely lost control in the decider as she was erratic and struggled with her court coverage while Sindhu looked aggressive.The Indian quickly took an early 4-1 lead and increased it to 8-3. Busanan started making too many mistakes as Sindhu seized a commanding 11-5 lead at the half. Busanan attempted to narrow the deficit following the last side change, but mistakes once more marred her play, allowing Sindhu to advance to 17-10.With Busanan missing the net once more, the Indian team secured eight match points. Sindhu raised her arm in a restrained joy.","Two-time Olympian PV Sindhu defeats Thailand's Busanan Ongbamrungphan. Sindhu advances to the USD 420,000 Malaysia Masters final.
