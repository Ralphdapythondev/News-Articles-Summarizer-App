When Neeraj Chopra inspired Kishore Jena to 'Go for Paris': The heartwarming backstory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/when-neeraj-chopra-inspired-kishore-jena-to-go-for-paris-the-heartwarming-backstory/articleshow/111797097.cms,"Kishore Jena - From volleyball to challenging Neeraj Chopra as a 'spearman'

Kishore Jena , fondly addressed as 'Jena Babu' whenever he is throwing spears in and around his home state Odisha, built his javelin career under the shadow of Olympic and world champion Neeraj Chopra -- until his beaming image standing beside his idol, Neeraj, on the Hangzhou Asian Games podium introduced him to the world.The Asiad silver is Jena's claim-to-fame story, but not many are aware of the little backstory to it from Hungary, a month before Jena finished behind Neeraj in Hangzhou, which booked him his maiden ticket to the Olympics.It was the World Championships in Budapest. Jena was making his debut at the elite tournament, and finished a commendable fifth while watching Neeraj become a world champion.Jena's then personal best of 84.77 fell an agonizing 43 cm behind the automatic Olympic qualification mark of 85.20. He returned to the hotel room a little despondent, even though a top-five finish in the final that had the likes of Neeraj, Arshad Nadeem, Jakub Vadlejch, Julian Weber and other top world throwers was no mean feat.That's when Neeraj called Jena to his room and inspired him in his own unique way.""The biggest thing about him, apart from his performance and achievements, is that you can ask him whatever, and he will reply like he is just one of us, a normal athlete. He never thinks like he is a big player,"" Jena told Timesofidia.com during an interview, as he narrated Neeraj's gesture that touched his heart.""The day our competition at the World Championships finished, I went back to our room around midnight. Our flight was early the next morning; we had to leave by 4 - 4:30 am,"" said Jena.Neeraj was, perhaps, aware of Jena's state of mind at that point.""Neeraj bhai called me to his room,"" Jena continued. ""He had qualified for the Paris Olympics during the World Championships with a gold medal. So he received a small piece of memorabilia, which had 'Go for Paris' written on it.""""He gifted that to me and said, 'Jena, keep this and work hard. I'll see you at the Asian Games next. Do well there'.""Neeraj's words turned prophetic.Jena not only improved his personal best at the Asian Games with a throw of 87.54, but also won a silver medal to share the podium with Neeraj who successfully defended his 2018 gold with his season best 88.88m.The other big result of that performance was that it ensured Jena will be on the flight to Paris.""I still have it with me,"" Jena said about the little gift from Neeraj that inspired him.""Ek crore mei ek aadmi aisa hota hai (there is only one person like Neeraj among a crore).""","Kishore Jena won silver in javelin at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. Jena finished behind world champion Neeraj Chopra at the World Championships in Budapest. A month before the World Championship, Jena received a gift from Chopra.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of India's white-ball tour of Sri Lanka, the national selectors and new head coach Gautam Gambhir are contemplating taking a hard call on appointing the captain for T20Is.TOI understands that the think-tank has to decide between Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav .According to sources, Surya has been deemed as a more stable candidate to lead the team.""Hardik was the natural successor of Rohit Sharma since he has been the vice-captain. But the selection committee and Gambhir are leaning towards Surya. The argument is the uncertainty over Hardik's availability in every series that India plays. They want a stable captain going forward with the T20 World Cup in 2026,"" a BCCI source told TOI.Hardik's workload has been a major issue over the last five years and rarely has he played back-to-back series. It may be noted that Gambhir has previously worked with Surya at Kolkata Knight Riders in 2014 and had even promoted him to vice-captaincy. Surya has been the top T20 batter in the world for a while now.""The coach and selectors spoke to both players on Tuesday evening. The scenario had to be made clear. It will be up to Hardik to reassure the management about his availability. A final call will be taken in the selection meeting soon,"" the source said.Hardik has already recused himself from the three ODIs in Sri Lanka citing personal reasons. It will be also interesting to see who will be made the ODI captain since Rohit has also asked for a break.KL Rahul has led the Indian team before.

You should have players who can anchor the innings and change in rules has also made a huge difference. That time we used to have only on new ball, now we've got two new balls and five fielders inside, so the role of the part-timer has gone out of the window. You don't see enough reverse swing anymore, you don't see enough purchase for finger spinners as well, but I always feel that when we talk about this new approach, you got to identify players who can adapt to those roles, that template very easily. Some people just cannot adapt to that template. So why push them to play in a certain way which doesn't come naturally to them. So for me I think indentifying players and at the same time getting the right mix is very very important rather than think that we have to play with a certain template so we got to select all the 15 with a similar mindset or with a similar template.""India have not won a global title in the ODI format since winning the Champions Trophy in 2013, and Gambhir would want to change that in the upcoming year.Gambhir is the only Indian -- and one of four international cricketers including Don Bradman, Jacques Kallis and Mohammad Yousuf -- to have scored centuries in five successive Test matches.",Gautam Gambhir is India's new head coach.

Barring

Hardik Pandya

, India does not have a genuine pace-bowling allrounder...

India's outgoing bowling coach Paras Mhambrey has worked within BCCI's ecosystem from 2015 as Rahul Dravid's trusted lieutenant. During their last assignment, they saw India lift the T20 World Cup in Barbados last month.""It's rewarding to see that the process that we started has seen players come through the ranks, go on to play for India and eventually share the dressing room when they were lifting the trophy. Rahul was very clear in his head what he wanted to do and backed it all the way - be it with the U-19 and India 'A' teams or at the NCA,"" Mhambrey tells TOI in an interview.Rahul was very clear that we had to stick to a 'process-first' policy with the developmental teams. Results were not the focus. It was ensured that every player on a tour got at least a game. That didn't mean that all of them got equal opportunities. But we had to ensure that no one was denied game time. Players felt secure and as a result the 'A' teams and U-19 teams lost very few matches. Thriving 'A' and U-19 programmes were instrumental in making sure the players never felt out of place when they toured with the senior team.I believe the biggest achievement during our tenure has been assimilation of data. When we started, there was no data at the U-19 and India 'A' level. There were no video analysts assigned. We had to run around and chase state associations to keep data of players. I remember there was a series in New Zealand when I had to sit all day at a spot holding a camera to shoot the game from the perfect angle. Devraj Raut at NCA was a massive help. As we got data across all aspects of the game, we could formalize a lot of programmes and streamline the structure. When you have data with you, it's easier to get players on board with your planning such as workload management.Then there was the decision to limit players to just one U-19 World Cup. Again, a strong 'A' programme and 'emerging' programme helped bridge the gap and carry out the transition of players.It was different. We took time to build a relationship with senior players. You can't be dealing in the same way with the likes of Shami , Ashwin , Virat or Rohit as you did with the players coming through BCCI programmes. Here the most important thing was conversations. Building relationships is crucial. That's why we got to a place when we could have an honest conversation with Ishant Sharma in South Africa and then the likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar to tell them the vision we had for the team going forward. Even with the likes of Siraj, who has come through our 'A' programme, we were having different conversations and that was result-oriented.It's important to have those discussions with Shami and Ashwin about their future plans and then lay out a plan. When we decided to invest in youth, we made sure they were not alone in the park shouldering all responsibilities. Be it Arshdeep or Avesh, we made sure they were always bowling alongside senior bowlers.You can't put a timeline on that. You have to be patient with it. We started in 2015 and we had that pool by 2020. If you look at Arshdeep's evolution, he played in the U-19 World Cup in 2018 and he was representing India in 2022 before really becoming an integral part in 2024. A young pace bowler takes four-five years to hit his peak. You can't simply rush them through.He got just one game in the U-19 World Cup because we were giving opportunities to everyone. Then he was out of the system. When he got picked in the IPL , I thought it was going to be interesting. But the best thing about him is that he is all about bowling. He loves to keep on bowling. He doesn't have a cluttered mind when he is at the top of the mark. He has bowled in the toughest phases. Even in IPL, where you were seeing consistent scores of above 200, his economy was under nine. Just the dedication towards bowling and a clear head has seen him rise.It is a bit tough with the younger generation of cricketers who have grown up seeing IPL. When Rahul and I were working with the junior teams, we talked a lot about the history of the game so they could understand the importance of all formats. Only 314 players have played Test cricket for India. What could be more glamorous than becoming a part of that elite list? And if you talk to the likes of Bumrah, Shami and Siraj, who have been doing well in all three formats, you will know how much they value Test cricket. If you do well in Test cricket, your value goes up a few notches.You have to understand what your advantage is according to the resources you have. If you have far better spinners then obviously spinning tracks will be your advantage. But raging rank turners are not the answer. It brings the touring team into the game big time because anybody who could roll his arm over and land the ball at a desired spot can run through your batting. It becomes a lottery.You need to identify such players across the country. There won't be many pace-bowling allrounders. The problem is that most of them give up bowling to sustain themselves. But if you can manage to find five-six potential allrounders from U-19 and domestic cricket, you have to keep working with them. Give them confidence. The Impact Player rule in IPL doesn't help. But you have to be at it. We have got Shivam Dube back to bowling. You have to give these bowlers overs in matches so that they start backing themselves.","India's outgoing bowling coach Paras Mhambrey has worked within BCCI's ecosystem from 2015 as Rahul Dravid's trusted lieutenant.

Under his guidance, KKR clinched their first IPL title in ten years during the recent season.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) officially named Gambhir as the successor to batting icon Rahul Dravid on July 9.The former Indian batter will now take charge of the national team, leaving behind his successful stint with the Kolkata-based franchise.Gambhir shared a touching video on X, showcasing his strong bond with the Kolkata franchise, which he led to two IPL titles as captain. In the message, Gambhir recognized the significance of his journey with Kolkata, stating, ""are a story, are a team"".However, he also emphasized that there are greater legacies to be created and more ambitious scripts to be penned together, as he embarks on a new chapter in his career as a member of the Indian cricket team's coaching staff.""I smile when you smile. I cry when you cry. I win when you win. I lose, when you lose. I dream when you dream. I achieve when you achieve. I believe with you and I become with you. I am you, Kolkata, I am just one of you. I know your struggles and I know where it hurts. The rejections have crushed me but like you, I wake up embracing hope. I get beaten every day but like you, I am yet to be defeated. They tell me to be popular, I tell them to be a winner. I am you, Kolkata I am just one of you. This Kolkata air talks to me. The sounds, the streets here, the traffic jams. They all convey how you feel. I hear what you say, but I know what you mean. I know you are emotional. So am I. I know you're demanding. So am I. Kolkata, we are a bond. We are a story. We are a team,"" said Gambhir in his video message.""And now the time has come when we have to create some legacies together. The time has come when we have to write some bigger and bolder scripts. The script not with purple ink but in that blue, the treasured India blue. As we both take our fresh card we promise each other that we will never walk alone. It will always be shoulder-to-shoulder, hand in hand. It will all be for the tricolor. It will all be about our India,"" he added.Gambhir's tenure as mentor of KKR was highly successful, as he revamped the team's approach after a few disappointing seasons. The opening pair of Phil Salt and Sunil Narine led the charge, making KKR one of the most formidable and aggressive batting lineups in the tournament. The spin bowling combination of Varun Chakravarthy and Narine, along with the youthful exuberance of Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora, also contributed significantly to the team's championship victory.The championship triumph also elevated the status of Indian middle-order batsman Shreyas Iyer, who had been excluded from the BCCI's central contract list earlier in the year. Following Gambhir's success with KKR, fans are eagerly anticipating his leadership of the Indian national team, hoping that he will guide them to numerous victories with the same aggressive, winning, and never-give-up attitude.","Gautam Gambhir steps down from his role as coach of Kolkata Knight Riders.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer and selector Saba Karim has lauded Shubman Gill 's leadership in the T20I series against Zimbabwe but highlighted the need for more consistency in his batting.Gill, who captained the young Indian team to a 4-1 series win in his first outing as captain, emerged as the highest run-getter with 170 runs at an average of 42.5 and a strike-rate of 125.93.Karim commended Gill on his leadership and handling of pressure, especially after India lost the first T20I.Speaking on Sony Sports, Karim remarked, ""Shubman Gill as a captain and a batter. I was expecting a little more consistency in Shubman Gill's batting. That was a little lacking. However, he performed fantastically as a captain.

'If they take us for granted...': Joshua Da Silva on England's focus on Ashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/if-they-take-us-for-granted-joshua-da-silva-on-englands-focus-on-ashes/articleshow/111792006.cms,"NEW DELHI: Joshua Da Silva , the West Indies wicketkeeper-batter, expressed his thoughts on England's approach to the current series, stating that their keen attention on the upcoming 2025-26 Ashes series against Australia could present an opportunity for his team.De Silva believes that this focus could work in favor of the West Indies as they aim to level the series in the crucial second Test.The second Test is set to commence on Thursday at Trent Bridge in Nottingham, following England's commanding victory by an innings and 114 runs at Lord's , which gave them a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.It was also the retirement game for the pace legend James Anderson , who retires from the sport with a total of 991 international wickets, including 704 Test scalps. From Tuesday onwards, Anderson took on a new role within the team as a bowling coach.The decision to appoint Anderson as a coach, along with the introduction of pacer Gus Atkinson and wicketkeeper-batter Jamie Smith, was made with a clear objective: to prepare for the 2025-26 Ashes series in Australia. England are determined to reclaim the coveted urn, having last lost it during the 2017-18 season. The team's last Ashes series victory on Australian soil dates back to the 2010-11 campaign, making the upcoming series a crucial opportunity to break the long-standing drought.Silva expressed his understanding of England's approach to prepare for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia, despite facing criticism from the cricketing world for potentially underestimating their current opponents, West Indies and Sri Lanka, who are touring the UK this summer. As a wicketkeeper-batter, Silva comprehends the significance of planning ahead for a crucial assignment like an away Ashes series.However, Silva also pointed out that if England were to underestimate the West Indies, it could provide an opportunity for the Caribbean side to clinch a crucial victory and keep the series alive.""That is their biggest fixture of their calendar,"" Da Silva said, as quoted by ESPNCricinfo.""So if they are looking forward, they are looking to groom some players to make sure they have their team ready for them. I do not think it is wrong of them at all.""""Nah, it does not hurt us. I do not study it especially. We still have to play the cricket. If they take us for granted we might get a win, or might win the series. For me, I take that as a favour,"" he concluded his point.Da Silva acknowledged that the team's batting performance was subpar in the opening Test match. However, he pointed out a few encouraging signs, such as batsmen getting decent starts, despite his personal scores of zero and nine in the two innings.""Obviously in the batting a few of us did not stick our hands up. We had a few soft dismissals. We are pretty disappointed after the first Test. We have put that behind us, we have had our discussions, and we are looking forward to the second Test. We are doing everything we can, rebuilding, and going hard forward into the next Test,"" said Silva.""It might not look like it, but we have taken a few positives. A lot of guys got starts and just did not carry on. We talked about soaking up more pressure and how we are going to deal with those situations if we are put in them again. Not losing wickets in clusters...""It is about reminding ourselves of the process and trusting that process because all of us have a different way of going about it. It is just about trusting our own game and making sure we get the job done,"" he concluded.",West Indies wicketkeeper-batter Joshua Da Silva believes England's focus on Ashes could work in their favor.

Hampshire captain James Vince pleas for peace after persistent attacks on property,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/hampshire-captain-james-vince-pleas-for-peace-after-persistent-attacks-on-property/articleshow/111790028.cms,"NEW DELHI: James Vince , the England cricketer and captain of Hampshire , has issued a public statement concerning the relentless assaults on his property, which have compelled his family to abandon their residence in Southampton .Vince and his loved ones had relished the serenity of their village home to the east of Southampton for close to eight years.However, their tranquillity was abruptly disrupted earlier this year when two alarming incidents occurred, targeting Vince's house and vehicles. As a result, the family was left with no choice but to evacuate and live in a state of constant apprehension.The first attack occurred in the early hours of April 15. Vince, 33, recounted the harrowing experience: ""My wife and I woke suddenly to a load of smashing and alarms going off. We had no idea what was going on and it was obviously very unnerving, so we rushed straight to get the kids to make sure they were safe. They were very shaken up,"" Vince told The Telegraph.When the authorities reached the location, the assailants were nowhere to be found, having fled the area and leaving a path of devastation in their wake. According to a witness living nearby, a vehicle was observed hastily departing from the vicinity of the incident.The extent of the destruction inflicted upon the vehicles and residence was significant, forcing the family to vacate the premises for a period of time as restoration work commenced. Despite the implementation of surveillance systems and warning devices, the feeling of security had been permanently compromised.Just a mere seven days after his return, Vince's deepest worries became a reality on May 1 when another assault occurred. During this incident, he was awake and upstairs in his home.""That meant I was able to get downstairs quite quickly and had more of a sense of what was going on. It wasn't such a surprise either, because it had happened before. I think they saw the activity in the house and left quickly,"" he explained.Vince and his family were subjected to another terrifying attack shortly after midnight, following their attendance at a charity event in support of Chris Wood , Vince's fellow team member. The assailants hurled bricks, shattering the windows of both the vehicles and the residence.The series of assaults has left Vince and law enforcement officials perplexed. Thorough inquiries conducted by law enforcement agencies, private security firms, and intelligence companies have failed to uncover a definitive reason behind the attacks. Despite the lack of a clear motive, Vince maintains a strong belief that the perpetrators have targeted his family erroneously.""All the experts we've spoken to say it looks like a money issue, unpaid debts, or something,"" Vince said. ""We have nothing to hide and know we have never been involved in anything like this. We just desperately want this to stop.""Footage from the new security cameras has provided some clues. It shows a man with a torch passing bricks over a wall to another man, who then throws them at the house and cars. The second man wore a hoodie with a Gym King logo and had his face covered. This, Vince hopes, might be a key piece of information to identify the culprits.The attacks coincidentally took place on days when Hampshire had home matches, adding another layer of mystery. Despite enhanced security measures, the family remains on edge, fearing a third attack. ""We don't want to risk the same thing happening again,"" Vince said. ""It's not fair for my wife or children to have to go through it again.""The emotional toll on the family has been immense, especially on Vince's young children. ""Something like this is hugely disruptive in our lives, especially for our children, who have understandably been affected and unsettled by the situation. Having said that, I'm amazed and extremely proud of how they have dealt with it. We have received great support locally, and from within cricket,"" Vince shared.The family has now turned to the public for help, hoping someone might recognise the attackers or have information that could solve the mystery. ""If anyone knows anything, or sees anything in the footage of the attack that could lead to anything, please contact us or Hampshire Police. It could be the final piece of information we need to find out what is going on and get our lives back to normal,"" Vince urged.Hampshire Police confirmed the incidents, stating: ""Two incidents of criminal damage at an address during the early hours of April 15 and May 11. On both occasions, two cars were damaged, and the front room windows smashed.""","England cricketer James Vince has issued a public statement concerning the relentless assaults on his property.

You can notice the difference in the MCA's administration from 2022 till now, compared to that of 2019-22. In the last 20 months, we've won eight titles, including the Ranji Trophy.

The plan will be to understand how to execute the plans and how to take the legacy of Kale and Mumbai cricket ahead.""TOI had reported in its edition on July 6 that Ajinkya Naik had emerged as a formidable MCA presidential candidate. Significantly, Ajinkya Naik’s nomination was proposed by former India women’s captain Diana Edulji . “I definitely feel that I’m backing the right horse. Kale and Ajinkya were a very good team as a president and secretary. He is absolutely aware of what Mumbai cricket desires. I’m sure that he would be able to carry forward the legacy of MCA, and maybe improve on Kale’s legacy, or make one of his own,” Edulji said.Present at Ajinkya Naik's media briefing on Tuesday were Edulji and MCA's cricket advisor and former Mumbai captain Milind Rege.Pitching himself as someone who loves developing cricketing infrastructure, Ajinkya said: “During monsoons, we don't have such an infrastructure, which can give outdoor-like feel. The vision is that instead of going to other places, in Mumbai's MMR jurisdiction, we will have our own academy which will have outdoor feel. I have see a lot of facilities in UK, Australia (and) there is one in Ghansoli. On the same lines, we should have one where there is actual grass and actual pitch because what we have right now is a turf pitch.”Explaining why he withdrew his nomination, Patil said: ""I was asked by our senior leader (Maharashtra congress chief) Nana Patole to withdraw as both Sanjay and Ajinkya are MCA's office-bearers and will go into a cooling period next year, when the next MCA elections take place.

In a candid statement, Mishra acknowledged that his officially recorded age is inaccurate, differing from his actual age by a year.The leg spinner acknowledged that the controversy surrounding his age played a role in his ability to participate in age-group cricket and gain entry into the cricketing system.The 41-year-old asserted that he was unaware of the deception and shifted the responsibility to his coach from his early years.Mishra disclosed that falsifying his age granted him an additional year to compete in U-19 cricket .""Let me tell you, I have a one-year discrepancy, and my coach helped with that. I didn't even know about it. The coach called my home and asked for one more year for me. It was quite an emotional story. I was surprised and asked, 'How?'

I agreed,"" said Mishra in an interaction on Shubhankar Mishra's YouTube Channel.During a lighthearted conversation following the 2024 IPL match between Lucknow Super Giants and Mumbai Indians, former MI captain Rohit Sharma playfully teased Mishra about his age. Rohit humorously asked Mishra if he was truly just three years his senior, sparking a discussion about the topic.During the same interaction, Mishra also talked about what separates Rohit Sharma from Virat Kohli .""The difference is in the nature. Rohit is very open with his players. A very good thing about Rohit is that when I met him for the first time, he is the same like he is now.

"Suryakumar Yadav set to pip Hardik Pandya, emerges as dark horse for India's T20I captaincy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/suryakumar-yadav-set-to-pip-hardik-pandya-emerges-as-dark-horse-for-indias-t20i-captaincy/articleshow/111788904.cms,"Thrust on domestic availability

NEW DELHI: Suryakumar Yadav , the dynamic batsman, has unexpectedly emerged as a strong contender to lead India's T20 team until the 2026 World Cup, potentially surpassing Hardik Pandya , who was previously considered the natural choice for the position.Despite Pandya's availability for the upcoming T20I series against Sri Lanka, it has come to light that Suryakumar, who led India in eight T20Is against Australia and South Africa in the previous year, is the favoured choice of the newly appointed head coach Gautam Gambhir and the chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar .It is understood that Gambhir and Agarkar had a discussion with Pandya earlier in the evening, explaining the decision to finalise a long-term option to ensure stability within the team.The T20 captaincy position became available following Rohit Sharma 's retirement from international cricket in the shortest format after India's triumphant World Cup campaign in the West Indies last month.Pandya, a key contributor to that victory, will be absent from the three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka due to ""personal reasons"".The T20I series is scheduled from July 27 to 30 in Pallekele, followed by the ODIs from August 2 to 7 in Colombo. The squad announcement for the series is expected in the coming days.""Hardik Pandya was India's T2O vice-captain under Rohit Sharma. He is completely fit and available for the three-match T20I series and was supposed to lead the side but there is a very strong feeling that SKY would be the potential leader not only for the Sri Lanka series but till the 2026 World Cup,"" a seniorBCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.""Hardik's break from ODIs is for very personal reasons. He doesn't have any fitness issue as is being suggested in the media,"" the official said.Suryakumar, aged 33, is considered one of the most well-liked individuals within the Indian cricket team. His rise to prominence as a T20 player occurred during his stint with the Kolkata Knight Riders, where he played under the leadership of Gautam Gambhir, who gave him the moniker 'SKY'.Although Hardik Pandya was seen as the natural choice to succeed Rohit Sharma, several factors have influenced the decision-making process. His lackluster performance as the captain of the Mumbai Indians, coupled with the selectors' unwillingness to allow him to pick and choose his assignments, has impacted his chances.The selectors are open to the idea of Pandya participating in the Vijay Hazare Trophy this season to gain some experience in the 50-over format.Regarding the ODIs, an official confirmed that Pandya has requested leave and has already informed Rohit, who is also taking a break from this series.For the ODI series, KL Rahul , who led the team in the previous series in South Africa, and Shubman Gill are the frontrunners for the leadership role.Jay Shah, the BCCI secretary, has emphasized the importance of star cricketers participating in domestic tournaments when they are not engaged in national team commitments. However, he mentioned that players such as Rohit, Virat Kohli, and Jasprit Bumrah will be exempted from this requirement.The BCCI is keen on having the remaining Test specialists take part in at least one or two Duleep Trophy matches scheduled for August. This participation is seen as a preparation for the upcoming Test series against Bangladesh and New Zealand.""This time there is no zonal selection committee for Duleep Trophy. Only the national selection committee will pick Duleep teams.""All Test team contenders will be picked. For Rohit, Virat and Bumrah, it will be their choice if they want to play or not,"" the source added.","Suryakumar Yadav has emerged as a strong contender to lead India's T20 team until the 2026 World Cup.

His crucial wicket of Heinrich Klaasen during the final and his decisive final over, in which he dismissed David Miller , turned the game in India's favor.This tournament served as a redemption story for Hardik, who had faced criticism and online trolling during the IPL 2024 after taking over the captaincy of the Mumbai Indians from Rohit Sharma . He was accused of betraying the MI franchise, Rohit, and his former team, Gujarat Titans, which he had led to the IPL title in 2022.India's 11-year-long ICC trophy drought finally ended as Virat Kohli (76), Hardik (3/20), and Jasprit Bumrah (2/18) played pivotal roles in the team's seven-run win over South Africa in the final at Barbados on June 29.Virat's masterclass knock helped India reach 176/7, while Bumrah and Pandya's pace bowling restricted the Proteas to 169/8, snatching victory from a challenging position.",Hardik Pandya thanks fans in Vadodara for their enthusiastic reception after Indian team's victory in ICC T20 World Cup.

He mentioned that the team revolved around three key players: Virat Kohli , AB de Villiers , and Chris Gayle .Parthiv had two separate stints with RCB, first in the 2014 edition of the IPL and then from 2018 to 2020. During his initial stint in 2014, the trio of Kohli, de Villiers and Gayle were at the height of their careers, dominating the opposition with their exceptional batting skills. However, when he returned to the franchise in 2018, Gayle was no longer a part of the team.""I played for RCB, I've been there for four years. The team is always about individuals, it's not about the team. And then everyone who comes out of that team will say that.

NEW DELHI: The Australian cricket team is set to embark on a white-ball tour of the United Kingdom in September, with matches scheduled against Scotland and England. Chief selector George Bailey announced a 15-man squad on Monday, with Mitchell Marsh named as the captain.The squad also includes 16-year-old Cooper Connolly , who has received his first call-up for the T20I matches on the tour.Connolly's journey to this moment began three years ago at Willowmoore Park in Benoni, South Africa, a venue located about 20 kilometers east of Johannesburg.In a less glamorous setting compared to the recent BBL final at Optus Stadium, which drew over 50,000 fans, Connolly experienced a defining moment in his young career.Despite the modest crowd at Willowmoore Park, the stakes were high for the then 16-year-old Connolly. He was given the opportunity to play in the final game of the 2020 men's Under-19 World Cup against the West Indies after Jake Fraser-McGurk had to withdraw from the tournament due to a monkey scratch incident.Connolly seized the moment and scored a 47-ball half-century, showcasing his ability to perform under pressure. Over the next four years, Connolly's talent and contributions played a significant role in thePerth Scorchers ' success, helping them secure a record fifth men's Big Bash title.Additionally, he was instrumental in Western Australia 's three consecutive Sheffield Shield victories. His consistent performances and ability to deliver in crucial moments have now earned him a place in Australia's T20 squad for the upcoming tour of the UK, marking his first international call-up.The call from national selector Tony Dodemaide was a ""surreal moment"" for Connolly. ""I couldn't sit still, I was walking around for about 10-15 minutes, it was such a surreal moment,"" IANS quoted Connolly as saying to cricket.com.au.Despite his success with the Scorchers and WA, Connolly admits that he is venturing into uncharted territory. ""I've never experienced this level (international cricket), so it'll be nice to learn from some of the guys going, some quality players including the likes of Travis Head,"" he said.""I'll get (over) there, get learning and hopefully, if I get my opportunity, I'll make the most of it.""Despite his relatively short stint in top-level cricket, having participated in just 15 matches since his BBL debut in January of the previous year, Connolly demonstrated remarkable versatility. His exposure to various playing conditions, such as leading the Australian team at the 2022 U19 World Cup held in the West Indies and being part of a tour to India, further bolstered his qualifications.Connolly's capacity to excel under high-pressure situations was showcased during the BBL 12 final against Brisbane Heat. He played a pivotal role in the Scorchers' victory by contributing an essential 25 runs off just 11 deliveries, remaining unbeaten. This ability to perform in crucial moments established him as a dependable middle-order finisher, a position that was previously occupied by experienced players such as Matty Wade and Marcus Stoinis.As he prepares for the UK tour , Connolly remains grounded and focused on his growth. At just 20, he recognises that he is far from a finished product. ""I'm trying to take every opportunity because I want to allow myself the best opportunity to represent my country in any position that's required,"" he said.Despite his desire to open the batting, he acknowledges the learning curve and aims to excel in the middle-order role where he has already shown promise.""I found my way a little bit towards the back end of the Big Bash last season at six and worked out how to play that role a bit better. I still want to open the batting, it's quite a good spot to be.""It's just going to take some time and it was something new to me, I haven't had that much exposure or experience with it so over time I'll hopefully get better and maybe get some opportunities in coming years.""Connolly frequently reminisces about his experience in Benoni in February 2020, a pivotal point that catalyzed his swift ascent. The event in Benoni served as a launchpad for Connolly's career, instilling in him the self-assurance needed to pursue his aspirations.""That tournament doesn't feel like a long ago at all,"" he said. ""I made (64 off 53 balls) at 16 years of age which was a real confidence booster for myself, I thought I could potentially make it to the next level.""It was strange circumstances that I got the opportunity and I just tried to make the most of it as much as I could. It's always nice to have in the back of your mind but then again I was 16 at the first one and 18 at the last one, there's so much growth that has happened between then and now.""And I feel like there's so much more growth I can give to my cricketing ability and hopefully I can show some of my talent if that opportunity presents (in the UK).""It's pretty surreal to be saying that I could be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with some of these guys, it won't feel real for the first bit but hopefully I can settle in … have some fun and see what happens.""",Cooper Connolly named in Australia's T20 squad for tour of the UK. The 16-year- old will play against Scotland and England on the tour. Connolly's first international call-up came at the 2020 U19 World Cup in South Africa.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111786142,imgsize-30988,width-400,resizemode-4/111786142.jpg"

UEFA Euro 2024: Spain bask in bench strength,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/uefa-euro-2024-spain-bask-in-bench-strength/articleshow/111771032.cms,"A bold and beautiful Spain sailed over every hurdle that came in their way over the last one month. While they were taking teams apart across different cities of Germany, they were also breaking a few age-old perceptions that have become part and parcel of Spanish football .Since the turn of the century, and more specifically following the Leo Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo era, the modern-day consumer of world football had come to believe that there's nothing more to Spanish football than El Clasico.The last time there was a club-country double in European competitions was way back in 1988 when PSV Eindhoven and The Netherlands won the two titles. Real Madrid and Spain have done an encore 36 years later, but it can be safely said that these two titles are completely independent of each other.Yes, Real's Dani Carvajal had the captain's armband on when Spain finally won it, and Barcelona 's Lamine Yamal was the talisman who kept delivering the goods time and time again, but this victory wasn't just about the two elite-team players. There was a bit of Barca influence with Dani Olmo and Marc Cucurella both being products of the Catalan giants' youth set-up La Masia, but they have played all their football in other clubs of Spain and abroad.Let's look at the two scorers of Sunday - Nico Williams and Mikel Oyarzabal. Not many are aware that they play in opposing clubs of one of the most fiercely contested derbies in Europe - the Basque derby . While Nico is still a part of Athletic Bilbao (he may not be one at the end of the summer transfer window), Oyarzabal plays for Real Sociedad, one of the most consistent Spanish clubs which played in the Champions League this year. Add to them goalkeeper Unai Simon and defender Le Normand - both from the Basque region - and we have a team which is significantly different from the 2012 Euro winning side, which had six Barcelona and four Real players in the starting XI. Meanwhile, the man of the tournament Rodri, who now plays for Manchester City, is a Villarreal product, a team that most Manchester United fans would remember from that Europa final marathon tie-break loss in 2021.It's not just about the personnel. The current lot's style and approach is significantly different from that of both Real and Barca. This Spanish team does revel in possession, but it is not meaningless possession of Luis Enrique's 2022 World Cup team, that seemed a pale shadow of the tiki-taka masters of the earlier decade.The Spanish coach Luis de la Fuente - himself a Basque who played most of his football for Bilbao - understood very early that he doesn't have the quality of Xavi Hernandez, Iniesta and Sergio Busquets in his line-up to play the old tiki-taka style. Rather, the players have the zest and speed of a technically gifted lot which is ready to press high when required and launch lightning fast counters when that's the call of the hour. There has also been a shift in style with the fast wingers on two ends of the pitch calling the shots instead of million passes in the middle of the park with the hope of one breakthrough ball.This pragmatism and fluidity of approach with a group of players who don't have the ego of superstars, but the work ethic of world beaters, helped de la Fuente create a team for all seasons.Come next World Cup, four magnificent Barcelona youngsters - Pedri, Gavi, Fermin Lopez and Pau Cubarsi - should be in the mix and the red of La Roja could be the brightest colour in world football for a while.","The last time there was a club-country double in European competitions was way back in 1988 when PSV Eindhoven and The Netherlands won the two titles.

UEFA Euro 2024: Yamal and Williams help La Roja out of Tiki-Taka rut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/uefa-euro-2024-yamal-and-williams-help-la-roja-out-of-tiki-taka-rut/articleshow/111770918.cms,"NEW STYLE

Player of the tournament: Rodri

Young player of the tournament: Lamine Yamal

Player of the final: Nico Williams

BARCELONA: Spain arrived in Germany with no huge stars or real expectations. Six weeks later, Luis de la Fuente 's team heads home with a European Championship title to celebrate and reason to believe in a bright future.The youthful spark of Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams combined perfectly with the veteran poise of Rodri and other mainstays who had yet to win a major trophy as Spain completed its superb Euro 2024 with a 2-1 win over England on Sunday.The key was making Spain a more dynamic attacking team to end a decade of "" tiki-taka "" misfires.""We hope this can keep going and we can shoot for the World Cup ,"" the 22-year-old Williams said after scoring the opening goal.The euphoria was justified.Spain won all seven games - with none going to penalties - and scored a record 15 goals at a European Championship.Spain downed Croatia and Italy in the group phase before eliminating Germany and France to reach the final.""We made history,"" Rodri said after the game. ""We made history beating four world champions in a row."" Rodri was named the player of the tournament, even without playing in the second half of the final due to a leg problem.The title ends a 12-year wait since a group piloted by Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez dominated world soccer after sweeping up the 2008 and 2012 Euros and the 2010 World Cup. ""The previous generations showed us the way,"" Rodri said. The only member of the team who knew what it was like to win a major title was the 38-year-old Jesus Navas, who played at the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. Fittingly, Iniesta, Xavi and former Spain striker David Villa were together in the stands at the Olympiastadion to watch how this new batch of players added a new dimension to Spain's game.While nowhere close to England's anguishing title drought since the 1966 World Cup, Spain had entered a period of underachieving since their success at Euro 2012. Their attempts to maintain the ""tiki-taka"" ball-possession playing style failed. In Germany, however, Spain deployed some new weapons that left defences scrambling to cover attacks from all angles. The imprint of those great Spain teams was still there to be seen, of course. Rodri and fellow midfielder Fabian Ruiz could latch onto the ball when required. Yet the strength of Spain shifted to the wings.Yamal put on a show each game from the right side. The Barcelona forward, who turned 17 a day before the final, scored an instant classic of a goal to help beat France 2-1 in the semi-finals, and he delivered his fourth assist of the tournament to set up Williams' goal against England.Williams romped on the other flank, doubling up with Marc Cucurella to make a duo that no defenders could handle. Cucurella delivered the pass for Mikel Oyarzabal to score the winner over England. Williams, the Athletic Bilbao forward and Leipzig's Dani Olmo are likely going to draw the attention of major clubs.",Spain beat England 2-1 in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin. Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams were key to Spain's success. Spain won all seven games and scored a record 15 goals at a European Championship. Rodri was named the player of the tournament.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111770893,imgsize-105032,width-400,resizemode-4/111770893.jpg"

The Italian had won three of their last four meetings.""Overall, I was inferior on the court. He was the better player,"" the 24-time major winner said.

dreams of one day sitting 'at same table' as

Djokovic

, Nadal and Federer

LONDON: Carlos Alcaraz took ownership of Wimbledon 's Centre Court in signature style. The 21-year-old was leaping into the air and slamming forehands one minute and getting down on the grass and picking up a volley off his shoelaces the next.He was all over the court, covering ground, corner to corner, baseline to net and back again without really breaking a sweat.The Spaniard thumped down serves at 136 mph and came up with feather light dropshots. Like a real estate mogul marking territory, he knew every blade of grass on the rectangle. ""I've never seen him serve that way, 136. I've never seen him serve that fast,"" Novak Djokovic marvelled.Alcaraz, just the second man in the Open Era to win his first four Grand Slam finals, Roger Federer won his first seven, is in a race with the record books. ""I've seen and heard all the stats,"" he said. ""I try not to think about it too much. It's a really great start to my career, but I have to keep going.""Alcaraz has Djokovic's 24 Grand Slams, Rafael Nadal 22 and Roger Federer 20 in his sights. That's the goal post he's aiming for. ""At the end of my career, I want to sit at the same table as the big guys. That's my dream right now,"" the two-time Wimbledon champion said. ""It doesn't matter if I already won four Grand Slams at the age of 21. If I don't keep going, it doesn't matter. I will try to keep winning and end my career with a lot of Grand Slam titles.""The world No. 3, who turns to the golf course to relax, reiterated the importance of building. Brick by brick. ""I'm happy with the work I'm doing with my team, I'm proud of myself, all the things that I'm doing great. It has been unbelievable, an amazing journey so far,"" said Alcaraz, whose long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero has been the conductor of his career.""I don't know what my limit is. I don't want to think about it,"" he said. ""I just want to keep enjoying my moment, just to keep dreaming. So, let's see if at the end of my career it's going to be 25, 30, 15 or four (Slams). I don't know.""Alcaraz, who had 21 forehand winners, and just 10 unforced errors off that flank in the final against Djokovic, picked on his weapon when asked where he could improve. ""I have to keep improving everything, I guess. My forehand, at this level I think it can be better. Every year it should be better,"" he said. ""I think my game in general can improve. I have to keep growing and keep improving.""Alcaraz, whose play appeared to have lost its edge in the second half of last year, stumbling in big matches, falling to Daniil Medvedev in the semifinals of the US Open, said he needed to grow up.""I learnt a lot from that match against Daniil in the US Open in 2023,"" he said. ""I had to be more mature in those situations. I gave up a little bit. I remember perfectly. I gave up a little bit in the second set after losing the first one. It is unacceptable playing in a Grand Slam. I knew that these things can't happen again.""""I'm here right now thanks to these kinds of situations that I learned from,"" he added. Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner , who between them have the season's first three majors covered, have powered a change of guard. That's not to say Djokovic is done, only that the top of the game has a whole different vibe now.""Being over there with Jannik, 21 years old and 22 years old in the top of the ranking, winning Grand Slams, I think it is good for tennis to have new faces winning the big things and fighting for the big tournaments,"" he said. ""I'm glad to have him there. We have a good rivalry, young players, fighting for these trophies. It's great for the sport, for the other players as well.""",Carlos Alcaraz has won four Grand Slam titles at the age of 21. The Spaniard beat Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final on Sunday.
