NEW DELHI: Former cricketer Kris Srikkanth has shown support for KL Rahul to retain the No.5 spot in India's batting order for the first Test against Bangladesh. The match begins on September 19 in Chennai. Srikkanth prefers Rahul over Sarfaraz Khan , despite Sarfaraz's strong performances earlier this year.Rahul missed most of the England Test series due to injury, which allowed Sarfaraz to step in and score 200 runs at an average of 50.However, Srikkanth expressed his preference for Rahul on his YouTube channel. He said, ""Honestly, I feel bad for Sarfaraz Khan. But this happens, at times, in Test cricket. You would have been playing well, but when a big player returns, you will have to lose your place.""Srikkanth also mentioned the upcoming Australia series, highlighting Rahul's experience and success in overseas conditions. ""At the back of the mind, they are also keeping the Australia series. New Zealand are also coming. KL Rahul has performed well overseas, in Australia he has done well,"" he added.Rahul's recent scores of 37 and 57 in the Duleep Trophy strengthen his case for selection.Meanwhile, India's top four are set with Rohit Sharma Shubman Gill , and Virat Kohli , while Rishabh Pant is expected to bat at No.6 as the wicketkeeper. This leaves the No.5 spot to be decided between Rahul and Sarfaraz.Sarfaraz's recent Duleep Trophy performance, where he scored 9 and 46, poses a tough decision for the selectors ahead of the Bangladesh series.

NEW DELHI: India's star pacer Jasprit Bumrah , who served as the vice-captain during the Test series against England earlier this year, will not hold the same position in the upcoming first Test against Bangladesh. Although he remains a part of the squad, Bumrah will play as a regular team member rather than being Rohit Sharma 's deputy.Bumrah is regarded as a key leader within the team, along with KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant , and Virat Kohli.While Kohli has opted to avoid any official leadership roles, Rahul and Pant are seen as potential future Test captains. Interestingly, the team has not designated a vice-captain for the Bangladesh series.The absence of the vice-captaincy role for Bumrah suggests that the BCCI and team management may not envision him as a future captain. This could stem from the need to carefully manage his workload.Bumrah has previously captained India, notably in the rescheduled 2022 Test against England and the 2023 match against Ireland, where his leadership was praised. However, a captain's consistent availability is crucial, and Bumrah’s injury history might hinder that.With Gautam Gambhir now at the helm as head coach, India's approach to vice-captaincy has shifted. Hardik Pandya was replaced by Suryakumar Yadav in T20Is, and Shubman Gill has taken over the vice-captaincy duties in both ODIs and T20Is, raising speculation about his potential role in Test cricket.The first Test between India and Bangladesh is set to begin on September 19 at MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, followed by the second Test at Green Park Stadium in Kanpur from September 27.Rohit Sharma (c), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Sarfaraz Khan, Rishabh Pant (wk), Dhruv Jurel (wk), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Jasprit Bumrah, Yash Dayal.",India's star pacer Jasprit Bumrah will not hold the same position in the upcoming first Test against Bangladesh.

Another day of Afghanistan-New Zealand Test called off due to ‘wet outfield’ despite bright sunshine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/another-day-of-afghanistan-new-zealand-test-called-off-due-to-wet-outfield-despite-bright-sunshine/articleshow/113236239.cms,"GREATER NOIDA : It’s now farcical, bordering on being comical. Tuesday saw everything unprecedented happening at the Shaheed Vijay Pathik Cricket Stadium here. It was the second day of the one-off Test between Afghanistan and New Zealand, with the first day being called off due to “wet outfield and damp patches in the run-up area of bowlers”.If the first day was full of mess and gross mismanagement on the part of the stadium authorities – in charge of the conduct of the Test match – the second day trumped the first in terms of inefficiency and incompetence.Again, play was called off due to “wet outfield and damp patches in playing area” for a second straight day with the toss yet to take place. The two umpires cited “players safety” as a concern.Sample this: In a never-seen-before scenario at the Test level, the groundstaff cut out blocks of dry grass from the nets practice area and then transplanted them on some damp regions inside the 30-yard circle.Then marriage shamiyanas were used to cover parts of the outfield. Electric fans were brought in and employed to dry the affected areas. It was a sight to see members of the groundstaff with their face to the ground, as if they were trying to hear something, and holding the stand of an electric fan.The one sight that topped everything was Afghan fans, who had come to the stadium to enjoy some Test match action between two quality sides, getting onto the field and help out the groundstaff in their efforts to get the ground ready.All this begged one question: Can Test cricket – the elite format of the sport – be subjected to such farce?Afghanistan, anyway, play very few Tests. Nine in six years, to be precise, since gaining ICC ’s Full Membership status. Although the Test here isn’t a part of the World Test Championship cycle, New Zealand too would’ve liked a better exposure to sub-continental conditions before their series against Sri Lanka and India.On Tuesday, while the Afghanistan team stayed put in their hotel, New Zealand players came to the ground in the afternoon. A practice net was installed next to the main pitch so that they could practice. Kane Williamson and Daryl Mitchell had a hit as spinners Ajaz Patel and Mitchell Santer bowled to the batters first. They were soon joined by the pacers.Just like Monday, multiple inspections were carried out by the umpires. Again, there was no rain throughout the day and the skies remained bright and sunny. There was a downpour for about an hour on Monday evening, and that just threw a spanner in the works of the groundstaff as the field couldn’t be readied even for a curtailed day’s play on Tuesday.The question, therefore, arises why such a stadium was chosen to play a Test match despite an abysmal drainage system and no readiness to counter emergency situations?The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) have a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with the BCCI way back in 2017. The Indian board provides venues and practice facilities for the Afghanistan team as a “friendly gesture”. A MoU was also signed with the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) to use the Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Cricket Stadium as a “home base” for Afghanistan.This time too, when ACB asked the BCCI to provide some options for the Test, the Indian board had given the names of Kanpur, Bengaluru and Greater Noida. The ACB opted for Greater Noida for “logistical reasons”.“The venue has always been Afghanistan’s home venue. If we talk about back from 2016, we have been playing games here. It is because of the incessant rainfall. That has played a spoilsport. We had a three-day game here with one of the local teams and that went well. We didn’t face any issue. But when the rain started, somewhere in the last two weeks, all of this happened,” ACB international cricket manager Menhajuddin Raz said on Tuesday. “We had conducted a recce four to six months back, and even the visiting team had done their recce. We didn’t find any issue that time.”Raz added that ACB considered moving the match to a different venue, but the monsoon made it impossible. “We tried working on a solution. We considered shifting the game to another venue. But we were told that because of the same rain, the venue couldn’t have been prepared in an emergency,” he said.Now, there is a good chance that the International Cricket Council may deem the venue unfit for international cricket.Interestingly, there was a downpour for an hour on Tuesday evening too. So, there is a big question mark over the possibility of any play on Day 3.",Second day of one-off Test between Afghanistan and New Zealand called off.

The incident took place during Pakistan's 1987 tour of India when Javed Miandad and Abdul Qadir left the field during the lunch break, Sachin was called upon to serve as a substitute fielder for Imran Khan's team.Tendulkar, eager and energetic, was asked to field for the visiting team. He took up a position in the outfield, donning a Pakistan jersey for a brief time, marking an unusual moment where the future Indian icon played for his cricketing rivals.Imran positioned Tendulkar at long-on, and it wasn't long before Kapil Dev hit a high ball in his direction. Despite his best efforts and a 15-metre sprint forward, Tendulkar was unable to reach the ball.In his recently published autobiography, 'Playing it My Way', Tendulkar recalled that incident in his autobiography, 'Playing it My Way' and shared that he later complained to a friend, expressing his belief that had he been positioned at mid-on instead of long-on, he would have been able to catch the ball.While this event is more anecdotal, it remains a testament to the spirit of cricket and its unpredictable nature.It remains a fascinating footnote in Tendulkar's illustrious career, showcasing his passion and dedication to cricket from a very young age.","Sachin Tendulkar briefly fielded for Pakistan during a festival match in Mumbai.

However, it was Madan Lal who earned the distinction of delivering the first ball for India in this ground-breaking tournament.The tournament featured 60-over matches, and Madan Lal etched his name in the history books by bowling the first ball of the World Cup to England opener Dennis Amiss Madan Lal, known for his accuracy and ability to swing the ball both ways, played a crucial role in India's bowling attack during the early years of limited-overs cricket.Despite his disciplined bowling, the match against England turned out to be a challenging one for India.

""The intensity and concentration in the big moments were missing this week. It was all a bit flimsy, cocky even. They took the mickey out of the game. The answer in Test cricket’s hottest moments cannot always be attack, attack, attack,"" he emphasized.Vaughan's remarks were aimed at warning England against underestimating opponents, particularly as tougher Test assignments loom, with series against Pakistan, New Zealand, India, and Australia on the horizon.The former captain stressed that England need to be more disciplined, especially in high-pressure situations.England's middle-order collapse, from 261-3 to 325 all out, proved costly, and Vaughan urged the team to reflect on this defeat as a wake-up call for future challenges.""I would really encourage England to never lose the love of winning. Sitting in the dressing room after a Test win, whether it is in the Ashes away or against an average West Indies side or Sri Lanka, who are not as strong as they once were, in your own backyard, that is a very special feeling.

149 own goals in one match: The most bizarre football game ever!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/149-own-goals-in-one-match-the-most-bizarre-football-game-ever/articleshow/113232338.cms,"NEW DELHI: One of the strangest moments in football history occurred in 2002 during a match in Madagascar’s national league, where Stade Olympique de L'Emyrne (SOE) deliberately scored 149 own goals against their opponents, AS Adema .The final score, 149-0, remains a world record for the highest-scoring football match, but the reasons behind it are as bizarre as the result.The match was not an ordinary contest. Instead, it was a protest by SOE against what they saw as unfair officiating in a previous match.SOE had been in a tight title race with AS Adema, but a controversial refereeing decision in a prior game eliminated them from contention for the championship.Feeling aggrieved and powerless to reverse the decision, SOE’s players took matters into their own hands in their next match.From the very first whistle, SOE's players began intentionally kicking the ball into their own net, over and over again.AS Adema's players and the fans watched in bewilderment as the score kept climbing without AS Adema having to touch the ball. By the end of the match, SOE had registered an unprecedented 149 own goals.While AS Adema technically won the game and the championship, the bizarre protest overshadowed the result.The Madagascan Football Federation reacted swiftly, handing out severe punishments. SOE’s coach, Zaka Be, was banned for three years, while four SOE players, including their captain, were suspended for the remainder of the season.The protest was widely criticized as unsportsmanlike, but it also highlighted the deep frustrations that can arise from perceived injustices in football.Fans and players alike were stunned by this form of rebellion, and the match has since become an infamous part of football lore.To this day, the 149 own-goal match remains one of football's most bizarre and unforgettable events.","Stade Olympique de L'Emyrne deliberately scored 149 own goals against their opponents, AS Adema.

How much does Lionel Messi's dog 'Hulk' cost?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/how-much-does-lionel-messis-dog-hulk-cost/articleshow/113226178.cms,"Messi has a kickabout with his dog - BBC News

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi 's dog, Hulk , a Dogue de Bordeaux , has captured the hearts of fans worldwide, almost as much as the legendary footballer himself. This massive, lovable breed perfectly complements Messi's larger-than-life persona.If you're curious about the cost of owning a dog like Messi's, here's an in-depth look at the expenses involved.Acquiring a Dogue de Bordeaux puppy can be a significant investment.The initial cost ranges from $1,800 to $2,500, and for top-quality or show-ready puppies, the price can soar to $3,500 or more. However, the expenses don't stop there.According to UK pet charity PDSA, maintaining a Dogue de Bordeaux can cost at least $125 per month, or upwards of $20,000 over the course of its life, including food, veterinary bills, and general care.Interestingly, when Messi's family relocated to Miami, they left Hulk behind in Barcelona due to health concerns.In an interview, Messi revealed that Hulk, now 7 years old, stayed in Barcelona because French Mastiffs like Hulk are prone to conditions such as hip dysplasia and heart problems, which often affect larger breeds as they age.With a typical lifespan of 10 years, Hulk is already considered a senior dog.Hulk isn't Messi's only furry companion, though. The family also owns a rare apricot toy poodle named Abu, who did make the trip to Miami with them.The Dogue de Bordeaux is one of France's oldest dog breeds, originally used for cattle driving and guarding. It gained international fame thanks to the 1989 Tom Hanks film ""Turner and Hooch."" Today, this loyal, imposing breed remains a favourite for families like Messi's.","Lionel Messi's Dogue de Bordeaux dog, Hulk, has captured the hearts of fans worldwide.

to become 1st Italian man to win US Open

He's 6 ft 3' with a scraggy crown, a face that doesn't say much and legs that are defined to cover great ground, run miles and miles at the speed of lightning. Then there is the intangible. An alloy of the unbendable ilk that runs through Jannik Sinner .The scrutiny the top-seed faced coming into the US Open is hard to imagine. He was fighting questions on his integrity - including some damning ones raised by fellow pros - following two positive tests in March for the banned steroid Clostebol.The 23-year-old was cleared of fault or negligence by an independent tribunal in the week before the season's final Grand Slam, but the court of public opinion, revved up by the engines of social discourse, had turned the glare on him. Players and the public alleged that tennis' anti-doping authorities had treated the world No. 1 differently from other players. At best it was a divided locker room.So, when Sinner threw up his arms up at the end of a power-packed slugfest with American Taylor Fritz, where he had rallied from 3-5 in the third set, reeling off four straight games to seal a dominant win, he stood tall in the winner's circle that isn't for the weak hearted. The world No. 1 took down Fritz, the top-ranked American, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 to claim his second Grand Slam title of the year, making him the first Italian man to win in New York and also the first man in 47 years to claim his first two Grand Slam titles in the same season.""The pre-tournament circumstances wasn't easy,"" said Sinner, who teared up as he held the Tiffany-designed winner's trophy. ""I felt like I had grown, match by match and that my confidence level went higher and higher (with each match). I'm happy how I handled this one.""Sinner, who surrounded himself with a slim-look team in New York, after dropping physio and fitness coach Giacomo Naldi and Umberto Ferrara from his close circle, had his two coaches - Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi - and girlfriend Anna Kalinskaya , ranked 14 on the WTA Tour, to fall back on.""The people who are close to me daily, people who know me already from when I was very young, my family, my team and everyone who supports me,"" Sinner said of the people who stood by him in the hardest times of his young career. ""I always try to stick with them, especially when the moments are getting difficult and tough, because I know that they can help me in these moments.""Sinner, whose title run in New York has taken his record for the year to 55-5, and extended his winning streak to 11 matches, said he's still sometimes weighed down by the incidents of the last five months.""It was and it's still a little bit in my mind,"" he said. ""My team and people who are close to me, they know what I've been through in the last months. It was not only one week before the tournament. It was months. When I'm on court, I try to focus on the game, I've done a great job mentally staying there, every point I play.""Sinner has now won a Tour-leading six titles in a sparkling 2024 season and has moved him 4,105 points clear of his nearest challenger, German Alexander Zverev .Not since 2002 has a season gone by without tennis' trifecta - Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal - winning a major, which is reason for public debate by itself, but when a pair of pros aged 23 and under in - Carlos Alcaraz , 21, and Sinner - sweep up the Grand Slam calendar, splitting the 2024 haul between them, it's called a new dawn.""It's something new, but it's also nice to see. Nice to see new champions, new rivalries,"" Sinner said. ""I will always have players who are going to make me a better player, because there are going to be times where they beat me.

However, before he was known for his powerful forehands and quick reflexes on the court, he was flying down the slopes of the Italian Alps .Growing up in the mountainous South Tyrol region, Sinner was a highly skilled skier, excelling in both slalom and giant slalom.His early years were spent mastering the art of skiing, competing in national junior events, and often securing first place in numerous competitions within his age category, where his balance and precision were key to his success.Skiing also instilled in him a strong mental focus, something that would later become an asset in his tennis career.At the age of 13, Sinner made a pivotal decision—choosing tennis over skiing. He relocated across Italy to train under the guidance of renowned coach Riccardo Piatti , in what proved to be a game-changing move.Piatti quickly recognized Sinner’s proactive, aggressive style, which stood out for someone so young. ""He hit the ball fast, always aiming to win the points,"" Piatti once remarked, noting that Sinner’s fearless mindset was a trait not commonly seen in junior players.Sinner himself credits his skiing background for shaping his mental approach to tennis. Just as in skiing, where each race lasts mere seconds and requires total focus, tennis demanded the same kind of short bursts of concentration.""In both skiing and tennis, he knows when to focus and when to relax,"" Piatti explained, drawing parallels between the two sports that have shaped Sinner’s rise.From being ranked 870th just two years ago to reaching the world number one spot in 2024, Sinner’s ascent has been meteoric. His calm under pressure and relentless drive to improve have made him a formidable force on the court.","Jannik Sinner is the first Italian man to win the US Open. The 22-year-old defeated Taylor Fritz 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 on Sunday. It was Sinner's second Grand Slam title of the year.

When Roger Federer corrected the chair umpire on a double bounce without using a video review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/when-roger-federer-corrected-the-chair-umpire-on-a-double-bounce-without-using-a-video-review/articleshow/113182267.cms,"Roger Federer Explains Why This Ball Bounced Twice 👀

Roger Federer's achievements:

NEW DELHI: Roger Federer , the legendary tennis player with 20 Grand Slam titles , was warmly greeted by the audience at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Tuesday evening during the US Open quarterfinal match between Aryna Sabalenka and Zheng Qinwen .The Swiss icon, who retired in 2022 and played his final official match at Wimbledon the year before, acknowledged the crowd with a smile and a wave when he appeared on the stadium's videoboards.This marked Federer's first appearance at the US Open venue since his retirement. He holds the record for the most consecutive US Open championships, having secured five straight titles from 2004 to 2008.Additionally, he holds the record for the most consecutive weeks at No. 1 (237) in PIF ATP Rankings history (since 1973).During the ATP Masters 1000 Madrid final against Tomas Berdych , Federer demonstrated his keen observation skills and understanding of physics. In one rally, Federer noticed that the ball had bounced twice before Berdych made contact, a detail the chair umpire missed. Federer approached the umpire to discuss the incident.Roger Federer asked the chair umpire, ""Did you see the ball bounce towards me?""The umpire replied, ""Yeah, but to me, it looked like he came under with the racket.""Roger acknowledged what the umpire had to say and responded, ""Yeah, I know, but the ball came bouncing at me with topspin. The only way that happens is if he pushed it down into the court first.""The chair umpire clarified again, ""It looked like he just came under it. I probably missed it, but that’s how it appeared to me, Roger.""Roger replied, ""I agree it was close, but the result was obvious—he didn’t hit it the right way. Otherwise, the ball would’ve gone up in the air.""Despite Berdych's strong start, winning the first set with an impressive 14 winners and only two unforced errors, Federer managed to turn the match around in the second set. The Swiss maestro broke Berdych’s serve twice and capitalized on a double fault from the Czech player to secure the set.Berdych’s struggles continued in the third set, as he committed two more double faults, seemingly handing Federer a decisive lead at 5-3.However, Federer encountered a hiccup while serving for the match, allowing Berdych a brief reprieve. Nonetheless, Berdych found himself in trouble again in the 12th game, facing three championship points at 0-40.Although he managed to save all three, he ultimately succumbed to Federer’s pressure, hitting a forehand into the net to concede the match and the title to the Swiss champion.With 103 titles and 1,251 wins, Federer is second only to Connors' 109 titles and 1,274 wins in the Open Era.Remarkably, he never retired in 1,526 singles and 224 doubles matches throughout his career. Twenty-time Grand Slam champion owns all-time Grand Slam record with 369 wins and 58 QFs, as well as 10 finals, 23 SFs and 36 QFs in a row.Federer holds tournament records for the most titles at Basel (10), Halle (10), Wimbledon (8), and ATP Masters 1000 Cincinnati (7).His impressive achievements include a 41-match winning streak (2006-07), reaching 17 consecutive finals (2005-06), a 24-final winning streak (2003-05), 24 straight victories against Top 10 players (2003-05), and 65 consecutive wins on grass (2003-08).","Roger Federer was warmly greeted by the audience at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Tuesday evening during the US Open quarterfinal match between Aryna Sabalenka and Zheng Qinwen.
