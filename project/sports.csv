The new Indian Premier League (IPL) Player Regulations for the period 2025-27 were announced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Saturday after a meeting of the IPL Governing Council (GC), and the mention of ""will get banned"" in the press release draws attention.Called the 'Big Auction', the regulations require all overseas players to register for it. In case a foreign player doesn't do that, ""then he will be ineligible to register in the following year's player auction.""But in the next instruction on the eight-point list of the regulations, the BCCI cautioned players who decide to register themselves, get picked by a franchise and then opt out of the season.""Any player who registers in the player auction and after getting picked at the auction makes himself unavailable before the start of the season, will get banned from participating in the tournament and player auction for 2 Seasons.""The 'Big Auction' is expected to be held in the second half of November at an overseas location, most likely in the Gulf.Among the most awaited part of the regulations was the number of players a franchise will be allowed to retain.The IPL GC ended that wait by declaring that ""the IPL franchises can retain a total of 6 players from their existing squad. This can be either via retention or by using the Right to Match (RTM) option.""The press release further stated, ""It is at the discretion of the IPL franchise to choose their combination for Retentions and RTMs. The 6 retentions / RTM's can have a maximum of 5 capped players (Indian & Overseas) and a maximum of 2 uncapped players.""The regulations made it clear that a capped Indian player will be considered uncapped ""if the player has in the last five calendar years preceding the year in which the relevant Season is held, not played in the starting XI in International Cricket (Test match, ODI, Twenty20 International) or does not have a Central Contract with BCCI.""","The new Indian Premier League (IPL) Player Regulations for the period 2025-27 were announced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Saturday.

Each franchise to have purse of Rs 120 crore; Impact rule to stay

'Uncapped'

can be retained

New stringent availability rules

Landmark match fee introduced

BENGALURU: Ahead of the mega auction in Nov, the IPL governing council has decided that the 10 franchises can retain a maximum of six cricketers. Also, the Right to Match (RTM) card, which was done away with before the 2022 mega auction, has been brought back.""It is at the discretion of the IPL franchise to choose their combination for retentions and RTMs.The six retentions/RTM's can have a maximum of 5 capped players (Indian and overseas) and a maximum of 2 uncapped players,"" the IPL said in statement announcing the big changes.Interestingly, the IPL GC, which met here on Saturday, has also come up with a rider which is a 'pay more to retain more' formula, wherein the price for the fourth and fifth retentions come at a higher cost. With each team having an increased auction purse of Rs 120 crore each, there will be a reduction of Rs 18 crore, 14 crore and 11 crore respectively for the first three retentions.The subsequent fourth and fifth retentions will see the franchise purse getting lighter by Rs 18 crore and 14 crore. Effectively, five retentions will come at a cost of Rs 75 crore, leaving the franchise with Rs 45 crore to complete the line-up.The price for the uncapped player has been pegged at Rs 4 crore, which further reduces a franchise's purse. Also, for the subsequent seasons the purse has been increased to Rs 151 crore (2026) and Rs 157 crore (2027).In another key decision, the GC has decided to retain the Impact Player rule . The same will continue for the 2025-27 cycle. Chennai Super Kings can retain their former captain MS Dhoni as an 'uncapped' player because an old rule first introduced in 2008 and scrapped in 2021 has been brought back: Indian players who have been retired from international cricket for a period of at least five years can go into the auction pool as an 'uncapped' player.Dhoni, for example, retired from international cricket in 2020 and can be retained for Rs 4 crore. CSK had shelled out Rs 12 crore to retain him ahead of the 2022 auction.The GC has laid down rules for players registering for the auction, bringing in some strict regulations. ""Any player who registers in the player auction and after getting picked at the auction, makes himself unavailable before the start of the season, will get banned from participating in the tournament and player auction for two seasons,"" the IPL said.There have been plenty of instances of players pulling out after being picked in the auction, especially England and Australia players, and this rule may prevent such late withdrawals.In an important step, players featuring in IPL-2025 are set to receive a match fee of Rs 7.5 lakh per game. This is apart from the auction fee they earn from their respective franchisees, BCCI secretary Jay Shah posted on X. Effectively, if a player features in all league matches, he will get an additional sum of Rs 1.05 crore. ""This is a new era for the IPL,"" Shah posted.",Each franchise to have purse of Rs 120 crore; Impact rule to stay. Chennai Super Kings can retain their former captain MS Dhoni as an 'uncapped' player.

NEW DELHI: Virender Sehwag 's 309 in Multan, often referred to as the ""Sultan of Multan"" innings, is one of the most iconic knocks in the history of Indian cricket . It took place during India's 2004 tour of Pakistan in the first Test at Multan.Sehwag became the first Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket , achieving the feat in just 364 balls.Sehwag had a 336-run stand with his idol batting legend Sachin Tendulkar for the third wicket.Sehwag has more than once shared numerous anecdotes about his time with Tendulkar on the field, in the dressing room, during team dinners, and while traveling.And in a video that is viral on the internet, Sehwag narrated an interesting incident during his partnership with Tendulkar when he was warned against hitting a six.Sehwag says in the video, ""When he (Tendulkar) came to bat after the dismissal of Rahul Dravid , I was on 120, and just after his arrival I hit Saqlain Mushtaq for a six, the ball just went over the long-on fielder who tried for a catch but he could not take it. Master came with his bat and said 'ab agar tune chakka maara na toh main tere bat maarunga kheench ke'.""Sehwag continues, ""When I reached 295, I said if Saqlain Mushtaq comes in the attack, I will step out first ball and hit a six. He (Tendulkar) said are you mad? You'll become the first Indian player to hit 300. I replied no Indian has ever hit 295 even, I have become the first Indian. He walked back saying you are mad. Saqlain came, I stepped out and hit a six to reach 300 and Tendulkar was happier than me.""Sehwag's knock helped India post a massive total of 675/5 declared in the first innings, leading India to win by an innings and 52 runs.This innings is remembered not only for its historical significance but also for the aggressive and fearless manner in which Sehwag played against a strong Pakistani bowling attack that included Shoaib Akhtar , Mohammad Sami, and Saqlain Mushtaq.Though both Tendulkar and Sehwag were batting legends with different styles, their camaraderie and mutual respect on and off the field created a unique partnership that benefited the Indian team for many years.Their camaraderie extends off the field as well. Their bond, despite differences in personalities (Tendulkar being calm and composed, Sehwag more carefree and humorous), has always remained strong.The Tendulkar-Sehwag friendship stands as a testament to the spirit of Indian cricket during their playing days and continues to be celebrated even after both have retired from the game.",Virender Sehwag became the first Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket.

BENGALURU: The IPL Governing Council which was convened on Saturday decided to continue with the hotly-debated Impact Player rule for the IPL 2025 season. The Impact Sub was introduced during the IPL 2023 and since then the rule has vertically divided opinion.Even in the meeting the BCCI had with the team owners earlier this July, some franchises like Delhi Capitals were not entirely in favour of retaining the Impact Player rule, primarily because it reduced the importance of the all-rounders.In fact, the nine highest totals in the IPL were made since the introduction of the Impact Player rule and the team often effortlessly crossed 220s and even 250s in the IPL 2024.""We had a chat with the franchise owners recently. The impact player rule has its pros and cons. The negative is that it makes the allrounder's role redundant. The positive is that it creates a spot for an Indian player to showcase his talent,"" BCCI secretary Jay Shah had said recently.The Impact Player rule allows a team to replace a player from the starting eleven and bring in a specialist batsman or bowler as per the match situation.The IPL franchises can retain a total of 6 players from their existing squad. This can be either via retention or by using the Right to Match (RTM) option.It is at the discretion of the IPL franchise to choose their combination for Retentions and RTMs. The 6 retentions / RTM's can have a maximum of 5 capped players (Indian & Overseas) and a maximum of 2 uncapped players.The auction purse for the franchises has been set at INR 120 Crore for IPL 2025. The total salary cap will now consist of auction purse, incremental performance pay and match fees. Previously in 2024, the total salary cap (auction purse + incremental performance pay) was Rs. 110 Crs which will now be Rs. 146 Crs (2025), Rs. 151 Crs (2026) and Rs. 157 Crs (2027).A match fee has been introduced for the first time in the history of IPL.

It was nice facing him, I was surprised at his pace,"" Dhawan said after the match.The numbers speak for themselves - figures of 3/27 in his four overs and a reputation for unsettling even the most seasoned batters.His impact was felt not just by the crowd, but also by the likes of fast-bowling legend Brett Lee, who hailed him as ""India's fastest bowler.""His flamboyant bowling, backed by smooth action, continued to inspire in the match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru as he swept Australia international Cameron Green aside with a delivery clocking 156.7 kph.But behind the raw speed is a story of perseverance. Injuries sidelined Mayank for much of his young career, including the latter part of IPL 2024.Despite this setback, his talent has led to a focused rehabilitation program, with the youngster bowling 14-15 overs per day at the NCA.The upcoming Bangladesh series offers a valuable chance for the national selectors to assess his international readiness in a limited bowling capacity, before potentially introducing him to longer formats like the Ranji Trophy.From being the kid in New Delhi's Motinagar who rattled batters with head-high deliveries, to now being hailed as India‚Äôs new pace sensation, Mayank‚Äôs ascent has been both thrilling and inspirational.The 22-year-old has had notable mentors like the late Tarak Sinha, who also coached Rishabh Pant Despite not having played U-14 or U-16 cricket , his rise in Delhi‚Äôs cricketing circles was meteoric.

However if a franchise opts for fourth and fifth retentions, they will again have to pay Rs 18 crore and Rs 14 crore respectively,"" a senior BCCI and IPL governing council member told PTI on conditions of anonymity.""So any franchise opts for all five retentions, then will have only Rs 45 crore to buy or even use their Right To Match (RTM) card to buy another 15 players and prepare a squad. There is no cap on Indian and Overseas retentions.""We introduced more deductions for retentions four and five to ensure level playing field. You can go ahead and retain five but then you will have less than Rs 50 crore to deal with at auction table.""Also if franchises opt for only three retentions, then more star value will be added to auction and some of the teams with lesser strength can set their house in order. The idea is to have a good competition,"" the source added.One needs to note that retention price is only a deduction from the team purse for the auction but it may or may not be the actual salary of the player which is a player-franchise separate contract.This presents a significant challenge for teams to balance star retentions with maintaining enough budget for squad depth and versatility.Also Read: IPL Retention Rules: Governing Council to meet on Saturday, announcement soon","The IPL Governing Council has decided to permit each franchise to retain up to five players and utilize one Right to Match (RTM) The first player that a franchise retains will cost Rs 18 crore, the second retention will cost ¬£14 crore, and the third retention will be ¬£11 crore.

NEW DELHI: Adam Gilchrist 's iconic performance in the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup final is remembered not just for his breathtaking century, but also for a unique element of his preparation -- a squash ball hidden inside his batting glove.On April 28, 2007, at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados, Australia faced Sri Lanka in the final of the tournament.Australia were aiming for a third consecutive World Cup title, and Gilchrist played a key role in making it happen.Opening the batting for Australia, Gilchrist unleashed an extraordinary display of power and precision, smashing 149 runs off just 104 balls.His explosive knock was laced with 13 fours and 8 sixes, and it was the cornerstone of Australia‚Äôs imposing total of 281 in a rain-shortened 38-over contest.However, what most people didn‚Äôt know at the time was that Gilchrist had a squash ball tucked inside his left glove during the innings.After the match, when asked about his exceptional form, Gilchrist revealed the secret.The squash ball was placed in his glove on the advice of his batting coach and mentor, Bob Meuleman, who had suggested it to help Gilchrist maintain a better grip on the bat and keep his hand from closing too early while playing shots.This small adjustment gave him more control and freedom to execute his shots, especially against fast bowlers.Gilchrist‚Äôs century in the final remains one of the finest innings in World Cup history, and Australia went on to win the match by 53 runs (D/L method), securing their third consecutive World Cup title.The story of the squash ball became legendary, adding an interesting layer to Gilchrist‚Äôs already outstanding achievement, and highlighting how a small tweak can lead to greatness on the world stage.",Adam Gilchrist scored 149 runs in the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup final.

Martinez strikes for Inter

Dusan Vlahovic fired Juventus top of Serie A with a brace in Saturday's 3-0 win at Genoa who were forced to play behind closed doors as punishment for fan disorder in their midweek Italian Cup defeat to local rivals Sampdoria.Juventus are a point ahead of Torino, AC Milan and Inter Milan , who were 3-2 winners at Udinese earlier on Saturday, after Vlahovic settled a match played in an atmosphere that harked back to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Serbia striker has struggled for form in the early weeks of the season, only netting in one of his previous six Juventus appearances.But he opened the scoring from the penalty spot two minutes after half-time before rifling home from Teun Koopmeiners' fine pass in the 55th minute.""People talk, say that you're the best when you score goals and a flop when you don't. I do my talking on the pitch,"" said Vlahovic to DAZN.""I know very well that there is a lot expected of me and I am not running away from that.""Thiago Motta's team, who also scored in the final minutes through substitute Francisco Conceicao, are yet to concede a league goal this season and snapped a run of three consecutive goalless draws in Serie A with a professional display.Juve could have won by more as Koopmeiners somehow failed to push home Conceicao's low cross in the 64th minute, hitting the crossbar from inside the six-yard box.The away side's task was made easier with Genoa's passionate support shut out of the Stadio Luigi Ferraris in the aftermath of the encounter with their second-tier neighbours Sampdoria.Prolonged clashes between the hardcore ultras before and after Wednesday's fraught derby cup tie led to dozens of injuries to fans and police and a crackdown by Italy's security authorities.A third defeat of the season left Genoa in 16th place and one point above the relegation zone.Lautaro Martinez struck his first goals of the season in Inter's entertaining win at Udinese.Davide Frattesi's deft finish after just 43 seconds was followed by Argentina forward Martinez's strikes moments before and after half-time.The win in Udine helped Inter bounce back from Milan derby defeat last weekend and move up to fourth, on 11 points after six matches.""After the derby we kept quiet and worked hard and I think you saw that on the pitch,"" said Martinez to DAZN.Martinez's brace will be great news for coach Simone Inzaghi whose team host Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League on Tuesday night.Before Saturday, last season's Serie A top scorer had not scored since netting the winner for his country in the Copa America final in July.""It definitely important for me because a striker is always on the hunt for goals,"" he said.""I always say that first I work for the team, and if I manage to score then so much the better.""Lazar Samardzic snatched a late 1-1 draw at 10-man Bologna with a brilliant 90th-minute leveller ahead of their Champions League trip to Shakhtar Donetsk.Midfielder Samardzic rammed home his equaliser seconds after striking the post, saving a point after playing with an extra man for almost all of the second half following Jhon Lucumi's 51st minute sending off.Atalanta are ninth and level on seven points with Bologna, who face a daunting Champions League trip to Anfield to take on Liverpool on Wednesday.",Dusan Vlahovic scores twice as Juventus beat Genoa 3-0 in Serie A.

Reinforcements

Osasuna shattered La Liga leaders Barcelona 's perfect start to the season with an emphatic 4-2 victory on Saturday.The Catalans won all seven of their opening fixtures but Hansi Flick's rotated side came badly undone in Pamplona as Ante Budimir scored a brace either side of Bryan Zaragoza's strike.Pau Victor had given Barca a lifeline to pull them back into the game before Budimir bagged his second from the penalty spot.Abel Bretones added a sensational fourth from the edge of the box, before Lamine Yamal pulled one back with a fine effort of his own.Victory would have matched Barcelona's best ever start to a league campaign with eight consecutive wins, but they were not able to build on their four-point lead on second-place Real Madrid.The Spanish champions visit Atletico Madrid, third, in a derby clash on Sunday.""It's normal there are rotations, there are a lot of games, it's not an excuse,"" Barcelona midfielder Pedri told Movistar.""In the second half we deserved a bit more but we let in goals when we were at our best.""Ahead of a Champions League match against Young Boys on Tuesday, Flick shuffled his pack.The coach handed starts to defenders Gerard Martin and Sergi Dominguez as well as Pablo Torre in midfield and Victor in attack.The coach rested Spain Euro 2024 starlet Yamal and Brazilian winger Raphinha among other regular picks.As a result Barcelona failed to ignite in the first half and Osasuna winger Zaragoza took centre-stage.Last season Zaragoza struck twice while playing for Granada in a 2-2 draw against Barca, a performance which helped earn him a move to Bayern Munich.On loan from the German giants, Zaragoza created the opener for target-man Budimir with a fine cross, which the Croatian nodded home with ease in the 18th minute after escaping the attentions of Dominguez.Zaragoza finished the second himself 10 minutes later after being sent through on goal, with the winger bypassing goalkeeper Inaki Pena with a fine ball roll and then slotting into the empty net.Barcelona complained there had been a foul on Victor in the build-up but the referee waved their complaints away.The leaders created little themselves, with the best opening falling to Ferran Torres. However the Spanish winger miscontrolled on the edge of the box and was quickly swallowed up by the Osasuna defence.Yamal, Raphinha and Ansu Fati warmed up at half-time, with Barcelona needing to turn to their stars to mount a comeback.Before Flick had time to send them on, Victor pulled Barcelona back into the game.Osasuna goalkeeper Sergio Herrera gave the ball away with a poor throw, intercepted by Martin, who fed Victor.The forward took an early shot from distance which Herrera, who slipped as he made it back to his goal, should have kept out but could not.Flick took off top scorer Robert Lewandowski, largely uninvolved, with 20 minutes remaining and moved Torres into the middle to fill the gap.However Osasuna almost immediately stretched their lead when 19-year-old centre-back Dominguez scythed down Budimir in the area as he went to shoot.The striker buried the penalty with a low effort hit hard enough to beat Pena although he dived the right way.Ruben Pena wasted a glorious chance to grab a fourth as he ran in on goal but was caught in two minds whether to pass or shoot, and Eric Garcia charged back to dispossess him as he dawdled.Bretones, on the other hand, was lethal from the edge of the box when he won the ball back and powered an effort past Barca goalkeeper Pena.Yamal hit back brilliantly from range and teed up Torres who struck the post, but it was too little, too late.Osasuna rose to sixth and Zaragoza said his team had been determined to beat the leaders.""We knew Barca were an incredible team, they had won everything and we knew we had to get stuck into it, and that's how we went out there,"" explained the winger.""It's a special game and really nice to play in.""","Osasuna shatter La Liga leaders Barcelona's perfect start to the season with an emphatic 4-2 victory on Saturday.

WOLVERHAMPTON: Ibrahima Konate headed home his first ever Premier League goal and Mohamed Salah converted a penalty as Liverpool climbed to the top of the Premier League table with a 2-1 victory over struggling Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.Arne Slot's men have 15 points after six games, one more than both Manchester City and Arsenal, while Wolves are bottom with a single point.Konate scored in first-half injury time after Diogo Jota beat his man down the left then served up a pinpoint cross that the 25-year-old centre back leapt to head home.Wolves capitalised on some sloppy defending by Konate, however, to level in the 56th minute. The French centre back appeared to be leaving the ball to run out for a goal kick but Jorgen Strand Larsen kept it in, and Rayan Ait-Nouri scored from close range.Yet Salah silenced the celebratory home crowd at Molineux five minutes later when Liverpool were awarded a penalty for Nelson Semedo's foul on Jota, Salah sending keeper Sam Johnstone the wrong way.""I think a team like Liverpool has to be in the top four for sure; we keep pushing, we keep pushing, but it's really early,"" Liverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch told Sky Sports after another impressive display from the Dutch midfielder.""This season I wanted to show myself again and I am really happy. He (Slot) put me in the starting 11 and gave me a lot of confidence.""Dominik Szoboszlai had squandered a brilliant chance to get Liverpool on the scoreboard when he connected with a cross from Andy Robertson, but Johnstone stopped the Hungarian's point-blank shot.The Reds had a few more chances in the dying minutes including a corner that Konate headed over the bar and a shot to the bottom corner by Curtis Jones after a one-two with Salah that Johnstone saved.Liverpool's victory comes amid a busy schedule, with Slot's side crushing West Ham United 5-1 in a League Cup third-round tie on Wednesday, while they host Bologna in a Champions League match in four days' time.Gary O'Neil's struggling Wolves side have gone 18 games without a clean sheet, since a 1-0 win last February at Sheffield United.Wolves captain Mario Lemina looked distraught after the final whistle, pulling his shirt over his face before a couple of teammates arrived to console him.Aston Villa could draw level on points with Liverpool at the top of the table on Sunday with a win at Ipswich Town, although Unai Emery's side trail 10-3 on goal difference.","Ibrahima Konate scores first Premier League goal as Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1.

KOLKATA: Enduring a poor start to the season, Odisha FC put up a dominating offensive performance in front of the home fans to overcome their defensive woes for a 2-1 victory over Jamshedpur FC in Bhubaneswar on Saturday. The win also brought the Kalinga Warriors their first points of this Indian Super League (ISL) season following consecutive losses.Diego Mauricio (20') and Mourtada Fall (42') scored one each for the Juggernauts before Fall netted an own goal (62') after the change of sides.Though the scoreline doesn't reflect the authority the hosts had over their visitors, Odisha were at their attacking best for the entire first half which virtually sealed the fate of the match in the hosts' favour. They scored two in the first 45 minutes but could have easily been 4-0 up going into the breather.However, the first real chance of the match came in JFC's way only to be denied by the woodwork in the 18th minute. Spanish midfielder Javi Hernandez 's left-footed shot from well outside the area shook the right post following an assist by Jordan Murray.The shot not only shook the woodwork but also the hosts from their stupor as two minutes later Mauricio put Odisha in the lead. Although the assist came from Hugo Boumous, the chief architect of the move was Mizo winger Isak Vanlalruatfela (Ralte), who left behind three-four JFC players with his deft run on the right combined with dribbling before delivering a pass to Boumous near the centre of the box.After a swift first touch, the French midfielder released the ball for Mauricio on the left and the Brazilian was spot on to give Odisha a deserving lead with his left-footed shot, which took a little deflection off a JFC defender before going in at the bottom right corner.Odisha then could have easily doubled their lead in the 27th and 34th minute.First, right-back Amey Ranawade hit the side netting with a close-range header following a Mauricio through, which should have been put into the net.The next one was a brilliant goalline save by Pratik Chowdhary.A livewire on the flanks and Player of the Match Isak was again at the centre of the move as he sent in a defence-splitting through to Jerry Mawihmingthanga down the middle, and the Mizo winger did very well to shoot it past an onrushing JFC goalkeeper Albino Gomes to his right, only to be denied by an alert Pratik on the line.However, Odisha's relentless pressure helped them double their lead three minutes from the break when Fall beat Gomes with a low, free header near the far post from a Boumous corner from right.Khalid Jamil's Men of Steel returned a better lot after the half-time, but Odisha did well to keep the scoresheet clean till the hour mark. In the 62nd minute, centre-back Fall, in a loose attempt to clear a JFC corner, headed into his own goal to reduce the margin for the Red Miners.For the last 30 minutes or so the match became mostly a cagey affair and ended 2-1 despite some late attempts for the equalizer by JFC.",Diego Mauricio (20') and Mourtada Fall (42') scored one each for the Juggernauts.

People waited the entire year for this tournament,"" GSA general secretary Devajit Saikia said, recalling the iconic status the competition once enjoyed.Initially played at the Judges' Field, the GSA's home ground, the tournament was later shifted to the Nehru Stadium.Over the last 10 years however, the tournament was held in different towns of the state.Saikia maintained that alongside Bordoloi Trophy, the popularity of other legacy football tournaments such as the Rovers Cup of Mumbai and DCM Cup of Delhi has also gone down.""GSA has been making efforts to bring back the glorious days for Bordoloi Trophy, with which the people of Assam have an emotional and sentimental connect. With support of the state government, we are unveiling it in a new format,"" he said.Under the new, expanded format, the tournament will be held in three phases.""It will be a 45-day tournament with about 610 matches, with participation of over 280 clubs and 5,600 players.

From playing at Manchester City and Chelsea to Indian football, how has it happened?

How does a sporting director work here in Indian football?

Is the role of sporting director somewhat different from what we see abroad and in India?

Recently, Sandesh Jhingan was vocal about the age fraud in Indian football. What has been your assessment while working with the grassroots?

What South United are doing under your supervision and what are the club's long-term ambitions?

NEW DELHI: It is rare for a player with an ocean of English Premier League experience to make India their home, but Terry Phelan , now 57, has become one of those exceptions.Arriving on the shores of Goa more than a decade ago, Phelan, with 103 club appearances for Manchester City , 25 for Chelsea , and 15 for Everton, has spent his time immersed in Indian culture and dedicating his labour to the country's football.Now serving as the sporting director of I-League 2nd Division side South United FC , Phelan took time out of his busy schedule for an exclusive chat with TimesofIndia.com. Phelan explains the differences between the role of a sporting director in India and Europe, addresses the ongoing issue of age fraud in Indian football and many more.After playing a lot of football in England, I decided to travel abroad, see other cultures, and see what the world's like, obviously travelling abroad with teams and the Ireland national team. I ended up in America for a few years playing for the Charleston Battery and helping my business partner over there who was the Charleston Battery reserve team goalkeeper with his project. And that really catapulted me into the coaching ranks and giving more back to football.Obviously, as a football player, we take a lot out of it, but I think giving back more to the community and that's where I really got started, if I'm being really honest.I think my first coaching job was a group of twelve-year-old girls way back in 2002. So it just tells you it's a long time. And then obviously, I got an offer to go down to New Zealand in 2005, which I accepted as a head coach for a team in Otago.And then, I just started developing myself, developing my mind in different ways and I really enjoyed it. So then I got a call around 2009. Would I be interested in a job in Goa with Sesa Football Academy as a chief mentor? And I went, ""Yeah, I'd love that.""I did a lot of studying on India beforehand. I just left New Zealand after six wonderful years, packed up and we landed in the little state of Goa.It was fantastic for two years, went back to obviously the UK, and then came back in 2014. I got a call from Kerala Blasters . I accepted the offer to be the technical director for all the youth programs there. David James was the head coach, and Trevor Morgan was his assistant.I came in 2015 and started working for the Kerala Blasters and have been here ever since. So I think it's been around about twelve years all in all.And now I am at the South United Football Club. I am there to help them with their structure of the football development side, which has been absolutely fantastic.I am a sporting director, and it's the link between the owners, the CEOs, stakeholders, the first team coach, the head of youth development, and the head of the academies. I think it's also perfecting the link between the players and the parents (of the young players). Parents are paramount to what we are actually doing. It also includes making sure that the strategy is working.Does a technical director go on the football field? Yes, they do. They like to go on the football field. Do you like to help out (the coaches)? But, at the end of the day, they can give their little ideas, but it's up to the people in the roles really to make the ideas come to life.There's a big difference. If you're looking at sporting directors and technical directors in Europe, some managers like them, some managers don't like them. Some managers think they interfere too much. They're the ones who get the signings. I don't really do that. I don't get involved too much with our first team. I leave that obviously to the owner if the owner wants any help, I may help him with that and the CEO.But at the end of the day, it's up to the head coach. I believe that's up to the head coach to determine what type of players he wants.In Europe, it's really robust over there. They get involved a lot more in the decision-making, in the board meetings with big stakeholders. So, I think that's the difference there.Here it's a little bit different. You are mostly involved with the coaching side of it, helping the coaches, helping the students, and talking to parents. Maybe in some clubs in India, it could be like in Europe, but I think at South United, we're a little bit easier on the eye. (laughs)There's been a lot of talk about that. I've been in India now for twelve years. I don't think it (age-fraud) is right. We look at it as just about winning and not developing, is it about winning trophies and not developing the players at the younger age groups, or having the patience to do that? Some clubs haven't got the patience to do that. They want to win trophies and put them in the trophy cabinet.India is a big place. A lot of children probably haven't got aadhar cards or birth certificates, so we wouldn't know. It's probably the same in Africa. I think in Europe, obviously, it's a little bit different. It's vastly different, everything has to be above board.Age fraud is probably in a lot of places around the world. But if we can do the right thing and maybe cancel it out a little bit, it would be fair play all around because it doesn't help the national side.The club's long-term ambition is really to nurture. But it's not just about football. It's about if we look at the psychological corner. Children come to the South United Football Club for different reasons. Some come in because they're curious. Some come in because their friends are there. Some come in because they want to be football players. Some come in for health and fitness, some come in for a bit of peer pressure. Some come in because they want to emulate their sporting heroes and that's what they try to do. And that's why we're here.We're fostering the growth of students and hopefully bringing them from one step to the other step, from the toddler's program to the junior development program to the youth development program to the elite teams and then obviously to the first team. That's the big, that's the vision and the vision of the club. Do we want to be in the ISL tomorrow? No, that's a long-term vision. We'll do it step by step.","Terry Phelan is the sporting director of I-League 2nd Division side South United FC.

KOLKATA: It was not a homecoming East Bengal fans were awaiting. After suffering two away defeats, the red-and-gold brigade completed a hat-trick of defeats in this ISL as they went down 2-3 to FC Goa in their first home match at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Friday. This time it was Borja Herrera who returned to haunt his former club, netting a hat-trick to give his side their first win of this ISL season while Carles Cuadrat 's disorganised unit was left looking for their first point in this edition.FC Goa dominated proceedings right from the word go as East Bengal were down by two goals within the first 20 minutes of play. Cuadrat brought in Debjit Majumder in place of out-of-form Prabhsukhan Singh Gill, but Ghosh had little chance to keep Borja at bay as poor defending saw the Spanish midfielder scoring from inside the box twice.In the 13th minute of play, Drazic kept the ball inside the box getting past East Bengal defender Anwar Ali on the left. Majumder did get a hand to punch it away but a lurking Borja collected the rebound to slot the ball inside the net.The next goal came soon after when Jordanian Hijazi Maher made a crucial blunder to lose the ball inside the box to Boris Singh, who cut inside and put it across to an unmarked Borja, who made a perfect finish giving Majumder no chance. In both the goals, none of the East Bengal defenders were in their positions.With most of the play being restricted inside the East Bengal half, it looked like the hosts were staring at another humiliation in front of the home crowd. But East Bengal managed to pull one back when they earned a penalty after Madih Talal was rather unnecessarily brought down inside the box by Goa defender Nim Dorji . Talal himself found the net from the spot in the 29th minute.The visitors continued to create opportunities and could have increased the lead had Majumder not made some vital saves. Borja once again found the target to complete his hat-trick in the 71st minute when Udanta Singh won possession from Hijazi and squared it to the Spanish player to push it in.However the Goa side suffered a setback when Carl McHugh saw a second yellow for a reckless tackle and received his marching orders in the 81st minute. East Bengal got their second goal when Goa goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani failed to collect Anwar's long ranger properly and substitute David Lalhlansanga was quick to pounce on it and fire it on the roof of the net from a close distance.Although East Bengal kept pushing for the equaliser in the final minutes, FC Goa managed to hold fort.",Borja Herrera scored a hat-trick to give FC Goa their first win of this ISL season. East Bengal were down by two goals within the first 20 minutes of play. Madih Talal and David Lalhlansanga scored for the hosts. Carl McHugh was sent off for the visitors.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113757243,imgsize-85732,width-400,resizemode-4/113757243.jpg"

BEIJING: Top-ranked Jannik Sinner rallied to beat Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 in the second round of the China Open on Saturday and learned afterward that his steroid case is far from over.While Sinner was on court in Beijing, the World Anti-Doping Agency announced it was seeking a ban of one to two years for the U.S. Open champion who tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but was not suspended in a decision by an independent tribunal announced by the International Tennis Integrity Agency on Aug.20 because the ITIA determined he was not to blame.Sinner's fate will now be determined by the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport after WADA said it filed an appeal on Thursday.""Obviously, I'm very disappointed and also surprised of this appeal, to be honest, because we had three hearings,"" Sinner said at a press conference after his match Saturday. ""All three hearings came out very positively for me.""You know, I was not expecting it. I knew it couple of days ago, that they were going to appeal, that today it's going to go official. But yeah, it's surprise.""On court Saturday, the two-time Grand Slam champion again found himself behind in the Chinese capital after Safiullin broke serve twice to claim the opening set.Sinner's power and laser-like accuracy from the baseline gradually chipped away at his Russian opponent and helped the Italian to win seven straight games from 2-2 in the second set to take the ascendancy and close out a gritty win.Sinner, who has reached at least the quarterfinals at every tour-level event he has played in 2024, will next play Jiri Lehecka, who earlier defeated Roberto Bautista Agut 3-6, 6-2, 6-1.Third-seeded Daniil Medvedev , who lost to Sinner in this year's Australian Open final, also reached the last eight after beating French veteran Adrian Mannarino 7-6 (6), 6-2.Medvedev, the 2021 U.S. Open champion, had eight aces and broke Mannarino's serve four times as he advanced to his 75th tour-level quarterfinal.""Titles are more important obviously than finals. But even then 75 quarterfinals are great,"" said Medvedev, who is Russian. ""When I made my first quarterfinal (it) was (in) Moscow and I was pretty happy. And now it's 75. I am still happy, but not the same way.""He next faces Italy's Flavio Cabolli, who advanced with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Pavel Kotov.In the women's draw, U.S. Open champion Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the third round with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Thai qualifier Mananchaya Sawangkaew.""In the first set, I was struggling a little bit with the rhythm,"" said Sabalenka, who's best run in Beijing has only been to the quarterfinals. ""In the second set, seems like everything started working much better. I think that's why it was more smooth and better quality.""The second-ranked Sabalenka is the top seed in Beijing in the absence of Iga Swiatek .Next up for the three-time major winner is American Ashlyn Krueger, who beat New Zealand's Lulu Sun 6-1, 7-6 (4).Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen of China, seeded fifth, also advanced with a 6-1, 6-1 win over unseeded Kamilla Rakhimova. Her next opponent, Nadia Podoroska of Argentina, is also unseeded.Third-seeded Jasmine Paolini of Italy rallied from a poor first set to beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. Paolini, the French Open and Wimbledon runner-up, will play Poland's Magda Linette after the 31st-seeded player also needed three sets to progress past Moyuka Uchijima 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.Ninth-seeded Daria Kasatkina of Russia beat Croatian Jana Fett 6-1, 6-2. She will play Amanda Anisimova, who beat Camila Osorio of Colombia 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova was upset 1-6, 6-4, 7-5 by Romania's Jaqueline Cristian.American Madison Keys, seeded 18th, won 6-2, 6-1 against Spaniard Sara Sorribes Tormo and next faces 13th-seeded Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil.Japan Open Tomas Machac upset fifth-seeded Tommy Paul 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4) to advance to the quarterfinals and continued a disappointing week for the top-seeded players in Tokyo.Top-seeded Taylor Fritz, third-seeded Casper Ruud and fourth-seeded Stefaos Tsitsipas were all beaten in the first round, before second-seeded Hubert Hurkacz was also eliminated as he lost to U.S. Open semifinalist Jack Draper 6-4, 6-4 in the second round.Sixth-seeded Holger Rune is the highest-ranked seed remaining in the draw. Rune, from Denmark, beat home favorite Yoshihito Nishioka 6-2, 6-4.Defending champion Ben Shelton , the No. 8 seed, is the only other seeded player left in the quarterfinal draw.Alex Michelsen of the U.S. also advanced after a 6-1, 6-4 win over Australian Christopher O'Connell to set up a quarterfinal match against Machac.Kei Nishikori beat Jordan Thompson 6-2, 6-3 and will play Rune in the quarterfinals.","Top-ranked Jannik Sinner rallies to beat Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2,. 6-3 in the second round of the China Open.

Vijay turns his tennis around despite financial challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/vijay-turns-his-tennis-around-despite-financial-challenges/articleshow/113769629.cms,"Vijay Sundar Prashanth during the ATP 250 men's tennis event in Hangzhou, China, last week

PUNE: Sometimes the sequel can be better than the original.If his tennis career were to be divided in two halves, there would be no prizes for guessing which one Vijay Sundar Prashanth would cherish more.The 37-year-old has been living his dreams these past couple of years. He notched up three Challenger doubles titles in 2023 in partnership with Anirudh Chandrasekar , 11 years younger to him.The pair played the Australian Open this year, first appearance in a Grand Slam for both, before a string of poor results saw them part ways.Vijay, however, found his mojo back quickly after starting to combine with his childhood friend Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan from May.The duo reached the final of the clay-court Challenger in Bonn in August and took it up to another level last week by clinching the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China.""I mean, it's a great feeling after having gone through the journey. And, I would say some type of validation that we are doing the right things and on the right path,"" said Vijay of his maiden success on the ATP Tour in a measured tone, belying the overwhelming emotions he was experiencing.Except in the opening round, all three teams the Indian combination subsequently defeated enroute to the trophy featured top-50 ranked players - Julian Cash (38) and Lloyd Glasspool (42) in the second round, Ariel Behar (45) and Robert Galloway (40) in the semis, and Constantin Frantzen (47) and Hendrick Jebens (47) in the final.""To be honest, we didn't expect to win the title. I mean, we always believed in ourselves and our talent, and we believed that we can match any team at the highest level,"" Vjay said.""With the doubles format, we knew that we had to play good on big points. I think we did it well this week.""Actually, to do it back to back for four matches and against top 50 teams, that really surprised us. But also not in a big way, because I think both of us truly believed that we could match any team in this tournament.""Playing with Jeevan seems to bring out the best in him.""We are very familiar with each other, we've known each other for almost 25 years, on court and off court. We grew up together in Chennai. So that makes it easier to work as a team,"" Vijay said.""We acknowledge each other's analysis after the match and feedback with an open mind, so it helps the team progress.""We kind of know we are in it for a long run, and we are not going to judge the partnership based on a few bad results or a few first-round defeats. That's how we've taken it, so that‚Äôs helped.""But the journey has not always been a bed of roses. The covid pandemic disrupted his career right when he was shifting focus to doubles and the prolonged period of uncertainty was much harsh on someone who has had to deal with financial constraints right through his career.""Yes, after covid, it was tough, because for most tennis players who weren't playing at the highest level, they had to, I had to re-evaluate my whole career, my life, how to take it forward,"" he said.""That's when I felt doubles could be a viable option to continue, because at least I would be playing the Challenger tour, which technically would help me progress up the ladder and financially help me sustain playing the sport.""Since then, I've had a lot more clarity on how to approach doubles. And I have this blind belief that I can be a very good doubles player. That has just translated (to) on-court.""The revival began when his contemporary and former Tamil Nadu state-mate PC Vignesh asked him if he was willing to combine with his younger brother Anirudh.Anirudh had made a pretty early decision to play doubles full-time and Vignesh felt the seasoned Vijay would be the ideal partner to guide Anirudh.""The partnership with Anirudh was good because we kind of made use of each other's strengths,"" Vijay said.""He made use of my experience, and I made use of his young, enthusiastic energy, which I was lacking.""Because I was coming back after lockdown, (I was) searching for answers, and someone who had that motivation and enthusiasm, it rubbed off on me, and I was giving him the experience.""Then we kind of worked our way. So, it was actually a good partnership because we had to climb different levels.""We had to work as a team. For the first time in my career, I worked as a team with someone, and we had to cross many barriers. We played the first slam (for both) together. So, it was really good, yeah.""While he has managed to turn things around on the tennis court, it is yet to translate into financial security - given the low purse offered in doubles.""To be honest, what's always been the challenge for me my entire career is the financial aspect of playing the sport professionally,"" Vijay said.""I don't know how long I can sustain because now I am married, I have a five-month-old baby. So, I have to think about that aspect of life as well.""So, I've accepted that it's never going to go away. It's up to me to start doing well, and then I can generate my own funds and sustain myself playing at this level.""So, for me personally, that's the only challenge, everything else, I'm very confident about myself, my work ethic, the partner that I have, and the circle that I've created around myself.""My wife has been very supportive of my career, which is really crucial at this stage.""So, the only challenge for me is the financial aspect. Hopefully there comes a stage where I don't have to worry about it.""","Vijay Sundar Prashanth won the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner ‚Äôs ongoing doping controversy has ignited discussions about doping in tennis once again. While Sinner, ranked among the top tennis players in the world, continues to appeal his case after testing positive for an anabolic steroid, the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) is seeking a ban.The tennis world is watching closely, as this case brings back memories of other high-profile doping bans in the sport.That said, we look at five tennis stars who were banned for doping.In 2016, the tennis world was stunned when Maria Sharapova, one of the most celebrated female players, tested positive for meldonium at the Australian Open.Meldonium, which had just been added to the banned substances list, was a heart medication Sharapova had been using legally for many years. She was initially handed a two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), but after appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), her suspension was reduced to 15 months.Sharapova admitted to not being aware of meldonium‚Äôs addition to the banned list, and though the ban affected her career, she returned to the sport in 2017.Five-time Grand Slam champion Martina Hingis shocked the tennis world in 2007 when she announced she had tested positive for cocaine at Wimbledon.Hingis denied ever taking the drug, but chose not to contest the result. She retired from tennis soon after and was handed a two-year ban by the ITF.Despite the ban, Hingis's legacy remains strong, and she later made a successful comeback in doubles tennis, further cementing her place in tennis history.Simona Halep, a two-time Grand Slam champion, was handed a four-year ban in September 2023 after testing positive for the banned substance Roxadustat at the 2022 US Open. However, it was later cut to nine months.Halep has consistently maintained her innocence, claiming the result was due to contamination or an unintentional error. Despite her defence, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) pursued a thorough investigation, leading to the suspension.The case has raised questions about doping regulations and the challenges athletes face in proving their innocence when contamination is alleged. Halep's career now hangs in the balance as she fights to restore her reputation.The Croatian tennis star Marin ƒåiliƒá was banned in 2013 after testing positive for the stimulant nikethamide. ƒåiliƒá claimed he had inadvertently ingested the banned substance through glucose tablets and contested the severity of the ban.Initially banned for nine months, the suspension was later reduced to four months by CAS.ƒåiliƒá went on to win the 2014 US Open, proving that a doping ban, while damaging, doesn‚Äôt necessarily end a player‚Äôs career.In 2009, French tennis player Richard Gasquet tested positive for cocaine and was handed a 12-month ban by the ITF. However, Gasquet's defence was one of the more unusual in sports doping history.He claimed that he had ingested the drug inadvertently by kissing a woman who had consumed cocaine in a nightclub. An independent tribunal accepted his explanation and reduced his ban to two and a half months, allowing him to return to competition soon after.The current case with Jannik Sinner bears some similarities to these past incidents, especially in terms of contested explanations and appeals.Sinner, who tested positive for low levels of Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, claims the substance entered his system accidentally through his physiotherapist's treatment. Despite three hearings that ruled in Sinner‚Äôs favour, WADA has appealed the case, seeking a one-to-two-year ban, which could disrupt the young player's rising career.","Jannik Sinner tested positive for Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid.

BEIJING: Jannik Sinner said he was ""disappointed and surprised"" Saturday after the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) appealed the decision to clear him in his steroid case, seeking a ban of up to two years.The Italian world number one twice tested positive for traces of the banned substance clostebol in March but was exonerated and allowed to carry on playing.The 23-year-old went on to win the US Open earlier this month for his second major crown, weeks after the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) found he ""bears no fault or negligence"".The ITIA accepted his explanation that the drug entered his system when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy to the player.WADA on Thursday appealed the high-profile case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport .""It is WADA's view that the finding of 'no fault or negligence' was not correct under the applicable rules,"" it said in a statement on Saturday.WADA made the appeal announcement as Sinner was on court at the China Open, where the defending champion fought back to beat 69th-ranked Russian Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 in Beijing.""WADA is seeking a period of ineligibility of between one and two years,"" it added.Sinner has consistently denied knowingly doping and said after his win: ""Obviously I'm very disappointed and also surprised.""We had three hearings. All three hearings came out very positively for me.""Clostebol is an anabolic agent prohibited at all times by WADA.After winning the US Open, Sinner said that the controversy over his failed tests was still on his mind.He defeated Taylor Fritz in straight sets to add the New York title to his Australia Open triumph in January.""It was and it's still on my mind. It's not that it's gone, but when I'm on court, I try to focus about the game, I try to handle the situation the best possible way, communication with the team, in the practice courts,"" said the world number one.""It was not easy, that's for sure, but I tried to stay focused, with which I guess I've done a great job.""The decision to clear the Italian was met with scepticism by some players in the locker room who suggested that Sinner had benefited from preferential treatment due to his status in the sport.Australia's Nick Kyrgios said in a post on X that the lack of a suspension was ""ridiculous"".Canadian player Denis Shapovalov said the decision proved that there are ""different rules for different players"" suggesting that Sinner was saved by his ranking.On court in Beijing, Sinner fell behind against the ""lucky loser"" Safiullin on Saturday after also dropping a set in his opening victory over Chile's Nicolas Jarry.The second set went with serve until the sixth game when Sinner finally broke to go up 4-2, celebrating with a subtle fist pump.Sinner took control early on in the deciding set on the way to an ultimately comfortable victory to reach the last eight, where he faces Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic.In-form Sinner has reached at least the quarter-final of every tournament he has played this year.","Jannik Sinner says he is ""disappointed and surprised"" by World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal.

NEW DELHI: The steroid case involving top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency , the Montreal-based body known as WADA , announced Saturday.WADA said it is seeking a ban of one to two years for the U.S. Open champion but indicated that it does not plan to back date an eventual ban - which would mean that Sinner could keep his second Grand Slam title if he is found guilty.The announcement was made while Sinner was on court against Roman Safiullin at the China Open in Beijing.Sinner tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but was not banned in a decision by an independent tribunal announced by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) on Aug. 20 because the ITIA determined he was not to blame.Sinner's accepted explanation was that the banned performance-enhancer entered his system unintentionally through a massage from his physiotherapist, who used a spray containing the steroid to treat their own cut finger.WADA said it filed an appeal on Thursday to the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport .""It is WADA's view that the finding of no fault or negligence' was not correct under the applicable rules,"" WADA said in a statement. ""WADA is seeking a period of ineligibility of between one and two years. WADA is not seeking a disqualification of any results, save that which has already been imposed by the tribunal of first instance.""WADA suggested the rules were not followed correctly despite a prosecutor for tennis's integrity body - which accepted Sinner's version of events - being a lawyer who regularly works on high-profile cases for the global watchdog, including the successful appeal against Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva.An appeal verdict at CAS could come quickly - even within just a few months - if the parties agree to cooperate. At least that's how it worked in another high-profile doping case in tennis involving Maria Sharapova.Still, the case likely won't be resolved before Sinner begins the defense of his Australian Open title in January.Sharapova tested positive at the Australian Open in January 2016 for the newly-banned heart medication meldonium. She was banned for two years in June that year by the International Tennis Federation.The Russian star appealed to CAS, had an appeal hearing in New York before three judges that September, and four weeks later got the verdict that cut her ban to 15 months.The entire process for Sharapova with CAS took just four months - far shorter than most doping cases, which typically last for about one year. The timeline can stall with the complexities of picking a judging panel, finding a hearing date and parties exchanging documents and evidence from expert witnesses.During the Indian Wells hard-court event in March, Sinner tested positive for low levels of a metabolite of Clostebol , a banned anabolic steroid that can be used for ophthalmological and dermatological use. It's the same drug for which San Diego Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. was suspended by MLB in 2022.Sinner tested positive again eight days later in an out-of-competition sample.He was provisionally suspended twice by the tennis integrity body because of those test results, but he successfully appealed twice to an independent tribunal judge and was allowed to keep competing on tour.Sinner said his test results happened because his fitness trainer purchased an over-the-counter spray called Trofodermin in Italy that contained Clostebol and gave it to Sinner's physiotherapist to treat a cut on the physiotherapist's finger. The physiotherapist then treated Sinner without wearing gloves.The ITIA said it accepted Sinner's explanation, after 10 interviews with the player and his entourage, and the independent panel agreed at a hearing on Aug. 15.Sinner later announced that he had fired his two trainers.",Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency.

LONDON: Wimbledon have been given the green light to go ahead with their controversial plans to expand the historic venue for the grass-court Grand Slam.The All England Club 's proposal to build 39 new courts, including an 8,000-seat show court, on the adjacent former Wimbledon Park Golf Club was passed on Friday by London's deputy mayor for planning Jules Pipe .Wimbledon will nearly triple the size of its current site once the project is completed.Plans were first submitted in 2021, but there had been strong local opposition from groups such as 'Save Wimbledon Park' and environmental protestors who claimed the harm caused to open land was not justified.The issue had become increasingly acrimonious, but Friday's decision was expected after Greater London Authority planning officers recommended permission be granted due to the financial and community benefits.""In summary, the proposed development would facilitate very significant benefits,"" Pipe said. ""I agree with my officers that these benefits clearly outweigh the harm.""Central to Wimbledon's case has been the desire to hold its qualifying competition, which is currently staged over three miles away in Roehampton, on its own land.All England Club chair Debbie Jevans said: ""We are delighted that the Greater London Authority has resolved to approve our applications to transform the former Wimbledon Park golf course.""Our proposals will deliver 27 acres of newly accessible parkland for the community and enable us to bring the qualifying competition for The Championships onsite, with all of the substantial economic and employment opportunities this presents.""The Mayor of London's office took charge of the application in January after Merton Council approved the plans and Wandsworth Council rejected them late last year.Mayor Sadiq Khan recused himself from the process having previously expressed public support for the development, leaving the matter in Pipe's hands.Fleur Anderson, the MP for Putney, claimed allowing the scheme would set ""a dangerous London-wide and national precedent"".But Jevans said: ""We look forward to working with all parties to bring this vision to life, delivering one of London's greatest sporting transformations since the 2012 Games and securing Wimbledon's future at the pinnacle of world sport.""","Wimbledon have been given the green light to expand the historic venue for the grass-court Grand Slam.

BEIJING: World number one Jannik Sinner fought back to launch the defence of his China Open title with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 win over 28th-ranked Chilean Nicolas Jarry on Thursday.The US Open champion next faces veteran three-time Grand Slam winner Stan Wawrinka, who is a wildcard entry in Beijing, or Russia's Roman Safiullin.The 23-year-old Sinner arrived in the Chinese capital fresh from winning in New York for his second major title, having triumphed at the Australian Open at the start of the year.With victory also at the Cincinnati Masters before the US Open, Sinner faced Jarry in red-hot form and on an 11-match winning streak.Sinner made that 12, but not before suffering a scare.""In the first set I was struggling to return his serve and he broke me,"" Sinner said.""I just tried to stay there mentally. The first round at any tournament is never easy and playing against him is very tough.""But I am happy about the performance and how I ended the match.""The two went toe-to-toe in the first set but it was the Chilean who got in front when he broke for a 4-3 lead when the world number one fired long.The 28-year-old Jarry consolidated without losing a point in the eighth game and, after double-faulting on his first set point, sealed the set with his fifth ace of the match.Going behind seemed to sting a re-energised Sinner into action.The top seed raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set, eventually wrapping the set up after briefly threatening to blow his advantage.Sinner tamed Jarry's big serve to start the deciding set and grab an early break, winning the game with a terrific crosscourt backhand.Sinner broke again for 4-1 and was well on the way to an ultimately comfortable win.His main rivals in the Chinese capital will be four-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz and the Russian duo of Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev , the third and fourth seeds.

For Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan , the ATP Tour doubles title in Hangzhou marks a sort of Jeev 2.0 ‚Äî not only has his game has matured and become more solid since he won his maiden title at his home town of Chennai, but he is also able to understand better the significance of triumph and what it means to his career going forward.The 35-year-old left-hander claimed the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China, in the company of his friend and fellow Tamil Nadu player Vijay Sundar Prashanth , beating Constantin Frantzen and Hendrik Jebens of Germany 4-6, 7-6 (5), 10-7 in the hard-court final on Sunday.Jeevan‚Äôs first title had come in 2017 at the Chennai Open in the company of veteran Davis Cupper and Australian Open Grand Slam champion Rohan Bopanna.‚ÄúI think (I am) a little bit more experienced. I remember the first title was a little sooner than I thought,‚Äù Jeevan, who has climbed 27 spots on the ATP ladder to be ranked 86 in doubles, told The Times of India.‚ÄúAfter switching to doubles, Rohan and I had won Chennai in 2017 and I didn't really know where that title was going to take me, you know.‚ÄúI was just kind of excited to be playing Grand Slams , because that title happened to push me into the top 100. And ironically, this title has also pushed me into the top 100.‚ÄúBut I would say, (in) 2017 I was kind of naive without any real path to move forward after achieving a 250 title. But now, I'm feeling much calmer after winning a title of this stage, because I have a set partner and I have schedule which works in our favour.‚ÄúAnd I'm healthy, I'm able to see that there is definitely going to be an exciting path to be playing with the same partner and consistently at a higher level.‚ÄùIt has been an eventful year for him so far, and Jeevan, wiser with experience, feels things are falling in place for him.‚ÄúThis year has not been very easy, there have been a lot of ups and downs. But very happy to be playing with Vijay, who's one of my closest friends, not just on tour, but in life,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúWe've been patient as a team. We've been learning how to get to our best ability together.‚ÄúAs the as far as the emotions are concerned, I think in goal setting, it was very clear for me that this was going to be the year for me to build something, because I'm always looking at long term with my partners.‚ÄúI have only played with a handful of people my whole career. So with Vijay, we are just building something to give ourselves an opportunity to be, you know, a set team in the Grand Slams next year.‚ÄùA long-term partnership has become a rare phenomenon in modern doubles and Jeevan looks at it practically.‚ÄúA lot of teams are looking to build partnerships together. You can see (that) even with the Double Dream of India. So many teams are sticking together, and we're just trying to figure out what best combinations are going to get us all into the Grand Slams,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúToday was a good day for Vijay and me, but the season has been good for Balaji and even Yuki has been doing very well.‚ÄúThe ideal goal for this program is to see all the players sitting at the Slam, taking a group picture.‚Äù","Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan wins ATP Tour doubles title in Hangzhou.

South Korean Lee Hyun Il is Sindhu's consulting coach

BENGALURU: After a disappointing Paris Olympics , PV Sindhu has a new coach, though temporarily, in former Olympian Anup Sridhar . The two-time Olympic medallist will work with the Karnataka man for the remainder of the year and the duo will sit down by the year-end to decide upon the future.Sridhar came into the picture after Sindhu's coach Indonesian Agus Dwi Santoso's contract got over after the quadrennial event.The former international player was taken on board after a successful meeting with the star player and her team. For the last three weeks, the ace shuttler, who trained at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) before Paris, has been sweating it out for almost five hours daily under the watchful eyes of Sridhar at the Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad. She has been involved in sparring sessions and fitness routines too. The current coaching team also includes former Korean shuttler Lee Hyun Il .Sridhar is pleased with the way the new partnership has begun and is keen to work on different aspects of Sindhu's game in the coming weeks. ""The start has been good so far. The first thing was to get her pain free, playing and moving freely on the court, which we have achieved. Now we're working on getting her speed and endurance levels up. There's a decent amount of improvement,"" Sridhar told TOI. ""I have tried to devise training programmes and routines around the areas that she's finding a little bit difficult.""The last 21 months has not been great for Sindhu as she did not win a single BWF singles title. The task is now cut out for Sridhar as her results in the next three months could prove to be the difference between a long or short-term association with Sindhu. However, the Bengaluruean is looking beyond the results.""The results are certainly important, but I wouldn't say it is the only important thing to look at. No miracles are going to be performed either by me or by anybody else, real change takes time. But I think this period is important from the point of view of how we work together, how we communicate. The working relationship will be important,"" he said.To start with, Sindhu has marked two events for next month, the Arctic Open in Finland (Oct 8-13, Super 500), and Denmark Open in Odense (Oct 15-20, Super 750).

HYDERABAD: Amid the uneasy quiet caused by Saina Nehwal 's repeated hints at retirement and PV Sindhu 's indifferent form of late, Anmol Kharb has quietly announced her arrival on the big stage with two back-to-back titles.Many pundits, including Pullela Gopichand , say the 17-year-old shuttler from Haryana can fill the gap, following her international triumphs in Belgium and Poland in the last two weeks.Sunday last, she routed Milena Schnider of Switzerland 21-12, 21-8 in the final of the Poland Open . A week before that, Anmol started the Belgium Open as a qualifier and went on to win her first women's singles title with a 24-22, 12-21, 21-10 victory against Amalie Schulz of Denmark in Leuven.And to think that she nearly missed the event. Anmol reached the Belgium Open venue an hour before her match after a long flight due to a visa issue. But she won seven straight matches to clinch the title.Anmol is also credited with helping the Indian women win the Badminton Asia Team Championship by pulling off crucial matches against top-ranked opponents in February. A gritty player, Anmol became the women's national champion last year when she was just 16.It is this never-say-die attitude and her willingness to work hard with a smile that makes Gopichand see a Saina in Anmol.""She is like Saina, very gritty and never leaves without putting up a tough fight,"" Gopichand told TOI on Tuesday after Anmol won her second international title in Poland.Gopichand, who shaped the careers of Saina, Sindhu, Kidambi Srikanth and several others, is not surprised by Anmol's progress. ""I am not at all surprised by her results. She will win more tournaments. A few basics in her game need correction. She has a good future and is on the right track,"" Gopichand added.A big fan of Saina, Anmol is being trained by Saina's husband Parupalli Kashyap, RMV Gurusaidutt and former international Rahul Yadav.Currently ranked 165th, Anmol's target is to get into the top-15 as soon as possible.

Despite not winning a medal in Paris, Sindhu has been training under Sridhar for the past three weeks at Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad.PV Sindhu's recent notable achievements include her victories at the Singapore Open and the Commonwealth Games in 2022.In 2023, she was the runner-up at the Madrid Spain Masters and at the Malaysia Masters Super 500 in May.""I spoke with Sindhu's team a few weeks ago, and she has been training under me in Hyderabad since the start of this month. We've made significant progress, and in two weeks, we'll head to tournaments in Europe,"" said Sridhar, who previously coached Lakshya Sen.PV Sindhu exited the Paris Games in the pre-quarterfinals, losing to China's He Bingjiao. Sindhu will now turn her attention to the European leg of the BWF World Tour . Her next event will be the Arctic Open in Vantaa, Finland, scheduled for October 8-13, followed by the Denmark Open in Odense from October 15-20.""I'm taking it week by week,"" said Sridhar, who was brought on for the rest of the season after Agus Dwi Santoso 's contract ended post-Paris Olympics.""Since we haven't committed to anything long-term, it's hard to plan for 2025. However, there are a couple of tournaments in 2025 that Sindhu should aim to peak at,"" he said.""You can plan for physical peaks, but not for form. I have my eye on a few tournaments next year, but the immediate focus is to enhance her consistency and get her back on the podium -- that's the big goal.""Reflecting on the current training, Sridhar noted, ""I've spent this time understanding her situation, and I'm pleased to report that she's completely physically fit, with no signs of aches or pains.""""We've followed our training schedule without missing any sessions. I'm working on helping her unlearn certain things while introducing new elements to her game,"" he added.Sindhu had a challenging period after a knee injury during the French Open last October, returning to competition only five months before the Paris Games.""She faced a tough couple of years with some good results but lacked consistency during that period,"" Sridhar said.""In just three weeks, I've noticed decent improvements, but there's still more work to be done,"" said Sridhar, a 2007 Asian Championships bronze-medallist.""If we can get her to a level where she's consistently advancing past the early rounds, regardless of her draw or opponent, she'll have a realistic chance of making a strong comeback.""""...yet her hunger remains. She works extremely hard and is a great role model for the rest of India's badminton players."" he added.PV Sindhu has seen multiple coaching changes leading up to the Paris Olympics. After securing a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics , her South Korean coach, Park Tae Sang, left her team in early 2023.Following his departure, Sindhu collaborated with SAI coach Vidhi Chaudhary for several months. She then appointed Muhammad Hafiz Hashim, a former All England champion, as her coach.This partnership, however, was short-lived. Sindhu then moved to Bengaluru to train under Prakash Padukone. Later, Padukone's academy brought in Agus Dwi Santoso to prepare her for the upcoming Olympics.","PV Sindhu is continuing her quest for success with new motivation from coach Anup Sridhar.
