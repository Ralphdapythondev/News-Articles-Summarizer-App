NEW DELHI: The Delhi Capitals (DC) will face off against the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Match 35 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 on Saturday. DC is currently in sixth place in the IPL 2024 points table with six points, while SRH is tied with Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings, and Lucknow Super Giants with eight points.In their previous encounters, DC has won 11 matches against SRH, while SRH has emerged victorious 12 times in the 23 matches they have played against each other.The upcoming match between Delhi Capitals (DC) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) marks the debut game of IPL 2024 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium . Historically, the pitch at this stadium has been slow and sluggish. However, with a fresh wicket expected for this match, we anticipate improved batting conditions initially. Nonetheless, as the game progresses, the spinners are likely to play a significant role due to the traditionally spin-friendly nature of the pitch.In the 84 matches played at the venue, teams batting first have clinched victory 37 times, while those batting second have emerged victorious in 46 matches.The average first innings total stands at 165 runs, whereas teams chasing have often faced an average target of 149 runs. The highest total ever recorded at this venue was 231/4 by Punjab Kings against Delhi Capitals, while the lowest total stands at 83/10 by Delhi Capitals against Chennai Super Kings.1. Batters can expect favourable conditions initially, but as the match progresses, the pitch will slow down, favouring spinners. Thus, batsmen adept at playing spin will be valuable assets.2. Bowlers will find assistance with the new ball, but as the game unfolds, spinners will come into play.IPL 2024 Stats: 253 Runs in 6 MatchesHeinrich Klaasen, the South African middle-order batsman, has been in exceptional form over the past 10-12 months.

KOLKATA: The city is in the grip of a heat wave, with the temperature soaring past the 40-degree Celsius mark. Afternoons, in particular, are extremely uncomfortable and the doctors’ advice is to stay indoors to avoid heatstroke and other related ailments.On such an afternoon, two teams will be heading into the Eden Gardens for a T20 cricket match.The heat will be the biggest challenge on Sunday, when Kolkata Knight Riders take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru in an IPL tie scheduled to start at 3:30 pm. Even the most supremely fit athlete would be yearning for some respite.“It will be very challenging,” KKR pacer Vaibhav Arora admitted on Saturday, after facing the heat during a practice session. “Accept it and carry on.”It will be a test for those diehard, debonair fans too, who would be brave enough to fetch up and stay out there in the Sun, rooting for RCB’s Virat Kohli among others. Quite often, sports is about individuals and the former India skipper will most likely be the man in maximum demand, even though his team is struggling to stay afloat.“We still believe that if we win a match or two, we can get that momentum,” senior RCB player Dinesh Karthik said.Kohli has been in form and KKR would want him back in the dugout as soon as possible. With 361 runs already in his bag, the veteran is currently on the top rung of the scorers’ ladder, quite ironic, given that RCB have won only one of their seven games so far. Languishing at the bottom of the table, they will be hoping for another Kohli special against KKR on Sunday.But then, like always, KKR have a plan for the veteran, Arora said. “We will be looking to get Kohli out early.”The hosts themselves would be a little demoralised after the gut-wrenching loss to Rajasthan in their last game. Having put up a mammoth score, they perhaps believed that the match was won, till Jos Buttler stepped in.","Kolkata Knight Riders take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru in an IPL tie scheduled to start at 3:30 pm.

With a series of setbacks shaking their campaigns, the underdog teams Punjab Kings and Gujarat Titans are eager to halt their downward spiral and reclaim victory in their upcoming Indian Premier League clash on Sunday.Former champions GT find themselves languishing in eighth place after a humiliating defeat to Delhi Capitals, where they were dismissed for a mere 89 runs, marking their third loss in four matches.PBKS, currently ninth, are reeling from a narrow nine-run loss to Mumbai Indians, salvaged somewhat by a remarkable recovery led by Ashutosh Sharma and Shashank Singh after a shaky start to their chase.With just two wins from seven outings, PBKS's confidence is shaky. Despite their opponent's struggles, PBKS faces a tough challenge, especially at their home ground, where fans have seen little to cheer this season.The absence of skipper Shikhar Dhawan due to injury has compounded PBKS's woes, with doubts lingering over his availability for Sunday's fixture. While Dhawan's IPL 2024 performance hasn't been stellar, his leadership and presence remain crucial for a team desperately seeking victories.PBKS's woes extend beyond Dhawan's absence. Specialist batters like Prabhsimran Singh, Liam Livingstone, and Rilee Rossouw have failed to deliver consistently, putting immense pressure on the team.However, amidst the gloom, PBKS finds solace in the performances of unsung heroes Shashank and Ashutosh, who have often salvaged difficult situations with their determined efforts.On the other side, GT, with three wins and four defeats, aim for redemption after their batting collapse against Delhi Capitals. Led by stars like Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, and David Miller, complemented by a solid supporting cast, GT possesses the potential to bounce back strongly.However, GT's bowling unit faces challenges, especially with Mohammad Shami's absence and Umesh Yadav's inconsistency. Despite this, star spinner Rashid Khan continues to shine with both ball and bat, providing hope for GT's resurgence.","Punjab Kings and Gujarat Titans play each other on Sunday.

In the first 7 games, MI only have three wins under new skipper Hardik.And former T20 World Cup winner and opener Robin Uthappa recently made a big statement on Hardik, saying that the booing has resulted in 'mental health issues' for the all-rounder.Taking Hardik's side and backing his decision to return to MI, Uthappa said that the treatment he has been receiving from fans has been unfair.""He is a guy who has got the calibre and potential to be an all-time great for the Indian team. He was let go by the team which discovered him, he went to another franchise. After winning 3-4 titles with them, he left. He must have felt a little bad; that will be there. He went to GT, won a title and finished runners-up in another. Then the conversation began,"" Uthappa said on The Ranveer Show on YouTube.""The mocking, trolling, the memes about his fitness. You don't think it hurts him? It hurts him. It hurts any human being. How many people actually know the reality of it? Hardik is dealing with mental health issues, for sure. We, as people, I understand, as Indians, we are emotional. But it is not right to impose this kind of treatment on any human being. It is unbecoming as a society for us to do that to someone and be okay with it. We should not be laughing along with it. We should not be forwarding these memes.""It's our job, yes it's passion too, but it's what puts the food on the table for me. My job is on display for you to criticise. A corporate person's job is not on television to criticise, or have an opinion about either. When that is the case, you have to exercise a certain amount of empathy and dignity to the other person to allow them to fail. One of the most beautiful things we did as a country is our expression of love, and our reaction to our Indian team after we lost the World Cup.

The little girl, Meher, who received a cricket ball as a surprise gift from MS Dhoni , has made a promise that warmed hearts as the video was shared by Star Sports on social media on Friday.While walking up to the dressing room after playing a cameo during the IPL match between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Dhoni paused at the stairs after seeing the little Meher with her father and gifted the ball to her after picking it up from the stairs.Talking about the cherished gift from the Indian legend, Meher said she aspires to play for India one day; and after fulfilling her wish, she will gift that ball to someone else.After his cameo of 4-ball 20 against Mumbai, Dhoni's bat continued to breathe fire when CSK visited the Lucknow Super Giants on Saturday. The former CSK and India captain smashed 28 not out off just nine balls, including 2 sixes and 3 fours.Dhoni's brisk knock and Ravindra Jadeja's 57* off 40 balls propelled CSK to 176 for 6 runs in their allotted overs. However half-centuries by LSG openers KL Rahul (82 off 53 balls) and Quinton de Kock (54 off 43 balls) ensured a comfortable eight-wicket win for the home team.","Little girl, Meher, who received a cricket ball as a surprise gift from MS Dhoni, has made a promise that warmed hearts.

'Mayank Yadav's body needs...': Former West Indies pacer on young LSG sensation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/mayank-yadavs-body-needs-former-west-indies-pacer-on-young-lsg-sensation/articleshow/109442981.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop has heaped praise on Lucknow Super Giants ' (LSG) emerging pace sensation, Mayank Yadav , lauding his rare combination of pace and control.Bishop emphasised the importance of managing Mayank properly through the expertise of medical professionals, strength and conditioning coaches, and nutritionists.Mayank made a stunning impact on IPL 2024 with his fiery pace during matches against Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).In these encounters, he showcased his talent by claiming six wickets and earning the 'Player of the Match' award in both games.Consistently touching speeds of 150 kmph, Mayank's exceptional control over line and length left spectators and pundits alike in awe. Although currently sidelined due to injury, his impending return has garnered anticipation from the entire cricket fraternity.Bishop acknowledged Mayank's extraordinary talent but cautioned against his injury history, emphasising the importance of managing his body and ensuring adequate strengthening to prevent future setbacks. This recognition underscores the need to nurture and safeguard the promising career of this young fast bowler.""Everybody agrees that Mayank Yadav is a special talent. It is very rare to have someone who can consistently bowl around 145 kph and go up to the mid-150s. Mayank has got something that you cannot buy: pace and control,"" said Bishop, as quoted by ESPNCricinfo in his column.""But he also has an injury history, and in this, he is not unique. We have seen several Indian fast-bowling talents break down. Rohit Sharma, I remember, had expressed his frustration about bowlers picking up injuries frequently.""""Mayank's body needs management and it needs great strengthening. How do we ensure his talent gets the chance to blossom fully?"" he concluded.Bishop said that he is a great American sports fan, in particular NBA basketball, and pointed out that in such tournaments, players invest in themselves through support staff and systems and national teams, franchises need to go the same route to preserve special talents.""I am a big American sports fan and I particularly follow the NBA, where the top players invest, or have others invest, in themselves to the tune of millions of dollars, in terms of having support staff and systems. Tennis players, too, do the same. I believe it is time for cricket to go that way - for the top franchises and national teams to preserve special talents like Mayank and support their growth,"" said Bishop.Bishop also pointed out that Australian skipper Pat Cummins , who was injury-prone as a youngster, struggled to deal with the stress of the game on his body. But over the years, he managed to build for himself an impressive career after years of working on his body and changing his technique. The former bowler said that it would be great if Mayank gets the same input that Cummins once had in his career, be it through LSG or the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).""Pat Cummins is a very good example of someone who came in as a teenager, and found that the stresses of the game were too much for his particular technique and his body. He had to come out, rehabilitate, make himself different technically, and come back a few years later. And as we've found out, Cummins has managed to build an exceptional career, where he has developed into one of the best fast bowlers and captains,"" said Bishop.""It would be a good idea for Mayank at the start of his career to have the input Cummins found he required. Whether it's Lucknow Super Giants, Mayank's IPL team, or the BCCI, they can undertake a project - not an experiment, mind you - to say, ""This guy is a diamond. Let us see if we can allocate some sort of funding and see where this goes,"" he added.Bishop said that Mayank should be given a personal strength and conditioning trainer for a year, along with some other medical and diet-related staff. In this way, Mayank will be able to give the game a ""decade of excellent fast bowling"". He also said that fast bowlers like him should have access to the ""right voices,"" like he had talks with Malcolm Marshall during the start of his career.""Mayank will still be playing cricket through this, to be clear; just that this person is attached to him. See how that pans out after a year. You have got the resources for an effort like this.Whether in the future Mayank plays a lot of red-ball cricket, whether he plays all formats, or whether you keep him as a white-ball option, you will be able to know after a year or two. So it is a worthwhile project, not only for India and LSG, but for the world game. This young kid, who is 21 now, by the time he is 23 or 24, when his body has matured, he can give you almost a decade of excellent fast bowling. That is one thing I would like to see happen.""""Alongside the physical development, it is also imperative that young fast bowlers like Mayank get to hear the right voices. I came through at a time when the great Malcolm Marshall was around. While I thought Marshall was one of the greatest tactical fast bowlers that I interacted with, I could only talk with him when we were on the field together or when we were in the dressing room together. Had I been able to access his insights more often, and while I was younger, it would have expedited my learning curve. I do not doubt that,"" he added.Bishop said that Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah should be made to interact with upcoming pace bowlers since he is a clear thinker and great communicator. He said that Bumrah could do some formal Zoom sessions with young pacers on bowling plans, preparations, variations, pace, lengths, etc.""I get a little frustrated that icons like, say, Jasprit Bumrah, are not made to interact frequently with young fast men. When we hear Bumrah speak, we know that he understands the game. He is clear in his thinking and he is a great communicator. For the next generation, the Under-19 guys, and even for those who are playing alongside him, you could organise some formal Zoom meetings and have him share his wisdom with them. Bumrah does not have to fly everywhere; just utilise technology,"" said Bishop.""Let him talk through formal bowling plans, preparation, and what he would do in certain situations. Let him talk through variations in pace and lengths, and how he sees the game. Expedite that learning curve. It does not have to be something that happens every month - half-yearly or quarter-yearly should work. And I can tell you that would not hurt anyone.""""It is like going to university, where you have guys who have been there and have done it before. MS Dhoni is a similar example. Excellent captain. If you want to bring in your next generation of leaders, why not tap into his expertise? I am not saying that these two gentlemen are the only people to talk to, but you get the drift,"" he concluded.Bishop said that he always picked up things from talking to Wasim Akram , Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding, etc., and he called them the ""university of fast bowling.""He said that Kartik Tyagi could talk to Bumrah after an IPL match for five minutes. He said that he thought that Tyagi was someone who could have pushed on, but he had injuries to deal with.""You do not have to tell a guy what to do right. But I can tell a guy what not to do because I have made the same mistake. I can tell him what to do to avoid that. We do not have to leave a lot of these things up to players finding out through trial and error.""""Let us not only leave these things to playing a lot of first-class cricket and learning as you go but let us supplement it from the outside as well. Let them play, but also let us help them with knowledge. It is time to start being a little bit more precise and determined in our development of players, especially if you have the resources for it,"" he concluded.","Former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop has heaped praise on Lucknow Super Giants'(LSG) emerging pace sensation, Mayank Yadav.

NEW DELHI: Another explosive start from openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma set up Sunrisers Hyderabad 's easy 67-run win over Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League on Saturday.Head and Abhishek Sharma combined for 125 without loss in the first six overs — the highest score in an IPL power play.While Sharma smashed 46 off 12 balls, Head finished on 89 off 32 as the openers made 131 in a mere 38 balls to give Sunrisers another unreal start.After yet another century partnership between Head and Abhishek continued to redefine the format, SRH reached 266/7 in their 20 overs, their third 250-plus total this season.A disciplined bowling effort then, led by a four-fer from T Natrajan, kept DC away from the target as the hosts folded for 199.Following the game, Cummins said during the post-match presentation, ""Good record here, another great game of cricket. We need to keep that going. There was not much for the bowlers in the powerplay. It got better for the bowlers when the ball got softer. We were very excited to see them (Head and Abhishek) batting, but we had to bowl in the second half as well. We were really disciplined with the ball; the bowlers executed their plans.""In the match, SRH was put on the field first by DC. Head (89 in 32 balls, with 11 fours and six sixes) and Abhishek (46 in 12 balls, with two fours and six sixes) put on an explosive stand of 131 runs in 6.2 overs.Later, contributions from Shahbaz Ahmed (59* in 29 balls, with two fours and five sixes) and Nitish Kumar (37 in 27 balls, with two fours and two sixes) came in handy to lift SRH to 266.Kuldeep Yadav was the pick of the bowlers for DC with 4/55. Mukesh Kumar and Axar Patel also got a six.In the run chase, DC managed to keep up with SRH's run rate in the first half of their innings despite losig wickets. Knocks from Jake Fraser McGurk (65 in 18 balls, five fours and seven sixes) and Abhishek Porel (42 in 22 balls, with seven fours and a six) kept the Capitals alive.However, after their dismissal, DC lost momentum and despite skipper Rishabh Pant 's fighting (44 in 35 balls, with five fours and a six), the Capitals were restricted to 199 in 19.1 overs.T Natrajan (4/19) was the pick of the bowlers for SRH.Head took home the 'Player of the Match' award.

NEW DELHI: Succumbing to a heavy 67-run defeat at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad at home, Delhi Capitals skipper Rishabh Pant on Saturday conceded his side was literally doing catchup after Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma 's record-shattering powerplay exhibition.As Sunrisers Hyderabad smashed 125 runs in the first six overs to create an IPL record, it helped the visitors to a towering 266 for 7 -- their fourth 250-plus total of the season.After getting ripped apart with the ball, Pant and co. did give a fight with the bat in the mammoth chase but eventually finished at 199 all out.Soon after the disappointing loss, legendary Sunil Gavaskar consoled Pant, asking him to never put his head down.""I never want your head down, there are lots of games so keep a smile always,"" Gavaskar told Pant during the post-match presentation.The DC captain was visibly moved by Gavaskar's supportive words and responded, ""I will try my best, sir"".Head (89, 32 balls) and Abhishek (46, 12 balls) took power play to a different level, erasing the previous record of 105/0 by KKR against RCB in 2017.""I think power play was the difference. We were just catching up throughout the match. That was the massive difference. Hopefully, we will come back with more thought process and clear mindset,"" said Pant, whose 'homecoming' was spoilt by Head and Sharma's 131-run partnership.The DC skipper also said he probably misjudged the dew factor at the Arun Jaitley Stadium and decided to bowl first after winning the toss.""The only thought process behind that (deciding to bowl first) was we thought there would be some dew but it didn't come. I thought if we could restrict them to 220-230, we would be in with a chance.""SRH bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar got just one wicket but his restrictive spell in the high-scoring match -- 33 runs in 4 overs -- played a vital role in the easy win.""Feeling good. Not among the wickets but the way I want to execute it is happening. Just a matter of time,"" said the pace-bowling stalwart.""When defending those many runs, you either go for plenty or you get wickets. We accepted that we'll go for plenty of runs when defending those many runs, but the plan was to keep executing,"" he added.Bhuvneshwar praised his fellow pacer T Natarajan's bowling, who was twice on a hat-trick in a single over and ended up with superb figures of 4/19 in four overs""Amazing. We know how good he is at yorkers. He keeps working hard, silent guy, goes unnoticed a lot. We know how important he is for Sunrisers,"" said Bhuvneshwar, adding that he is happy that SRH batting is finally clicking after several years.""For so many years, this is the first time our batting is clicking so much. As a bowling unit, happy to take the back seat. They (batters) are ruining us... when we defend 180 or so, it'll feel like less,"" he said.Bhuvneshwar added both Head and Abhishek bat in the same manner at nets.""Yes, same, especially Head and Abhishek, playing the same way. Batters sometimes play opposite (manner) in the nets, but they play the same way.""The pacer indicated that bowlers don't get their due despite all the hard work but, in the end, they win championships for teams.""Bowling is something... somebody says batting wins your sponsorship, but bowling wins you championship.

At the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Saturday evening, it was almost spine-chillingly cold-blooded about the way he tossed his bat, opened his gloves before the ball had even hit the cover boundary off Mukesh Kumar on the last ball of the powerplay.By then, he brought up his half-century inside the first three overs of the match, killed the spirit of the Delhi Capitals bowling attack along with fellow opener Abhishek Sharma and helped Sunrisers Hyderabad score a jaw-dropping 125 runs in the first six overs.The tempo set by Head's 32-ball 89 and Abhishek's 12-ball 46 was enough for SRH to put up a daunting score of 266/7 with a little help of Shahbaz Ahmed 's unbeaten 29-ball 59 in the second half of the innings. This is the third time in the tournament that they have breached the 250-run mark. And expectedly, that was enough for SRH to register another emphatic 67-run win.In reply, Jack Fraser-McGurk tried to match the muscle game with a frenzied 18-ball 65 along with Abhishek Porel's 22-ball 42. But the pressure of the score posted by SRH took toll once McGurk's onslaught ended 109/3 in the seventh over. Capitals were bowled out rather tamely with captainRishabh Pant , coming in at No. 6 and struggling to find timing, scoring 44 off 35 balls. The difference was some sharp and accurate bowling by SRH captain Pat Cummins (0/35) and T Natarajan's smart spell of 4/19.Head has been ruling the stadiums in India since the ODI World Cup in Oct-Nov. He broke Indian hearts in the World Cup final in Ahmedabad but he has clearly won them back with his marauding form in the ongoing IPL . The packed Delhi stadium was thrilled to bits to watch him on a rampage and even cheered for the visiting SRH team.On the match eve, Capitals coach Ricky Ponting had claimed that his team was ready for a shootout. Head went about gunning down one Capitals bowler at a time right from the second ball of the game when he nonchalantly slapped Khaleel Ahmed over the mid-wicket boundary for the six. That echo off the bat clearly rattled the Capitals bowling attack. Off-spinner Lalit Yadav, trusted to slow down the pace against two left-handers, was given the second over and he ended up leaking 41 off his two overs.Be it Anrich Nortje, Khaleel, Mukesh or Lalit-all of them were guilty of pitching the ball too short on a pitch which resembled a concrete strip. Abhishek was mostly a bystander to the carnage off Head's bat but he took the onus of taking down Capitals' trump card Kuldeep Yadav . Nimble on his foot, he charged down to Kuldeep to smack three sixes.Capitals captain Rishabh Pant may have thought that his team had finally got on track with good bowling performances in the two preceding games. Little did he know that his attack was running into a rampaging SRH team with Head and Abhishek their hands on the wheel and foot on the gas. For the first 30 minutes, it seemed like the duo were chipping sixes-12 between them.The onslaught was so freakish that Kuldeep's comeback with four wickets--including the wickets of Head, Abhishek and Markram-and Axar Patel's 1/29 seemed like an anomaly in the game. These two spinners have been the saving grace for the Capitals through the tournament. Yet, their effort could do beyond containing Sunrisers to 108 runs in the last 10 overs of the innings.",Sunrisers Hyderabad score 266/7 to beat Delhi Capitals by 67 runs. Opener Travis Head scores 89 and Abhishek Sharma 46 in first six overs. Jack Fraser-McGurk scores 65 but Caps bowled out for 109 in seventh over.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109464564,imgsize-66820,width-400,resizemode-4/109464564.jpg"

The ball stopped more in the 2nd innings, that was more than we anticipated, but when we needed to chase 260, 270, you'll need to keep scoring.Hopefully, we'll come up with more thought process and a clear mindset going forward. His batting has been phenomenal (on Fraser-McGurk), he's been nice for us, that's what we need to do as a team, be together, look at areas where we can improve going into the next game,"" Pant added.Earlier, Head showcased his batting prowess yet again, spearheading SRH's imposing total of 266/7.

Shahbaz Ahmed's unbeaten 59 off 29 balls further bolstered the scorecard, ensuring SRH posted a massive total to defend.Spinner Kuldeep Yadav was the lone bright spot for DC, claiming four wickets, but it wasn't enough to prevent SRH's commanding victory.","Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Delhi Capitals by 67 runs in their IPL encounter.

But the defenders, on both sides, looked to have brought a little more of it on the pitch as they denied attacks to be reflected on the scoreline.While Odisha ended up with better possession in the first half, the only shot on goal came from Blasters’ Hormipam Ruivah in the 22nd minute when he headed a superb cross from Freddy Lallawmawma straight into the hands of Amrinder Singh in Odisha goal.Odisha once again relied on their talisman Ahmed Jahouh to keep creating moves from deep but all those attacks were foiled by the Marko Leskovic and Milos Drincic-led Kerala defence inside the D. The story was being played in the same vein at the other end too, with both teams missing that final touch or shot in the final third in search of a breakthrough.The highlight of the opening 45 minutes was the drama that followed Mourtada Fall sending in the ball with a casual back heel on connecting with a Jahouh cross from the left of the box. While it was first given a goal by the referee, after consultation with the linesman and vehement protests from Blasters, the decision was overturned with Jahouh and Fall both found to be offside.Despite some desperate attempts from both teams to change the scoreline, they left the field for the break with the first knockout of the playoff stage goalless.Jahouh kept sending in measured crosses into the centre and the flank after the change of ends as Amey Ranawade and Jerry Mawihmingthanga kept attempting to make a goal out of them. But Blasters soon took charge of the game with a barrage of attacks near the Odisha goal.Mohammed Aimen and Saurav Mandal displayed the youthful vigour that Ivan Vukomanovic’s team rode this season but it was Fedor Cernych who broke the deadlock in the 67th minute. Aimen sent a pass to the Lithuanian after a delicate first touch as Cernych made no mistake in finding the corner of the net to the right of Amrinder.It was a well-deserved goal for the visitors but they could only maintain the lead for 20 minutes.With Blasters’ injured custodian Lara Sharma taken off field in a stretcher and replaced by Karanjit Sharma, Odisha took advantage of the lapse in focus of the opposition defence as Diego Mauricio scored his 11th goal of the season. He turned in a delectable cross from the right from current top scorer Roy Krishna and brought the home team back in the game and took it into extra time.And it was a replay of the equaliser in the seventh minute of extra time with Jahouh, once again, the conductor of the move. The Moroccan sent an inch-perfect long ball to Krishna on the right of the box and Isak only had to tap it in past Karanjit to break Blasters’ hearts.",Isak Vanlalruatfela's extra-time winner earns Odisha FC a place in the two- legged semifinal against Mohun Bagan Super Giants.

However, his persistent reactions towards the French fans led to a bizarre incident where he was initially shown a second yellow card, seemingly resulting in a red card and subsequent dismissal.Remarkably, Martinez was reprieved due to a rule that states yellow cards awarded during regular time are not carried forward to penalty shootouts. This allowed him to continue his heroics, ultimately proving instrumental in Villa's 4-3 shootout triumph.Aston Villa manager Unai Emery praised Martinez's mentality and leadership, acknowledging his importance to the team both on and off the pitch.

NEW DELHI: Bundesliga , Germany's top-flight football league, has found itself in a complex situation for determining the teams that qualify for European competitions, particularly the prestigious Champions League . The number of qualifying spots can vary depending on the performance of German teams in the current season's European competitions.Traditionally, the top four teams in the Bundesliga qualify for the Champions League.However, due to the revamped format of the Champions League, which will expand from 32 to 36 teams starting next season, Germany could potentially have five or even six teams in the competition.Two additional Champions League spots will be awarded to the leagues whose teams perform best in European competitions this season. Based on current standings, these spots are likely to go to Italy and Germany, whose teams have performed well in the Champions League and Europa League .The situation becomes even more complex when considering the potential scenarios involving teams like Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, who have reached the Champions League semifinals. If Dortmund were to win the Champions League but finish fifth in the Bundesliga, they would automatically qualify as the defending champions, and Germany would receive a sixth Champions League spot.The battle for European qualification in the Bundesliga is a moving target, with teams like RB Leipzig, Eintracht Frankfurt, and SC Freiburg vying for positions that could secure them a place in the Champions League, Europa League, or Europa Conference League. Even teams like Augsburg, currently seventh, could potentially qualify for the Champions League, depending on the outcomes of various matches and competitions.The Europa League and Europa Conference League qualifications are equally uncertain, as they depend on the results of the German Cup final and the final positions in the Bundesliga table. Remarkably, even second-division club Kaiserslautern could qualify for the Europa League if they manage to win the German Cup against Bayer Leverkusen While the top and bottom of the Bundesliga table provide some clarity, with Leverkusen already crowned champions and Darmstadt facing relegation, the battle for European qualification remains a complex and ever-changing scenario that will likely continue until the final weeks of the season and even after the Bundesliga campaign concludes on May 18.The uncertainty surrounding European qualification in the Bundesliga highlights the competitiveness and unpredictability of the league, as well as the impact of the revamped Champions League format on the qualification process. Teams and fans alike will have to remain patient and adaptable as the final standings and European qualifiers are determined in the coming weeks.","Germany's top-flight football league has found itself in a complex situation for determining the teams that qualify for European competitions.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one and two-time Grand Slam champion Garbine Muguruza announced her retirement from tennis on Saturday, following a hiatus of over a year without competing.Speaking at a press conference during the Laureus Awards, the 30-year-old reflected on her illustrious career, stating, ""The time has come to say goodbye. It has been a long and beautiful journey, but I feel that the moment to retire has arrived.""Muguruza's decision marks the end of a remarkable tenure in professional tennis, during which she achieved significant milestones and left an indelible mark on the sport.""It's a decision that I've been taking little by little.""Muguruza's last official match was at the Lyon Open in January 2023, marking her temporary departure from the sport. Following this event, she refrained from competing, leading to her eventual retirement announcement.""When I stopped competing, I returned home and I welcomed the break with open arms,"" said Muguruza who ends her career with 10 singles titles.""Every day that went by I felt better and I didn't miss the discipline and the difficulty of the life I had before, so it has been a progressive thing.""Muguruza's WTA main-draw debut occurred in 2012, marking the beginning of her professional journey. Her breakthrough on the Grand Slam stage came in 2015 when she reached her first final at Wimbledon , where she faced Serena Williams but was unable to clinch the title.However, she swiftly bounced back, securing her maiden Grand Slam victory at the French Open in 2016 by defeating Serena Williams. The following year, Muguruza continued her success by triumphing over Venus Williams to claim the Wimbledon title.These victories solidified her place in tennis history, as her French Open win made her the first Spanish woman to win a Grand Slam since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998, while her Wimbledon triumph made her the first Spanish female champion at the All England Club since Conchita Martinez in 1994.Martinez's influence played a significant role in Muguruza's success, as she coached her to the Wimbledon title. In a fitting turn of events, just two months after her Wimbledon triumph, Muguruza ascended to the number one ranking in the world, cementing her status as one of tennis's elite players.",Garbine Muguruza announces her retirement from tennis on Saturday. The 30-year- old had been out of action for over a year. The Spaniard won 10 singles titles during her professional career. She was the first Spanish woman to win a Grand Slam title since 1998.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109463554,imgsize-23266,width-400,resizemode-4/109463554.jpg"
Captain's role doesn't make much difference: AITA secretary Dhupar on India's BJK Cup performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/captains-role-doesnt-make-much-difference-aita-secretary-dhupar-on-indias-bjk-cup-performance/articleshow/109410678.cms,"PUNE: The Indian women's failure to qualify for the Billie Jean King Cup Playoffs has brought the focus on captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule but the All India Tennis Association believes the players have to step up.""The girls did well. I think after winning the first (singles) match against New Zealand, we should have won the tie,"" said AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar on Thursday.India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week.Winning the tie would have placed the team second in final standings, thereby securing them a spot in the Playoffs in November.""We are remaining in Group 1, but I was expecting to qualify,"" said Dhupar but then switched to highlighting the association's efforts in hosting tournaments through the season to help players gain ranking points.""The association has done everything. The girls have had the opportunity to get a lot of points, and we had organised a camp in China.""And they were all playing well. Ankita had just won a tournament (in doubles) in Japan just the week before.""Dhupar, however, brushed aside the questionable team combinations fielded by the captain and the coach.After entering Sahaja Yamalapalli in singles and pairing Rutuja Bhosale with Prarthana Thombare against the strong Chinese team, the team's think-tank opted to put Rutuja in singles and hand Ankita the additional duty of doubles for the remaining three ties.It proved to be disastrous as it left Ankita with little time to recover with only a 30-minute gap between second singles and the decisive doubles matches. Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective. ""If I were the coach or the captain, and if I find my No. 1 player not performing, I would put my No. 3 or any other player in,"" Bal, a former Davis Cup player, said.""Try something different, think out of the box. It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players. The captain, the coach and the support staff are appointed by the executive committee of the AITA,"" he said.Both captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule did not respond to request for a comment.",India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week.

Despite his sloppiness Ruud still took the set.The third seed looked to have sealed the match when he broke his French journeyman opponent in the third game of the second set.However, the world number six gave up four break points while serving for the match to allow 27-year-old Muller back in at 5-4.Ruud, though, was more clinical in the next game, breaking Muller to progress with his 25th victory in 2024 and will face Jordan Thompson in the next round.""This year is much better than last year, I'm having a good year,"" said Ruud, who defeated world number one Novak Djokovic last week.Monte Carlo Masters winner Stefanos Tsitsipas dispatched Sebastian Ofner in straight sets with a 6-4, 7-5 victory.(With AFP inputs)","Rafael Nadal says he will give his all at the upcoming French Open.

We could have qualified for Billie Jean King Cup playoffs: Rutuja Bhosale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/we-could-have-qualified-for-billie-jean-king-cup-playoffs-rutuja-bhosale/articleshow/109380108.cms,"PUNE: It was personally a successful week for Rutuja Bhosale but the 28-year-old felt the Indian team ""could have qualified"" for the Playoffs of the Billie Jean King Cup women's team tennis competition.The Indian team suffered an agonising 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round of the Asia-Oceania Group 1 matches in Changsha, China, last Saturday to finish third in the six-team duel.The top two teams -- hosts China and South Korea -- advanced to the Playoffs in November while India and New Zealand stayed in Group 1. Chinese Taipei and Pacific Oceania were relegated to Group 2.Rutuja won all her four matches in singles and her only loss of the week came in the one doubles match she was paired with Prarthana Thombare against the all-conquering Chinese.""For me, it was a very positive week, especially after the ankle injury I had in Mumbai (during the WTA 125K Series event),"" Rutuja said from Shenzhen, where she continued her exploits to win her first-round match in the $40K ITF event.""I didn't think I would be playing singles, but Sahaja had blisters and the captain ( Shalini Thakur ) and the coach (Radhika Tulpule Kanitkar) thought I had the experience, they trusted me.""In contrast to Rutuja's 100 percent record in the week, India No. 1 Ankita Raina had a below-par outing by her standards, winning just one of her five singles matches, although the World No. 255 had to double up for doubles duty as well.Two of Ankita's singles losses came against players whom Rutuja had beaten -- South Korea's Sujeong Jang (World No. 267) and New Zealand's Lulu Sun (167).""We could have qualified. The last day was very stressful. Ankita was a little bit tired, and it rained, so matches were moved indoors,"" Rutuja said.""It was clay but not the best like the one we played outdoors. The clay was coming off and you could see the (hard) surface beneath. We had to stay focussed.""And New Zealand (doubles team of World No. 5 and US Open winner Erin Routliffe and Paige Hourigan) played their best match of the week.""We had seen them play in the previous matches, and we were wondering if they were really World No. 5.""But against Ankita and Prarthana, they took the first set 6-1 in no time and went up 5-1 in the second. We made it 5-5 but they didn't really allow us to get back into the game.""It was a tough week but everyone gave their best.""Rutuja praised Ankita for showing courage to play back to back matches each day, but felt resting her a day could have helped the player's as well as the team's fortunes.""It was stressful for her. But credit to her, she stepped up to play both singles and doubles. Against Chinese Taipei, she had a long singles match (nearly two and a half hours) and then played doubles (after a 30-minute gap),"" Rutuja said.""Shalini ma'am and Radhika ma'am asked her if she could play, and she said she was ready.""She could have been rested one day, maybe against Korea (the day after playing Chinese Taipei). There were a lot of options.""","Rutuja Bhosale says Indian team ""could have qualified"" for the Playoffs of the Billie Jean King Cup.
