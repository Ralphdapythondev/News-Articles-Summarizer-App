defeat vs Australia

T20 WORLD CUP

ST LUCIA: The small island, with the Caribbean Sea on one side and the Atlantic Ocean on the other, is absolutely buzzing. For the last couple of days --cricket tourists --mostly Indians from the US and Canada --have been trooping in for an extended weekend, and once the Saturday night theatre happened in St Vincent, the excitement has gone up manifold.Australia's defeat to Afghanistan has suddenly opened up the possibility for the Indian fans who are here and those across the world to finally get their redemption. The defeat to the Aussies in the ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad in November is something no one related to Indian cricket has forgotten, and now it's a chance to pay the Aussies back with interest. A win on Monday for India will not only officially seal for them a semis berth, but also show Australia the door, provided Afghanistan beat Bangladesh later on Monday.The Indian team, that came in here late on Saturday night and cancelled their practice session on Sunday owing to exhaustion and the extreme humidity in this part of the world, would also surely be licking their lips.On current form, there's absolutely no reason why India wouldn't beat their biggest rivals Australia, making their own journey forward a little smoother. India apart, there is no other team than Australia which has so many individual match-winners who can destroy opposition on their day. If they can be taken care of before the semis,Rohit Sharma 's boys would probably have to just carry on playing the way they are and this cup would be theirs.The Darren Sammy International Stadium, the venue of this game, though has been slightly different from most other venues across the Caribbean. Scores have fluctuated between 180-220, barring the last game between South Africa and England, which the Proteas won with 163. Normally the ball does come on to the bat here which should be a bit of a relief for Aussies, who were absolutely strangled by the Afghanistan bowlers on the super slow St Vincent track.Australia had chosen to drop Mitchell Starc and add left-arm spinner Ashton Agar in the playing XI on Saturday. Even though Agar was extremely economical (0/17), there was no denying that Starc's explosive ability to run through opposition in Powerplay was missed.Aussies will be tempted to bring Starc back for this huge game, even though the average economy rate of spinners in St Lucia is 7.9 in the five matches played, which is significantly better than it is for the pacers (9.4).Captain Mitchell Marsh knows it, but he also knows that if they are to make a match of it against a marauding India, they will first have to deal with the mental scars of a defeat like this in a turnaround time of mere 36 hours.""First things first, we have to recover. We have a lot of belief in our group because we know we are a good cricket team. We had an off night but I guess there's also a positive in the fact that in 36 hours we go again. It's a big game --a must-win. I think if you look back at the short history of this team, I know for a fact that it brings out the best in our guys, so the boys will certainly be up and about for it,"" Marsh put up a brave face on Saturday night.For India, it's way more straightforward. Every constituent part of the Indian machine has been running smoothly and it's about keeping it going. No change is expected in the playing XI and with Jasprit Bumrah in outstanding form, one can hope the threat of Travis Head upfront will be taken care of. The explosive left-hander has caused enough heart-burns for India across formats, but he is coming off a failure against Afghanistan.Everything points to a perfect day for Team India and its fans, it's just about Rohit and his boys to maintain the composure that they have shown in the World Cup so far.",India take on Australia in World Cup quarter-final on Monday. India lost to Aussies in ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad in November. A win for India will see them through to semis. Australia will be looking to bounce back from defeat to Afghanistan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111217521,imgsize-69056,width-400,resizemode-4/111217521.jpg"
Euro 2024: Germany win group after Niclas Fuellkrug's stoppage-time goal earns 1-1 against Switzerland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/euro-2024-germany-win-group-after-niclas-fuellkrugs-stoppage-time-goal-earns-1-1-against-switzerland/articleshow/111217832.cms,"Germany clinched the top spot in Group A of Euro 2024 after Niclas Fuellkrug scored a crucial equaliser in stoppage time, securing a 1-1 draw against Switzerland on Sunday. This result continued Germany's strong form as they progress to the last-16 stage.The Swiss team had taken the lead in the first half through a goal by forward Dan Ndoye, threatening to upset the home crowd. However, Germany, who had already guaranteed their place in the knockout rounds before the match began, persevered and maintained their seven-game unbeaten streak dating back to November. Fuellkrug's header finally brought the equaliser, much to the relief of the German supporters.Germany had a goal disallowed and multiple penalty appeals turned down by the Italian referee, Daniele Orsato. Despite the frustration, the home side continued to press forward, attempting 18 shots on goal in a highly charged atmosphere at the stadium in Frankfurt.The draw prevented Switzerland from securing what would have been only their second victory over Germany in 22 competitive matches since 1959. However, the Swiss team's progression to the last-16 is also assured.With seven points from their three group matches, Germany sit atop the standings, holding a two-point lead over Switzerland. Meanwhile, Hungary, who have three points, must await the results of other groups to determine if they will progress as one of the best third-placed teams, following their 1-0 victory over the eliminated Scotland, who finished with one point.""Of course, we would have liked to win the game and to play greatfootball ,"" Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan said. ""But I think you also need games like that during a tournament. And that can also be a real strength for the next games, hopefully.""Germany believed they had taken the lead in the 17th minute when Robert Andrich's long-range effort from 30 yards out surprisingly beat Switzerland's goalkeeper Yann Sommer at his near post. However, Sommer's embarrassment was alleviated when the goal was disallowed due to a foul committed by Jamal Musiala.Contrary to expectations, it was Switzerland who found the back of the net just before the 30-minute mark. Musiala was dispossessed in midfield, and when Remo Freuler received the ball on the left side of the penalty area, his low cross was emphatically converted into the roof of the net by Ndoye.Germany, playing on their home turf, created a plethora of opportunities as they dominated possession in the Swiss half. However, after Kai Havertz squandered several chances, it was Fuellkrug who rose above the defense to head in David Raum's cross in the 92nd minute, ensuring that Germany maintained their unbeaten record in their home championship.""I think when you see the Germans celebrating, we can be proud of ourselves,"" Swiss captain Granit Xhaka told SRF. ""It's not easy against a team like that. Nevertheless, the late equaliser hurts.""Everyone fought for each other and ran for each other. We have to push ourselves to the limit. Then we can beat anyone. We have taken the first step and are now looking forward to the round of 16.""Julian Nagelsmann, the coach of Germany, selected an unchanged starting lineup for the third consecutive match. However, he will need to make at least one alteration for the round of 16 due to Jonathan Tah receiving his second yellow card of the group stage, resulting in a suspension.It is uncertain if Havertz's performance was sufficient to secure his place in the starting eleven. Germany appeared more menacing when Fuellkrug was introduced, and he proceeded to score his 13th goal for the national team in his 19th appearance, despite only starting six of those matches.",Germany secure top spot in Group A of Euro 2024 with 1-1 draw against Switzerland. Niclas Fuellkrug scores crucial equaliser in stoppage time. Germany had already guaranteed their place in knockout rounds before the match began. Switzerland's progression to last-16 is also assured.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111218051,imgsize-75438,width-400,resizemode-4/111218051.jpg"
T20 World Cup: Kuldeep Yadav enjoying the challenge of being a step ahead of batters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-kuldeep-yadav-enjoying-the-challenge-of-being-a-step-ahead-of-batters/articleshow/111217993.cms,"T20 WORLD CUP:

ST LUCIA: If there's one bowler whose non-inclusion in the India playing XI in the New York leg of the T20 World Cup was slightly criticized in different quarters, it is Kuldeep Yadav .The chinaman bowler has been India's best spinner across formats in recent times, still the Indian team management was waiting to employ him in slightly more favourable conditions for spinners than what it was at New York. But as the coaches kept explaining Kuldeep the situation, the wrist-spinner didn't lose heart and he delivered the moment he got his chance in West Indies Performances of 2-32 against Afghanistan and 3-19 against Bangladesh have proved how well-prepared in his mind Kuldeep was. The bowler mentioned that he ""would have loved to bowl in New York"", but he felt totally included in everything that was going on. ""I wasn't playing, but I was the 12th man there. I was helping out the teammates and carrying the drinks, so that is more like playing. I didn't bowl there but I would have loved to because it was more like pitches in Australia,"" Kuldeep said after India's comprehensive win against Bangladesh.It was in the West Indies that Kuldeep made his T20 debut back in 2017. He had a fair idea of what to expect in the Caribbean that helped. ""I knew the condition very well --the length to bowl and the importance of varying the pace. It was perfect for the spinners to come here and bowl,"" Kuldeep added.The left-armer explained how he doesn't think much about the conditions, which way the wind is blowing and all that when he comes into bowl. For him, it is more about the length and outthinking the batsman. ""I didn't think about the wind, just the length mattered. And obviously reading the batter and what they are expecting from me. It is about just reading one step ahead what the batters are thinking and reacting to it,"" Kuldeep said.It was evident that he was outsmarting the batters when he got Tanzid Hasan with a beautiful googly as the right-hander shaped to go to his back-foot. As for Towhid Hridoy , the mode of dismissal was the same, just that the ball turned in the opposite direction after landing in the same spot.Kuldeep plays his IPL cricket for Delhi Capitals , whose home ground is Ferozeshah Kotla , which isn't the easiest venue for a spinner. Coming from there, the T20 World Cup was a welcome relief for Kuldeep.""IPL is totally different, what you experience in IPL is what you are experiencing in the T20 World Cup are not the same…For me, wherever I play, it is about being more aggressive. That actually helped me in the IPL and it is helping me here as well,"" Kuldeep said, hoping to keep it going against Australia in their last Super-8 game on Monday.","Kuldeep Yadav has been India's best spinner across formats in recent times.

‘He didn't know the camera was on him’: Sanjay Manjrekar on Virat Kohli’s reaction after Rishabh Pant's dismissal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/he-didnt-know-the-camera-was-on-him-sanjay-manjrekar-on-virat-kohlis-reaction-after-rishabh-pants-dismissal/articleshow/111209107.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Indian batter Sanjay Manjrekar shared why Virat Kohli appeared frustrated with Rishabh Pant 's dismissal in the T20 World Cup encounter against Bangladesh on Saturday.Pant, known for his aggressive batting style, opted for a reverse sweep against Rishad Hossain, resulting in his catch at short third man. This moment of play drew a reaction from Kohi, reflecting a sentiment likely shared by many fans and observers of the game.T20 World Cup: Schedule "" Virat Kohli ka reaction agar aap logo ne dekha hoga jab Rishabh Pant out huye (If you saw Virat Kohli's reaction when Rishabh Pant got out), he didn't know the camera was on him. Immediately, he covered his face with a towel, similar to how fans would react seeing Pant's dismissal,"" Manjrekar said on Star Sports.Manjrekar pointed out that Pant seemed to be in control of his innings until the moment of his dismissal. The decision to play a high-risk shot, especially when Pant possesses a wide array of conventional shots, was the crux of the frustration.""The man who has so many good shots in the front of the wicket in his repertoire should try and avoid such a shot. Telling a player like Pant to show some patience would not be ideal, but maybe Kohli might try to tell him,"" he added.According to Manjrekar, while advising patience to a naturally aggressive player like Pant might not be the most practical approach, there could be an expectation for him to exercise better judgment in shot selection, particularly in crucial phases of the game.Despite Pant's dismissal and Kohli's subsequent frustration, India moved closer to a T20 World Cup semifinal berth with a commanding 50-run win over Bangladesh in a Super Eight match. All-rounder Hardik Pandya hit a 27-ball fifty, helping India post their highest score of the low-scoring tournament so far with 196 for 5 at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium.Bangladesh, struggling from the start, managed only 146 for 8 in response, suffering their second Group 1 defeat.

So, attitude matters a lot. Today, Afghanistan not only got their revenge but also showed great intent. And what excellent leadership was displayed by Rashid Khan . They say leadership is 80 percent mentality, 20 percent skill.

His crucial spell, which included the dismissal ofGlenn Maxwell , who had scored 59 off 41 balls, turned the match in Afghanistan's favour. Australia, chasing a target of 149, were eventually bowled out for 127, suffering their first-ever defeat to Afghanistan in a senior international match.Earlier in the match, Afghanistan's opening pair of Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran had laid a solid foundation with a century stand. Gurbaz top-scored with 60 off 49 balls, while Zadran contributed 51 off 48 balls. However, Pat Cummins claimed his second hat-trick in consecutive matches, helping to restrict Afghanistan to a total of 148 for six.Despite the late collapse, Afghanistan's bowlers, led by Gulbadin, defended the total successfully, keeping their hopes of a semi-final spot alive in the tournament.","Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar heaps praise on the Rashid Khan-led Afghanistan side following their historic T20 World Cup win over Australia.

He emphasized that a captain should not differentiate between senior players like Rohit Sharma , who has led India across formats and won multiple IPL titles with MI, and the youngest member of the squad.""Look, first and foremost, treat Rohit Sharma and the youngest team, the youngest member of the dressing room exactly the same way. Absolutely exactly the same way. It is a tough job, but leaders are bound to take tough decisions and are bound to do difficult things as well. That is why you're the leader. Otherwise, you would end up becoming a follower, said the former Indian international.He further elaborated that true leadership stems from self-belief and courage, enabling a captain to establish a consistent and fair approach for all team members.He rejected the notion of different rules for different players, emphasizing that profiles and past achievements should not influence a leader's decisions.""And to do that, you need to have a lot of self-belief, a lot of courage as well. And that is for me the first and foremost quality of being a true leader because you're true to the entire squad or entire bunch of people sitting in that dressing room. You cannot have different rules and you cannot have different things for different individuals. Looking at the profile, you do not look at profiles when you want to become a leader. If you want to become a leader, profiles do not matter,"" added Gambhir.Gambhir's comments shed light on the importance of impartiality, fairness, and consistency in leadership roles within a team environment.

Shaheen Shah Afridi was appointed as the T20I captain, while Shan Masood took over the red-ball leadership after the ODI World Cup campaign in November.However, Afridi's tenure as captain was short-lived, as Pakistan managed to win only one game in a five-match T20I series against New Zealand.

Buttler, who had to leave IPL 2024 before the playoffs to represent England in a T20I series against Pakistan, expressed his opinion during a press conference ahead of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.Buttler stated, ""It's my personal opinion that there shouldn't be any international cricket that clashes with the IPL. These games have been in the calendar for a long time, and leading into a World Cup, your No. 1 priority is playing for England and performing for England. I feel like this is the best preparation.""The comments sparked a debate on the Club Prairie Fire podcast, where Hafeez asked Michael Vaughan and Adam Gilchrist for their views. Vaughan supported Buttler's stance, acknowledging the growing significance of the IPL. He remarked, ""I actually agree with him. IPL has become so big, and the players are so well rewarded for participating.""Hafeez interrupted Vaughan by questioning whether it was fair for players to prioritize IPL over national duties. Vaughan responded, ""It is the nature of the beast in 2024. Whether it is absolutely morally right is a very good question. But I think IPL is so big now that it is very hard for international boards to compete with it.""Vaughan also noted the potential impact on the County Championship , with many players likely to miss matches due to IPL commitments. ""Pakistan Super League (PSL) will compete with IPL next year, which will be interesting. It will affect the English summer more than any other country because so many players will be involved in both tournaments,"" the former England skipper added.Adam Gilchrist echoed Vaughan's sentiments, pointing out that domestic cricket will inevitably be compromised due to IPL. He mentioned, ""Domestic cricket is going to be compromised within the more established cricketing nations. For instance, the Sheffield Shield final overlaps with the IPL, so players will have to make a choice.""Hafeez found Buttler's remarks surprising and emphasized the importance of national pride. He commented, ""To me, that was a shocking statement from the captain of England because representing your country is the biggest prize you play for.

'Implementation and execution': Bowling coach reveals India's mantra for success against Australia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/implementation-and-execution-bowling-coach-reveals-indias-mantra-for-success-against-australia/articleshow/111212672.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's bowling coach Paras Mhambrey discussed the team's strategy for the upcoming knockout matches in the ICC T20 World Cup , particularly focusing on the possibility of playing four spinners against Australia. He expressed confidence in India's ability to overcome the Australian challenge, provided they execute their plans effectively.The match against Australia holds significant importance for India, as a victory would secure their position at the top of Group 1. However, a defeat could potentially see them overtaken by both Australia and Afghanistan, should the latter triumph over Bangladesh in the final Super Eights encounter.As the highly anticipated clash between the two cricketing powerhouses approaches, Mhambrey emphasized the crucial role that the ""implementation of plans"" will play against the formidable Australian side. India's journey to the T20 World Cup final is fraught with challenges, given the caliber of the opposition they are likely to face in the latter stages of the tournament.""We played them initially. Earlier, a lot of these guys have played against them. A lot of guys have played in the IPL. So, in terms of knowing of the game, the approach that is going to change has been similar in the past games that we played. I don't think it's going to change. I think it's all what we can do is really focus on the implementation of our plans,"" Mhambrey, as quoted by ANI, said in a pre-match press conference.""And the bottom line is execution. I think if you're as close to execution, you will win every game. So, it's not about what the other opponent's going to do yet. We know what kind of approach they come with. That's the way they played in the past as well. But I think the focus purely should be on, that's what we will focus on in execution. And if we're as close to our plans, I'm pretty sure that we're going to cross the other side.Kuldeep Yadav , who was absent from the league stage of the T20 World Cup due to the pacer-friendly pitches in New York, made his presence felt in the Super 8 matches held in the West Indies. The spinner claimed a total of five wickets in the matches against Afghanistan and Bangladesh, proving his worth to the team.When asked about Kuldeep's performances thus far, India's bowling coach Mhambrey was effusive in his praise for the wrist-spinner and said, ""He's always been a class bowler, he's always done well for us, always won games for us initially as well. But unfortunately, because of the kind of wickets that we played in the US, he couldn't get an opportunity, couldn't get a run. But good to see that he's come out the last two games, he's done well. This was fabulous. I think he really bowled well, used the conditions very well and yeah, good to see that he's got in the run.""India's selection of four spinners for the tournament caught many off guard. The decision has been met with skepticism from certain fans and former players who have expressed doubts about the strategy.When asked about the likelihood of deploying all four spinners in crucial knockout matches, Mhambrey stated that it would depend on the pitch conditions.

During England's chase, Buttler showcased his hard-hitting prowess, leaving a lasting impact on the game.Earlier in the match, the 35-year-old Jordan, originally from Christ Church, Barbados, made a significant contribution.In the penultimate over, Jordan started by dismissing a well-set Corey Anderson for 29 with a low full toss. After Ali Khan survived the next ball, Jordan knocked over his off stump, then went on to remove Nosthush Kenjige and Saurabh Netravalkar off successive deliveries, achieving a hat-trick.Jordan's feat made him the second bowler in T20 World Cup history to take four wickets in a single over, following Curtis Campher of Ireland who accomplished the same against the Netherlands in the 2021 edition in Abu Dhabi.The USA suffered a dramatic collapse triggered by Sam Curran, who took 2/13, including the crucial wicket of Harmeet Singh in the final ball of the previous over.

Andries Gous hit Topley for a six but fell shortly after, caught by Phil Salt at deep square leg.USA faced early nerves when Steven Taylor narrowly survived a run out, thanks to a missed throw from Liam Livingstone. At the other end, Nitish Kumar capitalized on his opportunity, top-edging a delivery from Jofra Archer for six and hitting another maximum over long-on off Topley.Curran's introduction as the first change soon paid off, as Taylor was caught brilliantly by Moeen Ali at backward point, marking Curran's 50th wicket in T20 internationals. USA's skipper Aaron Jones quickly added a boundary through the third-man region, helping the team to 48 for two at the end of the powerplay.Rashid's entry into the attack was impactful, conceding only two runs in his first over. He delivered a beautiful googly in his next, bowling out Jones and curtailing the USA captain’s innings.Rashid then employed another effective googly to end Nitish's promising knock, who had hit two sixes and a four. The partnerships struggled to form as Livingstone had Milind Kumar caught behind, reducing USA to 88 for five by the end of the 14th over.Corey Anderson and Harmeet Singh attempted to revive the innings, bringing up the team’s 100 in the 17th over. Anderson and Singh added some valuable runs, with Singh hitting a six and a four off Curran, but his dismissal in the last ball of the over initiated a rapid downfall.","England beat USA by 10 wickets to qualify for 2024 T20 World Cup semis.

The goal came after a distressing incident involving Hungarian striker Barnabas Varga , who suffered a serious injury and had to be stretchered off the field.The Hungarian Football Federation provided an update shortly after the match, stating that Varga was in a ""stable condition"" and receiving treatment at a hospital in Stuttgart.The incident evoked painful memories of Christian Eriksen's collapse during Euro 2020, where Danish players formed a protective circle around him after he suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch.Csoboth paid tribute to his injured teammate by holding up Varga's shirt during his goal celebration. The late winner kept Hungary's hopes alive in the tournament, as they continue to fight for a spot in the last 16 of Euro 2024.""Of course we were fighting for him in the remaining 15-20 minutes.

However, consecutive losses had dented their confidence, and they needed a win against Scotland to maintain their chances of progressing to the knockout stages.In the end, Germany secured the top spot in Group A following a 1-1 draw with Switzerland, who advanced as runners-up. Hungary's fate now depends on the results of other groups, as they hope to qualify as one of the best third-placed teams.Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn parried a challenging, dipping shot from Bendeguz Bolla, while Styles and Willi Orban received bookings for fouling McGinn in a first half filled with effort but few clear opportunities.However, Che Adams' risky clearance resulted in a Hungary free-kick from 25 yards, which Dominik Szoboszlai curled towards the far post, with Orban's header narrowly missing the crossbar.Szoboszlai, who overcame injury concerns after missing Hungary's final team training session, blasted a long-range effort over the bar. Scotland only managed their first shot in the 53rd minute.Scotland's defense stood firm as Jack Hendry blocked Sallai's attempt when he cut in from the left, and Marton Dardai headed over from a cross.A terrifying incident occurred when Varga lay motionless on his back in the Scotland area as he attempted to head a free-kick goalwards, with Gunn rushing out and Anthony Ralston also falling to the ground.The game was halted for an extended period as medics placed Varga in the recovery position before covering him with a sheet and carrying him off on a stretcher.Scotland had a penalty appeal controversially dismissed after Stuart Armstrong was brought down by Orban, and the fourth official signaled 10 minutes of added time.Both teams frantically sought the winning goal during the stoppage time.Gunn made excellent saves from Andras Schafer and Szoboszlai, while Csoboth hit the post.

These include immediate ejection from the stadium, bans from attending future matches, and potential criminal charges for trespassing.The incidents have sparked debate regarding fan behaviour and the responsibility of tournament organizers to ensure a safe environment. Portuguese coach Roberto Martinez , while acknowledging the seemingly harmless intentions of the individuals involved in Saturday's incidents, expressed concern over the potential for escalation.""It is a concern because today we were lucky that the intentions of the fans were good.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo faced on-field confrontations from four supporters seeking selfies during Portugal 's 3-0 win over Turkey in Dortmund's Westfalenstadion on Saturday, leading coach Roberto Martinez to express concerns over player safety.The incidents began in the 69th minute when a young fan evaded stewards, reaching Ronaldo, who posed for a selfie. The situation escalated when, in the final minutes, two more people attempted similar actions.Following the final whistle, another person managed to get close to the 39-year-old striker for a photograph. Security intervened as two additional people tried to confront Ronaldo as he walked off the field with his teammates.WATCH:“It is a concern,” Martinez was quoted as saying by AP after the game, “because today we were lucky that the intentions of the fans were good.”“We all love a fan that recognizes the big stars and the big icons in their minds. We all agree with that. But you can understand it was a very, very difficult moment — if those intentions are wrong, the players are exposed and we need to be careful with that. I don't think that should happen on a football pitch.”Martinez emphasized the importance of communicating to fans that such behavior is not acceptable.“It's not the right way, you’re not going to get anything out of it,” Martinez added. “And what you do is probably the measures get worse for the future.“It’s not good to get the players so exposed when you have people running on the pitch.”Ronaldo's teammate, Bernardo Silva , who also scored against Turkey, shared a different perspective on the matter.“It's just a bit annoying in terms of having to stop the game because a fan enters the pitch,” Silva said. “That’s the price you pay for being so recognized in the world of football.“In terms of feeling in danger, no. Not me personally.”The series of breaches highlighted vulnerabilities in stadium security and the need for stricter measures to protect players during games.","Cristiano Ronaldo faced on-field confrontations from four supporters seeking selfies during Portugal's 3-0 win over Turkey in Dortmund's Westfalenstadion on Saturday.

Georgia struck first with Georges Mikautadze's penalty, but Schick equalized in a match filled with action and drama in Hamburg.Georgia, debutants in the competition, showcased their progress under coach Willy Sagnol , who highlighted his players' disappointment at their opening defeat as a sign of their growth. The Georgian team put in a spirited performance to earn their first Euros point, guided by goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili's exceptional saves.Sagnol said his players' disappointment at their opening defeat showed how far his team has come, and they gave everything in Hamburg to earn their first Euros point.Mamardashvili played a pivotal role, making crucial saves early on, denying efforts from Adam Hlozek and Schick. Georgia's offensive efforts were rewarded just before halftime when Mikautadze converted a penalty, secured after a VAR review flagged a handball by Czech defender Robin Hranac.The game's momentum swung back in favor of the Czechs in the second half. Schick, who had already demonstrated his scoring prowess at Euro 2020, equalized with an improvised finish, chesting home a rebound off the post from Ondrej Lingr's header. This goal marked Schick as the Czech Republic's top scorer in Euros history, surpassing Milan Baros with six goals, but a calf injury forced him to leave the pitch midway through the second half.The Czech team, led by coach Ivan Hasek, had started strong, creating numerous chances. They were initially frustrated when VAR disallowed Hlozek's goal due to a handball, following a save by Mamardashvili that deflected back onto Hlozek’s face and arm. Czech right-back Vladimir Coufal received a booking for a foul on Georgia's standout player Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who along with Mikautadze, had required medical attention before the match but both started.“He attempted to counter and was met with Coufal's challenge, resulting in a yellow card for the Czech defender,” observed reviewers of the game.Georgia also saw their penalty appeals for an incident involving Zuriko Davitashvili and Ladislav Krejci dismissed. Despite these setbacks, Georgia captained by Guram Kashia, managed to test the Czech defense, with Stanec making a brilliant first-half stoppage-time save before conceding the penalty kick.Czech fans experienced further tension as Krejci came close to scoring from another header, narrowly missing the target. The Czechs’ persistence nearly paid off, but they failed to capitalize on several opportunities.In an end-to-end encounter, Georgia showed impressive resolve. “Georgia's fans were in the majority…they began to roar every time Napoli winger Kvaratskhelia got the ball in opposition territory,” noted observers.The match concluded with a dramatic moment when Georgia had a golden opportunity to clinch victory. Substitute Saba Lobjanidze found himself in a prime position but fired over the bar amid a three-on-one break, leaving the match tied.This draw leaves both teams with a challenging road ahead in Euro 2024 Group F. With strong performances from both sides, they will be looking to build on this match in their subsequent fixtures.

Andy Murray: Two-time champion ruled out of Wimbledon 2024 following surgery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/andy-murray-two-time-champion-ruled-out-of-wimbledon-2024-following-surgery/articleshow/111208292.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has been compelled to withdraw from the prestigious Wimbledon tournament following a surgical procedure to remove a spinal cyst.This development was officially communicated by the Association of Tennis Professionals ( ATP ) through a statement on social media platform X, emphasizing the unfortunate nature of this event for both Murray and his fans.The surgery, aimed at addressing the spinal cyst, necessitates a period of recovery that unfortunately coincides with Wimbledon, thereby preventing Murray from participating in the tournament, set to be played from July 1 to July 14 this year.This marks a significant moment in Murray's career, given his historical performances and previous victories at Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016, which have cemented his status as one of the sport's most revered athletes.Murray's absence from Wimbledon is not only a personal setback for the athlete but also impacts the tournament's landscape. Known for his remarkable resilience, skilful play, and strategic acumen on the court, Murray has been a formidable competitor on grass.The ATP's message, ""Rest up and recover Andy, we'll miss seeing you there,"" reflects the sentiment of the tennis community and underscores the importance of Murray's health and well-being.The decision to undergo surgery, while difficult, highlights the challenges athletes often face in balancing their professional commitments with their health requirements.Murray commented after retiring at Queen’s, “I didn’t get the right side of my back treated after the French Open [a few weeks ago]. All tennis players have degenerative joints in the back but it’s all predominantly been left-sided for me for pretty much my whole career. I’ve never had too many issues with the right side.“Maybe there’s something which can be done between now and then [Wimbledon] with my right side – I will have a scan tomorrow and re-check and see what can be done. I don’t know exactly what the problem is. I just know I haven’t experienced that before – the back pain today and yesterday. I don’t know what the procedure will be or what to expect,” he added.As the tennis world looks forward to Wimbledon, the absence of Andy Murray serves as a reminder of the physical demands of professional sports and the unforeseen challenges athletes may encounter.","Andy Murray has been compelled to withdraw from the prestigious Wimbledon tournament following a surgical procedure to remove a spinal cyst.

"Not satisfied with Olympics entry, want to win the medal: Sriram Balaji",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/not-satisfied-with-olympics-entry-want-to-win-the-medal-sriram-balaji/articleshow/111120088.cms,"PUNE: It has already been an incredible journey as a professional tennis player for Sriram Balaji .Having started comparatively late at the age of nine in the southern city of Coimbatore, the 34-year-old Balaji is now on the cusp of playing in the Olympics — as Grand Slam champion Rohan Bopanna ’s doubles partner in Paris.Only Nirupama Sanjeev from the city known for its textile and auto industry has wielded the racquet for India at the Summer Games before.Yet, Balaji has come a long way, so much so that he is not ready to be satisfied by simply turning up in India colours, but go all the way and fetch the coveted medal.“Last year I played couple of slams. I did have the game, but was not sharp enough. The last couple of months I have been playing much better tennis. Earlier I would question myself, now I believe in myself much more, my confidence level has gone up. Right now, I am not getting satisfied (with) just making the entry, I want to win the medal,” Balaji, world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles, said.Balaji conceded playing in the Olympics had not been his goal until recently.“It is truly dream come true for me, thanks to Bops (Bopanna). Yuki (Bhambri) is 10 spots ahead of me in rankings,” said Balaji.“When I started, wanted to take it step by step. First the Under-14s (for India), then the Davis Cup. Olympics was not in my thoughts.""The right-hander who began his tennis journey at Perks Tennis School near his home in Coimbatore under the guidance of Elango Ranganathan, whose daughter Madura was a women’s pro.The first major step-up for Balaji was moving to Chennai at the age of 16 and beginning to work Hiten Joshi and Ilyas Hussain.“They (Joshi and Hussain) told me 'don't play juniors' … so I started playing the men’s (circuit). I earned my first ATP ranking point when I was 16. They were the ones who put me on to (Alexander) Waske (in Germany),” he said.Moving base to Europe was another steep learning curve for the Tamil Nadu lad as he had to adapt fast to the difference in culture and tennis.“It was totally different. My ranking was 800 but I was not even getting into qualifying (of ITF men's events),” Balaji said.“That's how tough it was, the standard was very high. It took me one year (to start winning) ... I lost all my matches. I went there in 2010, it was only in 2011 summer that I started getting into qualifying and winning.“It was also mentally very difficult. It makes you think, 'what am I doing here?' I got a lot of help from the coaches and my parents. They never let me down. They pushed me, they believed in me.”Balaji encountered another speed bump a few years later when his game began to stagnate at between 300 and 400 in world rankings. He was at a crossroads and needed to choose his path — continue to pursue success in singles or switch to doubles.“I did have limitations in my game. It was 2017 and I had to make a choice. That was also my best year,” he said of winning nine doubles titles, including his maiden Challenger, with Vishnu Vardhan .The preceding year the duo had won seven ITF titles.“My belief in singles was less. I believed I could get to top-200, but to get inside top-100 ... I could see that I had limitations, and I knew that in doubles I was capable of top-50.“So the choice was whether to go for top-200 in singles or top-20 in doubles. I chose top-20 doubles.”Almost immediately his ambitions suffered a setback as Vardhan decided to stop playing full schedule.“I didn't have a set partner after that. Every four-five weeks I had a different partner. In 2022, I started playing with Jeevan, in 2023 we did well and then he wanted to take a break,” Balaji said.But the tide began to turn when he started forging a partnership last year with Andre Begemann, a 39-year-old German who had ranked 36 in 2015 and won four ATP Tour titles.The Indo-German combination won three Challengers with Balaji getting into the top-100 in rankings for the first time and Begemann returning to the elite bracket too.“Both of us play in the German league, so I knew him already. It is only in the slams I play with a different partner since we don't get in. Otherwise in Challengers I play with Andre,” said Balaji who had beaten Rajeev Ram and Scott Lipsky in the company of Jeeven Nedunchezhiyan at the Chennai ATP Tour event in 2012.Balaji credited the ‘Doubles Dream of India’ programme for supporting the top-200 ranked players in the country.“It makes a lot of difference. Having a coach through the whole year is not affordable, especially with the less prize money in doubles,” he said.“Someone watching from outside can tell you what you cannot absorb when you are playing.“Providing a coach and a trainer during the matches in doubles, you don't find that in many countries. We have eight players in the top-200 ... without this (programme), players would have a lot of struggle.”This year’s French Open was a sort of dress rehearsal for the Olympics tennis competition, which will be held at the Roland Garros.Balaji had made it to the second round last year, and went one step further this year in tandem with Mexican Miguel-Angel Reyes-Varela. The pair lost to none other than Bopanna and Aussie Matthew Ebden.The fortnight proved to be a rewarding one in many ways for the Indian.“I was not in the tournament to begin with, we were sixth out,” Balaji said.“Rohan also has been mentoring me, telling which tournaments I should be playing. This time I told him I want to come to Paris, it's ok if I miss a Challenger.“I decided I was going to take my chances and signed in. The other thing is you also get to practise with the top players during the Grand Slam.“Finally we got in, thanks to the (inclement) weather also, as the singles players pulled out.”The match against the Australian Open winners in the third round was a difficult one but also brought out the best in Balaji and Begemann.“It was not an easy match, it was really hard (to play against Bopanna),” Balaji said.“I look up to him, he is like a mentor to me. I felt I handled it well.”",Sriram Balaji is on the cusp of playing in the Olympics as Rohan Bopanna’s doubles partner in Paris. The 34-year-old is world ranked at a career-high 62 in doubles.
