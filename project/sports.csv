Delhi Capitals are reportedly uncertain about retaining Pant as their captain, despite support from their director of cricket, Sourav Ganguly .

Who is Ryan ten Doeschate?

A man of character

NEW DELHI: The announcement of Gautam Gambhir as the new head coach of the Indian men's cricket team has brought a wave of excitement among fans and players alike.But the buzz doesn't stop there.Potentially joining Gambhir's team as assistant coaches are former India all-rounder Abhishek Nayar and former Dutch international Ryan ten Doeschate Although the BCCI has not yet officially confirmed these appointments, the cricketing world is already abuzz with anticipation.Gambhir's legacy as a leader is well-known. His tenure with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) saw the team rise from mediocrity to championship glory, clinching two IPL titles under his captaincy. Now, as the head coach of Team India, Gambhir brings with him a wealth of experience and a reputation for revitalizing struggling teams.Gambhir's knack for leadership was on full display when he led KKR to the knockout stages in his first year as captain and subsequently to IPL victories in 2012 and 2014.Now as the mentor, he brought the glory days back to KKR this year, though not single-handedly.With Ryan ten Doeschate orchestrating from behind the scenes, Gambhir had a man for whom he could, in his own words, even take a bullet.In a media interaction, Gambhir referred to Ryan ten Doeschate as the ""greatest team man"" he has ever played with. He recounted an anecdote from 2011 when ten Doeschate, despite having a stellar 50-over World Cup, carried drinks without a hint of disappointment. This act of selflessness left an indelible mark on Gambhir, shaping his own leadership ethos.""When I talk about selflessness, I have never said this in 42 years of my career, and I wanted to say this. The greatest team man I have ever played with, the most selfless human being, someone I can take a bullet for, someone who I can trust for life, and I can tell you this because in 2011, for my first game as a KKR captain, we only had four overseas players available, and this man had a fabulous 50-over World Cup. We went in that game with only three overseas players, and he was carrying drinks in that game with no disappointment on his face. He taught me selflessness. Ryan ten Doeschate. These are the people who made me the leader,"" Gambhir previously said during a media interaction.Born on June 30, 1980, in Port Elizabeth, Cape Province, Ryan ten Doeschate is a former Netherlands international, who has had a cricketing journey nothing short of remarkable.Discovered by Essex during a pre-season tour of South Africa, Ryan ten Doeschate's all-round abilities for Western Province caught their eye. His EU citizenship qualified him to play county cricket, paving the way for his impressive career.Standing at 5 feet 11 inches, the right-handed batting all-rounder and right-arm fast-medium bowler left an indelible mark on every team he played for.His impressive stats speak volumes: an average of 67 in ODIs, with five centuries and nine fifties in just 33 matches, and a strike rate of 132.92 in T20Is.In his IPL career, the part-time medium-pacer played 29 matches and took 2 wickets with a best bowling figure of 1/24 while maintaining an economy rate of 7.23.When it comes to his batting numbers, Ryan ten Doeschate scored 326 runs at an average of 23.29, with a highest score of 70* across 29 IPL matches.Ten Doeschate's talent took him across the globe, playing for clubs and franchise teams in the Netherlands, England, Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Pakistan.In September 2021, Ryan ten Doeschate bid farewell to his illustrious cricketing career, announcing his retirement by year's end. His swan song came on October 20, 2021, in a final international match against Namibia during the group stage of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.However, his association with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL further cemented his reputation as a versatile and reliable player.What sets ten Doeschate apart is not just his statistics but his character. Known for his humility and dedication, he has often been described as the best associate player among non-Test-playing nations.His performances in the 2011 ICC World Cup, particularly his career-best 119 against England, showcased his ability to shine on the biggest stage.Yet, despite his individual brilliance, ten Doeschate remains a quintessential team player, always prioritizing the collective over personal glory.As ten Doeschate looks set to join Gambhir and Nayar in the Indian coaching setup, the anticipation for the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka is palpable.With Gambhir's strategic acumen, Nayar's all-around expertise, and ten Doeschate's selfless spirit, Team India is poised to benefit from a diverse and experience-rich coaching team.","Former India all-rounder Abhishek Nayar and former Dutch international Ryan ten Doeschate could join Gautam Gambhir as assistant coaches.

This makes him India’s leading wicket-taker in the ICC event and places him fifth overall globally.Reflecting on the 2019 World Cup, Shami recounted, ""In 2019 I did not play the first 4-5 games. In the next game, I took a hat-trick, then picked up a five-wicket haul and then four wickets in the next game. A similar thing happened in 2023. I did not play in the first few games and then picked a fifer, then four wickets and then a five-wicket haul again.""In the 2023 World Cup, Shami emerged as the highest wicket-taker with 24 scalps in seven games. He was only included in the playing XI after all-rounderHardik Pandya was ruled out due to injury.""The one thing I keep wondering is every team needs players who can perform well,"" Shami remarked. ""I took 13 wickets in three matches. What more do you expect from me?""During the 2019 edition, despite taking 14 wickets in fours matches, he was benched for the final league match against Sri Lanka and the semi-final against New Zealand, which India lost by 18 runs.Shami's bewilderment was palpable as he continued, ""I neither have questions nor do I have answers. I can only prove myself when I get the opportunity. You gave me a chance, and I took 13 wickets in three matches. Then we lost to New Zealand. Played four matches overall and picked 14 wickets. In 2023, I picked 24 wickets in seven matches.""In the 2019 World Cup, Shami was playing under the captaincy of Virat Kohli , with Ravi Shastri serving as the head coach.Shami's consistent performance when given the opportunity underscores the importance of utilizing players to their full potential, especially in critical tournaments like the World Cup.","Mohammed Shami expressed his confusion over team management's decisions to bench him during crucial stages of the tournaments.

So, so many times in my life, the difference between when I was able to push my limits was always the fact that when my mind gets tired, I will tell my body to just push because you will always have extra effort in your body,"" news agency PTI quoted Pandya as saying.""The difference between, if you do 20 and if I do 20, we are on the same level. But if I push to 25 and if I challenge my mindset, next time I'm going to do 25, next time I'm going to do 30,"" he added.Pandya's chances of becoming captain suffered due to fitness concerns, affecting his ability to consistently play all three formats and bowl extensively, especially in ODIs.Earlier this month, he celebrated with the T20 World Cup-winning team in an open bus parade, enjoying the adoration of the fans.However, the weeks following the World Cup victory have been challenging for Pandya, marked by personal loss and a significant professional setback. His removal from the leadership role in the T20 team closely followed his announcement of separation.Despite the events, Pandya appeared unaffected when he made his first public appearance to launch his sports apparel brand in collaboration with Fancode, focusing solely on fitness aspects.""The point that it is very, very important to sometime clean your mind as well, that your body has much more than what you can think and that video (he watched as a 16-year-old) stayed with me for so long that, every time in my life, when my trainer is telling me to do 10 push-ups, I've always ended up doing 15,"" the 30-year-old shared.""And that has pushed my limits and I think slowly, everyone who wants to start with a fitness journey they should focus on that,"" said Pandya, adding that his highest score in the Yo-Yo test has been 21.7, only a few notches lesser than the upper limit.""Start pushing your barrier every single day because the human body is such a lovely creation by god that it will mould however you want (it) to, however you want to have it, it's just that it just needs little hard work,"" Pandya said.Pandya may not have been chosen by the new coach Gautam Gambhir for captaincy, yet he was once recognized by chief selector Ajit Agarkar as the ""only player in the country to do what he can do.""Reflecting on his drive towards fitness, Pandya said, ""I never knew what fitness would do to me, but it's just that I felt it that for me I always wanted to be No. 1 in everything which I do, so in a habit of that, I kept training a lot when I was young, I pushed myself a lot, ran a lot so I had a very good strong base.""Obviously, there was not much knowledge about the body, not much knowledge about how to increase my fitness, but because my base was strong and I did the basics which you are supposed to do while training, it helped me when I came to the higher level.""""I used to bowl if I'm not wrong 130s; higher 130s, I was able to go 140 plus, 142 by pushing, that's when I realised by 2017 or not as soon as I started getting more more into my body, more knowledge about it and that's when I start pushing,"" he said.",Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya focuses on fitness amid recent turmoil in his personal and professional life.

"With varying views on player retention policy, BCCI to meet IPL owners at month-end",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/with-varying-views-on-player-retention-policy-bcci-to-meet-ipl-owners-at-month-end/articleshow/111890097.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is set to meet IPL owners at the end of this month to discuss various topics including player retention policies, the Right to Match (RTM) option, and the salary cap for players, Cricbuzz reported.However, the exact date of the much-anticipated meeting has not been finalised but the BCCI has asked the owners to be available on July 30 or 31.The BCCI has planned to conduct the meeting at their recently renovated office situated within the Wankhede Stadium premises in Mumbai. Typically, meetings of this nature are conducted at a five-star hotel, but the BCCI has decided to break from tradition and host the owners at their own facility.The debate surrounding the optimal number of player retentions for franchises has been ongoing, with differing opinions on the matter. Proponents of higher retention limits emphasize the importance of maintaining team continuity, especially considering the longevity of most franchises, which have been in existence for nearly two decades. They assert that allowing up to eight retentions is crucial for fostering fan loyalty and strengthening the franchise's brand identity.Central to this argument is the notion that teams should be built around key players who are seen as indispensable to the franchise's image. By retaining these iconic figures, teams can create a sense of stability and familiarity for their supporters. This, in turn, can lead to increased fan engagement and a stronger emotional connection between the team and its followers.The BCCI has been engaging with IPL franchises to discuss crucial matters related to player retention and the upcoming mega-auction. While some franchises advocate for minimal player retention, others have differing opinions. The inclusion of the Right to Match (RTM) option in the mega-auction is also a point of contention.In an effort to gather feedback, IPL CEO Hemang Amin has been meeting with franchise representatives, either by visiting their headquarters in various cities or by inviting them to the BCCI office. These meetings took place earlier this month.The upcoming meeting will include deliberations on the salary cap, which is anticipated to be approximately Rs 120 crore during the initial year of the forthcoming three-year cycle. Furthermore, the retention value assigned to each player might also be a topic of discussion. In the past, the salary of the top retention was roughly 16-17 percent of the salary cap (Rs 15 crore in a salary cap of Rs 90 crore).If the same principle is followed, the salary of the top retained player this time could be around or slightly over Rs 20 crore. However, this remains speculative at this stage. The BCCI is expected to explain the formula for determining the salary of the retained players.",The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is set to meet IPL owners at the end of this month.

Patel described Yadav as a ""bowler's captain"" and a person with a carefree attitude.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) announced Suryakumar Yadav as the captain of the T20I team for the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka. Additionally, Shubman Gill has been named as the vice-captain for both the T20I and ODI squads.The white-ball series in Sri Lanka is set to commence on July 27, featuring three T20Is and an equal number of ODIs.This tour will mark India's first international engagement under the guidance of their newly-appointed head coach, Gautam Gambhir , who assumed the role earlier this month.Axar, in an interview with ESPNCricinfo, mentioned that he has spent considerable time with Suryakumar. He noted that Suryakumar's presence helps in maintaining a vibrant atmosphere within the team.""I have spent a lot of time with Suryakumar. Surya Bhai is a happy-go-lucky guy. He keeps the atmosphere lively and loves doing mimicry and such fun stuff. I know he will keep the atmosphere cool. I recently played a five-game T20I series (against Australia) when he was the captain. I know he is a bowler's captain,"" Axar told ESPNCricinfo, as quoted by ANI.""He gives the bowlers the fields they ask for. And it was like that with me, too. I do not think there will be a lot of change. We will get to know now, playing under his captaincy, about his mindset. You cannot judge someone's captaincy by one tour. When we play more, we will get to know more of his captaincy style.""Axar mentioned that he will be having discussions with Gautam Gambhir, the recently appointed head coach, to gain clarity on his role within the team.Axar expressed his positive outlook on being utilized as a floater in the batting lineup, where he is deployed at various positions and scenarios.He views this role as a sign of trust from the captain and coach, who rely on him to perform in challenging circumstances. Axar also mentioned that his IPL team, the Delhi Capitals (DC), has employed him in a similar capacity.""When the team needs someone to stand up, they are banking on me to deliver. That means they have seen something in me. When the team trusts you to deliver in such crunch situations, you start trusting yourself even more automatically. And once you deliver in one or two matches, it gives your confidence a different sort of boost altogether.""""It is not as if this has happened just once or twice. I have been asked to perform this role for Delhi Capitals and other teams as well. After a point, you get used to it and it does not matter which position you are batting in. You are confident in batting in any position and you know what to do in that situation,"" he added.Axar has had limited opportunities to showcase his skills on the international stage. Despite being a part of the squad for several years, he has only played in 14 Tests, 57 ODIs, and 60 T20Is. This is largely due to the presence of more experienced all-rounders like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, who have been given preference in the playing eleven.The all-rounder is not looking too far ahead, as he is focused on short-term goals based on the roles he is expected to play.""It should not happen that I am asked to perform some role and my goals do not align with it,"" he says. ""I do not believe in long-term planning. I just look at the present, what's in front of me and just the short-term goals is what I look at"" he concluded.","Suryakumar Yadav named captain of T20I team for upcoming tour of Sri Lanka.

So, I said I am resigning from technical committee membership.""Bhutia expressed his strong opposition to the special committee, led by AIFF vice president NA Haris, that was tasked with finding a replacement for Stimac. He firmly stated his disagreement with the committee's actions and involvement in the process of selecting a new coach for the national team.""I completely opposed the constitution of the special committee. There is a technical committee already in place and how come you formed a special committee to discuss the appointment of the coach.""The process itself is wrong.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest.
