IPL playoff scenarios: Five teams are still in the hunt for the last two spots as Rajasthan Royals suffer another defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-playoff-scenarios-five-teams-are-still-in-hunt-for-the-last-two-spots-as-rajasthan-royals-suffer-another-defeat/articleshow/110161665.cms,"|

Punjab Kings secured a five-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday, buoyed by an exceptional all-round performance from skipper Sam Curran. While the win provided Punjab with a consolation victory, it dealt a blow to Rajasthan's aspirations of clinching a top-two finish in the league stage, coming on the heels of their confirmation for a playoff spot just a day earlier.Rajasthan, who stay in second place with one game in hand, and table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders are the only two teams to have booked their play-off berth.Despite Punjab's earlier exit from the playoff race, Curran's commanding display with both bat and ball highlighted their resilience and determination to finish the season on a positive note.With just five league games remaining in the season, here's all the IPL playoff scenarios for the last two remaining spots: KKR are now guaranteed to finish sole toppers of the league stage since no other team can catch them on 19 points* RR are guaranteed qualification even if they lose their last game. Their best case scenario is to finish second by winning their last game against KKR. Whether that will be sole second or joint second will depend on results in other games. If SRH win both their remaining games, they could join RR on 18 points and there’s not much separating the two teams on net run rate at the moment.* Third placed CSK are sure to finish among the top four teams on points, but are not assured of qualification. They could end up tied third with up to four other teams (DC, RCB, SRH and LSG) or tied fourth with up to three other teams (DC, RCB and LSG) depending on results in other games. What helps is their better net run rate at this stage than any of the other teams competing for the last two qualifying slots.* Fourth placed SRH too are sure to finish among the top four on points, but they too are not sure of qualification. They could find themselves in a tie with four other teams (DC, RCB, CSK and LSG) for third place if they lose both their remaining games. They could also end up in a three-way tie for fourth spot with DC and LSG . But even just one win from their two remaining games would guarantee qualification* Fifth placed DC’s chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, are at 62.5%. But they are far from sure of qualifying. A third place finish on points would involve a four-way or five-way tie, while finishing fourth would mean a two-way to four-way tie depending on results in other games* Sixth placed RCB have a 50% chance of making it to the top four spots on points, singly or jointly. Their last game against CSK is a must-win, but even winning it is not enough. Other results will need to go their way* Seventh placed LSG, despite Tuesday’s loss to DC, are not out of it yet. They still have a 31% chance of finishing among the top four spots on points, singly or jointly. The bad news, however, is that finishing third would involve a five-way tie while ending up joint fourth would mean a three-way or four-way tie and their NRR is the worst among all the teams they could tie with* MI, PBKS and GT have already been knocked out",Punjab Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by five wickets on Wednesday. Kolkata Knight Riders are now guaranteed to finish sole toppers of the league stage since no other team can catch them on 19 points. KKR are guaranteed qualification even if they lose their last game against KKR.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110161699,imgsize-86128,width-400,resizemode-4/110161699.jpg"

CHENNAI: Cricket is at a crossroads with a part of the T20 World Cup in June taking place in the USA ahead of the sport's re-entry into the Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.The world is waiting with bated breath to see how the public accepts cricket in the United States , which is a new market for the sport.For cricket in the US to be successful, the India-Pakistan game group league game on June 9 in the Nassau County Stadium, 35 kilometres east of Manhattan, must be a hit.And the ICC and United States Cricket have left no stone unturned to produce a stadium with a capacity of 34,000 in six months' time.The stadium, where eight matches will be played including three games featuring India, was inaugurated by legendary Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt on Wednesday.Ahead of the occasion, Chris Tetley, head of events, ICC, said that the ground meets international standards comfortably.""Whenever a new stadium comes up, there are a lot of questions about the size. But the Nassau County ground is not a token-sized ground - it is 75 yards east west and 67 yards north south from the centre. It is similar to the size of Wankhede . The drainage facilities, too, will be world-class,' Tetley said during an interaction.Not too long ago, it was just a municipality park and the ICC worked on war-footing to get the facility ready. Other than the four centre wickets, there are six practice pitches near the ground and drop-in pitches will be used for the tournament.The pitches have been prepared in Florida under the supervision of Damian Hough, head curator of Adelaide Oval, and have been brought to New York in trucks. Hough, who knows all about producing great wickets, says that it was a major challenge but they are happy with how things have shaped up.""The pitches will have pace and bounce and the ball should come on to the bat, something that the players prefer. The idea is to produce good pitches that will stay good throughout the tournament and the players will enjoy playing on,' Hough said.The galleries for the venue are makeshift. The temporary structure will be brought in from the Formula One track of Las Vegas and returned after the tournament is over.","Nassau County Stadium in New York will host the T20 World Cup in June.

The last time they won the IPL in 2023, they were losing the final - 2 balls, 10 runs. It was almost over and [Ravindra] Jadeja hit four and six to win the match. Dhoni himself is in form this time with the bat, and whoever bats with him usually plays a match-winning knock, especially in a do-or-die game,"" Kaif remarked.""Dhoni's formula in crunch games is - don't panic, take a breath and only he has this art in crunch matches. Lots of IPL captains came, but Dhoni's alertness in the crucial moments of the game is unmatched. He makes very few mistakes, that's why they are a champion team [Dhoni galtiyan kam karte hai, isliye champion team hai]. Because of this, CSK are favourites against RCB in the crucial league match,"" Kaif added.Echoing Kaif's sentiments, former India all-rounderIrfan Pathan highlighted Dhoni's exceptional form in the current season and the unpredictability he brings to the table. Pathan pointed out Dhoni's impressive statistics, including an average of 68 and a strike rate exceeding 200, along with his penchant for hitting sixes. He suggested that Dhoni might even alter his usual batting position if the situation demands it, underscoring the skipper's adaptability and potential to spring surprises.""This season he is on a roll, scoring 136 runs at 68 average and a strike rate of over 200 [226.66]. Has already hit 12 sixes. Every time he came to bat he has hit sixes. The special thing about CSK is that at the crucial time they played at a different level. You never know, Dhoni can do something he hasn't done in the season, so far he is coming in to bat in the last one or two overs,"" Pathan stated.RCB host CSK at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Saturday, with both needing a win to earn a spot in the IPL 2024 playoffs.With expectations running high and the spotlight firmly on Dhoni and CSK, cricket enthusiasts eagerly await the outcome of the clash, poised to witness whether the seasoned campaigner can once again weave his magic in the IPL arena.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru host Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.

NEW DELHI: Captain Sam Curran led the charge with a well-paced fifty and two crucial wickets, guiding Punjab Kings to a five-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals in their IPL encounter on Wednesday.Despite a modest target of 145, the Kings faced a challenge on a sluggish track. However, Curran's composed innings of 63 not out off 41 balls, comprising five boundaries and three sixes, steered his team to their fifth win of the season, reaching 145/5 in 18.5 overs.Curran found a capable ally in Jitesh Sharma (22 off 20 balls), with whom he shared a fluent 63-run partnership for the fifth wicket.Despite suffering their fourth consecutive defeat, Rajasthan Royals maintained their second position on the table with 16 points, securing a spot in the playoffs.Punjab Kings' chase started on shaky ground as Prabhsimran Singh fell in the first over to Trent Boult. The team faced further setbacks when an impressive Avesh Khan (2/28) claimed two wickets in the fifth over.The right-arm pacer first plucked the important wicket of Rilee Rossouw, who played some strong shots in his 13-ball 22, and then jettisoned in-form Shashank Singh for a two-ball naught.Shashank failed to connect a fuller, straighter one from Avesh while attempting a flick, and the 141 kmph delivery thudded on his bat. Shashank did not even bother to use DRS as he walked away.Punjab gained some ground through the alliance between Curran and Jitesh, who smoked R Ashwin for two sixes.Curran too gave a dose of punishment to the veteran offie, lofting him for a wonderful six over extra cover.But the blossoming stand was snapped by Yuzvendra Chahal (2/31), leaving PBKS at 111 for five in the 16th over.However, Curran and Ashutosh Sharma (17 not out, 11 balls) knocked off the remaining runs without further drama.Earlier, despite a well-tuned 48 from local hero Riyan Parag, RR struggled against an array of accurate bowlers on a rather slow pitch, meandering to a sub-par 144 for nine.R Ashwin (28, 19b, 3x4, 1x6) and Parag (48, 34, 6x4) tried to accelerate during their 50-run stand for the fourth wicket but it could only bring in a temporary momentum for RR.In fact, lethargy had set in very early in the Rajasthan innings after the early loss of Jaiswal, who chopped a Curran (2/24) delivery back on to his stumps.Sanju Samson (18), who went past 500-run in a season for the first time in his IPL career, and Tom-Kohler Cadmore (18, 23b) stitched 36 runs for the second wicket but took six overs for it.But with Curran and Arshdeep finding a hint of swing and maintaining a good line, scoring was not an easy proposition for the RR batters.Eventually, Samson, who tried a hopping cut off pacer Nathan Ellis, gave a simple catch to Rahul Chahar at point in the seventh over.Cadmore too returned to the dugout in the next over, as his almighty heave off leg-spinner Chahar (2/26) could not progress beyond Jitesh in the deep.Those twin dismissals actually paved the way for the best phase in the Royals' innings as Ashwin and Parag pressed their foot on the right pedal.Ashwin displayed his batting skills, smashing Chahar for 17 runs in the 12th over that included a sequence of 6, 4, 4 and the first four was a stunning reverse scoop over backward point.But he could not further extend his innings, lofting Arshdeep to Shashank.Parag, usually a free-flowing batter, had to curb his flair in front of a hugely adoring home crowd because of the regular fall of wickets at the other end.But a late cut off Curran that sped to third man stood as a testament of his ability and timing as he also moved past the 500-run mark for the season, before getting trapped in front of the wicket by Harshal Patel.However, apart from conquering those little peaks the RR batters failed to slip into the top gear consistently.","Punjab Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by five wickets in their IPL encounter.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq has expressed his belief that Pakistan may struggle to overcome India in the upcoming T20 World Cup due to what he perceives as a ""mental block"" when facing their arch-rivals in ICC events.The highly anticipated clash between India and Pakistan is scheduled for June 9 in New York, marking one of the most eagerly awaited matches of the T20 World Cup, commencing on June 1 in the Americas.Historically, India has dominated encounters between the two teams in T20 World Cup tournaments, with Pakistan securing victory only once in seven meetings, which occurred in 2021.""You call it Pakistan's jinx or mental block when it comes to playing India in World Cups. Pakistan will need to do a lot because this is a very skilled Indian team with a powerful bowling line-up and two good spinners,"" Misbah said on 'Star Sports Press Room' on Wednesday.""India has quality fast bowlers in (Jasprit) Bumrah, (Mohammed) Siraj and Hardik (Pandya). The Indian cricket team's quality has risen many folds. It will be difficult to break, mental attitude matters a lot and Australia handles the mental side the best way.""There is no pressure of excess baggage with Australia, and it needs to be seen how both India and Pakistan handle that pressure.""Misbah highlighted that Virat Kohli , known for his memorable performances against Pakistan, remains a significant threat for their team in the upcoming T20 World Cup.Despite ongoing discussions regarding Kohli's strike rate during the current IPL season, Misbah emphasised the former Indian captain's ability to influence matches with his batting prowess.""Kohli is going to be a big factor. He has damaged Pakistan many times. He enjoys supremacy over Pakistan mentally. He takes motivation from big occasions and not pressure,"" he said.""The Virat Kohli effect will definitely be there. He is a top-class cricketer. He is one player who can win you matches, strike rates don't matter. Good players take motivation from those voices or criticism.""Misbah-ul-Haq still vividly recalls the ill-fated scoop shot he attempted in the inaugural T20 World Cup final against India in 2007.With Pakistan requiring only six runs to secure victory from the last four balls, Misbah's decision to execute the scoop over fine leg proved fatal as S Sreesanth took the catch. Pakistan subsequently fell short, crumbling to 152 while chasing a target of 157, ultimately handing India the coveted trophy.But Misbah said that tournament was responsible for the rapid growth of T20 cricket .""In the 2007 T20 World Cup, all teams were not so serious. India handed captaincy to a young (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni. But the final between India and Pakistan, the greatest rivalry in the history of cricket. The hype that T20 got after that World Cup is immense.""The way T20 cricket flourished, I feel whatever we achieved and the current players are now plying their trade in different leagues and IPL is something great,"" he said.","Former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq believes Pakistan may struggle to overcome India in the upcoming T20 World Cup.

'Was convincing myself from first day...': Sandeep Lamichanne after acquittal in rape case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/was-convincing-myself-from-first-day-sandeep-lamichanne-after-acquittal-in-rape-case/articleshow/110157289.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: After being acquitted by the Patan High Court in a rape case, Nepal's star spinner Sandeep Lamichhane expressed his relief, stating that from the beginning, he was confident in his innocence.He expressed gratitude to everyone who supported him throughout the ordeal and pledged to give his best for his country in the sport in the upcoming years.Lamichhane's acquittal clears the path for his potential inclusion in Nepal's squad for the ICC T20 World Cup , slated to begin on June 1 in the West Indies and the USA.Although the initial squad was announced by the Cricket Association (CAN), with Rohit Paudel leading a youthful roster named in May, adjustments can still be made until May 25. Lamichhane remains a contender for a spot in the team, offering his valuable skills to Nepal's campaign in the tournament.Following his acquittal, Lamichhane said, ""It had been more than one and a half years; from the very first day, I was convincing myself that I had done nothing wrong. I was framed in the case where I had done nothing wrong. Finally, we have reached here. I respected the verdict of the district court and I also respect the verdict given today by the High Court. I would try my best to level up the nation in the international arena. I am grateful to those who supported me throughout this process.""The Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) also lifted its suspension of Nepali leg-spinner Lamichhane in accordance with the verdict of the Patan High Court, which acquitted Lamichhane of all charges. In a press statement, CAN announced its decision to reinstate Lamichhane, aligning with the court's ruling.The news of Lamichhane's exoneration sparked celebrations among his supporters and fans, who took to the streets of Lalitpur in a rally. Musical bands joined the festivities, celebrating and welcoming the court's verdict, which vindicated Lamichhane of the allegations against him.A fan named Kumar Basnet said that the spinner is the ""ornament of the nation.""""Someone who brought this country's name and fame to the world stage has been acquitted. It is a welcoming verdict,"" the fan said to ANI.Another fan named Rewati Raman Rao said, ""This win has given me hope that justice still prevails in Nepal. This verdict has given hope that Nepal will be self-reliant, fostering a supportive environment.""Earlier, Patan High Court granted permission to rape convicted former Nepali cricket team captain Lamichhane to face the case without custodial remand, court officials confirmed.Lamichhane, along with his legal team, filed a petition with the High Court challenging the decision of Kathmandu District Court's eight-year prison sentence in a rape case.""The High Court, in response to Lamichhane's appeal, has allowed him to address the case without immediate incarceration,"" Tirtha Raj Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Patan High Court, confirmed to ANI over the phone. Earlier in January, the Kathmandu District Court convicted Sandeep, imposing an eight-year prison term along with a fine of 3,00,000 rupees and compensation of 2,00,000 rupees. Also, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) suspended rape-convicted former national team captain Sandeep Lamichhane from all national and international games.In a press release issued by the nation's cricket governing body, Chatur Bahadur Chand, Chairman of CAN, announced that Lamichhane has been removed from the national team and will no longer represent the nation in any game format.The district court's conviction was based on allegations of coercion, suggesting that Sandeep took advantage of the victim's financial vulnerability and exerted undue influence.However, Sandeep's petition to the High Court disputed the existence of substantial evidence supporting the claims of financial coercion mentioned in the verdict. Sandeep contended that the district court's assertion regarding financial transactions lacked credible evidence.Lamichhane was accused of rape by a minor back in 2022. The victim in the case was 17 years old at the time of filing the case. The star cricketer who led the national cricket team was accused of raping a minor multiple times in a hotel room in Kathmandu on August 21 of that year. The victim filed a rape complaint against Lamichhane at the Gaushala Police Circle on September 6.Lamichhane had denied the rape allegation in his statements to the DGAO and police. He admitted to staying with the girl in the same room of a hotel in Kathmandu on August 21. But he said that the girl slept on the bed while he slept on a chair that night.She had accused Lamichhane of raping her multiple times in room number 305 of a hotel in Kathmandu Metropolitan City Ward Number 9 that night. Police have also collected CCTV footage of the night from the hotel. The footage showed that Lamichhane had stayed at the hotel for seven hours.The girl claimed in her complaint that she had gone to Nagarkot with Lamichhane on August 17, 2023, after being introduced to him through a friend. Lamichhane left to play in the Caribbean Premier League on August 22 after leading the team to a 3-2 victory in the five-match Twenty20 series against Kenya. Rohit Kumar Paudel then led the Nepali team in the one-dayers in his absence.An arrest warrant was issued against Lamichhane on September 8, 2023 and the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) suspended him from the national team the same day after the issuance of the arrest warrant. The Nepal Police later also issued a diffusion notice against him through Interpol on September 26, 2023.Section 219 (2) of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 states: ""Where a man has sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent or with a girl child below eighteen years of age even with her consent, the man shall be considered to commit rape on such woman or girl child.""The case only focused on the age of the girl, with subsequent hearings postponed from time to time. The Apex Court earlier on February 23, 2024 had ordered to conclude the case through a fast-track process.The court again paused the hearing after Lamichhane travelled to Zimbabwe to participate in the World Cup qualifiers. He was behind bars for a few months and was released on bail and was later allowed to travel abroad. Earlier, the hearings were kept on hold to let him play international games.The Patan High Court repelled the order of the Kathmandu District Court to send Lamichhane to judicial custody in the case of raping a minor, citing a lack of grounds to keep him in custody. He was released on bail of Rs 2 million the next day.At the time of release, the Patan High Court had granted bail under five conditions, which included a prohibition on overseas travel. The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) had appealed to the Supreme Court (SC) against the Patan High Court's order to release him on bail of Rs 2 million.The OAG in appeal, argued that the Patan High Court's order to release Lamichhane on bail was against legal provisions and the SC's interpretation during bail hearings in cases of similar nature.Clause 27 of the National Criminal Procedure (Code) Act, 2017 has clear provision for holding the accused of any offence that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding three years in detention if, based on the evidence available, the accused appears to be guilty of the offence or there is any reasonable ground, based on such evidence, to believe that such person is guilty of the offence.But Lamichhane was released on bail despite sub-section 3 (d) of Section 219 of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 stating that a person who commits rape shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 to 12 years if the woman is 16 or above 16 years of age but below 18 years of age. The victim in the case was 17 years old at the time of filing the case.Lamichhane had also moved to the SC, demanding he be allowed to travel with the national team to the UAE to play ICC Men's Cricket World Cup League 2 matches against the UAE and Papua New Guinea at the end of February.The joint bench of Justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Kumar Chudal, after conducting a joint hearing of the petition by Lamichhane and the OAG's appeal, ordered on February 27 to allow Lamichhane to go to the UAE.The District Government Attorney's Office (DGAO), Kathmandu had registered a case against Lamichhane, charging him with raping a minor. Police had investigated him under Section 219 of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 after a 17-year-old girl filed a rape complaint against him.The Kathmandu DGAO had demanded a prison sentence of up to 12 years against Lamichhane as per sub-section 3 (d) of Section 219, which states that a person who commits rape shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 to 12 years if the woman is 16 or above 16 years of age but below 18 years of age. It also sought compensation for the victim.","Lamichhane's acquittal clears the path for his potential inclusion in Nepal's squad for the ICC T20 World Cup. Earlier in January, the Kathmandu District Court convicted Sandeep, imposing an eight-year prison term.

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: World's fastest man Usain Bolt on Wednesday expressed his preference for T20 cricket which aligns with his own reputation and comes as a no surprise.As a Jamaican who once aspired to be a fast bowler, Bolt believes that the fast-paced nature of T20s will continue to attract more fans from the Caribbean and around the globe, potentially surpassing the popularity of Test matches.Having retired from his illustrious athletics career in 2017, Bolt's magnetic personality remains as strong as ever.Now, as the ambassador for the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup, the legendary athlete is thrilled to be involved in the sport he loves, stating that he is ""living the dream.""Bolt's unparalleled achievements on the track, which include holding world records in the prestigious 100m and 200m events, have solidified his status as one of the greatest athletes in history. Seven years after his retirement, his influence and charisma continue to captivate audiences worldwide, making him an ideal ambassador for the exciting world of T20 cricket.One could sense a child-like excitement in him while talking about cricket as he headed towards the makeshift cricket stadium in New York, one of three T20 World Cup venues in American mainland and host to the India-Pakistan clash on June 9.""I grew up on cricket. My dad was a massive cricket fan and still is. It is something that I have always in my blood. To be actually get to be a part of cricket again as an ambassador, it is wonderful. I never got to live my dream of being a cricketer so to be ambassador of T20 World Cup is wonderful,"" Bolt told PTI from New York.He has spent the last months travelling the world for music and football among other things and therefore, he has not got the time to watch live cricket on the TV.He knows the IPL is on but his schedule has not allowed him to binge watch.""I have not been able to watch as much as I would like to but when I get time I try to catch up on T20s,"" said the 'Lightning Bolt'.Speed continues to excite Bolt the most and no wonder he calls T20 the best format of the game.""T20s for sure... When they started it was a great idea and still is. It compresses the game because you have to also be strong and quick but also be strategic, set a field and get things done quick. To me it combines Test match and one day together to create the perfect game.""Bolt is not the only one in the Caribbean who is attracted towards the shortest format. The same goes for its elite cricketers who are now admired more for their exploits in T20 leagues than what they do in West Indian colours.Amid the T20 boom, Test cricket faces a grave threat in the region and Bolt too only sees a bright future of the slam-bang format.""I think the T20s and one dayers (ODIs) are still massive in the Caribbean. People actually don't enjoy Test cricket that much. It is all about the speed of the game, big hitters like Andre Russell, so for me that is the direction that is going in (game is going in the Caribbean).""It will bring more people to watch the sport. Because people love excitement. That is the key,"" he said.USA is hosting a global cricket event for the first time and despite being a game that is played by South Asian and Caribbean expats at the moment, Bolt believes the local American community will get involved with the game.""I surely think the game can grow in USA. When you have presence in a country people start gravitating towards it and want to know more about.""Bolt may not have a lot of free time at his disposal but growing up in Jamaica, he watched plenty of cricket with his father. Visuals of Wasim Akram castling the batters with his inswinging yorkers remain fresh in his memory.""Over the years, one of my favourites growing up was Wasim Akram because of the inswinging yorker that he had. Of course Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose all these guys that I admired over the years, they were so dominant in their space.""Did he like anyone in the Indian team?""Like my father, I always support the West Indies (laughs). But yes, I have also been a Sachin Tendulkar fan. He and Brian Lara was part of my life growing up. It was a great rivalry,"" he said referring to the two legendary batters.Among the current lot, Bolt says ""Kohli is the standout one for sure"".When asked if there a cricketer who has the slightest potential of being a sprinter, the showman in Bolt came to the fore.""We have a running joke right now, me and Chris Gayle (both are close friends), he said actually he can beat me over 100 metres. We are looking to put out a race and see what happens (laughs).""When it comes to speed I am the best, I don't think there is any cricketer right now that can challenge me (laughs),"" said Bolt, who is looking forward to return to India in the near future.His last visit to the country was in 2014.",Usain Bolt is the ambassador for the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup. The Jamaican believes T20s will continue to attract more fans from the Caribbean and around the globe.

But despite falling, he somehow held onto the ball, leaving his Rajasthan Royals teammates and bowler Trent Boult pleasantly surprised.The incident took place in the first over of Punjab's chase when Prabhsimran tried to smack Boult on the on-side but the top edge made the ball go straight up and towards short third-man.Stationed inside the circle, Chahal back pedalled and was all over the place while keeping his eyes on the ball.

IIt gives me so many options at the death, the batters are ready for that slower one and I can sneak in a yorker or a quick-length ball. And when you get the batters out, they can’t get that acceleration at the death. They are probably 10-15 below par, I think we bowled really well after the powerplay.

NEW DELHI: Despite a valiant 48 from local hero Riyan Parag , Rajasthan Royals struggled to find their rhythm against a disciplined bowling attack on a sluggish pitch, finishing at a below-par total of 144 for nine against Punjab Kings in their IPL match in Guwahati on Wednesday.The Rajasthan innings began with a setback as Yashasvi Jaiswal was dismissed early, chopping a delivery from Sam Curran onto his stumps.Although Sanju Samson and Tom-Kohler Cadmore stitched together a 36-run partnership for the second wicket, their progress was slow, taking six overs to accumulate those runs.Despite some occasional eye-catching shots, particularly Cadmore's towering six over deep mid-wicket and Samson's elegant backfoot punch through covers, the Punjab Kings bowlers, especially Curran and Arshdeep Singh, maintained tight lines and made scoring difficult.The dismissal of Samson, who attempted a cut shot off Nathan Ellis and was caught at point, triggered a mini-collapse. Cadmore fell soon after, attempting a big shot off leg-spinner Rahul Chahar.However, the partnership between R Ashwin and Riyan Parag injected some momentum into the Rajasthan innings. Ashwin displayed his batting prowess with some aggressive strokes, including a stunning reverse scoop over backward point.Parag, though forced to rein in his natural aggression due to wickets falling at the other end, showcased his skill with a well-timed late cut off Curran.Both Ashwin and Parag surpassed the 500-run mark for the season, with Parag becoming the second uncapped Indian player to achieve this milestone in IPL history, following in the footsteps of his teammate Yashasvi Jaiswal from the previous season.Despite these individual efforts, Rajasthan Royals failed to consistently accelerate and were dealt a blow when Harshal Patel dismissed Parag lbw, ending any hopes of a late surge.",Rajasthan Royals bowled out for 144 in their IPL match against Punjab Kings.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi 's arrival in MLS has been nothing short of spectacular, as evidenced by his incredible performance in his first game of the season. In a moment that showcased his unparalleled skill, Messi effortlessly chipped the ball over a fallen defender, Andrew Brody, before collecting it in stride and firing a shot at goal.The audacious move left his Inter Miami teammates in awe, with midfielder Julian Gressel exclaiming, ""Oh my god, he just chipped the guy at full speed and got a shot off.""At 36 years old, Messi continues to evolve his game in fascinating ways, refusing to rest on his laurels despite his numerous accolades, including eight Ballon d'Or awards.His presence in the global spotlight will be felt once again this summer when he joins Argentina for the Copa América, but even in MLS matches against lesser-known opponents, every minute of football he plays is a thrilling and unmissable experience.Inter Miami's team may bear some resemblance to Messi's former Barcelona squads, with familiar faces like Luis Suárez, Sergio Busquets , and Jordi Alba , but the similarities end there. Surrounded by a mix of young, athletic prospects from South America, Messi finds himself in a more open, end-to-end style of play than he has experienced in his club career.This has led to a shift in his role, as he now drops deeper to help build play from the back and weaves through lines with quick one-twos, showcasing his unrivalled vision and passing ability.Messi's impact on the league is undeniable, as he leads MLS in assists and is among the top scorers, averaging an impressive 1.18 goals per 90 minutes played. His ability to break into the penalty area and create chances for himself and his teammates is a testament to his enduring brilliance.While Inter Miami may not go down as the greatest team in MLS history due to their defensive frailties, they are currently top of the league and must-see TV whenever Messi takes the field.

NEW DELHI: The family of the late Diego Maradona is taking legal action to prevent the sale of the Golden Ball trophy he received after Argentina's victory in the 1986 World Cup . The trophy, which had been missing for years, recently resurfaced and is scheduled to be auctioned off in Paris by Aguttes auction house.Maradona's heirs claim that the trophy was stolen and that the current owner has no right to sell it.Gilles Moreu, a lawyer representing two of Maradona's daughters, plans to file an urgent request with the Nanterre judicial court to have the Golden Ball removed from the auction. He will also seek a judicial sequestration of the trophy and file a complaint for theft and concealed theft.According to Aguttes, the trophy reappeared in 2016 as part of a private collection acquired at an auction in Paris. Maradona received the award in 1986 at a ceremony at the Lido cabaret on the Champs-Élysées, but it subsequently disappeared, leading to various rumours about its whereabouts. Some speculate that it was lost in a poker game or sold to pay off debts, while others believe it was stolen from a Naples bank where Maradona had stored it.Maradona's family only recently discovered that the trophy had been stolen and wants the sale to be prohibited, as they believe the Golden Ball rightfully belongs to them. The auction house argues that the person who purchased the trophy years ago was unaware that it had been stolen.The Paradox Lawyers firm, representing Maradona's heirs, stated, ""If the owner of an object can claim ownership under French law, it is on the obvious condition that his or her good faith cannot be called into question. This cannot be the case for the owner of a trophy that was famously stolen from Diego Maradona and whose heirs can legally claim ownership.""The auction house expects the trophy to fetch millions due to its uniqueness, and bidders will be required to make a deposit of 150,000 euros ($161,000) to participate in the June 6 auction.","Diego Maradona's family is taking legal action to prevent the sale of the Golden Ball trophy he received after Argentina's victory in the 1986 World Cup.

I guess that's the key.""The 26-year-old could get a rematch of the Madrid final which she lost in dramatic fashion to world number one Iga Swiatek earlier this month.And Sabalenka, who has won the two most recent Australian Opens, was in a different class to Ostapenko who could do nothing in the face of some punishing hitting.Rome is the first time since the 2013 French Open that the top three women have reached the last four of a WTA event of 250 level or higher, with Swiatek and world number three Coco Gauff in the other semi-final.Following Sabalenka will be Alejandro Tabilo whose fairytale run in the men's tournament continues against China's unseeded Zhang Zhizhen for a place in the semi-finals.Tabilo knocked out six-time Rome champion Novak Djokovic on Sunday and as the 29th seed will be favourite to set up a last four clash with either world number five Alexander Zverev or Taylor Fritz who play the day's final match.Zverev, who won the Rome title in 2017, is the highest ranked man left in the event after Daniil Medvedev's elimination on Tuesday.As well as Novak Djokovic's exit, Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz both dropped out injured before the tournament.Holger Rune, who lost last year's final to Medvedev, Madrid champion Andrey Rublev -- ranked sixth in the world -- and beaten finalist Felix Auger-Aliassime have also been eliminated.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Jelena Ostapenko 6-2, 6-4 to reach Rome Open semi-finals.

""I don't know, to be honest. I have to check that. Training was different. I was going for kind of easy training yesterday. I didn't feel anything, but I also didn't feel the same.
