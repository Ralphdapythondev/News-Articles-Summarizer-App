NURSERY OF MEDALLISTS: Budding wrestlers train at the Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi on Saturday

""Ek mann mein tees thi

Yahan ki mitti mein kuch alag baat hai

It's 5 pm, dusk is settling in. Wrestlers from different age-groups are trickling in at the Chhatrasal Akhada for their evening training. They stay at the adjoining sports hostel. Coaches Jaibir Dahiya, Anil Mann and Pradeep Dahiya are waiting for them.Each one does the customary knee-touch of their gurus, before going for their warm-ups. The young boys are quite excited.There's a broad smile on each of them.A week ago, one among them had taken a flight to Paris. On Friday, he became an Olympic bronze medal winner for the country. No wonder, everyone at the wrestling academy on Saturday was talking about Aman Sehrawat. Chhatrasal Akhada isn't new to such highs.Three years ago, Chhatrasal trainees Ravi Dahiya (silver) and Bajrang Punia (bronze) won Olympic medals in Tokyo. India has eight Olympic medals in wrestling till now, 6 have come from Chhatrasal. It started with Sushil Kumar, who won bronze in 2008 Beijing & then followed with a silver in '12 London.Sushil Kumar, trained in this Chhatrasal Akhada, won bronze in 2008 Beijing and then followed with a silver in 2012 London. At the same London Games, Yogeshwar Dutt bagged a bronze for the country. It was Satpal Singh - also known as Guru Satpal among his wards - who is the founder of the academy and had trained the Sushil-Yogeshwar duo.Back in 1988, Satpal, along with two more wrestling coaches - Ramphal Mann, a.k.a. Guru Ramphal, and Pradeep Sharma - started the akhada on the premises ofChhatrasal Stadium in 1988. The stadium is in Model Town area of Delhi and is located somewhere between the Model Town and Azadpur metro stations. Over the years, the three coaches got help from another famed wrestling coach Virender Kumar in running the akhada.During his days as a wrestler, Satpal emerged as one of India's premier wrestlers, winning the national title 16 times. On the international stage, Satpal won silver at the 1974, 1978 and 1982 Commonwealth Games. At the Asian Games , he continuously upgraded the colour of his medal, winning bronze in Tehran 1974, silver in Bangkok 1978 and finally a gold in New Delhi 1982 in front of a home crowd. During this playing days, Satpal also represented India at two Olympic Games - Munich 1972 and Moscow 1980. But he failed to win a medal.(there was a pain in my heart of not winning an Olympic medal). That's why I started the akhada at the Chhatrasal Stadium. I wanted to churn out Olympic medallists for the country,"" Satpal tells TOI. ""Now we have produced not one, but six Olympic medallists.""When I went for the Olympics, I had never even seen a mat, practising on it was something totally different. The European countries, by that time, had been wrestling on mats for years. I wanted to change that. I wanted to give our young wrestlers an equal opportunity to fight at the international level. We got our first mat at the Chhatrasal Akhada in 1992. Sushil, who was a 15-year-old at that time, trained on the mat and won a gold at the World Cadet Games in 1998,"" Satpal, now 69, adds.There are budding wrestlers training at the Chhatrasal not only from Delhi, Haryana and its adjoining areas, but there are some who have come from as far as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. One of them, Dhanraj, who hails from Maharashtra, says, ""(There is something different here). That's why I have come here to train.""When you enter the premises of the akhada, there are giant-sized photos of Sushil, Ravi, Yogeshwar, Bajrang on the walls. The Chhatrasal Akhada is to wrestling what Sansarpur in Jalandhar, Punjab, is to hockey or what Azad Maidan in Mumbai is to cricket.The wrestling academy has now become a state-of-the-art facility where there is modernity in terms of equipment, but tradition is followed when it comes to the guru-shishya (master-pupil) relationship. There are many cadet-level, youth-level, and also senior-level wrestlers training at the same time, under the same roof, and their motivation is the same. ""I want to win an Olympic medal and make my country proud,"" says Mohit Dahiya, 15, who recently won at the Youth Asian championship level.""I want to emulate Sushil pehelwaan , Ravi pehelwaan, Aman pehelwaan. They are my heroes. I know if I train well and listen to my coach, then I can also win medals at the Olympic stage,"" adds 16-year-old Deepanshu. What makes the akhada so special? One of the present coaches, Jaibir Dahiya, who himself trained here in the 1990s under Satpal, Ramphal and Pradeep, says, ""When you train in the mud, you become really tough as a wrestler. That is where your foundation is made.""Training in mud helps budding wrestlers attain real strength. Movement in the mud is tough and therefore wrestlers need to use extra force. So, when they are put on the mat, they suddenly find themselves moving faster and are more agile. All because of the hours they put in mud,"" he adds. Nowadays, the akhada gets scores of applications. Many youngsters want to train under the coaches at the Chhatrasal. So how are the selections made?""It's trials. Only those who we think can have a future in wrestling are enrolled. Our training is very hard and rigorous, and we push the young ones to their limits. Our aim is to ensure medals for the country, that's why the preparation - right from a young age - is very robust,"" says Anil Mann, another coach, who used to be a trainee.There is a small temple outside the living quarters. Before their daily routine, wrestlers pray to Lord Hanuman - the favoured deity of the wrestling community - and ask for strength.Before we leave, coach Jaibir points towards five-six young wrestlers and says, ""These ones will win Olympic medals in future, I can guarantee you.""","Chhatrasal Akhada is a state-of-the-art facility where there is modern equipment in terms of equipment. India has eight Olympic medals in wrestling till now, 6 have come from the academy. It started with Sushil Kumar, who won bronze in 2008 Beijing & then followed with a silver in '12 London.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112437085,imgsize-62262,width-400,resizemode-4/112437085.jpg"

Dutt also emphasized the critical importance of weight management in wrestling.""The rule is very clear. For example, I competed in the 65kg category, so my weight should be 65 or below. Even 10 grams more than 65 won't work. Every wrestler who has played at the international or even national level knows that they have to maintain weight,"" Dutt explained.The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on Saturday confirmed that CAS extended the deadline for a final decision until August 13, 2024, at 6:00 PM Paris time (9:30 PM IST).

""It has been three days since we have been waiting. Whenever the decision is out, we will be happy,"" he stated.Vinesh Phogat had announced her retirement from wrestling following the disqualification.","Olympic medalist wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt has expressed optimism about fellow Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat's ongoing appeal.

Kieron Pollard of Southern Brave delivered a match-winning performance by hitting Rashid Khan of Trent Rockets for five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday. His explosive batting helped Southern Brave to chase down a target of 127, achieving victory with just one ball to spare at the Rose Bowl in Southampton.Pollard's game-changing performance began when Brave needed 49 runs off the last 20 balls.Rashid Khan had been economical with figures of 1/10 from his first 15 deliveries, but Pollard dismantled his bowling in a single over.Pollard smashed the first two balls over cow corner and the long-off region, followed by a straight hit back over Rashid's head with the third ball. A powerful shot over deep mid-wicket came next, and Pollard topped off the over with a final six over long-off.

The team ultimately won the contest by two wickets with just one ball remaining.Earlier in the game, Tom Banton top-scored for Trent Rockets with 30 runs, helping his team to post a competitive total of 126/8.Reflecting on his performance against Rashid Khan, Pollard acknowledged their shared history and familiarity with each other's play.""I've played a lot against him, and he's gotten me out many times. But I knew the lines and lengths he was likely to bowl,"" Pollard said.""I just backed myself - if he bowled short, I was going across; if he went full, I was going to hit straight. He bowled three fuller balls, and they were right in my arc. At that point, I couldn't hold back, I had to go for maximums. But Rashid is a world-class bowler; we've played a lot against each other,"" he added.Pollard's performance not only secured a crucial victory for Southern Brave but also underscored his reputation as one of the most formidable hitters in the sport.","Kieron Pollard hit five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday.

Jagmander Singh and Virender Dahiya , senior Indian coaches, led the rigorous weight-cutting regime.Following the mat session, he endured a one-hour hot-bath session.At 12:30 am, Aman moved to the gym for a non-stop one-hour treadmill run to induce sweating and weight loss.A brief 30-minute break was given before engaging in five 5-minute sessions of the sauna bath.By the end of the sauna sessions, Aman's weight was still 900 grams above the limit.He then received a massage and was instructed to do light jogging.

Arshad Ayub and Venkatapathy Raju were bowling. They were very good and me and Sachin had a long partnership,"" news agency PTI quoted Vengsarkar as saying.Vengsarkar added that Tendulkar’s performance on the turning track hinted at his potential for a successful career in cricket.“He was going so well on a turning track. I thought he was going to go places and that is what happened,” he said.Vengsarkar, the former chairman of selectors, also dug out a nugget from that famous Ranji Trophy final between Mumbai and Haryana in 1991.“There was this match in 1991 against Haryana — the Ranji Trophy final — and the way he batted…we were chasing 355 and we were 22 for three wickets (34/3).“The way he played in that innings was absolutely brilliant. We could have won the game had he stayed there a couple of overs more,” said Vengsarkar, who made a valiant 139 while Tendulkar scored 96.In one of the most memorable Ranji Trophy finals, the domestic giants Mumbai lost the final by a mere two runs against Kapil Dev-led Haryana.Vengsarkar also remembered that former India skipper Sourav Ganguly, who made his ODI debut in January 1992, was initially picked as a ‘fourth seamer' during the tour of Australia.“On that tour he was selected as the fourth seamer and he was asked to go to the nets. After two deliveries, he said ‘I am not a bowler and I want to bat'.“Ganguly was told that he was picked as the fourth seamer. But he did not get opportunities on that tour. After a few years, he was picked for the tour of England,” he said.Vengsarkar also praised former India skipper and T20 World Cup-winning coach Rahul Dravid for the gradual improvement he made as a player.“Every batsman must improvise. You cannot bat in the first gear all the time. You have to bat in the second, third and the fourth gear. As the years passed by, Rahul improved tremendously and was one of the best batsmen in the world,” Vengsarkar said.The Mumbaikar also recalled VVS Laxman's 281 against Australia in Kolkata in 2001 was ‘important' as it changed India's mentality.“It was very important because India won against Australia. They were a strong team that time. Rahul also played very well,” he said.",Dilip Vengsarkar recalls Sachin Tendulkar's impressive performance against spinners Arshad Ayub and Venkatapathy Raju during a Ranji Trophy match.

He disclosed that the series defeat against South Africa in the 2021-22 season was the lowest point of his coaching career with the Men in Blue.In the 2021-22 season, Virat Kohli-led India had a golden opportunity to secure their maiden series victory against South Africa on their home soil.The visitors began the series with a resounding 113-run victory in the opening Test at Centurion, raising expectations of a historic triumph.However, the Proteas staged a remarkable comeback in the following two Tests, clinching both matches by seven wickets, despite India holding the upper hand at various stages. The South African team's resilience and determination shone through as they secured a memorable series win.Speaking to Star Sports, Dravid said, as quoted by ANI, ""If you ask me what is the lowest point, I would say that the South Africa Test series early on in my career. We won the first Test match in South Africa in Centurion, and then we were playing in the second and third Test match. We have never won a series in South Africa, as you know. It was a really big opportunity for us to win that series. Some of our senior players were not there.""Dravid shared that several senior players, including Rohit Sharma , missed the series. Despite this, India managed to compete closely with the Proteas in both matches. However, South Africa ultimately limited India to low scores when it mattered most and comfortably chased down their targets.""Rohit Sharma was injured, and we didn't have some senior players in that series. But we were very close, and in both the Test matches--the second and the third test matches--in the third innings, we had a big opportunity. We could have set a decent score and won the game, but South Africa played well. They chased back in the fourth innings. So I would say that that was probably my lowest point in my coaching career--not being able to win that series in spite of being ahead,"" he added.Dravid had an impressive tenure as the coach of Team India , capping it off with an ICC T20 World Cup victory after a thrilling win over South Africa in June this year in Barbados.Prior to this, India finished as runners-up in the 50-over World Cup on home soil last year, after an impressive 10-match winning streak that ended with a loss to Australia. The team also secured the runner-up spot in the ICC World Test Championship, again to Australia, and claimed the 50-over Asia Cup title last year.","Rahul Dravid says defeat against South Africa in 2021-22 season was lowest point of his coaching career with the Men in Blue.

In their debut season in 2022, the team clinched the title, and they secured the runner-up position in 2023, demonstrating their prowess from the outset.However, a key figure in this triumvirate, Gary Kirsten, has already departed to take up a position with the Pakistan team. This change might be one of the catalysts prompting the contemplation of further adjustments within the coaching setup, despite the team's commendable performance under the current leadership.Solanki's future with the team remains uncertain amidst the ongoing overhaul, but there are signs that he may be able to weather the storm. However, the head coach position is less secure. Reports suggest that Nehra's presence may have caused discomfort among some team members.In previous seasons, including the 2023 final, the former India pacer was frequently seen on camera, offering guidance to Mohit Sharma after each delivery. However, his appearances on television during the 2024 season were noticeably less frequent, which might not be a mere coincidence.Regarding the speculation about a potential change in the Gujarat Titans' management - from CVC Capital to either Torrent Pharma or the Adani Group - it is likely that any such transfer will have to wait until February next year.This is due to the mandatory three-year lock-in period for franchise shares, which means the current management under CVC will likely oversee at least one more season; definitely the auction which is expected to take place in December.","IPL team planning to overhaul coaching staff ahead of upcoming mega auction.

Couto brothers

paid a visit to former India batsman

MUMBAI: A video which went viral recently, in which former India cricket star Vinod Kambli is struggling to walk, left many cricket fans disturbed. Deeply concerned by Kambli's condition, which hasn't been great for a few years now, two of his close, old cricketing friends - school classmate Ricky and his brother, First-Class umpire Marcus Couto visited the 52-year-old at his fifth floor flat at the Jewel Cooperative Society in Bandra on Thursday.Much to Coutos' and Kambli's many well-wishers' relief, the former left-handed batsman, who played 17 Tests (1084 runs) and 104 ODIs (2477 runs) told them that he's ""fit and fine.""In a video that they made at his fifth floor flat at the Jewel Cooperative Society flat (where many former Mumbai and India cricketers reside), Kambli, when quizzed by Marcus about his condition, said: ""I'm good,"" giving a thumbs-up sign. ""By the grace of God, I'm surviving. I'm fit and fine. I'm ready to bat at No 3 (jokingly). I'll hit the spinners outside the ground, like we used to play at Shivaji Park!""The Couto brothers enjoyed a great time at the Kambli residence. Describing their emotional meeting, Marcus said, ""We went to meet him for 10 minutes but ended up being with him for nearly five hours. While spending almost the entire day with his family, we had home-cooked lunch and tea, all made lovingly by his wife Andrea.""""We reminisced about some of his best knocks- facing the fearsome West Indies quicks in the 1990s, how he attackedShane Warne (at Sharjah in 1994), and listened to songs. He was in a jolly mood throughout our stay in his house and regaled us by singing old Hindi movie songs! While he has a few health issues, he didn't appear to be as fat as he's looking in the video, and looked in decent shape. He was eating well too. He told us: 'I am fine and fit.' When we asked him about the video, he said that it was from a few weeks ago. At that time, he had gone down to buy something, and suddenly felt dizzy, but it wasn't as if he was drunk or something,"" the 53-year-old explained.""He was giving batting tips to his son, Cristiano, who is also a left-handed batter like his father. Andrea, meanwhile, was helping out the kids with their homework,"" said Marcus. The duo then made Kambli speak to several of his friends, including former teammate Abey Kuruvilla , who is now BCCI GM, Ajinkya Naik, the president of the Mumbai Cricket Association and former Mumbai captain Shishir Hattangadi.""There was some leakage from the ceiling of his flat, but the family seems to have sportingly adjusted to that trouble,"" Marcus revealed.Incidentally, it was Marcus who played a massive role in telling the world about the famed 664-run partnership between Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli in 1988. Soon after that partnership, Marcus approached illustrious statisticians Anandji Dossa and Sudhir Vaidya, before another noted statistician, Mohandas Menon eventually established that it was a world record partnership.Ironically, Marcus' brother Ricky, who too paid a visit to Kambli on Thursday, was the 12th man for the Shardashram Vidyamandir school team, for whom Tendulkar and Kambli had that record partnership, in that match.","Vinod Kambli's condition hasn't been great for a few years now.

Will 'Skeleton bone test' be able to end the age fraud menace in Indian grassroots football?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-skeleton-bone-test-be-able-to-end-the-age-fraud-menace-in-indian-grassroots-football/articleshow/112229085.cms,"What is a skeleton bone test?

NEW DELHI: If you google "" age fraud in Indian football "", you'll find countless entries, articles, short-form, long-form, evidence-driven ones, written by countless writers, journalists, and observers of the beautiful game of football.One can find the news of the Indian under-15 football team's captain turning out to be almost eighteen months over the age limit for the Asian under-16 championship in April 2019 or an under-17 player initially rejected by coach Nicolai Adam for his ""unnatural height"" at age 14 was later accepted into the team under Luis Norton de Matos, everything is already so well-documented.While age fraud remains a persistent issue in Indian football, we should now be looking for a more permanent and accurate solution to fight it.And it should begin early, from the grassroots level of Indian football, like the Subroto Cup , an annual school football tournament held in India, named after Subroto Mukerjee, the founder of the Air India Football Club. The prestigious tournament, established in 1960, was once graced by players like Baichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri and will enter its 63rd edition on August 5.Aimed at promoting the sport at the grassroots level, it will host a jaw-dropping 111 teams across three categories, with the sub-junior (under-15) category introduced for the first time this year. It will also have some teams from foreign countries too.To fight the demon of age fraud, the organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament, offering a promising solution to address this issue effectively.During the opening press conference of the Subroto Cup, TimesofIndia.com raised concerns about age fraud. Answering, an Air Force Sports Control Board (AFSCB) spokesperson stated, ""All and every footballer (who will be participating in the Subroto Cup) is registered on the AIFF website. And each of them gets a unique code. We also want to avoid age fraud. As per the AIFF guidelines, a skeleton bone test will be done for the under-15 boys category. For the under-17 category, it will be normal medical. The skeleton bone test or the age-detection test will all be done under the guidelines of AIFF.""The skeleton bone test, commonly known as a bone age assessment, estimates a person's age, especially in children and adolescents, by analyzing their bones.This process typically involves taking an X-ray of the left hand and wrist, as this area contains bones that undergo predictable developmental changes with age. The X-ray is then compared to standard reference images, such as those in the Greulich-Pyle Atlas, to determine the bone's developmental stage, including the appearance of growth plates and the fusion of epiphyses.It is understood that 22 teams in the under-14 category were disqualified and did not participate in the Subroto Cup after failing the age-determination test last time. According to AIFF guidelines, if four or more players from a team are found to be over-aged, that team will be immediately disqualified and barred from the tournament.""Apart from that, all the players who have already registered through AIFF and CRS (central registration system), have their age verified. The people who are coming are less in numbers. So, in times to come, age fraud, which is prevalent in football, is likely to reduce,"" he ended on a positive note, sounding hopeful, as we all are, of a better future.","The Subroto Cup is an annual school football tournament held in India. The tournament, established in 1960, will enter its 63rd edition on August 5. It will host a jaw-dropping 111 teams across three categories. The organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112229089,imgsize-108216,width-400,resizemode-4/112229089.jpg"
