India vs Pakistan in World Test Championship final: Still possible or it's a near-impossible dream?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/india-vs-pakistan-in-world-test-championship-final-still-possible-or-its-a-near-impossible-dream/articleshow/112791230.cms,"Top Picks For You 'Isme players ki koi galti nahi hai': Ahmed Shehzad blasts PCB after Pakistan's historic Test defeat to Bangladesh

NEW DELHI: While the prospect of an India vs Pakistan World Test Championship (WTC) final remains theoretically possible, recent results have made it a near-impossible scenario. Pakistan's historic defeat to Bangladesh in Rawalpindi has further diminished their already slim chances of reaching the WTC final . With India among the favorites to make it to the final again, a match-up between the two rivals would have been a blockbuster.However, Pakistan's road to the final now looks more challenging than ever.Pakistan currently sit in the eighth position on the WTC points table, with just two wins in six matches and a winning percentage of 30.56. This significant decline in form, especially in red-ball cricket, has left them with a steep mountain to climb if they hope to reach the WTC final.Pakistan still have eight Tests remaining in the current WTC cycle. To have a strong chance of making the final, they would need to win all of these matches. This task will be challenging, as they face tough opponents, including England, West Indies, and South Africa, with the series against the Proteas being played away from home.Meanwhile, India and Australia remain the favorites to face each other again in the WTC final next year. Both teams are at the top of the standings with a considerable lead. India lead with six wins in nine matches and a winning percentage of 68.52, while defending champions Australia are just behind with eight wins in 12 matches and a percentage of 62.50. The upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy later this year will be crucial for both teams as they aim to secure their places in the final.Bangladesh's recent victory over Pakistan has moved them up to sixth place in the points table, with two wins in five matches and a winning percentage of 40.00. This victory marks a significant improvement for Bangladesh in Test cricket .In another notable match, England defeated Sri Lanka by five wickets in the first Test, climbing from seventh to fourth in the WTC points table. This result caused Sri Lanka to slip to the fifth position.While an India vs Pakistan final remains a tantalizing prospect, Pakistan's path to the WTC final now appears increasingly improbable given their current position and recent performances.",Pakistan currently sit in the eighth position on the WTC points table. Pakistan's historic defeat to Bangladesh in Rawalpindi has further diminished their already slim chances.

"When Dilip Vengsarkar, Sandeep Patil ensured Shikhar Dhawan was picked at the right time",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/when-dilip-vengsarkar-sandeep-patil-ensured-shikhar-dhawan-was-picked-at-the-right-time/articleshow/112792237.cms,"MUMBAI: Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan , owes a significant part of his success to two stalwarts of Indian cricket from Mumbai-Dilip Vengsarkar and Sandeep Patil .These two ensured that Dhawan was selected at the right time in his career. Both Vengsarkar and Patil made strong, and sometimes unpopular, decisions during their tenure as chief national selectors, but are still appreciated for identifying young talent and picking players at the opportune moment.In early March 2013, it was at Patil's insistence that Dhawan was picked for India's squad for the third Test against the visiting Australians in Mohali.Replacing the great Virender Sehwag , who was then going through a lean patch, Dhawan immediately made his mark by smashing a magnificent 187 off just 174 balls, including an 85-ball century - the fastest by any batter on Test debut.""You should support a young cricketer who's in form. Getting the right opportunity at the right time is extremely important. At that point, Shikhar had just returned from India A's South African tour after scoring a double century and a century there. Unfortunately, we had to make a tough call. All my four co-selectors opposed my decision (to select Dhawan over Sehwag), but ultimately, something good happened. He scored a hundred on his Test debut. It proved that my idea of picking him was right. I don't want to take credit for this. I give credit to Shikhar because he proved my decision right. He saved me!"" Patil told TOI on Sunday.Years before this, Dhawan shot into the limelight during the 2004 Under-19 World Cup in Dhaka, where he emerged as the tournament's highest run-getter. The left-hander set the event on fire, amassing 505 runs in seven innings at an average of 84.16.Few know that it was Vengsarkar who played a crucial role in Dhawan's selection for that tournament after he had initially been dropped by the then India Under-19 selectors due to poor performance in a couple of trial matches in Mumbai.Recalling that episode, Vengsarkar told TOI: ""In 2004, I was the chairman of the BCCI's TRDW (Talent Research Development Wing), and Jagmohan Dalmiya (then BCCI president) asked me to attend all the selection committee meetings of the India Under-19 team as well.""Before the squad was announced, the BCCI had organized two one-day selection trial matches at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, which I couldn't attend due to a prior commitment. When the squad was announced, I noticed Shikhar's name was missing. I had been watching him since his Under-16 days. When I asked the selectors why he was dropped, I was told that he didn't score in those two matches. Pushing for his selection, I told them, 'So what if he failed in these two matches? He's a good player, just pick him.' To their credit, the selectors respected my opinion, and Dhawan was picked. He ended up being the highest run-getter of the tournament.""","Former India selectors Dilip Vengsarkar and Sandeep Patil played a key role in Shikhar Dhawan's success.

NEW DELHI: In a stinging rebuke of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), cricketer Ahmed Shehzad has criticized the board's strategy and selection policies following Pakistan's historic 10-wicket loss to Bangladesh in the Rawalpindi Test on Sunday. This defeat marks Bangladesh's first-ever Test win over Pakistan, achieved on the latter's home soil.After being bowled out for just 146 runs in their second innings, Pakistan set Bangladesh a modest target of 30 runs, which the visitors chased down effortlessly.Expressing his frustration in a video posted on X, Shehzad described the defeat as a ""new low"" for Pakistan cricket.""Pakistan ki cricket ka haal yeh ho gaya hai ki aaj Bangladesh ne Pakistan ke home soil pe pehli dafa zindagi me Pakistan ko hara diya. Maine apni zindagi me Pakistan cricket ko itna low jaate huye kabhi nahi dekha. Kabhi zindagi me nahi dekha. Batting, bowling, fielding, achcha, bura ye toh baad ki baat he. Lekin yeh ek naya low hit kiya he Pakistan ne, jo ki maine apni Zindagi me kabhi nahi dekha [Pakistan cricket has reached a point where today Bangladesh defeated Pakistan on home soil for the first time ever. I have never seen Pakistan cricket sink so low in my life. This is a new low that Pakistan has hit, which I have never seen in my life],"" Shehzad said.Shehzad also suggested that Pakistan will struggle to recover from this loss, much like they have struggled since their defeat to Afghanistan in the 2023 ODI World Cup. He criticized the PCB for making short-term decisions that have led the team towards a decline reminiscent of the fall of Pakistani hockey.""Aur Pakistan iss defeat se bahut mushkil se nikal payega, jaise Afghanistan ki defeat se aaj tak nahi nikal paa raha hai. Issi tarah Pakistan is defeat se bahut mushkil se nikal payega. Humne pehle bhi bola tha. Agar aapne short term decision liye hai toh Pakistan ki team already he na zero ki taraf he, hockey wala haal ho raha hai. Lekin humne yeh nahi expect kiya tha ki aap Bangladesh se bhi har jayenge. Aaj aapne woh bhi kar dikhaya,"" he stated.Despite the poor performance, Shehzad did not place blame on the players but instead targeted the PCB for its lack of vision and poor selection policies.""Isme players ki koi galti main nahi manta. Mujhe nahi lagta isme players ki galti hai. Galti Pakistan Cricket Board ki hai. Kyunki players kabhi bhi aapko zabardasti nahi keh rahe he ki humein aap team me daale. Aap log he jo unko lagataar khilaye jaa rahe he. Aap log he jo domestic ke players ko aane nahi de rahe. Aap hi log he jo khud hi yeh bata rahe hai ki humare paas domestic me he hi kuch nahi. Toh aapke paas domestic mein iss tarah ke players nahi he jo in logon ko replace kar sakenge, toh aapne banaya kya hai abhi tak,"" he argued.Before this clash, Pakistan and Bangladesh had met in 13 Test matches, with Pakistan winning 12 and one ending in a draw. The Rawalpindi loss has prompted calls for introspection and changes within the PCB, as the cricketing community grapples with the implications of this historic defeat.","Ahmed Shehzad criticizes Pakistan Cricket Board's strategy and selection policies.

India declared at 306/6 but lost by 10 wickets. Pakistan's defeat by Bangladesh in Rawalpindi echoes India's 1976 loss.By declaring India's first innings at 306 for 6, captain Bishan Singh Bedi tried to protect the tailenders from the West Indies' fast bowlers on a dangerous pitch.

The win came despite political turmoil in their home country.Pakistan's batting lineup crumbled, managing only 146 runs before being dismissed. The Bangladeshi pace attack effectively dismantled Pakistan's top order, setting the stage for the spinners to dominate, AP reported.Mehidy Hasan Miraz, an off-spinner, and Shakib Al Hasan, a left-arm spinner who previously served as a lawmaker under the government of ex-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, combined to take seven wickets.This remarkable performance marked Bangladesh's first-ever Test win against Pakistan in 14 encounters, making it a historic moment for the team.As the tea interval approached, Bangladesh's opening batsmen Zakir Hasan and Shadman Islam remained undefeated, scoring 15 and 9 runs respectively. The team reached a total of 30 runs without losing a wicket, securing only their seventh victory in an away Test match and their first since triumphing over New Zealand at Mount Maunganui in January 2022.Despite declaring at 448-6, Pakistan found themselves trailing by 117 runs in the first innings. The team resumed play at 23-1, still 94 runs behind, but was ultimately dismissed by a well-disciplined combination of pace and spin bowling from the Bangladeshi side.Mohammad Rizwan, who scored an unbeaten career-best 171 in the first innings, once again top-scored with 51 runs. However, many of his teammates fell victim to impulsive shots, which were exacerbated by the aggressive field placements employed by Bangladesh's captain, Najmul Hossain Shanto.Miraz and Shakib were the standout performers with the ball, taking seven wickets between them. Mehidy finished with impressive figures of 4-21, while Shakib claimed 3-44. The pace trio of Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud, and Nahid Rana chipped in with a wicket apiece, contributing to Pakistan's downfall.The morning session proved to be a turning point in the match, as Bangladesh tightened their grip on the game.Pakistan struggled to cope with the pressure, losing five crucial wickets and limping to a score of 108-6. The tone was set early when Hasan Mahmud found the edge of captain Shan Masood's bat, dismissing him for 14 in the second over of the day, with the wicketkeeper completing the catch.Masood clashed with on-field umpire Richard Kettleborough for the second time in the match, following a controversial caught-behind decision in the first innings. Television replays, however, showed that the left-hander had indeed edged the ball after Bangladesh's successful referral.Hasan nearly dismissed Babar Azam for a second duck in the game, but wicketkeeper Litton Das dropped a straightforward catch on the first ball Babar faced. Babar then looked to counterattack, hitting three boundaries before fast bowler Rana (1-30) claimed his wicket when he reached 22.Pakistan's middle-order batters faltered, recklessly losing their wickets to spinners Shakib and Mehidy.First-innings centurion Saud Shakeel, attempting an unnecessary extravagant shot against Shakib, was stumped for a duck - the first time in his brief Test career.Abdullah Shafique also lost patience, playing an overly ambitious shot off Shakib, which resulted in a top-edge catch at point. Mehidy soon followed by finding the outside edge of Salman Ali Agha's bat in his second over.Bangladesh maintained the pressure on Pakistan after the break, with Mehidy taking three wickets post-lunch. Rizwan, just after completing his half-century, under-edged a sweep off the offspinner back onto his stumps, and No. 11 Mohammad Ali was trapped leg before wicket.The defeat extended Pakistan's winless streak in home red-ball cricket to five losses and four draws since their last victory against South Africa at Rawalpindi in 2021.The second Test will also be played in Rawalpindi, starting next Friday, after being relocated from Karachi due to ongoing construction at the National Bank Stadium.","Bangladesh beat Pakistan by 10 wickets in the first Test match in New Delhi.

Wood becomes more important player than Stokes on flat pitches: Vaughan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/wood-becomes-more-important-player-than-stokes-on-flat-pitches-vaughan/articleshow/112784067.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former England captain Michael Vaughan emphasized the significance of Mark Wood 's role in the team, particularly on pitches that offer little assistance to bowlers. Vaughan asserted that in such conditions, Wood's presence becomes even more vital than that of Ben Stokes .The ex-skipper expressed his concern over Wood's unavailability for the remaining two Tests against Sri Lanka, considering it a significant setback for the English side.Wood sustained an injury to his right thigh muscle during the first match of the series at Old Trafford, which England eventually won by five wickets on Saturday.The pacer had to leave the field after delivering just two balls in his 11th over during Sri Lanka's second innings on the third day and was unable to bowl on the fourth day.""When you get on a flat pitch, Mark Wood is the most important player for England's Test match team. Yes, even more than Ben Stokes. Wood is that good – and his injury that rules him out of the rest of the series against Sri Lanka is a blow.""""Stokes is a colossus. Talismanic, an incredible leader, a brilliant player. But I just can't see how England can replace Wood. He's just got something very special about him,"" wrote Vaughan in his column for The Telegraph, as quoted by IANS.He also pointed to Sri Lanka's second innings on day four as an example of England feeling the absence of Wood. Without Wood available to bowl, Sri Lanka's Kamindu Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal batted through the morning session, setting a target of 205 for England, which they successfully chased down with five wickets in hand.""How much England miss him was evident on the fourth morning with that fantastic partnership from Dinesh Chandimal and Kamindu Mendis when the pitch got flat and it became much easier for batting. We might get a lot of those conditions in the next year or so – definitely in Pakistan, and maybe a bit in New Zealand too. England need to find a way to take 20 wickets on wickets like that.""Vaughan went on to explain what sets Wood apart from other England fast bowlers. ""The point of difference that Wood brings is so important. England have got to wrap him in cotton wool to try and get him available for 60 or 70 per cent of Tests in the next year. Realistically, having Wood available that much would be a great outcome for England. A bowler like him is never going to be able to play every single game.""""Wood is now the most important cog in this England Test match wheel for them to go and beat India, for them to go and win in Australia. He's the player that opponents would most like to see not in the England side.""""Even Jofra Archer, who is fantastic, doesn't bowl 95mph. This is a guy that is doing something that we've never seen in English cricket. There's not many around the world that bowled at Wood's pace with that amount of ferocity. Every time he's come on to bowl this summer, he's made something happen.""""He is not only obviously brilliant for the team, he's brilliant for the game. We used to talk about Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff and Stokes, how they'd get spectators out the bar to go and watch. Well, get out of the bar and make sure you're there watching Mark Wood. He is that bowler. A bowler like that doesn't just give a team a great point of difference. It also sends a shudder to the opponents' dressing room,"" he concluded.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan stresses significance of Mark Wood's role in the team.

Their batting lineup collapsed from 23/1 to 146 all out, largely due to the exceptional spin bowling of Mehidy Hasan Miraz (4 wickets) and Shakib Al Hasan (3 wickets).Bangladesh, needing just 30 runs to win, comfortably reached the target in less than seven overs without losing a wicket, sealing a momentous victory.This win propels Bangladesh to sixth place in the ICC World Test Championship standings, tied on points with Sri Lanka at 40%.

While Kylian Mbappe made his much-anticipated home debut at the Santiago Bernabeu , the French star was unable to find the back of the net.Despite dominating possession throughout the match, Real Madrid struggled to break down a well-organized Valladolid defence in the first half.The visitors, who were the only team to keep a clean sheet in the opening round of LaLiga fixtures, remained resolute in their defensive approach.The deadlock was finally broken early in the second half when Fede Valverde 's powerful free-kick took a decisive deflection, finding its way past Valladolid goalkeeper Karl Hein.Despite creating further opportunities, Real Madrid struggled to convert their chances. Rodrygo missed a key opportunity to extend the lead, misplacing a pass with Vinicius Jr. well-positioned to score.Mbappe himself was denied on two separate occasions, once by a smart save from Hein and later firing wide when presented with a promising counter-attacking opportunity.Substitutes Brahim Diaz and debutant Endrick ultimately sealed the victory for Real Madrid in the closing stages of the match. Diaz, introduced in the second half, finished off a flowing move with a composed lob in the 88th minute.He then turned provider in stoppage time, setting up fellow substitute Endrick, who marked his first-team debut with a well-taken goal.While Mbappe was unable to make a significant impact on the scoresheet, his presence added an undeniable element of anticipation to the match. The French forward, who arrived from Paris Saint-Germain this summer, will be looking to open his LaLiga account in upcoming fixtures.The victory marks Real Madrid's first win of the LaLiga season following their opening draw against Real Mallorca. However, with Barcelona securing a victory against Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, Carlo Ancelotti's side remains two points adrift of their rivals in the early stages of the title race.","Real Madrid beat Real Valladolid 3-0 in LaLiga on Sunday.

So to be honest, our role is very small, if you ask me. We select the best players from this list that has been given to us,"" Sai told The Times of India.""I know how it works in cricket. I have a friend who does junior selection, and I know he travels a lot (as part of the job).""He watches the players, he interacts with them. He’s always keeping an eye out for up and coming talent. And he's a lot more involved than, let's say, me.""And I do feel that there should be a whole lot more involvement. I mean, I personally would think that that's how selections can be made more accurately, because then you know exactly who you're talking about, what they do, what they have done in the recent times, how they're playing currently, things like that.""In cricket, it is a much bigger thing, because it is a team sport. So everything hinges on that, you know, on the player being on the team or not.""In tennis, it's completely the other end of the spectrum, because it's an individual sport for 95% of the time, and the only time you play for your country is in Davis Cup , Fed cup, or Olympics, or Asian Games Olympics once in four years.""So unlike a sport like, say, cricket, where if you're not on the team, you're not even given an opportunity to make a mark. Here you can make a mark on your own.""But I think at the end of the day, there should be more involvement for us, as opposed to what is just now, which is simply, ‘here's a list. And, choose from this’ kind of thing. I definitely think that more involvement in knowing who is doing what and how they're playing at the moment.""Sai said a more hands-on approach could begin with having the selectors travel to tournaments in India.""I think there maybe, should be more (travelling). The chairman, Nandan (Bal), watches a lot of matches. And if something happens in Chennai, then I go and watch. But other than that, I think some amount of travel (is needed) so that you're actually aware of what the players are doing, you see how they are on court.""She acknowledged that the presence of selectors would act as a catalyst for the players to give their best, and compared it to the yesteryears when players gave more than their best to succeed at the Nationals.""I do think so, because when I was playing, the Nationals was like the biggest tournament in the country, and everybody would give an arm and a leg to have won it, (that) kind of thing,"" she said.""It was like the biggest tournament that everyone marked out of their calendars and everyone was trying to win. It meant so much, you know, to be a national champion. Now it seems to sort of receded in everyone's consciousness.""But it's a tough thing to do because you are trying to chase points, you are trying to get a better ranking. It's very tough, competitive sport because you're on your own and you're trying to plan all these things.""Mukund Sasikumar , who has been sanctioned for allegedly making himself unavailable for selection for three ties, had remarked that players represent the nation even when they compete on the professional tour and not just in team competitions like the Davis Cup.Mukund had also said that a player should not be punished merely because he chooses to play in the pro circuit instead of a Davis Cup match.Without commenting directly on Mukund’s views, Sai said: ""Around the time I was playing … of course, this was before social media and even the internet … playing for the country was like the absolute, like the apex, you know. If you've played for your country, it was like, 'wow'.""Even today, when I talk to people, you say you won the Nationals, you won so many tournaments, your ranking is so and so … None of it makes as big a dent or an impression as when you say that you played for your country.""So, I would still think playing for the country (ranks above) most other things. I mean, when you play the other tournaments ... Tennis is an individual sport. So you're not really representing the country as such.""Yes, your name will be as, X, and the country name will be in brackets. But at the end of the day, it's an individual sport.""I can't comment on individual player's choice. Why they did what they did. It's a tough choice to make, because you're sort of trying to do this on your own, and trying to make your way through it.""If you're not chasing points, someone else is going to be doing that, and they're going to take your place. It's fairly competitive.""Personally, speaking for me, I always consider playing for the country a very big honour and very privileged.""Sai refrained from giving her opinion on whether a player should be penalized for being unavailable for national duty.""Again, you're asking me a comment on something that … I think those decisions are made by the executive committee or the association, it's completely out of our purview. It's something that I shouldn't comment on,"" she said.She, however, agreed it was worrisome that players - on the men's side at least for the moment - increasingly choosing to make themselves unavailable for India selection.""Yes, I definitely think so. Because, like I said, it comes down to the priorities that the player has. I guess you know where they are in their career and things like that,"" she said.""But if you would ask me, and if I was in a situation where they (selectors) said, ‘are you available to play for the country', I would choose to play for the country.""",Sai Jayalakshmy Jayaram is a former Billie Jean King Cup tennis player. She is a member of the national selection committee. She says the selectors need to have a larger role than what they have currently. Sai said a more hands-on approach could begin with having theSelectors travel to tournaments in India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112782004,imgsize-12378,width-400,resizemode-4/112782004.jpg"

Novak Djokovic eyes record 25th Grand Slam at US Open after golden Games,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/novak-djokovic-eyes-record-25th-grand-slam-at-us-open-after-golden-games/articleshow/112756176.cms,"Novak Djokovic , the Serbian tennis star, finally achieved the elusive Olympic gold medal in Paris, completing the prestigious career Golden Slam . However, as he prepares to defend his U.S. Open title, Djokovic faces the possibility of being excluded from the Grand Slams for the first time since 2017.Throughout this season, Djokovic has been overshadowed by his younger competitors.He suffered defeats against Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open semi-finals and Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final. Additionally, the 37-year-old was forced to withdraw from his French Open quarter-final due to a knee injury.The last time Djokovic participated in all four majors without securing a victory was 14 years ago. However, his recent performance suggests a resurgence in form, as evidenced by his triumph over French Open champion Alcaraz in the Paris Games final at Roland Garros.In preparation for his attempt to surpass Margaret Court and claim sole ownership of the all-time Grand Slam record, Djokovic has made the decision to skip the U.S. Open tune-up tournaments in Montreal and Cincinnati, allowing himself time to recharge and focus on the upcoming challenge at Flushing Meadows .""I think he can find the motivation, the gold medal will lift him. If he plays like this, he's the man to beat at the U.S. Open,"" Djokovic's former coach Goran Ivanisevic said.""I'm so glad that he finally won the Olympic gold.

Emma Raducanu returns to the US Open confident and ready to compete,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/emma-raducanu-returns-to-the-us-open-confident-and-ready-to-compete/articleshow/112755647.cms,"NEW DELHI: Emma Raducanu concluded her U.S. Open practice session on Friday by hitting with a young fan she had asked her social media followers to help locate after they were unable to meet the previous day. As the defending champion from her surprising victory three years ago, Raducanu remains unfazed by questions regarding her match readiness for the tournament .Despite her 2021 U.S. Open title remaining her sole WTA Tour victory, and her absence from last year's event due to injuries, the 21-year-old British player has participated in fewer than 30 matches this season.Although she has declined opportunities to compete more frequently, Raducanu stands by her preparation approach for the year's final Grand Slam .""Even when I won the U.S. Open, I only played a few tournaments that year,"" Raducanu said. ""Yes, they were closer together, but I'm not in any big rush to play those. I think I'd rather target tournaments and play the tournaments that I'm entered in.""Emma Raducanu, following her fourth-round exit at Wimbledon in July, made the decision to skip the Olympic Games and participated in only one event during the North American hard-court season, suffering a third-round defeat in Washington.The young tennis star, who holds a Canadian passport due to being born there, chose not to compete in her birth country. Instead, she returned to Britain to focus on training rather than participating in additional tournaments in preparation for her highly anticipated return to New York. In the first round of the US Open, Raducanu is set to face off against Sofia Kenin, the 2020 Australian Open champion.While some players crave match time, Raducanu said that just isn't her. The rising star's approach to tournament preparation differs from that of many of her peers, as she prioritizes targeted practice sessions over extensive match play leading up to major events.""I don't think I'll ever be the player who's playing, like, close to 30 events a year,"" she said. ""I think that's not my style. It never has been.""Emma Raducanu's 2023 season was marred by injuries, forcing her to miss a significant portion of the year due to surgeries on both wrists and an ankle. As a result, her only appearance at the U.S. Open following her historic 2021 victory as a qualifier was a first-round defeat to Alize Cornet in 2022.Despite the setbacks, Raducanu expressed a greater sense of preparedness for this year's U.S. Open. During her practice session on Friday, she had an unexpected encounter with a 7-year-old fan who had watched her play the previous day and enthusiastically proclaimed Raducanu as her favorite player.Although Raducanu had to leave quickly after the practice and couldn't meet the young fan, she took to social media to apologize and asked her followers to help locate the girl.Much to the delight of the young fan, Raducanu found her on Friday and extended an invitation to hit together on the court, creating a memorable moment for both the player and her admirer.""She barely missed a ball and she has a lot of courage to kind of go onto the court with a lot of people watching and start hitting balls, and it was nice to meet her and speak to her,"" Raducanu said. ""Obviously I felt incredibly bad about yesterday but I feel good and I feel happy that I was able to connect with her today.""Emma Raducanu is well aware that her career decisions have drawn skepticism from those who doubt her ability to secure another U.S. Open title. However, the sight of her name etched on the trophy and her image displayed alongside past champions serves as a powerful reminder of her previous triumph and her potential to achieve such greatness once more.""I think that's such an epic achievement and these two weeks I completed it,"" she said. ""So for me coming back here now, I come back with such a different outlook and just joy and promise, and it inspires me to want to do more.""",Emma Raducanu is the defending champion of the U.S. Open.

""Now I just need some clean air.""The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) revealed that Sinner failed two drug tests, one during a tournament in Indian Wells, California, and another eight days later. However, it was determined that the banned anabolic steroid Clostebol entered his system unintentionally through a massage from Naldi.""Obviously it has been a very tough moment for me and my team,"" Sinner said. ""It still is, because it's quite fresh.""Sinner, the top-seeded man at the U.S. Open , is scheduled to face American Mackie McDonald, ranked 140th, in the first round on Tuesday.Despite the timing of the news, Sinner maintained his innocence, stating, ""Of course it's not ideal before a Grand Slam, but in my mind, I know that I haven't done anything wrong. I had to play, already, (for) months with this in my head, but just (was reminding) myself that I haven't done really anything wrong. I always respect these rules - and I always will respect these rules - of anti-doping"" as reported by AP.Considered a leader among the next generation of male tennis stars, Sinner has had an impressive 2024 season, with a 48-5 record and a tour-leading five titles.He recently won the Cincinnati Open, a hard-court tournament, in preparation for the U.S. Open. Frances Tiafoe, the American who lost to Sinner in the Cincinnati final, commented on the situation, saying, ""He's an incredible player, and, you know, (governing) bodies made a decision. They went and did that; he's cleared to play. That's pretty much what I have to say about it. All the best to him in the U.S. Open.""Sinner explained that Ferrara purchased an over-the-counter spray containing Clostebol in Italy and gave it to Naldi, who used it on a cut finger before giving Sinner a massage.The investigation found a trace amount of the steroid in Sinner's system, which he illustrated by counting out the number of zeroes before the ""1"" in the amount: .000000001.When asked if the episode would affect his reputation, Sinner responded, ""We will see now - now, moving forward. Because this, I can't really control.""He also expressed relief at the outcome, admitting that he was worried as it was his first time in such a situation, and hopefully his last.","Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner fired his fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara, and physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi.
