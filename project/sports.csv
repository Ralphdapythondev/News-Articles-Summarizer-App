NAVDEEP'S INCREDIBLE JOURNEY

NEW DELHI: Para-athlete Navdeep made history at the Paralympic Games by winning the gold medal in the Men's Javelin throw F41 category . He achieved a personal best distance of 47.32 metres, securing India's seventh gold medal in the French Capital.Initially, Navdeep had finished second behind Iranian Beit Sayah Sadegh, who had set a Paralympic Games record of 47.65 metres.However, the Iranian athlete was disqualified for violating rule 8.1 of the World Para Athletics Rules and Regulations.Navdeep's silver medal was upgraded to gold after initial winner Iran's Sayah was disqualified for repeatedly displaying an objectionable flag following a dramatic men's javelin throw F41 final.According to International Paralympic Committee rules, athletes are prohibited from making political gestures during the event, and Sayah was disqualified for unsporting and improper conduct.""World Para Athletics (WPA) is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity, ethics, and conduct in the sport of Para athletics. All participants in the sport, including athletes, coaches, officials, and administrators, have a responsibility to uphold these standards and ensure that the sport is conducted in a fair, honest, and transparent manner.""As a result, Navdeep was awarded the gold medal, marking India's first-ever victory in the Men's Javelin F41 category at the Paralympic Games.During the competition, Navdeep started with a foul before throwing the spear 46.39 metres on his second attempt. He then improved his distance to 47.32 metres in the third round. After another foul, he managed 46.06 metres and ended his campaign with a final foul.China's Sun Pengxiang claimed the silver medal with a throw of 44.72m, while Iraq's Wildan Nukhailawi was upgraded to bronze with a distance of 40.46m.Hailing from Panipat, Haryana, the 24-year-old Navdeep has overcome the challenges posed by his short stature to excel in sports.He completed his education at Unique Public School and earned a B.A. in Hindi (Hons.) from Delhi University. Inspired by his father, a national-level wrestler, Navdeep began his sports journey in athletics before focusing solely on javelin throw.He received professional coaching in 2017 and made his international debut at the Asian Youth Para Games, where he won the gold medal.Navdeep has won five gold medals at the national level and participated in the Fazza International Championship in Dubai in 2021, where he secured the gold medal.Despite finishing fourth in both the Tokyo Paralympic Games and the Asian Para Games in Hangzhou, Navdeep's determination and skill have now earned him a well-deserved gold medal at the Paralympic Games.","Para-athlete Navdeep made history at the Paralympic Games by winning the gold medal in the Men's Javelin throw F41 category.

That will not work. Stick to your captain, stick with him,"" Kaneria told Republic TV.""Okay, I have made him the captain for one year. I will ask him. I will ask him to give me an answer after one year. Nobody will touch him you have full support from me, but you need to perform.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo , the iconic Portuguese forward, recently etched his name deeper into the annals of football history by scoring his 900th career goal during Portugal's UEFA Nations League match against Croatia.The 39-year-old’s goal, a tap-in volley from Nuno Mendes' cross, sealed a 2-0 lead, and eventually, Portugal triumphed 2-1. Ronaldo’s emotional reaction on the field, as he hit this incredible milestone, speaks volumes about the dedication, hard work, and excellence that have driven his illustrious career.With 900 goals across club and international football, Ronaldo has set a bar that seems almost untouchable.His tally includes 450 goals for Real Madrid , 145 for Manchester United, 101 for Juventus, 68 for his current club Al Nassr, 5 for Sporting Lisbon, and a stunning 131 for Portugal.However, some footballers are still in the race, albeit at a distant pace. Below are the top three footballers who are chasing Cristiano Ronaldo’s 900-goal mark .Lionel Messi, Ronaldo’s eternal rival, is closest to his 900-goal mark with 859 career goals to date. The Argentine forward's career has been nothing short of legendary, with countless records for both club and country.Messi has amassed 672 goals for Barcelona , 32 for Paris Saint-Germain, and now plays for Inter Miami in Major League Soccer. His international career with Argentina has been equally spectacular, with 103 goals, including helping Argentina lift the 2022 FIFA World Cup.At 37 years old, Messi continues to score regularly, especially in MLS, and his pursuit of Ronaldo's milestone adds yet another layer to their age-old rivalry.Polish striker Robert Lewandowski has been one of Europe’s most consistent goal-scorers over the last decade.With 635 career goals to his name, he ranks among the top in football history. Having played most of his club career with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich, Lewandowski is now at Barcelona, where he continues to add to his tally.Known for his technical prowess and finishing ability, Lewandowski has also scored 81 international goals for Poland.At 36, while catching Ronaldo seems far-fetched, Lewandowski's legacy as one of the most clinical strikers is firmly established.Luis Suárez, the Uruguayan forward, has been an integral part of football's elite strikers over the past two decades.With 578 goals in his career, Suárez has left an indelible mark on every club he’s played for. His exploits for Liverpool, Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, and now Gremio have made him one of the most feared forwards of his generation. Suárez’s 68 international goals for Uruguay further underscore his reputation as a top performer.Though nearing the twilight of his career at 37, Suárez’s hunger for goals remains undiminished, and he could well climb the all-time rankings before hanging up his boots.Cristiano Ronaldo’s 900-goal achievement has set a monumental benchmark in the world of football. While Lionel Messi remains the closest contender to challenge Ronaldo’s record, other greats like Robert Lewandowski and Luis Suárez are making their way into football’s all-time top scorer lists.However, Ronaldo’s legacy as the first male footballer to cross the 900-goal mark will remain an awe-inspiring achievement, setting an almost insurmountable challenge for the next generation of players.","Cristiano Ronaldo recently scored his 900th career goal against Croatia.

They then shifted gears offensively in the middle quarters, building a 15-point lead by the start of the fourth period.Despite two of India's top performers fouling out in the final quarter, Lebanon mounted a spirited comeback, but their efforts were thwarted by a sensible play of 5-foot-9 point guard Ankush from Haryana. Ankush scored a game-high 14 points on 47.6-percent shooting to take control of the proceedings after India's tallest cager Mohammad Ishan and skipper Lavish left the court one after the other for committing five personal fouls.Before being fouled out, Ishan and Lavish played crucial roles in India's impressive performance in the second and third quarters, which ultimately propelled the team to a 55-40 lead at the start of the final period. Ishan recorded a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds, along with 4 assists, a steal, and 3 blocks, resulting in an efficiency rating of 21. Lavish contributed nine points and six assists. With timely baskets, Sahibjit Singh Bhullar and Mirthun Danasekar scored identical 10 points.The quarter-wise scores in India's favour read 16-16, 19-13, 18-11, 11-22. This two-point victory over the higher-ranked Lebanon also served as sweet revenge for India's 2016 quarterfinal defeat against their West Asian counterparts.India's American head coach Scott Flemming was a happy man. Speaking with TOI, Flemming said, ""This is a great win for India. I was pleased with how we competed. We struggled late with 2 of our top players fouled out. Overall, we outplayed a very good Lebanon team. Really happy for our players.""Explaining the strategy, Flemming added, ""Defensively, we wanted to protect the paint. Make them beat us from the perimeter. We needed to rebound with them. When we made our run, we executed that. Offensively, we wanted to push the ball but run our offences when they stopped our break. We needed more consistency, but overall we did what we needed to do to secure the win.""Though India were outrebounded by Lebanon 53-43, the 26.39% three-point shooting and 68.4% free throw conversion did the trick for the boys donning blue outfits. The quarterfinal will be the biggest test for India as they face the tournament's winningest nation, China, on Saturday.",India beat Lebanon 64-62 to confirm their last eight berth at the U-18 Asia Cup in Jordan. The boys in blue ended a six-year winless streak in the biennial tournament.

This was the seventh time in six matches that Mendis has passed 50, a run that includes three centuries.Sri Lanka had a stroke of luck when De Silva remained at the crease despite a mistake. He should have been out for 23 but Test debutant Josh Hull dropped a straightforward catch at mid-on. The ball went through Hull's hands after a miscue off spinner Shoaib Bashir.Earlier in the innings, an unfortunate mix-up cost Sri Lanka their first wicket. Dimuth Karunaratne was run out for nine due to Olly Stone's direct hit from short cover following Pathum Nissanka's ill-advised dash for a single. Nissanka went on to score an impressive fifty, highlighted by seven boundaries from 40 balls, but the middle-order wobbled soon after.Stone, returning for his second Test in three years, made a significant impact. The injury-prone paceman took the wicket of veteran all-rounder Angelo Mathews for just three runs, enforcing an edge to Pope in the gully in only his second game since the 190-run win at Lord's last week.Hull strikesHull's first Test wicket, removing a set Nissanka for 64, marked a significant moment in the third Test. England gained momentum, reducing Sri Lanka to 91-4 and subsequently 93-5 after Stone trapped Dinesh Chandimal lbw for zero.Kamindu Mendis, batting at No. 7, displayed composure during a precarious situation as dark clouds loomed.To counter potential bad light after tea, England deployed spinners from both ends, with Bashir and part-timer Dan Lawrence bowling in tandem. The tactic aimed to prevent the umpires from pausing the match.De Silva responded by late-cutting Lawrence for four to reach his half-century off 81 balls, while Kamindu Mendis reached his fifty in just 60 balls.Joe Root also bowled briefly with his occasional off-breaks before bad light halted play for the day.By then, Sri Lanka had added 69 runs without losing a wicket in 17 overs of all-spin bowling post-tea.Earlier in the day, England saw a collapse, losing six wickets for 35 runs after starting at 221-3. Pope, who resumed on 103 not out, had struggled in previous innings.The Sri Lankan pace attack, initially lacking precision, found their rhythm, with fast bowler Milan Rathnayake ending with figures of 3-56 from 13.1 overs.Left-arm quick Vishwa Fernando dismissed Pope, who scored 126 off 156 balls, including 19 fours and two sixes. Despite his dismissal, Pope's first-class average on his Surrey home ground remained above 84.England are aiming for a clean sweep -- their for the first since 2004.","Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva and Kamindu Mendis form unbroken century partnership.

It was during this inaugural match that Lala’s audacious decision made headlines.The match was played at Delhi’s Karnail Singh stadium, also known as Railway stadium, from 18-20 March 1960.Lala, who had the distinction of scoring the first century for India in his debut Test, was leading the Rest of India team and cricketer Polly Umrigar was the captain of the Bombay team.In an extraordinary move that shocked everyone, Amarnath decided to send in a player who was not originally in the batting lineup — the 12th man .During the match, both Lala and the umpires disregarded the rules of cricket. When Lala sustained an injury, he instructedPrem Bhatia , who was designated as the 12th man for the Rest of India team, to bat in his place.The 12th man Bhatia was allowed to bat in both innings — at No. 9 in the first innings and at No. 3 in second innings — of the first Irani Cup. Bhatia scored 22 and 50 in the game.The incident remains a testament to Lala’s audacity but who would have known then that after many years later the International Cricket Council (ICC) would come up with a substitute rule where a player who was not originally named in the XI can come out to bat/bowl.Lala, a prominent figure in Indian cricket history, held the distinction of being the first Indian to lead the national team in ten consecutive Test matches. During his tenure as captain, which spanned 15 Tests, Amarnath achieved a significant milestone for Indian cricket.Under Amarnath's leadership, India secured their maiden Test victory against their arch-rivals, Pakistan. This groundbreaking match took place at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground in Delhi in October 1952.India's performance was nothing short of dominant, as they comprehensively defeated Pakistan by an innings and 70 runs, asserting their superiority on the cricket field.","Lala Amarnath was the chairman of the national selection committee.

At tea, India B was 33 for three.In this situation, Pant and Sarfaraz (46 off 36 balls, 7x4, 1x6) were expected to play with caution as the ball was moving considerately. However, both players defied the conditions and bowlers. Their partnership yielded 72 runs in just over nine overs, shifting the match's momentum towards India B.Sarfaraz targeted Akash Deep, hitting five consecutive fours, while Pant dealt effectively with Ahmed, producing a late cut and a cover punch for boundaries.Sarfaraz was dropped on 28 by Ahmed off his own bowling, but soon after, he lofted a six off the same bowler.

He transitioned from 43 to 49 with an overhead six off Kuldeep Yadav, then achieved the milestone with a single on the next delivery. His innings ended when he attempted a sweep off Tanush Kotian and offered a simple catch to substitute Kumar Kushagra.By this time, Pant had also demonstrated his capability as a wicketkeeper, reinforcing his position as the first-choice wicketkeeper batter for India's upcoming two-Test series against Bangladesh.Earlier, India A resumed their innings from 134 for two but were bundled out for 231. Pacers Navdeep Saini (3/60) and Mukesh Kumar (3/62) shared six wickets between them.

However, Sai Kishore induced an edge that was caught by Musheer at forward short leg, thus ending their resistance.At the close of play, India B maintains the upper hand, thanks largely to the aggressive and timely contributions from Pant and Sarfaraz that countered early setbacks by India A's pacers.","Rishabh Pant and Sarfaraz Khan lead India B to a substantial second innings total of 150 for six after facing persistent India A pacers.

Malappuram FC blank Forca Kochi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/malappuram-fc-blank-forca-kochi/articleshow/113156067.cms,"KOCHI: A cohesive Malappuram FC came to Kochi and conquered the home team in their den as they registered a 2-0 win over Forca Kochi FC in the opening match of Super League Kerala at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi, on Saturday.Forca Kochi had an impressive array of stars in their line-up, which included Raphael Santos, Nijo Gilbert, Asif K, and Arjun Jayaraj, giving them a formidable side on paper.However, their performance on the pitch against Malappuram FC was below par. Led by the seasoned Anas Edathodika , Malappuram totally outplayed the home side, giving great joy to the fans who had travelled from Malappuram to support the district’s first professional football team. Pedro Manzi (3) and Faslurahman Methukayil (40) scored a goal each for the winners.Forca Kochi came into the opening match after a training camp of just two weeks, while Malappuram, under ISL-winning coach John Gregory, underwent a pre-season camp of a month and a half. The difference was evident on the pitch as Malappuram totally dictated terms right from the start.Capitalising on Forca Kochi FC's sluggishness, Malappuram needed just two minutes and 43 seconds to seize an early lead, setting the stage for a thrilling encounter. Spanish forward Pedro Manzi soared high to head home a precisely delivered cross from Malappuram's Nandu Krishna from the right wing, leaving Subhasish Chowdhary helpless in the Kochi goal.In the 40th minute, Malappuram extended their lead through Faslurahman. Gurjinder Kumar launched a long ball into the Kochi penalty area, which Manzi headed into Faslu's path. The 29-year-old forward slid onto the ball, deftly placing it beyond the goalkeeper's reach and into the back of the net.Despite a couple of attempts from Kerala Santosh Trophy captain Nijo Gilbert, Kochi's forwards were completely neutralised by Malappuram's resolute four-man defence. Brazilian midfielder Raphael Santos, who was once the favourite of ISL sides, was just a shadow of his former self, while Arjun Jayaraj was nowhere to be seen in the picture.Kochi's most promising scoring opportunity arose in the first minute of added-on time in the first half. Receiving a long ball from a free-kick, Tunisian midfielder Said Mohamed Nidhal attempted a header from a challenging angle. Although his effort was successfully thwarted by Malappuram goalkeeper Midhun V, the ball remained loose, falling to defender Dziri Omran. However, the Tunisian squandered the chance as his shot sailed wide off the target.","Malappuram FC beat Forca Kochi FC 2-0 in the opening match of Super League Kerala.

But Gokulam Kerala FC conquered the hurdles that came their way throughout the tournament as well as an experienced J&K Bank FC 4-0 in the final to lift the second edition of Climate Cup at Open Stadium here on Saturday.“It was a very difficult task playing here,” new Gokulam coach Antonio Rueda told TOI even as his victorious wards were very busy celebrating their achievement ahead of a new I-League season.“But the boys were impressive.”However, it was not even a closely-fought match unlike the semifinals when they had to struggle for a breakthrough in regulation and extra-time against a youthful 1 Ladakh FC team that gave their all even as the whole of Ladakh – at the venue or following the game online – hoped for a miracle.But on Saturday, the two-time I-League champions – in Ladakh with their first-team Indian players – showed their superiority as they controlled the summit clash from the word go. Player-of-the-tournament Mashoor Shereef found the net with a piledriver in the 23rd minute before an own goal by J&K Bank 11 minutes later took them to the break with a 2-0 lead.The script didn’t change after the change of ends as Thapuia earned them their third just a minute after restart and Vaseem Imamdar put one more into the net in the 87th minute as Gokulam sealed the game with a 4-0 margin for the hard-won trophy.“Playing here was difficult, but I think it is a good thing to win ahead of the pre-season,” said Mashoor. “This was a good experience and I hope we can carry it into the new season.”The dearth of oxygen makes it difficult for players unused to it to play their natural game for 90 minutes, something that the only Indian Super League team at the contest – NorthEast United FC – would vouch for.Coming to Ladakh with their U17 players and beaten by J&K Bank in the semifinals, NEUFC academy coach Suhel Nair, who coached them at Climate Cup, said, “Our boys are very young and enthusiastic and ran a lot more than they should have at this altitude. A couple of them also needed to be administered oxygen during or after the matches.”However, for 90% of them, it was the first time outside the northeast and was a great experience in a new terrain and interacting with a different culture,” he added.Indeed, the Climate Cup – with its wooden trophy in sync with the tournament’s ideology – did not just provide the most beautiful scenic backdrop to a football tournament in India but also brought teams from different parts of India, and Tibet, in contact with the hospitality of the Ladakhis and their unique culture.And the best example of that was witnessed after the presentation as Gokulam players danced with young Ladakhi boys and girls to the tunes of popular Indian songs as music and sports broke barriers and united people from two extreme ends of the country.","Gokulam Kerala FC beat J&K Bank FC 4-0 in the final of the Climate Cup.

Shortly after arriving on Merseyside, he was named captain, a position he would hold for eight more full seasons.The most enduring image of his playing days at Anfield likely occurred the next year, when Yeats ascended the Wembley steps to claim the FA Cup for the first time.Yeats appeared in 454 matches for Liverpool, with over 400 of those as captain.

In 1986, Yeats returned to the club as chief scout, a role he held for 20 years until his retirement in 2006.Reflecting on his greatest accomplishments at Anfield, Yeats once remarked, ""There have been two of them. Being the captain that took the club out of the Second Division after eight years was a very, very proud moment.""We won the league by eight or nine points that season and to follow that by being the first captain of Liverpool to lift the FA Cup is something I am very proud of.

The home team relied on long-range shots and managed to put only two on target in the first half, one of which resulted in Rodrygo's goal.Just before halftime, Ecuador almost equalized when Moises Caicedo’s shot was cleared off the line by Brazil’s Gabriel Magalhaes.

Each squad must include seven U-20 homegrown players and three U-23 local players, with a maximum of six foreign players per franchise and only four allowed on the field at a time.The head coach of each team must be a foreigner, while the assistant coach should be from Kerala.

NEW DELHI: Taylor Fritz has the opportunity to break a two-decade drought for American men's tennis when he faces world number one Jannik Sinner in the US Open final on Sunday.The 26-year-old believes his current form is ""good enough to win"" and end the 21-year wait for a male Grand Slam champion from the United States, with Andy Roddick being the last to achieve the feat at the US Open in 2003.Fritz's confidence is high, and he feels that his five-set semi-final victory over fellow American Frances Tiafoe on Friday, a match in which he was outplayed for significant periods, was a tougher test than the upcoming clash with Sinner.""I don't think that I'm going be put in a more stressful situation than I was against Frances,"" said Fritz, as quoted by AFP, the first American man in a Slam final since Roddick at Wimbledon in 2009.""I just feel good. I have a feeling I'm going to come out and play really well and win. When I play good tennis, I think that level is good enough to win.""Fritz, currently ranked 12th in the world, has taken full advantage of the unexpected early departures of Novak Djokovic , a four-time US Open champion, and Carlos Alcaraz, the 2022 winner. Their absence has created a significant opportunity for the remaining players in the tournament.Fritz secured his place in the semifinals by defeating Alexander Zverev, the fourth-ranked player and 2020 runner-up, in the quarter-finals. Prior to that, he overcame Casper Ruud, the eighth seed and 2022 finalist, in the round of 16.His upcoming opponent, Jannik Sinner, has made history by becoming the first Italian man to reach the US Open final. Fritz and Sinner have faced each other twice before, with their head-to-head record standing at 1-1.Fritz won their first meeting on the hard courts of Indian Wells in 2021 with Sinner gaining revenge at the same California desert venue two years later.""I've always played well against Jannik. He hits the ball big. He's like a very strong ball striker, but I feel like I always hit the ball really nice off his ball,"" explained the American, who had never got past the quarter-finals of a major before this US Open.Sinner claimed his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January and, despite controversy surrounding two failed drugs tests, has advanced to his second Slam final of 2024.He boasts a flawless record in finals this year, winning all five, with titles in Rotterdam, Halle, Miami, and Cincinnati, alongside his Melbourne victory.At 23 years old, he has accumulated 54 wins and only five losses this season. He is excited about not only facing Fritz but also performing before a lively crowd of 23,000 at the vast Arthur Ashe Stadium.""Being in America for sure, the crowd will be a little bit more on his side,"" said Sinner.""But it's normal. It's like when I play in Italy, so I'm going to accept that.""I have my team and my people who are close to me. In my mind, I know that there are many people watching from home from Italy, and it's just take some support from them.”One concern for the Italian is the condition of his left wrist, which he injured while breaking a fall during his semi-final win against Britain's Jack Draper.Sinner needed a medical timeout to address the injury but quickly reassured that it won’t be a problem on Sunday.""The physio loosened it up very fast on court and it went away by playing, which is good,"" explained Sinner.""Let's see how it is tomorrow when it's cold. It's going to be a different feeling. Hopefully it's nothing to be concerned about. I'm quite relaxed, because if it's something bad, you feel it straightaway a bit more.""Win or lose on Sunday, Fritz believes American men's tennis is on the brink of a new golden age as the country boasts five players in the top 20.""I think it gives hope and shows that we're knocking on the door of winning a Slam,"" Fritz said.""We're all moving in the right direction.

He partnered with Luca Pow and made the most out of the opportunity by reaching the final-four stages.""I had no pressure to win or lose as this was my first ATP tournament. The excitement level was high as I got the chance to play with top-level players. Although the result did not go my way (in singles), it was a good experience. I am happy to have used the opportunity given to me,"" Dhakshineswar told TOI from the USA.Dhakshineswar spoke on the support of the home fans and stressed the areas where he needs to improve. ""The home crowd backed us throughout the competition. My strengths are serving aces and playing the forehand. I am a tall payer and I used it (serve) to my advantage. While playing at the elite level, you need to narrow down on your mistakes which I couldn't as I committed several unforced errors. The opponents overpowered us at times which did not help our cause. I need to assess the match situation and see when I can get the better of them (opponents).""The Indian tennis fraternity had a torrid time during the Covid-19 pandemic as they could not compete in tournaments regularly. The rankings of several players dropped and they had to start from scratch again.

After completing my schooling, I tried to play professionally but due to the pandemic, I could not compete much. I thought of studying in the USA and playing simultaneously. I am now happy to be in college and play good tennis. Most of the players in my college compete in the Challenger series. I train alongside them and the level of tennis is high.""The coaches here have helped me a lot. More than the technique, the coaches help us with the tactical play. At this stage, everyone can serve, and play forehand and backhand shots. But the ones who play tactically well and are mentally strong emerge victorious. We focus more on these aspects in training.""Dhakshineswar will have to play in a lot of ITF tournaments to improve his rankings. He is currently ranked 985th in singles and 502nd in doubles. ""As I am currently in college, I have not planned where to play next. I am looking forward to competing in the ITF tournaments near my place but nothing has been confirmed yet. I will try to attain good results in the ITF tournaments and then when I reach the desired ranking, I will play in the Challenger series.""Before finishing my degree (in 2026), I want to get inside the top-200 as it will get easier for me to play in the Challengers regularly,"" Dakshineshwar added.",Dhakshineswar Suresh from Tamil Nadu gave a good account of himself in his maiden ATP Tour competition.
