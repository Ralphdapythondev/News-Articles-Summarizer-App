'We don't see Olympic medallists after one or two Olympics because..' Jaspal Rana criticises flaws in the system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/we-dont-see-olympic-medallists-after-one-or-two-olympics-because-jaspal-rana-criticises-flaws-in-the-system/articleshow/112602108.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jaspal Rana , the coach of double Olympic-medallist shooter Manu Bhaker , has criticized the national federation's inconsistent Olympic selection policy . Rana, a pistol legend himself with three Asiad gold medals in 2006, expressed his concerns during a visit to PTI headquarters with Bhaker on Friday, where they interacted with the editors.Rana pointed out that the federation's tendency to make last-minute changes to its policy has negatively impacted some of the most promising talents in the past.He warned that if the federation does not maintain consistency in its selection process, more young shooters will suffer in the future.Additionally, he questioned the federation's unwillingness to acknowledge or facilitate the presence of shooters' personal coaches at national camps and trials.""The (federation's) selection policy changes every six months. I met the sports minister and told him 'get the selection policy from the federation. Let them decide... whatever they decide, right or wrong, we are not discussing that, and then stick to it'. You will see the difference (in the performance of shooters),"" said the decorated marksman.Several promising shooters, including Saurabh Chaudhary , the sole finalist in the 10m air pistol event at the Tokyo Olympics, and Jitu Rai , an Asian Games gold medallist, have disappeared from the spotlight within a few years, despite being considered among the most promising candidates for Olympic success. Rana argued that the system let them down, along with many others.""Where is (pistol shooter) Saurabh Chaudhary, where is (Asian Games gold medallist pistol shooter) Jitu Rai? Does anybody talk about them? No. Are we talking about (10m air rifle shooter) Arjun Babuta, who finished fourth in Paris? He missed the medal by a fraction,"" the passionate 48-year-old questioned.Rana, who was reportedly asked to leave the Karni Singh ranges by the federation's High Performance Director Pierre Beauchamp during the Paris Olympics Selection Trials , emphasized that no one is considering how to help Babuta regain his position on the platform.Following two consecutive Olympic appearances without a medal in Tokyo, the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) revised its selection criteria in 2021, significantly reducing bonus points awarded to quota winners and reintroducing trials to determine the final squad after a considerable hiatus.Previously, the composition of the final squads was at the discretion of the NRAI, and quotas could be exchanged if the federation deemed a shooter inadequate. Names were determined based on the NRAI's own obscure evaluation of the shooters' performance leading up to the Games, causing stress even among the best performers.However, even with the introduction of trials, consistency was lacking, and the NRAI faced criticism for limiting the number of shooters who could compete for an Olympic spot to just the top five based on international and camp performances. This made it impossible to have a full field of eight shooters at the trials, which was widely mocked and criticized.Rana expressed that he was not opposed to change but would prefer more consistency throughout an Olympic cycle. He pointed out that currently, there is no system in place to safeguard Olympic and world medalists, and he lamented that Bhaker, despite winning two medals in Paris, will have to compete for a spot on the national team once she returns from a three-month hiatus.""All the Olympic medallists, we don't see them after one or two Olympics because there is no system by which we can protect them,"" he observed""The squad is selected from the Nationals. So, if she is not playing the Nationals, which she is not, then next year she will not get the facilities other shooters will get.

Shami is anticipated to participate in one of these games before heading to Australia for the major tour.Shami, 34, one of India's premier fast bowlers, last represented the national team in the ODI World Cup final against Australia in Ahmedabad on November 19 of the previous year.Since then, Shami has not played any competitive matches due to undergoing ankle surgery in the United Kingdom in February of this year, which ruled him out for at least six months.Although there are Instagram videos showing Shami beginning his Return To Play (RTP) routines at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru, where he has been bowling with a shortened run-up and at low intensity, there were reports suggesting he might be available for the Duleep Trophy.However, it has been determined that Shami is unlikely to be fit for the Duleep Trophy, and the selectors are cautious about rushing his return prematurely.The priority is to ensure that India's leading pace trio - Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, and Mohammed Siraj - are fully fit for the five-Test series in Australia.To date, Shami has taken 229 wickets in 64 Tests, including six five-wicket hauls and 12 four-wicket hauls.","Mohammed Shami is expected to return to competitive cricket after ankle surgery.

Trials will be held across 55 cities in five zones starting in October, with provisions for additional camps in cities not included in the initial list.Tendulkar highlighted the need to balance advantages between batsmen and bowlers in the league, which features unique rules like the ""50-50"" and awarding nine runs for specific shots.""If we are giving some advantage to the batsmen then the bowlers also need to get in the game,"" Tendulkar said.He emphasized that introducing reverse swing using taped tennis balls would test batsmen's technique, adding, ""During my playing days, I used to tape the ball up from one side. In season (leather) balls, we look for the shiny and the rough side and in the tennis ball, we would apply tape on one side and I used to practice reverse swing to face it in international cricket. I thought why not introduce it in this format and if this is implemented then the batter's technique will also be tested.""Initially, bowlers in the ISPL were unaccustomed to bowling with taped balls and generating reverse swing, leading to inconsistencies in line and length. Tendulkar addressed this by conducting workshops with coaches, noting, ""The first thing they needed to learn was to think about the release point and the place between point A and B - I'll call it A plus - you target that and the ball will undoubtedly go to the batter.""He stressed the significance of bowlers trusting their instincts and aiming for a specific spot rather than focusing solely on the batsman, especially when dealing with reverse swing. This adjustment, according to Tendulkar, was crucial for bowlers to regain control and utilize the taped ball effectively.","Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar introduces reverse swing to tennis-ball tournament.

Meanwhile, Bologna, who surprised everyone last season, settled for a 1-1 draw with Udinese.In the second half at the Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi, Verona's new signings Dailon Livramento and Daniel Mosquera found the back of the net, handing Conte a disastrous start to his league campaign with his new club.During a press conference on Saturday, Conte referred to this season as ""year zero"" following Napoli's disappointing 10th-place finish as defending champions in the previous campaign, which saw them cycle through three different coaches.The 55-year-old also cautioned fans against having high expectations while he awaits reinforcements and deals with the situation surrounding Victor Osimhen, the star of the 2023 title triumph, who has been sidelined for pushing for a transfer.Despite Napoli being the superior team in the first half, the injury to their key player Khvicha Kvaratskhelia just before halftime proved to be a turning point in the match.Kvaratskhelia's chance to break the deadlock was thwarted by a last-ditch tackle from Jackson Tchatchoua, and the Georgian star was subsequently injured by Pawel Dawidowicz.Napoli's attacking threat diminished in Kvaratskhelia's absence, and Verona capitalized four minutes into the second half when Livramento deftly converted Darko Lazovic's precise cross.Napoli nearly equalized on the hour mark when Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's powerful shot ricocheted off the crossbar.Mosquera, making his debut, sealed the victory for Verona 15 minutes later after a midfield scramble ended with the Colombian surging forward and calmly slotting the ball past Alex Meret. In stoppage time, Mosquera further compounded Napoli and Conte's misery by tapping in Lazovic's low pass, having been left completely unmarked.In their inaugural match under newly appointed coach Vincenzo Italiano, Bologna faced a setback as Lautaro Giannetti's header in the 68th minute secured a draw for Udinese.Giannetti, the Argentine player, found the back of the net just moments after Florian Thauvin's penalty was saved by Bologna's goalkeeper, Lukasz Skorupski. Bologna had taken a well-deserved lead in the 57th minute through Riccardo Orsolini's successful spot-kick.Despite the disappointing outcome, Bologna showcased the same energy and style of play that characterized their performance last season under Thiago Motta's leadership, which had led them to qualify for the modern Champions League for the first time in the club's history.The spotlight now shifts to the capital city, where rivals Roma and Lazio are set to commence their respective campaigns.

Rodrygo Goes had given Madrid an early lead, but the hosts equalized in the second half through Vedat Muriqi's powerful header.Madrid's star-studded side found it challenging to break down Mallorca's defence, with the home team coming close to securing a victory in the closing stages at Son Moix stadium.The match ended on a sour note for Los Blancos as defender Ferland Mendy was sent off in stoppage time for a high challenge on Muriqi.Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti fielded the same starting line-up that had triumphed over Atalanta in the UEFA Super Cup on Wednesday, with Jude Bellingham positioned in midfield behind the attacking trio of Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, and Rodrygo.Jagoba Arrasate, the newly appointed coach of Mallorca, faced a daunting task in his first match against the defending champions, who were further strengthened by the addition of Mbappe to their squad.Despite the odds stacked against them, Mallorca put up a valiant performance and managed to secure a well-deserved draw.Madrid, having suffered only a single defeat in their previous La Liga campaign en route to a dominant title victory, began the match with purpose. Their Brazilian attacking duo combined brilliantly to open the scoring, with Vinicius laying the ball off for Rodrygo, who bent a shot into the far corner, beyond the reach of Greif.Although Greif managed to parry another attempt from Rodrygo and Mbappe missed the target, Madrid maintained their pressure but failed to extend their lead.Arrasate instructed his team to remain focused until the interval, and they followed his orders, effectively neutralizing Real Madrid's star-studded lineup.Before halftime, Muriqi nearly scored for the home side, while the tenacious defender Pablo Maffeo received a yellow card for a rough tackle on Vinicius.Early in the second half, Mallorca equalized when the strong Kosovo striker Muriqi powerfully headed the ball into the net from Dani Rodriguez's corner kick.Greif made a low save from Mbappe at his near post, and Vinicius blasted the ball over the crossbar as Ancelotti's team tried to regain the lead.In an effort to create more attacking fluidity against Mallorca's deep-lying defence, Ancelotti substituted veteran midfielder Luka Modric, who will turn 39 in September, for defensive midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni.Mbappe had another chance, but Greif denied him once more, and Johan Mojica cleared the rebound to safety before Rodrygo could reach it.",Real Madrid held to 1-1 draw by Real Mallorca in La Liga opener.

Young talents Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson, along with recent acquisition Pedro Neto, spearheaded Chelsea's offensive efforts. However, their attempts were often disjointed and lacked the precision and potency of their opponents.Manchester City, in contrast, exuded control and tactical discipline across the pitch.

This fight is not just for Bengal, but for the entire country.""Bose continued: ""Together, we will fight so that no one dares to commit such a heinous act again. I'm a footballer, and the ground means everything to me. But if our mothers and sisters don't feel safe in our state or country, there is nothing more important than addressing that.""We all have to come together and fight for their safety. We must protect them and show them respect. I'm here as a common person, without any political affiliation.""The scheduled Durand Cup derby match between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal was cancelled by the administration due to security concerns.Commenting on the cancellation, ""No one would have been happier than me if the match had taken place. I always want to play in as many derbies as I can. But this was the government's decision, and they felt it was necessary.""However, the bigger cause is justice for RG Kar, and I will always stand for that,"" he said.Fans began to assemble around 4 pm in front of the VIP Gate of the Saltlake Stadium, where the match was supposed to take place. They were joined by supporters of Mohammedan Sporting.The atmosphere was unique as fans from rival clubs came together for a common cause. Scenes were unprecedented with some fans even being detained temporarily by the police before eventually being released.AIFF chief and former India goalkeeper Chaubey, who is also a BJP politician, strongly condemned the Trinamool Congress-led state administration.""It feels some kind of a riot is going on here. It's very shameful and it's a complete failure of law and order in West Bengal that a football match could not happen here,"" Chaubey said.""If half of the police force that is deployed to arrest the fans and stop the protest was there at the stadium, the match would have happened peacefully. ""Why should our teams go out to other places -- Jamshedpur, Shillong -- to play football? This is the mecca of Indian football, and football should happen here.""Football is beyond politics, religion or any colour. The match should not have been cancelled. If the fans are arrested, it's a shame for the state's law and order,"" he added.Chaubey joined the supporters in their efforts and pleaded with the police not to arrest any fans. Eventually, the detained fans were released.The quarterfinal fixtures for the 133rd Durand Cup were announced on Sunday.Bengaluru FC is set to play against Kerala Blasters in Kolkata. East Bengal will face their quarterfinal match in Shillong, while Mohun Bagan will compete against Punjab FC in Jamshedpur.
