Women's T20 WC to have 16 teams

COLOMBO: As was widely expected, the International Cricket Council ( ICC ), soon after the conclusion of its four-day Annual Conference here on Monday, announced that it had formed a three-member committee to ""review the delivery"" of the T20 World Cup which was co-hosted by the USA and the West Indies last month.The committee includes three directors-former New Zealand batsman Roger Twose , Lawson Naidoo and Imran Khwaja, who is the deputy chair of the ICC.""The ICC Board confirmed that there will be a review into the delivery of the ICC T20 World Cup,"" the ICC stated in a release soon after the conclusion of its Annual General Meeting (AGM).Reportedly, the ICC has incurred losses over $20m for conducting matches in New York, Florida and Dallas. Apparently, the tournament's expenses for the US leg overshot the allocated budget by a long margin, something that was pointed out by Pankaj Khimji of Oman.It was reported that the resignation of two ICC officials was related to the conduct of the World Cup, although a reliable source in the ICC has maintained that both Claire Furlong and Chris Tetley had made up their mind to quit last year itself but were asked to stay back for the Women's T20 World Cup (Furlong), and the Champions Trophy next year (Tetley).Meanwhile, TOI understands that there was no discussion on theICC Champions Trophy , to be held in Pakistan in 2025, or India's participation in the tournament.In what is certainly a big setback for cricket in the United States just a few days after their national team stunned everyone by beating Pakistan and making it to the T20 World Cup Super 8s, USA Cricket, along with Cricket Chile, has been formally put on notice and given 12 months to comply with ICC's Associate Membership criteria.Apparently, the USAC has been in breach of Associate Members Protocols on two counts - not having a fulltime CEO and not having recognition of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee.The ICC Board has approved an expansion of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup to 16 teams in 2030, aligning with its ongoing commitment to equity between the men's and women's games.The CEC approved the appointment of ex-Australian pacer Paul Reiffel to the Cricket Committee as the Elite Panel representative.","International Cricket Council forms three-member committee to ""review the delivery"" of the T20 World Cup.

Michael Vaughan believes this player can break Sachin Tendulkar's Test record for most runs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/michael-vaughan-believes-this-player-can-break-sachin-tendulkars-test-record-for-most-runs/articleshow/111929220.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former England captain Michael Vaughan has commended Joe Root for his exceptional batting skills, suggesting that Root has the potential to surpass Sachin Tendulkar 's record for the highest number of runs scored by a batter in the history of men's Test cricket Sachin Tendulkar's record of 15,921 Test runs stands as one of cricket's most formidable achievements.Over his 24-year career, Tendulkar displayed unparalleled skill, consistency, and longevity, cementing his status as the ""God of Cricket."" While greats like Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis , and Kumar Sangakkara have come close, Tendulkar's record remains unbroken.Former England captain Michael Vaughan has identified Joe Root as a potential successor to Tendulkar's record.

As the rock, Root is obviously key to that, and I love that he kept the reverse-scoop in the locker until he was past 100 and England’s lead was massive.""Against an attack like the West Indies in these conditions, you expect him to get a century. He missed out in the first innings but was so determined to put it right in the second. He was never going to make the same mistakes,"" wrote Vaughan in his column for The Telegraph.Root's sublime 122 against the West Indies at Trent Bridge, which included his strategic use of the reverse scoop, further reinforced Vaughan's belief.Root's consistency and ability to score under pressure have made him a pivotal figure in England's Test lineup. With 11,940 runs and 32 centuries to his name in Tests , he is on the verge of breaking several English records currently held by Alastair Cook , including most Test hundreds (33) and highest run-scorer (12,472).Root is also poised to become only the seventh batter in history to score 12,000 Test runs, having recently overtaken Brian Lara 's tally.While Vaughan's claim is bold, Root's recent form and career trajectory suggest he has the potential to challenge Tendulkar's record. However, surpassing such a monumental achievement will require sustained excellence over an extended period, akin to Tendulkar's remarkable longevity.","Sachin Tendulkar's record of 15,921 Test runs stands as one of cricket's most formidable achievements.

He made an immediate impact, taking two five-wicket hauls on spin-friendly pitches.However, Bashir faced challenges at the beginning of the English county season, finding himself behind the more experienced England spinner, Jack Leach , in the Somerset team. In an effort to gain more playing time, Bashir went on loan to Worcestershire .Despite these setbacks, England captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum maintained their confidence in Bashir's abilities, and their faith was rewarded with his outstanding performance at Trent Bridge.As Bashir continues to develop his skills, he remains committed to ""learning the tricks of the trade"" and establishing himself as a key player in the England squad.""A lot has happened in the last few years,"" AFP quoted Bashir as saying. ""I can't get ahead of Leachy at Somerset, understandably, he's obviously played a lot more cricket than I have.""Jack was over the moon for me (getting selected for England). We had a chat and he just told me to enjoy it. He's a class spinner and I've learned a lot from him. There's always so much to learn. I'm only 20, I'm still learning the tricks of the trade.""There's a lot to work on, in cricket you never complete the game. Going on loan was a decision I had to make to play cricket at a high level, that's part of the journey.""He added: ""I didn't have too many expectations going into this game, I'm still trying to comprehend what's happened.""Bashir's performance in Test cricket has been remarkable, capturing 24 wickets at an impressive average of 29.83 across five matches. This stands in stark contrast to his domestic first-class record, where he has claimed a relatively modest 16 wickets at an average of 70.68 in 10 appearances.However, the England selectors are not solely focused on statistics when it comes to evaluating Bashir's potential. The team management has recognized several key attributes that make him well-suited for international cricket.Bashir's height and ability to get drift, in addition to bowling an attacking line are the qualities that have caught the attention of the selectors.""Bowling spin in England is pretty tough, but I'm grateful I'm a 6ft 4in (1.93 metres) spinner because it's a nice attribute to have,"" he said.""The extra bounce helps. We saw it here (at Trent Bridge), if you land the ball in the right areas, a few will bounce and a few will skid on. I've got experienced guys in the team that help me make judgments on the pitch, what lines to bowl and what places to bowl.""I'm just grateful to be in the position I am.

I think that's to be welcomed,"" he added.While there is a perception that IPL owners , such as the billionaire Ambani family who own the Mumbai Indians, may only be interested in full control of a Hundred team, Gould stated that there is an opportunity for potential investors to acquire 100 percent ownership, depending on their financial capabilities and operational delivery expertise.The ECB's director of business operations, Vikram Banerjee, confirmed having met and spoken with IPL and Women's Premier League (WPL) owners multiple times.""I've now met and spoken to, a number of times, all the IPL owners and WPL (Women's Premier League) owners that don't overlap and there is interest there, from what they've told me, which is fantastic and lends into a very exciting process.

Marquez will then transition to the role of India’s head coach full-time. The duration of Marquez's contract was not specified by the AIFF.Marquez, a UEFA Pro License holder, will debut as India’s head coach at the Tri-Nation tournament in Vietnam in October, with Lebanon being the third team in the competition. Originally from Barcelona, Marquez has been coaching in India since 2020, managing two ISL clubs, Hyderabad FC and FC Goa.Marquez's tenure with Hyderabad FC (2020-23) culminated in an ISL Cup title in the 2021-22 season. For the 2023-24 season, he shifted to FC Goa, steering the team to a third-place finish in the ISL league standings. Prior to his career in India, Marquez held an extensive coaching career in Spain, including positions with La Liga side Las Palmas in 2017 and various lower division clubs such as Las Palmas B, Espanyol B, Badalona, Prat, and Europa.Before transitioning to coaching, Marquez played as a defender in several lower division Spanish teams, retiring professionally at the age of 28.","Former Indian football team head coach Igor Stimac cautioned his successor, Manolo Marquez, about the difficulties ahead.

I am absolutely delighted to have won it,” Venkatesh, a FIFA Level 1 (top-tier) referee, told TOI.“A lot of emphasis is being laid on minimizing the human errors and that is what I have been trying to do. Whichever referee makes the least mistakes is considered the best. That is the concept not only in India but also the rest of the world,” Venkatesh added.Venkatesh dedicated his award to assistant referee (linesman) and his “friend” P Vairamuthu, with whom he began his career in 2009. Venkatesh and Vairamuthu worked in tandem in some of the biggest matches of the Indian football season – the Indian Super League (ISL) Shield-deciding contest, ISL final and Super Cup title decider.“This award also belongs to Vairamuthu. My personal effort is not the only reason for me to win this award. I feel really comfortable on the field when Vairamuthu is part of my team; there is a lot of trust and belief.

There is good communication between us; we also speak the same language (Tamil),” Venkatesh said.Venkatesh was the AIFF’s first-choice for key fixtures. “Last season was pretty special for me. I am delighted to have gotten the opportunities. That is what we work hard for. For a long time, I did not get to officiate a final. I am very happy that I was part of three of the most important matches of the season,” said Venkatesh, adding that officiating big matches involving the Kolkata giants were a “huge challenge”.While Mohun Bagan Super Giant played in both the ISL Shield-deciding game and ISL final, East Bengal FC fought for the top prize in the Super Cup title clash.“When the Kolkata clubs play, it is always difficult. There are a number of factors, including the quality of teams and enormous size of the fan bases. As officials, we have to understand the feeling around such matches.

Panaji:

Manolo Marquez ’s coaching staff with the national team will comprise those who he has worked with in the past, except for Indian assistant Mahesh Gawli, already contracted with the All India Football Federation ( AIFF ).Manolo, 55, was named the head coach of the national team on Saturday and has now been asked to choose his coaching staff.According to sources, the Spanish coach – who will continue to be with FC Goa till the end of the season – will have Benito Montalvo as his assistant and Jose Carlos Barroso as the strength and conditioning coach, both working with Goa at the moment.Montalvo, a former Argentinean footballer, trained to become a coach in Barcelona and was head coach at the RCD Espanyol Academy Helsinki. He met Manolo during training camps in Finland and Sweden during the Covid-19 pandemic, and has been with him since his first season at Hyderabad FC in 2020.Barroso was part of Cesar Ferrando’s coaching staff at Jamshedpur and has extensive experience of working in India.The only new member of Manolo’s coaching staff, outside Goa, would be goalkeeper’s coach Marc Gamon , who worked for two seasons with the Spaniard at Hyderabad FC before taking up a job in Belgium.Manolo is already preparing for his first assignment with the national team in Sept and will most certainly skip the Bhausaheb Bandodkar Memorial Trophy where part of the dates clash with the international window.“The AIFF will confirm the teams for the Sept window in the next couple of days but most certainly the two opponents will be from Africa and Oceania,” said a senior official. “Since it’s already late in confirming the teams, they won’t be from the top 100. In fact, most certainly lower ranked than India.”The AIFF is expected to host the matches in Hyderabad.For the October window, India will travel to Vietnam for a friendly tri-nation series which also involves Lebanon. As per the latest FIFA rankings, Vietnam (116) and Lebanon (117) are placed ahead of India (124).“Manolo has to strike a balance between club and country commitments, but he’s taken up the job knowing he is ready for it. For the first few windows, there will be little time for preparations since the Indian Super League (ISL) will be in progress. He has to be ready for the challenge,” said the official.The experienced Spanish coach has trained teams at all levels, including grassroots, youth, third division, second division and the LaLiga with Las Palmas in 2017. He has taken up a national team job for the first time in his over two-decade long coaching career.","Manolo Marquez will have Benito Montalvo as his assistant and Jose Carlos Barroso as the strength and conditioning coach, both working with Goa at the moment.

Manolo Marquez to coach club and country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/manolo-marquez-to-coach-club-and-country/articleshow/111896728.cms,"Manolo Marquez is contracted with FC Goa till May 31, 2025

Panaji: The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has confirmed the appointment of Manolo Marquez as head coach of the national team, while allowing him to continue with FC Goa with whom he is contracted till May 31, 2025.The arrangement helps ease the financial burden on the AIFF, given the strain on its resources and the compensation battle with Igor Stimac.Despite two years left on his contract, the former India coach was sacked without notice and is now seeking the full value of approximately Rs 6 crore.Manolo, 55, arrived in India in 2020 as a replacement for Albert Roca, who quit Hyderabad FC to take up an offer with Barcelona as a fitness coach. The Spanish coach’s arrival saw him take the bottom-placed club to the top in just two years and he’s now been handed the India job, given his record in producing players for the national team.Players like Mohamed Yasir, Akash Mishra, Liston Colaco, Chinglesana Singh, Ashish Rai, Hitesh Sharma, Nikhil Poojary and Jay Gupta are some of the players who either made their debuts or made comebacks into the national team, with Marquez as club coach.“It's an honour for me to be the coach of India, a country I consider my second home,” Manolo said after his appointment on Saturday. “India and its people are something I feel attached to and I feel a part of since I first came to this beautiful country. I want to do my best to bring success to the millions of fans. I am very grateful to FC Goa for allowing us the flexibility to help the national team during the coming season while I am still the club’s head coach. I'm grateful to the AIFF for this opportunity and we hope to do great things for football.”Manolo is understood to have signed a three-year contract. While for the first year, he will work with Goa and the national team, he will take up full-time India duties from June next year. Should he take India to the Asian Cup, his contract will be automatically renewed.Besides Manolo, the executive committee also discussed Antonio Lopez Habas, the most successful coach in the Indian Super League . He won the ISL Shield with Mohun Bagan Super Giant last season, but at 67, and with health complications, his chances lessened.If AIFF were to appoint an Indian as coach, Sanjoy Sen and Santosh Kashyap were the shortlisted candidates.In the past, popular coaches like Sukhvinder Singh, PK Banerjee, Syed Nayeemuddin and Armando Colaco have all handled dual responsibilities. Manolo, though, will become the first foreign coach in India to work for the national team while still being employed with a club.Senior AIFF officials said India is not the first country to have a coach who will do both the jobs. Rinus Michels (Barcelona and Netherlands in 1974), Sir Alex Ferguson (Aberdeen and Scotland in 1985), Guus Hiddink (PSV Eindhoven and Australia in 2005-06; Russia and Chelsea in 2009), Dick Advocaat (AZ Alkmaar and Belgium in 2009) are some examples of big-name coaches handling dual responsibilities.The AIFF received 291 applications for the India coach job, following the dismissal of Stimac for his failure to take India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers. The applications were then trimmed to approximately 150 and from there 17 were asked if they still had interest in the job.Former World Cup-experienced coaches Philippe Troussier and Winfried Schaefer, besides former Real Madrid coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caro, were among those who made it to the final list. Foreign coaches with experience in India like Adrian Boothryod (Jamshedpur), Cesar Farias (NorthEast United) and Nelo Vingada (NEUFC/Kerala Blasters) also made the cut.“Given the financial situation of the AIFF, it was not possible to rope in high-profile coaches,” said another official. “Manolo is our best and safest bet. He has the experience of working in India and his record is impressive.”The experienced Spanish coach has trained teams at all levels, including grassroots, youth, third division, second division and the LaLiga with Las Palmas in 2017.Manolo’s first assignment will be in September with AIFF yet to confirm the opponents. In October, India will be up against Vietnam and Lebanon in an away tri-nation tournament, but the big test will be in March next year when the battle to qualify for the Asian Cup 2027 resumes.","Manolo Marquez has been appointed as the new coach of the India national team.

Third set I really caught a good rhythm and that energized me,"" Eubanks said, as quoted by AFP.""After I got that first hold in the third set I felt like myself again. I was enjoying it. I was really pleased with how I played and how I competed. Excited to get another win.""Eubanks, who claimed his maiden ATP title on the grass courts of Mallorca in June 2023, now progresses to the semi-finals on Saturday. His opponent will be determined by the outcome of the match between Australian qualifier Alex Bolt and the second seed from the United States, Marcos Giron.Prior to his impressive run in Newport, Eubanks, currently ranked 128th in the world, had a modest record of 6-15 in ATP matches this year.In the decisive tiebreaker, Vukic, known for his strong performance in such situations with an 8-1 record this year, committed a costly double fault, allowing Eubanks to take a 4-2 lead.Eubanks capitalized on this opportunity by hitting a forehand winner.

His significant drop in the rankings can be attributed to his prolonged absence from the tour, during which he underwent surgeries on his hip and wrist.","Chris Eubanks beat Aleksandar Vukic 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (7/3) in the ATP Hall of Fame Open quarter-finals on Friday.
