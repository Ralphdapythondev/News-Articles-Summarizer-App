One of India's greatest batsmen Virender Sehwag needs no introduction; but Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan made an impression, possibly sarcastically because of his latest criticism by the former India opener, that he didn't exactly identify who the journalist mentioned in his question.Bangladesh are all but through to the 'Super 8s' stage of the T20 World Cup having won two of their three matches in Group D, including a win over former champions Sri Lanka.On Thursday, the 'Bengal Tigers' defeated Netherlands, after which a video clip of Shakib at the post-match press conference went viral.Listening to a mediaperson's question on Sehwag criticising his batting, the Bangladesh captain stopped the journalist in between and asked ""Who?"", and the clip, which ends at that moment, went viral.Journalist: ""There has been a lot of discussion about your performance, especially a comment by Virender Sehwag that has received much attention...""Shakib: ""Who?""However, the veteran allrounder, who rediscovered his batting form with a stroke-filled 64 not out of 46 deliveries in Bangladesh's 25-run win over Netherlands, did go on to complete his reply.""A player doesn't play to answer (the critics). His job is to contribute to the team. If he is not able to do that, there will be a lot of talk. I think it's not such a bad thing,"" he said.Sehwag had criticised Shakib for his poor run in the first two matches against Sri Lanka and South Africa.""If he was included in the squad for experience, then we were not able to see it. At least spend some time at this wicket! It is not like you are Hayden or Gilchrist who can play a pull shot off a short ball, you are just a player from Bangladesh. Play according to your standards. When you are not able to play hook or pull, so just play the strokes that you know,"" Sehwag had said on Cricbuzz.","Bangladesh are all but through to the 'Super 8s' stage of the T20 World Cup.

NEW YORK: Indian cricket fans got everything they wanted from the New York leg of the World Cup. In the makeshift Nassau County Ground , which will be dismantled over the next few days, the Men in Blue played three games which offered completely different flavours.While Ireland was a standard walk in the park, the Pakistan game had all the highs and lows that you can expect from a top-of-the-chart encounter. The match against USA, meanwhile, was a battle of attrition in which India triumphed after enduring a few difficult phases.Amid all this, there was one note that went just a little off-tune: the form of Virat Kohli . The thousands who filled the stands on all three days had one common wish, a meaningful contribution from their favourite superstar.Low scores of 1, 4 and 0 in three consecutive games isn't something that we have seen too often from the modern master, who came into the World Cup on the back of some magnificent knocks in the IPL Kohli was a superhit as an opener in the IPL, prompting captainRohit Sharma to book that slot for him in the T20 World Cup. The captain was also very categorical when he said that his and Kohli's are the only two slots that are ""fixed"", while the rest will move up and down ""as per the situation"".But in the three games here, Virat seemed to be unsure where his off-stump is, a problem that has plagued him in the past, notably during India's 2014 tour of England, when he had aggregated 137 runs from four Tests. That, however, is now ancient history and Kohli subsequently was able to completely turn things around against the moving ball.The conditions here in New York have been quite unique. The ball has completely dominated the bat. It's not just the movement but also the up-and-down nature of the track that has kept batters on their toes.What could have gone against Kohli was the fact that he joined the team a little late. He missed the practice match against Bangladesh at the venue and went into the tournament slightly undercooked.But the champion batter has put in a lot of effort in the nets to get it all sorted out. Two days before the Pakistan game, he batted for almost two hours and everything seemed to be coming from the middle of the bat.""We know what Virat brings to the table and how good he can be. Yes, he joined a bit late, but he is putting in all the hard work to get used to the conditions,"" Rohit had said on the eve of the match against Pakistan.It is true that Virat has looked good at the nets, but that form somehow hasn't translated into performances in the World Cup so far. The worrying bit is that there is a serious rain threat in Miami - the venue of India's final league game against Canada - and there could be a case where all their practice sessions get washed out. There is a question mark on the game itself on Sunday and that could mean Kohli might not get too much time to work on his batting before the Super-8s start.The team, however, has enough belief in their No. 1 batter. Shivam Dube, who also endured a bit of a rough patch explained, said, ""Who am I to talk about Kohli? If he hasn't got runs in three games, he may well get three hundreds in the next three and there will be no more discussions.""Rohit, of course, has the option of bringing in Yashasvi Jaiswal in as his opening partner and drop Kohli down to his regular No. 3 spot. But the captain doesn't want to do that because he believes the former skipper is best suited at the top and the team will not be able to include four allrounders if Kohli comes down the order.It's the faith the team management has in Kohli that has stopped them from taking any harsh decisions. It's now on the batting great to flick on that switch which will once again make us believe in the clich√© that 'class is permanent'.","The batting superstar's poor run as opener is the only jarring note.

NEW YORK: From being a journeyman cricketer in Mumbai to becoming a coder for Oracle to now getting Virat Kohli out for a first-ball duck in a T20 World Cup , it has been a long and winding road for Saurabh Netravalkar .The left-arm pace bowler was the talking point of the World Cup after his match-winning Super Over against Pakistan. Now, just to prove he is no flash in the pan, Netravalkar has followed up that performance with the wickets of Kohli and ""old mate"" Rohit Sharma .It's a surreal turn of events for the 32-year-old who once nearly gave up on the game. ""It is difficult to explain that journey in a couple of sentences. It's been really very long. Back then, I had to take a practical call when I saw that my career as a cricketer in India wasn't really taking off because of the talent around. I got a chance to study in a reputed university here and it was a decision to pursue my other love, coding,"" Netravalkar said.Indian journalists, incidentally, chose to skip the media interaction with Man of the Match Arshdeep Singh just to have a conversation with this mild-natured boy who has seen difficult days in his life.Netravalkar is multi-talented. He plays the ukulele as well quite well, which he says he does for ""fun"". ""I see YouTube videos and try to get the tune right, it's just a hobby,"" the boy from Mumbai, who now works in Silicon Valley , said.""I am just happy that I can pursue both my passions. It is all happening very fast and I am in the process of digesting it. These last two games were really high-profile,"" he added, as references to his dismissal of Rohit and Kohli. ""It was an emotional moment to get Virat's wicket. I was looking to hit off-stump and it worked out well,"" he said.While Rohit and Suryakumar Yadav know him well and congratulated him on his performance, Virat, too, acknowledged his effort after the game got over.""I know Surya from my U-15, U-17 days, we were talking about our dressing-room banter. I didn't know Virat personally but he did congratulate me,"" Netravalkar said, exuding humility.India's bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, a Mumbai man himself, said the other day that Netravalkar is an ""inspiration"". ""If there is a seed of hope, keep watering it. The plant will happen, it may take time, but it's going to happen,"" Netravalkar said, getting slightly emotional with all the adulation.For USA, there is serious business up ahead with Ireland up next. The game is in Fort Lauderdale in Miami and if it gets washed out, the co-hosts will go through.""We are not thinking about the rain. Ireland are a good side and we have to beat them. If our performances help the sport grow here and become part of the school and college curriculum, we will know we are on the right track.""","Saurabh Netravalkar was the talking point of the World Cup after his match- winning Super Over against Pakistan.

The 25-year-old was subsequently dropped for the next match against India, which Pakistan lost by six runs.After the match, a video surfaced on social media showing Khan eating street food late at midnight in New York.Khan faced extensive trolling on social media platforms for his actions.Former Pakistan captain and Team Director Mohammad Hafeez criticised Khan on Friday, revealing some shocking details about him.Hafeez, appointed as Team Director in November last year, was sacked by the PCB just three months later following the team's embarrassing 3-0 Test series loss to Australia and a 4-1 T20I series defeat to New Zealand.During his tenure, Hafeez supported Khan in the New Zealand series, but the son of former Pakistan wicketkeeper Moin Khan failed to meet Hafeez's expectations.In a program on a local sports channel, Hafeez called Khan unprofessional and stated that the 25-year-old is not ready to play international cricket.""(On meeting Azam Khan for the first time) Azam Khan, if you want to play cricket for Pakistan, you need to do two things. First, you have to try your best to get physically fit, which is the requirement at the international level. Second, whenever you get an opportunity, you have to perform. I also want you to work hard on your wicket-keeping abilities because with your current fitness, you can't do fielding,"" Hazeez said while speaking to a local sports channel in Pakistan.""I connected Azam Khan with the incumbent Pakistan trainer and shared all the plans with him. Regardless of his body weight and body fat level, I told him that I don't care about that; all I cared about is that you needed to bring your fat level down and improve your running abilities. You need to increase your running abilities so that the team's balance doesn't get affected during the game,"" Hafeez said.""After allotting him a 6-week program, when Azam Khan appeared, he was still at the same body weight and body fat level as he was 6 weeks prior. His running ability was also twice as low as the rest of the team. If the rest of the team could cover 2 kilometers in 10 minutes, Azam Khan could only do it in 20 minutes. So, I went to talk to him and asked him why he didn't follow the plan and role given to him. He didn't have any answer, saying he tried his best but couldn't. This is unprofessionalism,"" the former Pakistan cricketer said.""Then, Azam Khan got another chance and played three matches. I found that this guy is not ready to play international cricket. I told him again that if you want to play for Pakistan, you need to show more commitment. But I didn't see that commitment in him. After three matches, I rested him and informed the selectors about my findings regarding him. Now, it's up to them to decide whether to play him in the future or not?,"" an angry Hafeez said.Khan has played 14 T20Is so far and scored just 88 runs at an average of 8.80.",Azam Khan was dismissed for a duck in his maiden T20 World Cup outing.

NEW YORK: Going into the game against USA, the form of Shivam Dube was a bit of a concern for the Indian team. He has been selected as a 'designated hitter' in the middle-overs but things were not falling in place for the lefthander. In fact, Dube's lean patch didn't actually start in the T20 World Cup either, but in the latter half of the IPL when he was playing for Chennai Super Kings He had a magnificent first phase which got him the ticket to the World Cup, but after that the performances tapered off. Dube, who scored 31 not out off 35 balls to help India cross the line against the USA, conceded that he was feeling the heat of a lean patch over the last one and a half months.""Yes, I was thinking about it, but there was no self-doubt. Here the conditions are such that I can't bat the way I bat for CSK . It demands a different way of batting and I was looking to do that,"" Dube said.There were phases in Wednesday's game when the left-hander struggled, but to his credit he didn't give his wicket away. It took him a while to hit his first six of the tournament, which went a long way in releasing the pressure. ""This long a wait to hit a six? It might have happened in Ranji Trophy , but not in IPL, but the pitch is really difficult here. The ball sometimes shoots up, sometimes keeps low, moves around. I'm sure you have never seen a pitch like this in a T20 World Cup before,"" Dube said.Range hitting is something that the man with long levers is used to doing, but that hasn't been the case for him here. In fact, even during training, it has been more about survival than hitting, which Dube concedes is ""a little difficult"".""But the coaches, support-staff told me that I have the ability to deal with this and I will definitely not delete this from my memory,"" the 30-year-old said.His 67-run partnership with Suryakumar Yadav finally helped India win beat the USA and the Mumbai cricketer said that the pair knew it all was about dealing with the difficult phase. ""We knew we could hit the big shots even on this pitch, if he could get settled. Thankfully it happened that way.""He might have liked to get a bit of bowling as well, given the fact that he is playing as the fourth allrounder. ""A six was hit off me and that's why I didn't get to bowl much, but that's fine,"" he said.Going forward, the indications are that the team will stick with him for a while and the left-hander has to keep doing what he did for CSK if India are to come close to winning the World Cup.","Shivam Dube scored 31 not out off 35 balls to help India cross the line against the USA.

The current position of the teams in Group A is as follows:

Here's a look at the scenarios in which Pakistan can grab the second spot in Group A and progress to 'Super 8s':

If USA beat Ireland

If Ireland beat USA

If USA vs Ireland is washed out

India vs Canada

If Pakistan beat Ireland

If Pakistan vs Ireland is washed out

While the Pakistan team continues to draw flak for its lackluster show at the ongoing T20 World Cup , there was some good news for them when neighbours India defeated USA in New York on Wednesday -- a result that favours Pakistan in their quest to qualify for the 'Super 8s' stage of the tournament.After consecutive defeats against USA and India at the start of their campaign, Pakistan's chances of advancing to the next round are no longer in their own hands, as they depend on favourable results in other matches in Group A.India's win over USA took Rohit Sharma & Co to the 'Super 8s', while the seven-wicket defeat for the the US team meant that their run-rate (+0.127) is now inferior to Pakistan's (+0.191), thanks to Babar Azam & Co's seven-wicket win over Canada.1. India - 3 matches, 6 points (NRR +1.137) - Qualified for 'Super 8s'2. USA - 3 matches, 4 points, (NRR +0.127)3. Pakistan - 3 matches, 2 points (NRR +0.191)4. Canada - 3 matches, 2 points (NRR -0.493)5. Ireland - 2 matches, 0 point (NRR -1.712)There are three matches left to be played in Group A, all in Florida , where a storm is brewing and threatens to disrupt and/or wash out out the matches.- USA vs Ireland (June 14)- India vs Canada (June 15)- Pakistan vs Ireland (June 16)A victory for the co-hosts over the Irish team will take them to six points, which will be enough to qualify for the 'Super 8s', along with India, as none of the other three teams can reach six points.In case Ireland manage to beat USA, it will keep them only mathematically alive because their NRR is the poorest among the four teams. However, Pakistan's spirits will improve further with that result as USA's net run-rate, which is already inferior to Pakistan's, will worsen and give Pakistan a chance to reach the 'Super 8s' by beating Ireland.The split points in the case of a washout or no-result will take USA to five points, which will be enough for them to advance to the 'Super 8s', rendering the remaining matches in the group meaningless.This game will be rendered inconsequential in case USA beat Ireland on June 14. But if the opposite happens in that match, Canada will have to upset India in order to tie with USA at four points. But they will have to stun the unbeaten Indian team by a substantial margin to make their negative NRR better than USA's, which seems highly unlikely. If India win, the Canadians will be eliminated.This result will be relevant only if USA lose to Ireland on June 14. If that doesn't transpire, the outcome in Pakistan vs Ireland game won't matter anymore. Pakistan will have their fingers crosed for Ireland's win over USA, because in that scenario, a win over Ireland will take Pakistan to No. 2 on the points table, edging out USA on NRR to make it to the 'Super 8s'.A win over USA will also mean that Ireland come into this match alive mathematically, but their progression is highly unlikely because their negative net run-rate is literally beyond repair and has virtually eliminated them from the race already.In the eventuality of points getting shared in this game, Pakistan will end up with 3 points, which will allow USA to go through to the 'Super 8s' even if they lose their last match against Ireland.","India's win over USA took Rohit Sharma & Co to the 'Super 8s', while the seven- wicket defeat for the the US team meant that their run-rate (+0.127) is now inferior to Pakistan's (-0.191) There are three matches left to be played in Group A, all in Florida where a storm is brewing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110963598,imgsize-77994,width-400,resizemode-4/110963598.jpg"

"PCB proposes February 19 start for Champions Trophy 2025, rejects hybrid model for India‚Äôs matches",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/pcb-proposes-february-19-start-for-champions-trophy-2025-rejects-hybrid-model-for-indias-matches/articleshow/110947791.cms,"(With IANS inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has put forward a proposal for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 to commence on February 19 and be hosted entirely in Pakistan. The PCB has firmly rejected the idea of a hybrid model for India's matches, similar to the arrangement made for the Asia Cup 2023.According to the PCB's proposed schedule, the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 will span from February 19 to March 9, 2025, with all matches taking place in three major Pakistani cities: Karachi, Rawalpindi, and Lahore .Sources within the PCB have revealed that International Cricket Council (ICC) officials, who recently visited Pakistan to assess the preparations for the tournament, have expressed their satisfaction with the arrangements in place.Notably, the PCB has taken a strong stance against the idea of a hybrid model, particularly for India's matches, insisting that all games should be played on Pakistani soil.This stance is likely to elicit a focused response from the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ), which had previously suggested a hybrid model where India's matches would be played at neutral venues outside of Pakistan, similar to the arrangement made during the Asia Cup 2023, when India's matches were relocated to Sri Lanka.However, Pakistan remains firm in its position, desiring all matches, including those involving India, to be played within its borders.‚ÄúWe have not opted for the hybrid model. However, we have given this leverage that India‚Äôs matches can be played in Lahore only. This way, the team will not be required to move around cities within Pakistan and its security can be well maintained in Lahore‚Äù, said a source in the PCB.‚ÄúIndia can be based in Lahore for the entire tournament. This would minimise logistical and security complications associated with their travel between cities‚Äù, the source added.The Indian team might find it more convenient and less challenging to participate in matches, as the special arrangement would allow them to play in a single city. This could potentially simplify their travel and logistical requirements throughout the tournament.‚ÄúThe proximity of Lahore to Wagah Border crossing is also going to be more suitable for the Indian fans. However, the question remains, if India would accept and participate in the event‚Äù, the PCB source said.According to the PCB's suggested itinerary for the Champions Trophy, Karachi will host a minimum of three matches, including the tournament opener and a semifinal.Lahore is set to stage at least seven matches, with the final being one of them. Rawalpindi will be the venue for no fewer than five matches, which includes a semifinal.It is worth noting that the Indian cricket team has not set foot in Pakistan since their participation in the 2008 Asia Cup. The decision regarding India's travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy will be made by the Indian government, which has been opposed to the cricket team crossing the border due to Pakistan's alleged involvement in supporting terrorism within India's borders.The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy will mark the first time Pakistan has been the sole host of a major international cricket event. In the past, Pakistan shared hosting duties with India and Sri Lanka for the 1996 Cricket World Cup, and prior to that, co-hosted the Reliance Cup alongside India in 1987.","The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has put forward a proposal for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 to commence on February 19 and be hosted entirely in Pakistan.

You ideally want a left-hand right-hand opening combination and while you have Jaiswal, that doesn't seem possible.""Additionally, Jaffer expressed his desire for India to adopt a more proactive approach in their power-play batting in the upcoming matches. He believes that a more aggressive strategy could benefit the team's performance.""You will need to be proactive in the powerplay. You will reach nowhere if you play cautiously on such pitches because the bowler knows he has to bowl on a spot and let the pitch do the rest. We have seen players like Rishabh Pant get rewarded for their bravery and that's the way you need to play with the powerplay restrictions.""With India's final Group A game against Canada scheduled for June 15 in Florida, Jaffer suggests that there might be an opportunity for Sanju Samson to bat at number four, provided they decide to leave out Shivam Dube, who contributed an unbeaten 31 off 35 balls in the seven-wicket victory over USA in New York.""There might be a case for Sanju Samson at No. 4. But then Shivam Dube has got just a couple of games and the team management will want to give him a longer run. Whether Samson will play, whether Jaiswal will play, these decisions are something that the team management will need to think about going forward,"" he concluded.","Former India cricketer Wasim Jaffer is confident that charismatic batsman Virat Kohli will showcase his true potential and brilliance in the crucial stages of the Men's T20 World Cup. This belief comes despite Kohli's underwhelming performance in the New York leg of India's campaign, where he scored a mere five runs in three innings. Jaffer dismissed the idea of Kohli moving back to the number three position.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110975952,imgsize-41310,width-400,resizemode-4/110975952.jpg"

If Ireland emerge victorious against the USA and Pakistan register a win in their concluding Group A match, Babar and Co. will enter the Super 8 phase of the T20 World Cup.For the co-hosts USA to progress, they require at least a point against Ireland.Should Pakistan falter and lose a point, the USA will secure their place in the Super 8 phase.Both matches are scheduled to take place in Lauderhill , and in the event of a washout in either game, the USA will automatically qualify for the Super 8 stage.",Brian Lara believes co-hosts USA will progress to the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup.

"Paris is going to be very, very special: Rohan Bopanna",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/paris-is-going-to-be-very-very-special-rohan-bopanna/articleshow/110976368.cms,"PUNE: It has been a hugely successful year for Rohan Bopanna , winning his maiden doubles Grand Slam at the Australian Open and becoming the World No. 1. And the India star says he is elated to be nominated to represent India at the Olympics for a third time in his career in Paris later this year.""This one feels really very, very special. Eight years ago I didn't even think I would play for India (at the Olympics) again. I missed Tokyo and I wasn't anywhere close to representing the country,"" Bopanna said on Thursday.The 44-year-old Karnataka lad will be pairing with Tamil Nadu's Sriram Balaji in Paris after the All India Tennis Association went along with Bopanna's choice of partner.Bopanna earned automatic qualification by virtue of his world No. 4 ranking -- the top 10 ranked players in men's and women's doubles are given direct acceptance and can choose a player ranked in the top-300 as their partner.Sumit Nagal, ranked 77 in singles as on Monday -- the ranking cut-off date for Olympics entries, is on the list of alternates.June 14 is the deadline for national federations to submit their nominations to the ITF, which will announce the final list on July 4.The tennis competition will be played at Roland Garros, where Bopanna had won the mixed doubles crown with Canada's Gabriela Dabrowski in 2017.He will be at his best in terms of form and mental space too, despite being the oldest player on the ATP Tour.""I have been playing very good tennis. Got into the top-10 in rankings and qualified for the Games, the only way I could do it. I have been able to do it twice (having done it in 2016 as well), really happy about it,"" he said.The past two editions when he competed in the quadrennial showpiece had been marred by controversies with AITA initially refusing to pair him with the partner of his choice before climbding down due to public backlash.This time, however, the selection committee headed by former Davis Cupper Nandan Bal, who had also nurtured Bopanna in his formative years, had respected his decision to pair with Balaji.""It is really great that AITA has supported me, and it is a very progressive way moving forward,"" the Bengaluru lad said.Looking ahead at the Paris Games, Bopanna said: ""I am feeling extremely positive, I have been playing some great tennis over the last 18 months and enjoying my time on court. And I want to be able to translate that positivity to my partner.""It is going to be a new experience, playing with someone who will be making his debut at the Olympics.""I played Balaji in his last match as well (in the third round of the French Open). He had a good match in Paris. The last time I played with him was in the Davis Cup in Bengaluru (against Uzbekistan in 2017).""Bopanna said that the good thing for Balaji would be that he would be playing the Olympics at a ""familiar"" venue but sought to play down expectations.""Balaji has an explosive game and has all the shots,"" he said before adding, ""Olympics will be a very different scenario. He had nothing to lose and played freely (during the French Open).""It is a great opportunity for him. Thankfully it is going to be at Roland Garros, a place he will be familiar with.""No matter what, they (rival teams) will be coming for him. It is going to be tough.""Bopanna will have his coach Balachandran Manikkath and physiotherapist Rebecca van Orshaegen in his corner at the Games.Balachandran has been a reputed coach in the Indian circuit for many years now. Besides working with Bopanna, he also heads the Bengaluru stalwart's academy located at 'Sport School'.He has also been a part of the Indian Davis Cup team's support staff on a couple of occasions.Currently, Balachandran is also assisting other Indian players who are part of the ""Doubles Dream of India"" programme -- an initiative by Pune-based tech firm KPIT to support top-200 ranked men's doubles players.Van Orshaegen is a 25-year-old Belgian who played tennis largely at the national level before moving onto sports physiotherapy. She started working with Bopanna a little more than a year ago and has played a key role in prolonging his career.""Balu has been working with Balaji too (as part of the 'Doubles Dream of India' project), and knows his game really well. I have seen him (Balachandran) for 25 years, having someone familiar on your side is always a good thing. Rebecca is the most important member of my team. I am 44 now, recovery is a key aspect of my game at this stage.""Bopanna and Balaji will look to play together in a couple of tournaments in the lead up to the Olympics.""We plan to play a couple of tournaments after Wimbledon, maybe Hamburg and Umag. There is really no time (to prepare) before that. Practising on grass for a tournament on clay doesn't make sense. After Wimbledon is the ideal time.""",Rohan Bopanna says he is elated to be nominated to represent India at the Olympics for a third time in his career in Paris later this year.

NEW DELHI: The All India Tennis Association ( AITA ) has officially announced that Rohan Bopanna will team up with N Sriram Balaji to represent India in the men's doubles competition at the upcoming Paris Olympics . This confirmation comes after reports from PTI suggesting that the 44-year-old Bopanna had chosen Balaji as his partner for his final attempt at securing an Olympic medal.

In a press release, AITA expressed their excitement, stating, ""The All India Tennis Association (AITA) is thrilled to announce that Rohan Bopanna and N. Sriram Balaji have qualified for the Paris Olympics 2024 in the tennis doubles event. Their journey to the Olympics marks a significant milestone for Indian tennis.""

The decision was reached during a selection committee meeting, presided over by Nandan Bal, a former Davis Cup Captain. Although Yuki Bhambri, India's second-ranked doubles player, was also considered, AITA sources revealed that Balaji's agility on the court ultimately tipped the scales in his favor.

Balachandran Manikkath, who is affiliated with Bopanna's Sports School in Bengaluru, will accompany the team as their coach, while Rebecca Van Orshaegen will serve as the physiotherapist.
