Just a day later, Vinesh faced a shocking disqualification for being 100 grams overweight before her scheduled women's 50kg freestyle final against the USA's Sarah Hildebrandt.The disqualification has since been a major topic of discussion, with the Indian sports fraternity and fans eagerly awaiting the verdict from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).CAS, which set up a special ad-hoc division for dispute resolution during the Olympics, accepted Vinesh's appeal against her disqualification on Friday. Having heard arguments from all parties involved, CAS is expected to deliver its final verdict on Tuesday, potentially overturning or upholding the disqualification.The Games officially concluded on Sunday with a grand ceremony at the Stade de France , the main venue for the track and field events.

Memories of a lifetime for Manu Bhaker and Reetika Hooda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/memories-of-a-lifetime-for-manu-bhaker-and-reetika-hooda/articleshow/112481404.cms,"PARIS: Manu Bhaker fuelled India’s hopes at the Olympic Games by bagging two bronze medals, so it was only fitting that the youngster came back from Delhi to carry the flag along with bronze winner and retiring hockey goalkeeper PR Sreejesh as the curtains came at the stroke of midnight here at the Stade de France.Manu, who won third place in women’s 10m air pistol and team events and narrowly missed another third place in the women’s 25 pistol final, enjoyed every moment of the three-hour long spectacle in front of more than 71,500 spectators, who filled the stands hours in advance for the program, that started with a musical performance followed by the entry of flagbearers from 205 delegations.Sreejesh and Manu walked in dressed in the official team colours with ‘India’ glittering in golden bold letters on the back as loud applause rang from the hundreds of Indians who had taken their seat for the closing ceremony. “It was an unforgettable moment and I’ll always cherish this day,” Bhaker said. The 22-year-old added that it was “such a great honour to carry the national flag”.Manu’s only disappointment was that she couldn’t capture some of the treasured moments on her mobile phone. “Manu lost her phone when she returned to Delhi. She put it in airplane mode and left it on her seat and forgot to take it with her after landing in Delhi. It was a big loss as it was the same phone that was gifted to her by the official sponsor at the Tokyo Games,” sources told TOI. “A complaint was lodged with the carrier and we searched in the lost-andfound items. But Manu’s mobile was not there,” sources added.Sreejesh, meanwhile, had no such problems and he was seen clicking away after they took turns to wave the national flag.Wrestler Reetika Hooda was among the lucky few in the Indian contingent who got to stay back to be part of the closing ceremony. “I felt very good to represent my country in front of such a large audience. It was a bitter sad moment for me as I missed out on a medal,” said Reetika, the first Indian wrestler to qualify in the women’s heavyweight category.For Reetika, the big moment was not to watch Hollywood star Tom Cruise take the Games flag to Los Angeles but to meet and greet Cuban wrestling legend Mijain Lopez. Lopez won his first gold at Beijing in 2008 and he retired here after winning his fifth straight gold in the men’s Greco Roman 130-kg category. “I’m not even a big fan of Bollywood, so Hollywood is very far,” she said with a smile. “But to meet and pose for a picture with Lopez sir was a priceless moment,” she told TOI.",Manu Bhaker and PR Sreejesh carry the national flag at the closing ceremony. Bhaker won two bronze medals in the women's 10m air pistol and team events.

Saha, who originally played for Bengal from 2007 to 2022, returned to the team with hopes of winning major domestic tournaments, following a public fallout with a Cricket Association of Bengal ( CAB ) official.Saha's switch to Tripura came after an official accused him of making excuses to skip Ranji Trophy matches in 2022.This dispute led him to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) to play for Tripura.""After playing for almost 15 years with the West Bengal cricket team, I played for the Tripura cricket team for two years.

You never know with Virat Kohli's fitness, you can see him competing for five years. He is probably the fittest guy in the team,"" Harbhajan told PTI Videos in an exclusive interview.""You ask any 19-year-old competing with Virat (on fitness). Virat will beat him. He is that fit.

NURSERY OF MEDALLISTS: Budding wrestlers train at the Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi on Saturday

""Ek mann mein tees thi

Yahan ki mitti mein kuch alag baat hai

It's 5 pm, dusk is settling in. Wrestlers from different age-groups are trickling in at the Chhatrasal Akhada for their evening training. They stay at the adjoining sports hostel. Coaches Jaibir Dahiya, Anil Mann and Pradeep Dahiya are waiting for them.Each one does the customary knee-touch of their gurus, before going for their warm-ups. The young boys are quite excited.There's a broad smile on each of them.A week ago, one among them had taken a flight to Paris. On Friday, he became an Olympic bronze medal winner for the country. No wonder, everyone at the wrestling academy on Saturday was talking about Aman Sehrawat. Chhatrasal Akhada isn't new to such highs.Three years ago, Chhatrasal trainees Ravi Dahiya (silver) and Bajrang Punia (bronze) won Olympic medals in Tokyo. India has eight Olympic medals in wrestling till now, 6 have come from Chhatrasal. It started with Sushil Kumar, who won bronze in 2008 Beijing & then followed with a silver in '12 London.Sushil Kumar, trained in this Chhatrasal Akhada, won bronze in 2008 Beijing and then followed with a silver in 2012 London. At the same London Games, Yogeshwar Dutt bagged a bronze for the country. It was Satpal Singh - also known as Guru Satpal among his wards - who is the founder of the academy and had trained the Sushil-Yogeshwar duo.Back in 1988, Satpal, along with two more wrestling coaches - Ramphal Mann, a.k.a. Guru Ramphal, and Pradeep Sharma - started the akhada on the premises ofChhatrasal Stadium in 1988. The stadium is in Model Town area of Delhi and is located somewhere between the Model Town and Azadpur metro stations. Over the years, the three coaches got help from another famed wrestling coach Virender Kumar in running the akhada.During his days as a wrestler, Satpal emerged as one of India's premier wrestlers, winning the national title 16 times. On the international stage, Satpal won silver at the 1974, 1978 and 1982 Commonwealth Games. At the Asian Games , he continuously upgraded the colour of his medal, winning bronze in Tehran 1974, silver in Bangkok 1978 and finally a gold in New Delhi 1982 in front of a home crowd. During this playing days, Satpal also represented India at two Olympic Games - Munich 1972 and Moscow 1980. But he failed to win a medal.(there was a pain in my heart of not winning an Olympic medal). That's why I started the akhada at the Chhatrasal Stadium. I wanted to churn out Olympic medallists for the country,"" Satpal tells TOI. ""Now we have produced not one, but six Olympic medallists.""When I went for the Olympics, I had never even seen a mat, practising on it was something totally different. The European countries, by that time, had been wrestling on mats for years. I wanted to change that. I wanted to give our young wrestlers an equal opportunity to fight at the international level. We got our first mat at the Chhatrasal Akhada in 1992. Sushil, who was a 15-year-old at that time, trained on the mat and won a gold at the World Cadet Games in 1998,"" Satpal, now 69, adds.There are budding wrestlers training at the Chhatrasal not only from Delhi, Haryana and its adjoining areas, but there are some who have come from as far as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. One of them, Dhanraj, who hails from Maharashtra, says, ""(There is something different here). That's why I have come here to train.""When you enter the premises of the akhada, there are giant-sized photos of Sushil, Ravi, Yogeshwar, Bajrang on the walls. The Chhatrasal Akhada is to wrestling what Sansarpur in Jalandhar, Punjab, is to hockey or what Azad Maidan in Mumbai is to cricket.The wrestling academy has now become a state-of-the-art facility where there is modernity in terms of equipment, but tradition is followed when it comes to the guru-shishya (master-pupil) relationship. There are many cadet-level, youth-level, and also senior-level wrestlers training at the same time, under the same roof, and their motivation is the same. ""I want to win an Olympic medal and make my country proud,"" says Mohit Dahiya, 15, who recently won at the Youth Asian championship level.""I want to emulate Sushil pehelwaan , Ravi pehelwaan, Aman pehelwaan. They are my heroes. I know if I train well and listen to my coach, then I can also win medals at the Olympic stage,"" adds 16-year-old Deepanshu. What makes the akhada so special? One of the present coaches, Jaibir Dahiya, who himself trained here in the 1990s under Satpal, Ramphal and Pradeep, says, ""When you train in the mud, you become really tough as a wrestler. That is where your foundation is made.""Training in mud helps budding wrestlers attain real strength. Movement in the mud is tough and therefore wrestlers need to use extra force. So, when they are put on the mat, they suddenly find themselves moving faster and are more agile. All because of the hours they put in mud,"" he adds. Nowadays, the akhada gets scores of applications. Many youngsters want to train under the coaches at the Chhatrasal. So how are the selections made?""It's trials. Only those who we think can have a future in wrestling are enrolled. Our training is very hard and rigorous, and we push the young ones to their limits. Our aim is to ensure medals for the country, that's why the preparation - right from a young age - is very robust,"" says Anil Mann, another coach, who used to be a trainee.There is a small temple outside the living quarters. Before their daily routine, wrestlers pray to Lord Hanuman - the favoured deity of the wrestling community - and ask for strength.Before we leave, coach Jaibir points towards five-six young wrestlers and says, ""These ones will win Olympic medals in future, I can guarantee you.""","Chhatrasal Akhada is a state-of-the-art facility where there is modern equipment in terms of equipment.

As curtains fell on Paris Olympics on Sunday, Indian fans were left with a mixed feeling over the country's performance. For a nation of 1.4bn people, our return of one silver and five bronze is very meagre. That the world's most populous country couldn't produce a single gold medal is hard to digest.However, if we look at India's showing in the past Summer Games, the Paris tally isn't too bad.Yes, we couldn't better our 2020 Tokyo haul of seven (one gold, two silver, four bronze) but we did much better than in Rio 2016, when our medal count was just two.The performance, especially in badminton, boxing and archery was disappointing, as medals were expected. Still, there is a flicker of hope -there were six fourth-place finishes. Besides, Vinesh Phogat 's disqualification meant India lost a gold or a silver.What may rankle is the fact that our elite athletes now get the facilities that they want - the best training, good exposure and medical support. While at the grassroots level, sport still craves for attention and support, the govt does make things easy for top athletes to train, prepare and perform.For preparing the contingent for Paris Olympics, the Union govt spent Rs 470 crore over the last three years. This is significantly more than what used to be the figure earlier.Looking at the break-up, the highest amount was spent on athletics (Rs 96.08 crore) followed by badminton (Rs 72.02 crore), boxing (Rs 60.93 crore) and shooting (Rs 60.42 crore). All 16 disciplines in which India participated in Paris got funds.But another number makes it look dismal - 84 countries won medals in Paris and India were placed at 71 in the table. Certainly, not flattering. Those who have a stake in Indian sport must feel the pinch.Abhinav Bindra , India's first individual Olympic gold medallist, called the Indian contingent's show 'commendable'. ""It's been a spirited performance. All our athletes have performed at a high level,"" he said.Encouraging words indeed. The problem is that while we improve, the world improves too. The powerhouse nations keep trying to get better and fringe countries keep producing surprise champions. The competition at this level is relentlessly high quality. The challenge is enormous.The likes of Manu Bhaker , Sarabjot Singh and Aman Sehrawat give optimism a youthful boost. More of their ilk are welcome.","India won one silver and five bronze at the Paris Olympics. 84 countries won medals in Paris, India at No. 71 in the table.

NEW DELHI: Among Indian athletes, badminton queen PV Sindhu was a prominent medal contender heading into the Paris Olympics. Having previously won a silver at the Rio Games and a bronze at the Tokyo Games, Sindhu was expected to secure a podium finish and become the first Indian athlete to win three individual Olympic medals.However, things didn’t go as planned.The 29-year-old shuttler reached the Round of 16 but was defeated by China’s He Bingjiao in straight games, 21-19, 21-14.Will Sindhu make a strong comeback at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028? She will be 33 when the Games commence.India’s 2012 London Olympics bronze medalist Saina Nehwal believes Sindhu’s future performance will largely depend on her fitness.""Sindhu played well. Bingjiao was a little better. It’s not just about the desire or the will to play; it’s about how your body will support you as you grow older. If your body supports you, you can play for as long as you want,"" Nehwal told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Sindhu and Nehwal are the only Indian badminton players to have won Olympic medals (one silver and two bronze).Lakshya Sen came close to securing a medal in Paris but lost a tough bronze medal match against Malaysia’s Lee Zii Jia.""Sindhu and I performed well for many years and did our best to popularise badminton in India. We definitely see more young boys (like Lakshya Sen) coming up and doing well. However, progress on the girls' side is taking some time, but I believe we will see more players emerging in the future who can achieve success,"" Nehwal said.Despite India’s six medals in Paris, falling short of the Tokyo Games' tally of seven, many athletes came agonizingly close to winning medals.Shooter Manu Bhaker finished fourth in 25m Pistol, Arjun Babuta was fourth in 10m Air Rifle, archers Dhiraj and Ankita finished fourth in the mixed team event, Anant Jeet and Maheshwari were fourth in the skeet mixed team event, Lakshya Sen lost the bronze medal match, and Mirabai Chanu also finished fourth in weightlifting.Nehwal described these fourth-place finishes as 'painful' but praised Manu for winning two medals at the Paris Games.""Missing out on a medal is definitely disappointing, but as athletes, it's our job to get back to training and look forward to the next Olympics. I know it’s painful because you prepare for four years, and sometimes luck isn’t on your side. It’s definitely tough, but we have to work hard and try again,"" Nehwal said.""I met Manu in January this year, and she was quite sure she would win a medal this time. She achieved that, so hats off to her confidence and preparation. I can only congratulate her on the medals and hope she can add one more to her tally in future Olympics,"" she said.Nehwal also supported providing medal-winning athletes with government/corporate jobs for financial stability and security.""Support from corporates through job opportunities helps sustain budding talent in their careers, so they don’t have to worry about making a living. I’m proud to be employed by BPCL, which has a history of nurturing talent and has inducted over 200 sportspersons across various disciplines,"" Nehwal said.On BPCL's support for sportspersons, a company spokesperson added, ""Consistent with BPCL's philosophy of nurturing and encouraging our country's sporting talent, we have taken on board over 200 sportspersons across various disciplines over the years. Our support helps build their confidence and serves as a springboard for their aspirations.""",Sindhu was expected to become first Indian athlete to win three individual Olympic medals.

As far as I'm concerned, I see the same qualities in him as a leader within this group,"" Uthappa told TimesofIndia.com in an interview.""He [Gambhir] will seek out major opportunities and strive to seize them. As a leader, I can vouch for his ability to create an environment that enables people to thrive. He is that kind of leader—more than just a great captain, he's also an excellent tactician and an exceptional leader of people. He fosters a culture within the group that encourages success. Gautam Gambhir is a leader who provides security to his players, and we have seen that in action,"" Uthappa said.India's next challenge is a series against Bangladesh, starting September 19.

"Indian players comfortable in ISL, must play abroad to grow: Manolo Marquez",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indian-players-comfortable-in-isl-must-play-abroad-to-grow-manolo-marquez/articleshow/112456005.cms,"In his more than two decade career, Manolo Marquez is coaching the national team for the first time

Panaji:

Manolo Marquez arrived in India as a replacement for Albert Roca at Hyderabad FC in 2020, replacing the Spanish coach who couldn’t resist the temptation of joining Barcelona as part of Ronald Koeman’s coaching staff.For two years during Covid-19, he was forced to live inside the bio-bubble. It was here that he got to know the Indian players , spending a lot of time with them, learning about their psyche, their families, cultures and traditions.Now, after four seasons in Indian football , the experienced Spaniard is the chief coach of the national team , and it is this thorough knowledge that is expected to give him a head start.“This is my fifth season in India and if you tell me five years ago that I will spend five years in India, maybe I would think that it was crazy,” Manolo said during his presentation in the Capital on Sunday. “After Spain (my home country), India is the country where I have spent the most years. From day one, I felt things are working in a good way for me (here).”It is India that has given him the job that he craved the most. After more than two decades of coaching where he trained almost every possible team – grassroots, youth, third division, second division, women and even LaLiga – Manolo finally takes charge of a national team. “I am very happy, it’s a dream for me to be the national team coach of India.”Manolo is doing the dual job of continuing to coach his club, FC Goa , and also national duties. “It’s about professionalism,” he told reporters when questions were asked, assuring everyone that “there won’t be any doubts.”His first assignment will be the tri-nation tournament in Hyderabad next month where he will field a team only after a couple of days’ training. The teams are still in pre-season. The bigger challenge, though, will be getting the best out of the Indian players, particularly with not making enough progress being made in the last five years.“In five years, the level of Indian players is better, but they could have improved faster. My feeling is that maybe some Indian players are very comfortable playing in ISL . I tell this to my players: you are very comfortable in India and will grow when you play abroad. I understand life is good for most of them here, and they are very comfortable. If Indian players play abroad, they will find strong opposition and their improvement will be faster,” said Manolo.The experienced coach who won the ISL trophy with Hyderabad in 2022 – after taking over a team at the bottom just two years ago – also felt domestic players should show more hunger to succeed with the national team, besides improving their mentality.“My feeling is that we are losing the spirit to play for the nation. You have to be angry, disappointed when you lose a game. We have to move in the same direction and play as a team. Sometimes a player thinks if he has a knock (injury), it’s better (not to join the national team camp).“We have to be stronger mentally. In football, technique is very important. Tactics are very important. Physical condition is very important, but if the head doesn't work, you can do nothing in life, not just football. If the mentality is correct, we will get good results,” said Manolo.","Manolo Marquez takes charge of India's national team for the first time. Spaniard has been coaching in India for four seasons.

The result leaves Mohun Bagan rooted in the mid-table with 12 points from 8 matches.East Bengal FC, Bhawanipore Club and Calcutta Customs are currently the top three teams with 19 points each and on track for advancing from Group B to the Super Six (championship round).Even if Deggie Cardozo's Mohun Bagan win their remaining four matches, their fate may not be in their hands.With their fifth win, George Telegraph under Gautam Ghosh kept their hopes alive with 15 points from 9 matches.Mohun Bagan came into the match looking for a hat-trick of wins following their demolition of Eastern Railway (5-0) and Tollygunge Agragami (5-1).Cardozo's boys went about achieving their target in earnest when referee Nripen Halder judged George defender Akash Mukherjee's attempted clearance to have touched his teammate Juwel Mazumder's hands, despite the latter's intense protest against the decision. From the resultant penalty, Serto Worneilen sent the goalkeeper the wrong way to give Bagan the lead in the 30th minute.However, Bagan were undone by their poor finishing as well as poor defending.On the first occasion, Bagan captain Sumit Rathi failed to check the run of Harsha Parui, whose cross saw Samaresh Das meet it with a powerful header at the other end. As the ball ricocheted off the first post, Ekka was nearby to drive it in.Three minutes later, it was Bagan goalkeeper Raja Barman who made a mess of a back-pass. Although he managed to block Abhishek Chakraborty's initial shot, Ekka's powerful left-footer off the return ball did the decisive damage. Bagan centre-back Raj Basfore claimed to have made a goalline save off Ekka's shot but the referee allowed the goal to stay, thus paving the way for George to complete a remarkable comeback.","George Telegraph rode a second-half brace from Amit Ekka to stun the green-and- maroon brigade 2-1.

Indian players must play abroad, even if it's in lower division

NEW DELHI: Manolo Marquez , the newly appointed head coach of the Indian football team , described his new role as a 'dream come true' but emphasized that in the future, the national team should ideally be managed by an Indian.The 55-year-old Spaniard's tenure, effective from last month, will span three years, during which he will fulfill a dual role as both the head coach of FC Goa and the national team.Marquez, who will manage FC Goa during the 2024-25 season alongside his national team responsibilities, will transition to exclusively coaching the Indian team from 2025.""Apart from Spain, India is the country where I have spent the most number of years. Long time ago, I thought I would like to be a national team head coach and I am here. It is a dream come true,"" Marquez said while addressing his first press conference after his appointment as India head coach.""In the future, the national team coach has to be an Indian because he (Indian) will know better how the country works, knows the people of different parts of India. So, this has to be the target of Indian football in the coming years,"" he added.Marquez has been active in Indian football since 2020, having spent three successful seasons with Hyderabad FC. He also had a notable season with FC Goa, achieving a third-place finish in the Indian Super League (ISL ) this year. His upcoming international assignments include the three-team Intercontinental Cup, to be held in Hyderabad from September 3 to 9, featuring Syria and Mauritius alongside India.Following the Intercontinental Cup, Marquez will lead the team in the VFF Tri-Nation Series in Vietnam from October 9 to 15, competing against Lebanon and hosts Vietnam. Both tournaments will take place during the FIFA international match window, and the national camp for the Intercontinental Cup is scheduled to commence on August 30 or 31.Addressing concerns about potential conflicts of interest while serving as both India head coach and FC Goa manager, Marquez stated that this situation, although unusual, is not unprecedented.""It's not a normal situation, no doubt, but it's not the first time and won't be the last time regarding this situation.""I checked, in international level, there were big names earlier in same situation and in India, I am told there were many (such cases) earlier.""National team plays when there is no ISL. You won't have any doubt that we will work very hard for the national team.""Having failed to make it to the third round of the joint 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 Asian Cup qualifiers under Stimac, India are yet to qualify for the continental showpiece. The team will have to play in the qualifying round of the 2027 Asian cup from March next year onwards.""The target is to improve the level of Indian football -- individually as players as well as a team. No doubt, that will not be immediate but will take time,"" said the experienced coach who has managed several lower division sides in the Spanish league.""Our target is to win every match, but the long term one is to qualify for the Asian Cup in 2027. We will get 6-7 games before the Asian Cup qualifiers,"" Marquez said.""So, these two upcoming tournaments (Intercontinental Cup and VFF Tri-Nation Series) are important so that we can be in good seeding during the draw (for the Asian Cup qualifiers) in December this year.""""The best players will have to play at the best level, against stronger opponents. That is how you grow as a player. That is why more Indian players should play in the ISL. That is why my advice to Indian players is to play abroad even if it is lower division leagues.""They will learn more and improve more (by playing abroad). But the Indian players are comfortable playing in the ISL, in India but I want them to play abroad,"" Marquez said, adding that Indian football has improved in the last five years but can improve further.Marquez also said he will pick I-League players for the national team, if they have the requisite level.Asked what is lacking in an Indian player as seen in his five-year association with the country at club level, he said, ""It's the mentality of the players, we need to improve on this. We have to develop that we can do something, we have to be stronger in mentality.""If the mentality is right, we will get good results. I am optimistic that Indian football will improve step by step and reach the desired place.""",Manolo Marquez is the new head coach of the Indian football team.
