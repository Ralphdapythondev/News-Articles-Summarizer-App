In 2021, Virat Kohli stepped down as India's T20I captain, which was soon followed by him vacating the position in the ODIs and Tests as well. He left the post without an ICC trophy under his leadership, but former off-spinner Harbhajan Singh believes that doesn't make Kohli a ""lesser captain"".Speaking to 'Sports Yaari' in an interview, Harbhajan said Team India is now reaping benefits of the fire that was lit by Kohli during his days as captain.""Kohli ki kaptaani mei chaahe aap World Cup nahi jeete (you may not have won a World Cup under Kohli's captaincy), but it doesn't make him a lesser captain or lesser player,"" said Harbhajan, one of the best spinners India has produced.Harbhajan went on to explain that Kohli instilled the belief of taking a challenge head on and to not go down without a fight. He cited the example of the third and fourth Tests during the 2020-21 tour Australia when India clinched the Border Gavaskar Trophy with a heroic finish.Kohli, however, had to leave the four-Test series after the first match for the birth of his child, handing over the mantle to Ajinkya Rahane.""Jo usne aag lagayi na team mei (the fire that he ignited in the team), like it may be a target of 400 in the fourth innings of a Test, we'll go for the chase, we won't' panic. If we go down, we do it while chasing,"" Harbhajan said.India entered the third Test in Sydney on that tour with the series locked at 1-1. Set a daunting target of 408 to chase in the fourth innings, India sent a scare down in the Aussie camp before ending up with 334 for 5. The match ended in a draw.""...it takes a lot of guts and brain, which Kohli has instilled in the team. So every person has left his legacy,"" said the 44-year-old Harbhajan, who now wears the hat of a commentator.He then mentioned the knocks played by Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant in the fourth Test at the Gabba, which India won by three wickets while chasing a target of over 300 to clinch the series.While Gill contributed 91 runs, Pant's iconic 89 not out took India to a famous victory.""That determination to fight till the end, which Shubman and Rishabh showed to win that Test in Gabba. It was because the way the team's thinking changed,"" Harbhajan concluded.","Virat Kohli stepped down as India's T20I captain in 2021.

India women resume quest for maiden ICC T20 World Cup trophy against New Zealand women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-womens-t20-world-cup/india-women-resume-quest-for-maiden-icc-t20-world-cup-trophy-against-new-zealand-women/articleshow/113923113.cms,"Image credit: BCCI Women

On Friday, the Indian women’s team will embark on their quest to claim their maiden ICC T20 World Cup trophy. India’s story at World Cups in the past has been one of unfulfilled potential and missed opportunities. Their closest brush with glory came in 2020 when they made it to the final, only to be outclassed by a formidable Australian team at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Aiming to emerge from the shadows of past disappointments, India will begin with Harmanpreet Kaur leading her team onto the field at the Dubai International Stadium against New Zealand in their opening Group A match. New Zealand Women have only won one of the 13 T20Is that they have played this year and India should be the runaway favourite.Harmanpreet, who has participated in every T20 World Cup since its inception, instills a sense of comfort and confidence to the squad. “Our expectation is clear: to bring glory to our country and to the loyal supporters who stand by us, no matter where we play. The team has a unified vision, and every individual has been empowered to prepare in a manner that will contribute to our success,” Harmanpreet said on the eve of their opener.The squad has a core group of seasoned players who are raring to go. At the forefront of India’s batting is Smriti Mandhana , whose elegant strokeplay and aggressive mindset have made her an asset. The explosive youngster Shafali Verma brings raw power and the ability to dismantle bowling attacks. Skipper Harmanpreet, Jemimah Rodrigues and Richa Ghosh are capable of turning a match on its head. D Hemalatha, who has been given many an opportunity, will be itching to prove her mettle too.Yet, it’s not just the batters who will be pivotal. The Indian bowling attack has depth and versatility, especially the spin department. The pitch in Dubai is normally batting friendly, but there could be some help for the bowlers. While India’s three-prong pace attack of Renuka Singh, Pooja Vastrakar and Arundhati Reddy is pretty formidable, the slowness of the pitch should keep the spinners in play.India have plenty of options in the spin department, which is led by off-spinner Deepti Sharma. With 131 wickets and an economy rate of 5.97, Deepti will be a proper threat for the Kiwi batters. She has the company of left-arm spinner Radha Yadav and the two can be handful in tandem.Despite their recent struggles, New Zealand is a team that is known to rise to the occasion. They are led by the seasoned Sophie Devine, who knows how to thrive in high-pressure situations.With battle-hardened campaigners like Suzie Bates and the dynamic Amelia Kerr, New Zealand boast of a well-rounded squad capable of matching India’s intensity. Their bowling attack, featuring the pace of Lea Tahuhu and the tactical acumen of Jess Kerr, will have to deal with the powerful Indian batting lineup.Devine knows that the road ahead will be long and arduous. “When you’ve got India and Australia, as well as Sri Lanka, it’s going to be a pretty tough pool to progress. But we certainly love our chances coming up against those sorts of teams. There hasn’t been too much cricket in the UAE, so it will be a real challenge for all the teams, but we are excited to play there,” said Devine.",The Indian women’s team will embark on their quest to claim their maiden ICC T20 World Cup trophy. India will begin with Harmanpreet Kaur leading her team onto the field at the Dubai International Stadium. New Zealand Women have only won one of the 13 T20Is that they have played this year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113923145,imgsize-131232,width-400,resizemode-4/113923145.jpg"

If you need to pick one player from the current Indian team who never loses his smile and sense of humour whatever be the situation, it has to be Rishabh Pant , who celebrates his 27th birthday on October 4.Most famous for his knock in the 2021 Brisbane Test, which ended Australia's dominance at the Gabba, the year 2024 has been a special one for the attacking wicketkeeper-batsman as he returned to international cricket after more than a year since his horrific car accident in December 2022.In the recently concluded home Test series against Bangladesh, which India swept 2-0, Pant made his Test comeback and announced it with his sixth Test century to join the legendary MS Dhoni for most Test hundreds by an Indian wicketkeeper.The ton positioned Pant as India's first-choice Test wicketkeeper-batsman once again, which will strengthen Rohit Shama & Co's defence of the Border Gavaskar Trophy later this year in Australia.The five-Test series commencing in the second half of November will bring back memories of Pant's 89 not out to script a memorable victory for India in Brisbane three years ago when the visitors chased a daunting 328 while playing with an understrength team.Talking about Pant's comeback this year, he marked his return to competitive cricket with the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he once again led Delhi Capitals. The Delhi franchise had picked Pant in the 2016 IPL auction.Pant's biggest moment in his new lease of life as a cricketer came in June this year when he was part of India's T20 World Cup triumph in the US and the Caribbean islands, where India defeated South Africa in a thrilling final to become the T20 champions once again after 17 years.The left-handed batsman from Delhi has so far played 35 Tests, 31 ODIs and 76 T20Is, scoring 2432, 871 and 1209 runs respectively.","Rishabh Pant celebrates his 27th birthday on October 4.

After Pakistan got the ICC Women's T20 World Cup off to a winning start on Thursday against Sri Lanka , it is time for a double header at the extravaganza in the UAE. South Africa, West Indies, India and New Zealand will be in contention today (4 October).The day begins with South Africa vs West Indies in Dubai in the sweltering afternoon heat followed by India against New Zealand in the evening.South Africa and the West Indies both suffered defeats in their warm-up matches leading up to the tournament, with South Africa's losses being particularly unexpected.They were bowled out for just 92 runs against New Zealand, resulting in an eight-wicket loss, and fell short of their 145-run target against India.In contrast, the West Indies lost to teams ranked significantly higher than them, first falling to India by 20 runs and then to Australia by 35 runs, struggling to chase down scores in the 140s on both occasions.South Africa finished as runners-up in the 2023 T20 World Cup and aim to maintain their momentum following a 2-1 series victory against Pakistan. Although they hold a 7-14 win-loss record against the West Indies, South Africa have triumphed in three of their last four T20 encounters with them.The West Indies also bring some positive momentum, having secured a 2-1 series victory in Sri Lanka, although that was back in June.South Africa might opt for a spin-heavy lineup, potentially including 18-year-old legspinner Seshnie Naidu along with allrounders Chloe Tryon and Sune Luus.The weather in Dubai is expected to be quite hot, with temperatures around 37°C at the time of the 1:30pm local time toss, remaining warm even after the match concludes.Laura Wolvaardt (capt), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder, Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta (wk), Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe TryonHayley Matthews (capt), Aaliyah Alleyne, Shamilia Connell, Deandra Dottin, Shemaine Campbelle (vice-capt, wk), Ashmini Munisar, Afy Fletcher, Stafanie Taylor, Chinelle Henry, Chedean Nation, Qiana Joseph, Zaida James, Karishma Ramharack, Mandy Mangru, Nerissa CraftonIndia secured victories in both their warm-up matches, winning by convincing margins of 20 runs against the West Indies and 28 runs against South Africa In contrast, New Zealand won one and lost the other warm-up game, defeating South Africa by eight wickets but going down to England by five wickets.Two players in the India squad, all-rounder Shreyanka Patil and wicketkeeper-batter Yastika Bhatia, are being monitored for fitness. Both participated in the warm-up matches, which is a positive sign for India. Head coach Amol Muzumdar confirmed on the eve of the match that captain Harmanpreet Kaur would bat at No. 3 , as she did in the warm-ups, although she has only batted in that position five times since 2019. The last occasion was against Ireland during the 2023 T20 World Cup when India’s opening partnership lasted 9.3 overs.Meanwhile, New Zealand enter the tournament after suffering ten consecutive losses in T20Is, including a 3-0 sweep by Australia. They will be eager to secure a win today to improve their chances of reaching the semi-finals.While India may have made a last-minute decision regarding their No. 3 batting position, New Zealand have opted to move their powerful captain, Sophie Devine, into the middle order, with Georgia Plimmer and Suzie Bates set to open.Both teams are anticipating significant dew during the evening match, making the toss crucial.

The respect looks quite visible when you play against Australia since we have beaten them for back-to-back series wins at their own backyard,"" Kohli further said.The all-important five-match series will begin at Perth followed by Adelaide (pink-ball game), Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney respectively.India's recent Test series win against Bangladesh consolidated their position at the top of the WTC standings with eight wins, two losses and a draw from 11 matches played for a collective 98 points.

(Photo by John Macdougall/AFP via Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: Batting legend Sachin Tendulkar 's performances against Pakistan are some of the most memorable moments in cricket history. His battles with Pakistan's fierce bowling attack, featuring legends like Wasim Akram Waqar Younis , and Shoaib Akhtar , have become iconic.Sachin Tendulkar 's innings in the 1999 Chennai Test at the MA Chidambaram Stadium against Pakistan is remembered as one of his most valiant and heartbreaking performances.This Test was part of Pakistan's tour of India in 1999, which also marked the resumption of bilateral series between the two countries after almost a decade. It was an emotionally charged series with high expectations from both sides.In the first innings, Tendulkar was dismissed for a duck by Saqlain Mushtaq as India posted a modest total of 254.In the second innings, with India chasing a target of 271 for victory, Tendulkar played a heroic knock.Tendulkar came in to bat with India in trouble at 6/2. The situation worsened as India lost more wickets, and they were reduced to 82/5.Battling against Pakistan's world-class bowling attack of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, and Saqlain Mushtaq, Tendulkar put together a crucial partnership with Nayan Mongia (52) to resurrect India's chances.Sachin batted with extreme patience, displaying a blend of defense and aggression, especially against Saqlain Mushtaq, who had dismissed him in the first innings. However, during his knock, Sachin was suffering from severe back spasms, making it even more remarkable.Tendulkar reached his century under immense pressure and brought India to within touching distance of victory. His 136 was a masterclass in handling pressure and tackling a quality attack on a deteriorating pitch.With India needing just 17 more runs to win, Sachin was dismissed by Saqlain Mushtaq, caught by Wasim Akram at mid-off trying to loft a delivery over the infield. His wicket turned the tide of the game.After Sachin's dismissal, India lost their last three wickets for just four runs, collapsing from 254/6 to 258 all out, falling short of the target by just 12 runs.In a viral video, former BCCI president the late Raj Singh Dungarpur, who played a key role in Tendulkar's early career and development and as chairman of selectors had selected Tendulkar for India's tour of Pakistan in 1989 he was just 16 years old, recalls what happened after the Chennai Test when Sachin didn't come to collect his Man of the Match award.Dungarpur says, ""I came down to the dressing room, I think it's fair for me to say he was weeping like a school boy. I kept on telling him, 'why are you taking the whole blame on yourself, by then we had lost the match. You made impossible possible by playing this great innings.' He said 'no sir, I have lost this match'.""Dungarpur continues, ""We were at the podium, I think very few times you get the Man of the Match on the losing side. He got the Man of the Match on the losing side. From the podium I signaled to Anshuman Gaekwad, the coach of the Indian team, and asked where is he (Tendulkar). He said 'not coming'. I think that's what commitment is all about.""Pakistan's win was hailed as one of their finest, and Saqlain Mushtaq's five-wicket haul in the second innings, including the crucial wicket of Tendulkar, was instrumental. Tendulkar was left devastated after the match, sitting alone in the dressing room for hours after the game ended.Despite the heartbreaking defeat, Sachin Tendulkar's 136 is considered one of his greatest innings. He single-handedly brought India to the brink of victory, battling both the opposition and his own physical pain.Tendulkar's decision to play through severe back pain showcased his dedication and fighting spirit and this knock cemented Tendulkar's reputation as a master of tough situations and a cricketer who could take on the best bowling attacks under immense pressure.Though India lost the match, Tendulkar's effort remains legendary, demonstrating his resilience and class in one of the most dramatic Test matches between India and Pakistan.","Sachin Tendulkar's innings in the 1999 Chennai Test against Pakistan is remembered as one of his most valiant and heartbreaking performances.

SHARJAH: Pakistan staged a determined fightback to beat Sri Lanka by 31 runs in their opening game of the Women's T20 World Cup campaign in Sharjah on Thursday.Left-arm spinner Sadia Iqbal claimed three wickets with Nashra Sandhu , Omaima Sohail and Fatima Sana all taking two each for Pakistan as Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka fell comfortably short of their target of 117.Pakistan needed a crucial lower-order knock from their captain Sana to post a competitive total, having slumped to 84-8 after winning the toss and choosing to bat.Sugandika Kumari had both Pakistan openers caught behind off her left-arm spin and the wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals.Sohail made 18 and Nida Dar added 23 but Pakistan looked in danger of failing to reach 100 as Sri Lanka skipper Chamari Athapaththu picked up three wickets with her off-spin.Athapaththu finished with 3-18 and Kumari took 3-19 but Sana's 30 off 20 balls, featuring three fours and a six, frustrated Sri Lanka and proved a match-winning contribution.She was eventually dismissed by left-arm seamer Udeshika Prabodhani, who ended with 3-20.Pakistan lost opening bowler Diana Baig to a calf strain after just one ball of the Sri Lanka innings, but her replacement Sana picked up the vital wicket of Athapaththu -- caught at extra cover for six.Sohail bowled Harshitha Samarawickrama and Hasini Perera cheaply, but while Vishmi Gunaratne remained at the crease there was hope for Sri Lanka.Kavisha Dilhari holed out to long-on off Sandhu while trying to increase the run rate to leave Sri Lanka reeling at 47-4 in the 11th over.Nilakshika Silva earned a reprieve when she was trapped lbw from a delivery called a dead ball after Sandhu's towel fell out of her pocket.But Gunaratne perished for 20 three balls later as she was caught just inside the boundary attempting to hit Sandhu straight down the ground.Silva departed for 22 in the penultimate over after a top edge to short fine leg.Neither team has ever made it out of the group stage in eight previous attempts at the T20 World Cup.Pakistan face arch-rivals India in their next game on Sunday, while Sri Lanka take on tournament favourites Australia who are bidding for a seventh title in nine editions.",Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by 31 runs in their opening game of the Women's T20 World Cup in Sharjah.

NEW DELHI: The Indian women's team will begin its 2024 T20 World Cup campaign against New Zealand at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday and head coach Amol Muzumdar has said that captain Harmanpreet Kaur will be batting at the no.3 slot throughout the tournament.Jemimah Rodrigues, who usually bats at three, has been moved to number five, prompting India to experiment with Yastika Bhatia, Dayalan Hemalatha, Sajeevan Sajana and Uma Chetry at that slot.Harmanpreet however took the no.3 position in the warm-up wins against the West Indies and South Africa and will continue in that role.“Absolutely, not just the warm-up games, but we had already decided back in India and in the camps that happened before we set off from Mumbai. We had a lovely camp in Bangalore, and we decided there. Basically, these pre-World Cup matches absolutely stamped that for us. Go through the scorecard, you'll find out,” said Muzumdar in the pre-match press conference.Harmanpreet, capable of delivering useful off-spin, hasn’t bowled in T20 matches for some time.Muzumdar discussed the lack of a sixth bowling option for India, stating, “We've paid a lot of attention to the sixth bowling option. Also, for a fact that we have had multiple discussions within our top six, at least three to four have to bowl. If we can get those overs out of them, then nothing like it.”“All of them could bowl. So, it's just a question of applying and just putting in those hard yards in the nets and then converting that into a match performance. So, Harman hasn't bowled, but she bowled in the second T20 warm-ups, and is experienced enough to bowl those overs.”Muzumdar emphasized improvements in the team’s fitness and fielding, areas he has focused on since taking charge. “Basically, if you see in the first press conference, I had said that fielding and fitness would be of prime importance. We have worked upon it, thoroughly gone deeper into it, and tried to absolutely work individually.”“First in regards to the volume as far as fielding is concerned, and then in fitness, we have paid attention to each individual to take their fitness levels to the next level. So, I think we have put in that effort. The effort has been there. I think you will definitely see the results.”As the team embarks on its first T20 World Cup since the advent of the Women’s Premier League (WPL), the tournament has produced more statistics and breakout stars. New talents like Sajeevan Sajana, Shreyanka Patil, and Asha Sobhana are part of the Indian squad for the tournament.Muzumdar also acknowledged the significance of the WPL in shaping the current team.“WPL has been a very successful tournament so far in the last couple of editions. You have seen what response WPL has had. Obviously, the stats have helped and we have dug into a lot of statistics and we have seen the results.”“Some of the players that have come into the Indian squad here at the World Cup, are a product of WPL as well. Of course, not undermining the first-class cricket as well back home, but WPL has given us a strong base to find players.”“That's actually a good headache to have. We do have a lot of talent in the team, talent in this 15 and beyond as well. So, as I said, good headache to have. But me, Harman, Smriti, we enjoy that kind of stuff where we try out different combinations, and then finally we have figured out the right combination that we are going to play tomorrow.”“Whoever has got an opportunity, they have performed at their own numbers, whether it is batting number or, bowling, they have performed really well and that's why they are there in the team. So we found the right combination I guess.”","Harmanpreet Kaur will be batting at the no.3 slot throughout the tournament. Jemimah Rodrigues, who usually bats at three, has been moved to number five.

LUCKNOW: Run-machine Sarfaraz Khan had made a promise to his Mumbai teammates and his family after his younger brother Musheer was ruled out of the Irani Cup match against Rest of India , following a road accident: score a double hundred .Known to amass big scores, Sarfaraz kept his word with a magnificent knock of 222 to guide Mumbai to a mammoth 537 all out on the third day of their match, even as Musheer was recovering from the accident he suffered while travelling to the city for the game along with his father Naushad Khan ""Yes, it has been an emotional week for me. I had promised my family and teammates that if I am set, I will score 200 - a hundred for me and hundred for my brother (Musheer),"" Sarfaraz told reporters at the end of day's play.""If he (Musheer) had played in the match, abbu (father) would have been prouder. Unfortunately, he met with an accident. So, I thought I must somehow score a double ton in this match.""Sarfaraz, 26, said he has spoken to his brother who is seven years younger to the man who is once again knocking on the national selectors' doors.""Yeah, I spoke with him. He is fine but will take two-three months to recover,"" said Sarfaraz, who struck a half-century against England in the Dharamsala Test in March.Sarfaraz became the first player to score an Irani Cup double hundred for Mumbai.His 15th first-class centurywill certainly dispel all doubts about his slot as a reserve middle-order batter for the remainder of the Test season (8 games).Asked about his penchant for making big scores, Sarfaraz said, ""I'm known to play big knocks. I feel good doing things I'm known for. Mumbai also needed me to bat long,"" he said.""It's a big opportunity for us to win the Irani Cup after a long time. Back of the mind, I thought of playing as long as possible, putting as many runs on the board as possible which will help the team win,"" Sarfaraz added.The Ekana Stadium track had underlying moisture on the second day and the dampness contributed to the ball seaming around initially and the extra bounce made it challenging for batters.Sarfaraz's driving on the off-side was regal and there is nothing more to add to his footwork against spinners. He was brutal, especially against left-arm spinner Manav Suthar (0/137 in 37 overs), who looked clueless.After a certain point, he employed the negative leg-stump line and Sarfaraz would either slightly go inside out or bent down on one knee to slog sweep it for maximums.Speaking further about his monumental effort, he said, ""I have played in the Irani Cup earlier and scored a century for the Rest of India. But this is a very emotional innings for me as I'm playing for my home team. I am putting an extra effort so that Mumbai can lift the Cup.""If you look at it, weather was obviously a challenge. We are up against some of best players in India right now,"" he said.""Most of them have played international cricket. I was looking to make runs against them. It was an opportunity to give my best. I am satisfied with the time I spent in the middle.""The whole bunch has put in lot of effort to reach the Irani Cup by winning the Ranji Trophy last season. It's not like our team can't win this tournament). In fact, we are one of the best teams in India. So, we hope to do well and win it.""","Sarfaraz Khan scored 222 to guide Mumbai to a mammoth 537 all out against Rest of India. His brother Musheer was ruled out of the Irani Cup match following a road accident.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan great Zaheer Abbas on Thursday cited focus on T20 cricket and the influx of money as key reasons for the decline of Pakistan cricket .At a cricket conclave, Abbas shared his concerns over the current state of cricket in Pakistan. ""There's too much T20 cricket being played in Pakistan, and because of that, our players have forgotten the essence of Test cricket.This is why we're not performing well in the longer format,"" news agency ANI quoted Abbas as saying.The growing popularity of T20 cricket has created an imbalance between formats. Abbas, who once elevated Pakistan cricket to great heights, expressed his disappointment with the modern players' focus on financial gains.""So much money has come into cricket that the players today are only focused on making money, and their attention is diverted from the game itself,"" he remarked.According to Abbas, the shift towards financial priorities is a key reason why Pakistan has struggled to maintain its dominance in international cricket, especially in Test matches.The former Pakistan captain strongly critiqued the leadership within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). ""It is the misfortune of Pakistan cricket that those who run it do not understand cricket,"" he said, expressing frustration with cricket administration in the country.""We took Pakistan cricket to great heights. The world admired our cricket. But today, those in charge are only concerned with their own interests, not with cricket or the players.""Abbas also spoke the upcoming 2025 ICC Champions Trophy , which is set to take place in Pakistan, calling for smooth cricketing relations between India and Pakistan.""The Indian team is a great ambassador of cricket. If they come and play in Pakistan, it will take cricket forward in our country.""The strained relations between India and Pakistan have affected their cricketing ties, with no bilateral series taking place for several years.Abbas called for renewed engagement, which could help revive cricket in Pakistan.The legend also shared a memorable and humorous incident from a Test match against India in 1978, where he faced an unexpected bowler in Sunil Gavaskar.""When I saw Gavaskar coming to bowl, I thought it would be tough for me. I wasn't taking him seriously,"" Abbas chuckled. However, his light-hearted approach cost him dearly. ""I played a shot, it went in the air, and I was caught,"" he said.The moment marked Gavaskar's only wicket in Test cricket, a fact the Indian great would later fondly recall. ""Gavaskar said he'll always be proud of the fact that his first and only Test wicket was that of Zaheer Abbas,"" Abbas shared with a smile.","Former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas spoke at a cricket conclave in New Delhi.

India then scored 285/9 decl. quickly and managed to take two Bangladesh wickets late on the penultimate day. On the final day, India bowled out Bangladesh for 146 and then chased down 95 for an brisk win.""I actually do (If India will play same cricket in Australia).

It was not about 'How many runs I score', it is about finding enough time to bowl Bangladesh out. They played a great brand of cricket, but it was all about giving them enough time.

NEW DELHI: Legendary Indian footballer Bhaichung Bhutia on Thursday made a strong call for strengthening the game at the age-group level, saying without that it was virtually impossible for the senior national team to make an impact at the international level.Bhutia, who has played more than 100 games for India and scored 42 international goals, also asked the All India Football Federation ( AIFF ), state associations, I-League and ISL clubs to start working at the grassroots for the development of the next generation of players.""In India, if the (senior) national football team has to do well, I think our U17, U19 and U20 teams have to start qualifying for the Asia Cups and World Cups on merit basis. Until and unless you don't do that, it becomes very difficult for the national team to give you great and big result.""That's where we can start dreaming for our national team to start doing well,"" said the India great while announcing a partnership between his academy, Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools (BBFS) and Premier League side Southampton Football Club, aimed at developing the grassroots coaching system.""If you look at the results especially for the age group tournaments, we have not been performing great. Today, U20 players are losing to Bangladesh, not qualifying for the Asia Cup. We can't expect miracles from the senior team. We need to really work at the ground level. The important thing for the AIFF is to bring as many kids as possible to play.""As part of the agreement, which will initially be for three years, BBFS will be the international academy partner of The Saints, which will enable them to get access to Southampton FC's academy performance plan, including coaching, tactics and strategy from U6 to U16 levels.The agreement also covers building player experiences through programmes like staff visits, customised camps and tournaments in England as well as in India.Bhutia added that the two major leagues in the country -- ISL and I-League -- too will have to do more to build a big pool of young players to bring the country's football up to European standards.""We'll also have to make sure that every state, club, I-League and ISL invest big time in grassroots honestly because we still need that setup what a lot of European leagues are doing... investing in young talent and making it an asset, benefiting the players, and the national team,"" he added.Southampton legend Matt Le Tissier, who spent his entire professional club career with The Saints, becoming the first midfielder to score 100 goals in the Premier League, said that the best way to improve a country's football was to invest in its coaches.Southampton FC's coaching philosophy and best practices in youth development can now be integrated into the training programs at BBFS, ensuring that aspiring Indian footballers and coaches are equipped with the skills and the mindset necessary to succeed in the world's most popular sport, said Matt, 55, who is the second-highest scorer for Southampton behind Mick Channon.""Nobody develops footballing talent better than The Saints. I have been there all my life and I can tell you that they have the most committed academy coaches and support staff which have produced some of the best players in England.""","Legendary Indian footballer Bhaichung Bhutia makes a strong call for strengthening the game at the age-group level.

MUMBAI: Former captain Sunil Chhetri on Thursday termed centre back Anwar Ali an ""asset"" for Indian football while urging players across the spectrum to stay away from controversies as much as possible.Anwar was handed a four-month ban by All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) in early September with the governing body holding the player ""guilty"" of terminating his contract with Mohun Bagan in an unjust manner and signing a new deal with East Bengal, having returned to his parent club Delhi FC.AIFF also sought a compensation amounting to Rs 12.90 crore from Delhi FC and East Bengal.""I do not know the nitty-gritty of the thing. I don't know exactly what happened. Just purely on Anwar, because I love him and he knows it, he's one of the assets of the national team. I would want him to stay away from controversies as much as possible,"" Chhetri told PTI in an exclusive interview.However, AIFF's Player Status Committee issued him a No Objection Certificate following a directive by the Delhi High Court, allowing Anwar to play for Mohun Bagan.""He knows it. I've called him and I've told him. All the boys in the national team, they know it. All the national team boys, especially the ones who are upcoming and young. I want them to stay away from controversies as much as possible,"" he said.""I don't know how much possible was it for him (to avoid the controversy). But I hope going forward, all the prospects of the national team stay away from these things,"" Chhetri, who was named the brand ambassador of Utkarsh Small Finance Bank here, said.Chhetri, who retired in June this year from international football, said he is still coming to terms with his decision.""Why are you asking me difficult questions, man? It's not been nice, I miss it,"" he said when asked about his life away from the international arena.""I've got six players from the national team at my club. They come back and tell me stories and I don't like it. I've told them, 'shut up, it's going to take time, I'm not cool with it yet'.""""The day I am, I'll speak to them properly and you too. But for now, don't remind me that I'm not a player of the national team,"" he said.Chhetri, 40, backed India head coach Manolo Marquez to excel in his dual role with the national team as well as with FC Goa.""It is challenging, but we know what Manolo has done in the last couple of years. The good thing is the windows, the one that is left. One is the Vietnam window and then one is the March window,"" he said.""He'll be able to handle it. Also, the plus point, the pro, (because) the cons we talked about. The pros is that he will know the players. He's watching every game in the ISL because he has to. That really works. He will know exactly what team to pick,"" he said.Chhetri said he has enjoyed sharing days of fatherhood with his good friend Virat Kohli, but added that retirement was something neither of them has brought up in their discussions.""We talk a lot about what's happening now. We talk a lot about different things that sports provide us,"" he said.""We talk a lot about kids, that's a common topic now. A lot of diapers, a lot of fun stuff, a lot of crawling. But we haven't talked yet about post retirement stuff, to be very honest.""""We talk a lot, but the talks are more about the kids right now and the present scenario, not about what's going to happen after retirement,"" he added.Chhetri said he will continue to play in the Indian Super League as long as he can add value to his club Bengaluru FC.""As long as they can have me, as long as I can add value to the club, as long as I'm happy. The day I think I am not adding any value, the day I think the club doesn't need me, I'll be gone. As simple as that.""We had a great start for the season. We're at the top right now with 10 points. I don't have a date that I can give you, but as long as I'm enjoying, as long as I'm adding value to the club, I'm here,"" he said.","Sunil Chhetri calls Anwar Ali an ""asset"" for Indian football.

What is the case?

How this could change

football transfers

?

Is there precedent of football transfers industry being affected?

Who is Lassana Diarra?

Football's player transfer system will be in the spotlight and could even be massively overhauled on Friday when the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) announces its verdict on former France player Lassana Diarra 's case against governing body FIFA .The international transfer system, which processes hundreds of millions of dollars each year in player transfers and has existed in its current form since 2001, is overseen by FIFA.Diarra has challenged that status quo by claiming in a Belgian court in 2017 that FIFA's transfer rules had blocked him from moving to a new club after his contract was terminated by Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow.After Lokomotiv Moscow terminated his contract in 2014, Diarra tried to sign with Belgian club Charleroi. But that attempt proved futile as FIFA refused to issue an International Transfer Certificate (ITC).FIFA's regulations state that if a player breaks his contract, which is then terminated by a club, his new team is jointly liable, alongside the player, to pay compensation to his old team.As FIFA refused to give him the necessary documentation to begin life in Belgium's fifth-largest city, there was further setback for 'Lass'. Diarra was ordered to pay 10 million Euros by FIFA's Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) in 2015.Because the former Chelsea , Arsenal and Real Madrid midfielder was without a club at the time, it was ruled that any future employer would not be liable to pay compensation.In 2015, Diarra joined Olympique de Marseille in the French league with further stints at Al-Jazira (in the UAE) and Paris Saint-Germain (in France).Even though the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected Diarra's appeal against FIFA's ruling, the player sued FIFA and the Royal Belgian Football Association in a Belgian court for damages and six million euros in loss of earnings.The Belgian court has asked the CJEU for guidance, with the European Court's decision expected on October 4.Early signs don't look good for FIFA. Advocate General Maciej Szpunar suggested to the judges that they should side with the player.""Some FIFA rules on transfer of players may prove to be contrary to EU law. These rules are of restrictive nature and may only be justified in specific circumstances,"" he wrote in a non-binding opinion.His lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont said this year that a judgment in favour of the footballer would be a milestone in modernising football governance in the European Union as it would allow players' unions and clubs' unions to regulate their employment practices.""This will put an end to the degrading practice of commoditising players,"" lawyers Dupont and Martin Hissel said in a joint statement in April.However, since moving out of the EU block since Brexit, how this affects English Premier League (EPL), the biggest spenders in the world, remains to be seen. It won't be a surprise if a new FIFA ruling is announced that would apply to all member countries.Dupont had famously represented Jean-Marc Bosman in 1995 which created the transfer window and market that we know today. The Belgian midfielder wished to join USL Dunkerque in France for free in 1990 after his contract expired at Belgian side RFC Liege.But RFC Liege demanded a fee of around 500,000 pounds - Bosman's estimated value then - from the French club, refusing to let the player go despite his contract not being renewed.Dunkerque refused to budge, leading to Liege cutting Bosman's fee by 75 per cent - a move that triggered the landmark court case of Bosman vs Liege, UEFA and the Belgian Football Association.The case lasted five years and came out in favour of the player, giving birth to the term 'free transfer' - one that saw Kylian Mbappe join Real Madrid from PSG in the summer.The case, popularly named the ' Bosman ruling ', saw the CJEU mandate that players were free to move when their contracts had expired, and that European clubs could hire any number of European Union players.Diarra is a former French midfielder who played for multiple high-profile clubs - Chelsea, Arsenal, Portsmouth and Real Madrid before bowing out at PSG.He won 13 trophies throughout his career - winning league titles in England, France and Spain with domestic cups to boot. The 39-year-old played his last game in October 2018.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) will announce its verdict on former France player Lassana Diarra's case against governing body FIFA.

TIEBREAK UPSET

BEIJING: Carlos Alcaraz rallied from a set down and held his nerve in a deciding tiebreak to beat defending champion Jannik Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) in the China Open final on Wednesday and win his fourth title of the season.French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz, who won both of his previous meetings with Sinner this year, recovered from a slow start to wrap up victory in three hours, 21 minutes and improve his head-to-head record with the Italian to 6-4.While the stage might not have been as grand as it was in some of their recent encounters, Sinner and Alcaraz pushed each other to the limit in the latest chapter of the burgeoning rivalry that has taken the ATP Tour by storm.""He could have won in two, I could have won in two, it was a really close match. Jannik once again showed that he's the best player in the world, with the level that he's playing,"" Alcaraz, 21, said.""It is unbelievable, it's a really high quality of tennis , physically, mentally, he's a beast.""I had my chances in the first set but didn't make it, but in general I'm proud of myself. The way that I dealt with the match, the way that I managed everything. For me, it was a really good match.""After both players defended break points in a cagey start, Alcaraz seized the early break for a 3-1 lead when Sinner's backhand went wide, before consolidating the advantage in the next as his Italian opponent netted a shot.World number one Sinner, whose last win over Alcaraz came in the semi-finals of this tournament last year, gradually found his range to level at 5-5 and save two set points in the tiebreak to clinch the first set.Alcaraz was on the ropes early in the second set and Sinner pushed him hard in a 15-minute game, but the second seed successfully held serve for 4-4.Sinner's failure to break in the lengthy game appeared to take the wind out of his sails, as Alcaraz sped through the next two games to level the match at a set apiece.The Spaniard cranked up the intensity on his forehand and broke for a 2-1 lead in the third set, but with victory seemingly in sight, he suffered a lapse in concentration and allowed Sinner to level at 4-4.In the deciding tiebreak, Sinner snatched control to take a 3-0 lead, but some excellent work at the net helped Alcaraz edge a couple of rallies and go ahead 4-3, before finally clinching the title with an emphatic cross-court forehand winner.The tiebreak defeat was uncharacteristic for Sinner, who had won 18 out of his past 19 tiebreaks.Asked if Sinner's record had caused him any doubt, Alcaraz said: ""I never lost hope, but honestly, I know that stat. Every time that Jannik plays (a tiebreak), it goes to his side.""I'm not going to lie, at 3-0 down and with two mini breaks for him, I thought, 'Okay, I have to give everything that I have just to try to give myself the opportunity to be close'.""I played great points just to make it 3-3 and after that, I just thought 'go for it'. If I lost it, at least I went for it.""The result denied Australian Open and U.S. Open champion Sinner becoming the first man to retain the crown at the China National Tennis Centre since Novak Djokovic won four straight titles between 2012-15.",Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) in the China Open final. The Spaniard rallies from a set down to win his fourth title of the season. Sinner had won 18 out of his past 19 tiebreaks.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113879853,imgsize-61044,width-400,resizemode-4/113879853.jpg"

Shades of Kylian Mbappe

BEIJING: Jannik Sinner ignored the bubbling controversy over his steroid case and a roaring home crowd to set up a China Open final against Carlos Alcaraz on Tuesday.The world number one and defending champion defeated the 96th-ranked Chinese wildcard Bu Yunchaokete 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to avoid a major upset.The Italian faces Spanish second seed Alcaraz, who was in fine form in a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev in the other semi-final.In front of a packed house on China's national day, US Open champion Sinner was facing a player he had never met before and who was competing in the biggest match of his life.China's 22-year-old Bu was also in the form of his life, having similarly reached the semi-finals last week in Hangzhou.Bu had Sinner under pressure on the Italian's serve early in the first set, but Sinner staved off the threat and the storm gradually blew itself out as the set wore on.They went to the tie break in the second set, with Sinner serving an ace to convert his third match point after just over two hours.Nobody has won more matches on tour this season than Sinner, 23, who failed two doping tests in March but was cleared of wrongdoing and allowed to keep playing.Tennis authorities accepted Sinner's explanation that trace amounts of a banned steroid unintentionally entered his system from a physiotherapist who used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy.The World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) reignited the case on Saturday, saying it had appealed the decision and is seeking a ban of up to two years.Sinner has admitted to having sleepless nights over the issue.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz reached his first final in the Chinese capital and is in ominous form, yet to drop a set.""I think I played really well. Obviously if I want to beat Daniil, I have to play really good tennis, high-quality tennis,"" said Alcaraz, who is chasing a 16th ATP Tour title -- which would equal Sinner.""I felt great on the court once again, so I'm really happy about it. I think I couldn't ask for a better semi-final.""The final is on Wednesday.In the women's draw, 595th-ranked home hope Zhang Shuai -- one of the storylines of the tournament -- rolled into the quarter-finals to make more history.Her 6-4, 6-2 victory over Magdalena Frech was her fourth win in Beijing and all in straight sets -- having come into the event after losing 24 singles matches in a row.The barren run lasting more than 600 days was the second-longest on the WTA Tour in the Open Era, which began in 1968.The 35-year-old Zhang, a former two-time Grand Slam quarter-finalist who has been plagued by injury, said she had come close to quitting singles tennis before coming to Beijing.""I had no idea how to win and I didn't want to lose another, especially with all the Chinese fans,"" she said.""Walking back to the locker room, I didn't know if I should continue or not before this tournament.""The former top-25 player will face Spain's 19th-ranked Paula Badosa in the last eight.Zhang is the lowest-ranked player to reach this stage of the China Open and struck a defiant pose -- a tribute to Kylian Mbappe -- after beating 31st-ranked Frech.Former world number two Badosa dumped out US Open finalist Jessica Pegula 6-4, 6-0 to make the second-seeded American the biggest casualty so far.","Jannik Sinner beats 96th-ranked Chinese wildcard Bu Yunchaokete 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) Italian faces Spanish second seed Carlos Alcaraz in the other semi-final.

It was Pegula's first win against the 39th-ranked Kudermetova in three attempts.Pegula will play the 15th-seeded Paula Badosa in the fourth round after the Spaniard beat Rebecca Sramkova 7-5, 7-5.Poland's Magdalena Frech, seeded 23rd, overcame a disastrous start to rally to a three-set win over 12th-seeded Diana Shnaider 0-6, 6-3, 6-4 and next faces the 595th-ranked wildcard Zhang Shuai , who beat Greet Minnen of Belgium 6-2, 6-3.In the men's draw, local favorite Bu Yunchaokete upset Paris Olympics bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti 6-2, 6-4 for the 22-year-old's first victory against a top 20-player.The 96th-ranked Bu will next play either fifth-seeded Andrey Rublev or Alejando Davidovich Fokina.Seventh-seeded Karen Khachanov made 15 fewer winners and four more unforced errors than Argentine Francisco Cerundolo, but found a way to win the big points in a 7-6 (4), 7-6 (9) victory to take him through to the quarterfinals and a matchup against Alcaraz.Alcaraz needs to make at least the semifinals this week to rise above Alexander Zverev to No. 2 in the rankings.
