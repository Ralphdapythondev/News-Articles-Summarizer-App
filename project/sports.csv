While Rashid remained unbeaten on 24 off 11 balls, Tewatia also played a little cameo (an 11-ball 22) to guide GT to a tense three-wicket victory.There was pindrop silence in the stadium when Rashid whacked Avesh Khan over cover for a boundary when Gujarat needed two off the last ball.Needing 15 off the final over, Rashid Khan hit Avesh for a four and then ran two on the second ball to inch closer to the target. A sharp edge missed the outstretched hands of Sanju Samson as GT needed just 5 off 3. The drama continued as Tewatia was run out on the fifth ball by a smart fielding by Jos Buttler.In pursuit of a daunting target of 197, GT were off to a steady start. Openers Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan put on 64 for the opening wicket in eight overs. However, the introduction of Kuldeep Sen in the ninth over turned the match on its head.The 27-year-old struck thrice in his first two overs to derail the GT innings. The tall Madhya Pradesh pacer first trapped Sudharsan (35 off 29 balls) in front and then returned in his second over to strike a double blow. He cleaned up Matthew Wade (4) and Abhinav Manohar (1) in a span of just three deliveries to reduce GT to 79/3.For the addition of just 15 runs, the GT top-order were cooling their heels in the dug-out. Although Vijay Shankar (16 off 10 balls) and Gill tried hard to resurrect the innings for a brief period, Yuzvendra Chahal castled the former to make matters worse for last year’s runners-up team.Gill’s 72 off 44 balls kept the interest alive for the packed crowd. Despite the departure of their skipper, Tewatia and Rashid fought hard till the end and snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.Earlier, the in-form Riyan Parag and Sanju Samson scored breezy half-centuries. Barring the Powerplay, it was one-way traffic as the home team dominated the GT attack.The Samson-Riyan duo not only overcame early jitters but also steadied the innings with their fearless approach. Put in to bat by GT skipper Gill, RR did not get off to a flying start.

Doull: ""Nobody said a word. I would love to see the bowler give a reaction (makes animated gestures).""

Vaughan: ""You could see that he wanted to. He went for it and then he thought - Oh, it is MS Dhoni.""

NEW DELHI: In a recent Indian Premier League ( IPL ) match between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), fans witnessed an unusual moment involving the legendary Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Despite CSK ultimately securing victory by 7 wickets, the spotlight was on Dhoni for dropping an easy catch of West Indian marauder Andre Russell .The incident sparked a flurry of reactions among fans and pundits, as such occurrences are rare for someone of Dhoni's calibre, known for his exceptional skills behind the stumps.However, even the best can have off moments, and this instance served as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of cricket.The incident happened in the eighth ball of the 18th over, Mustafizur Rahman executed a deceptive slower delivery aimed at Andre Russell, managing to elicit an edge from the KKR all-rounder. Despite the skillful execution, Dhoni, positioned behind the stumps, failed to secure the catch, attempting it with just one hand.The incident left the jam-packed crowd at Chepauk in disbelief, with both Mustafizur and CSK skipperRuturaj Gaikwad , who was fielding near the boundary line, momentarily stunned by the missed opportunity. However, despite the lifeline provided by the dropped catch, Russell couldn't capitalise on the reprieve and was dismissed soon after for just 10 runs.Despite the initial setback, CSK's disciplined bowling effort restricted KKR to a total of 137/9 in their allotted 20 overs. While the missed catch generated a wave of surprise and anticipation among fans, it ultimately did not significantly alter the outcome of the match, as CSK emerged victorious in the end.Chennai chased down the target quite comfortably in 17.4 over riding on a fine half-century from skipper Gaikwad.Following the high-profile clash, former England skipper Michael Vaughan and ex-New Zealand cricketer Simon Doull engaged in a discussion about Dhoni's dropped catch on Cricbuzz.Meanwhile, CSK's stronghold at their home ground continued to be evident as they comfortably secured victory without facing significant challenges, effectively ending KKR's unbeaten streak in this season of the IPL.",Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 7 wickets in IPL match.

NEW DELHI: Ajit Agarkar , chairman of selectors, acknowledged that Virat Kohli 's fitness blueprint has created a significant impact throughout the Indian cricketing ecosystem.Despite being 35 years old, Kohli continues to excel in executing the most challenging fitness drills, setting himself apart from others.""You look at guys like Virat (Kohli), he is one of those guys who set the benchmark.10-15 years into his career, he has only got fitter, you can see the results. If someone like him sets an example and puts forward certain things that you need or certain fitness levels that you need, gradually it progresses across the ecosystem.""Gradually it has progressed (to the younger generation). The one difference you have seen over the last 15-20 years or so is the fitness levels of players,"" said Agarkar on SportifywithPRG.In the current season of the IPL, Kohli has showcased outstanding form, hitting his eighth century in the tournament, thus extending his record. Additionally, he tops the run charts with 316 runs from five games played thus far.Agarkar described former India skipper MS Dhoni as a true instinctual player in a sport that has long embraced the use of data and insights.Dhoni's intuition has led him to clinch five coveted IPL titles. Despite stepping down as skipper of the Chennai Super Kings , his mere presence on the field instills immense confidence in his team.The former India cricketer felt that artificial intelligence cannot be a substitute to someone like Dhoni whose captaincy instincts are incredible.""The amount of data that's available, is incredible. You can plan a whole innings and I think everybody does it now, but it doesn't mean it will work all the time. You need a captain on the ground because not everything that you've planned is going to go your way.""On a particular day it might, but most days it won't. And that's where you need human instinct. That's why you call MS Dhoni a great captain because he had a feel for the game. He knew what was happening and how the game was changing,"" opined the 46-year-old former India pace bowler.Agarkar said that the IPL had become a huge platform to spot talent but what mattered most was a strong temperament, which would set them apart from the rest.""You can see it, (IPL) keeps throwing up players out of the blue.

IPL is a fairly big stage because of the pressures involved, big crowds.""You might be bowling to the top batters in the world, or you might be facing one of the top bowlers in the world, and that's when you stand up and that's where you judge the temperament of a player, whether he can do it consistently,"" said Agarkar.""It's sometimes a difficult task because of the sheer numbers (of players coming through the domestic structure) that we have. But, eventually, the more you watch players and temperament sometimes separates it.""Agarkar believes a tight-knit side will, more often than not, be a winning side.""A tight-knit group generally helps.

NEW DELHI: Power-hitters Rahul Tewatia and Rashid Khan pulled off an incredible late 14-ball 36 stand as Gujarat Titans pipped Rajasthan Royals by three wickets in a last-ball thriller in Jaipur on Wednesday.Snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, Titans handed Royals their first defeat of the season, ending their four-match winning streak.Chasing a steep 197 for victory and looking to avoid a third straight defeat, Titans kept losing regular wickets until Tewatia and Rashid's late heroics made a late twist in the plot.Sanju Samson (68 not out off 38) and Riyan Parag (76 off 48) continued their red hot form in the competition with disdainful half-centuries as Rajasthan Roylals reached 196 for three after being put in to bat.Shubman Gill (72 off 44) fought a lonely battle for the major part of Titans' innings before Rahul Tewatia (22 off 11) and Rashid Khan pulled the rabbit out of the hat in a last-ball finish.Titans needed as much as 73 runs off the last 30 balls but managed to bring the equation down to 15 off the last six.Avesh Khan, who has proved his worth in the death overs, was again tasked with bowling the 20th over. In the end, it came down to two off one ball and Rashid's rasping cut for four sealed the deal for Titans.Playing his first game of the season, Royals pacer Kuldeep Sen struck thrice in a searing spell before crumbling under pressure in the death overs.Opener Sai Sudharsan (35 off 29) was playing well until he got trapped lbw while going for a lap shot.Matthew Wade was Sen's second victim as he played a wide ball on to his stumps. Abhinav Manohar misread the line and was also beaten for pace, becoming Sen's third scalp.The decision to give R Ashwin the 17th over proved expensive as the veteran spinner conceded 17 runs, bringing the equation down a gettable 42 off 18 balls. 15 were needed off the final over and an over rate penalty forced Royals to keep one extra fielder inside the circle.Earlier, Titans had it all under control in the powerplay before skipper Samson and Parag combined to snatch the momentum from the visitors. Royals smashed as many as 123 runs in the last 10 overs.Parag, who has taken his game to the next level and is thriving in his new batting position of number 4, was at his disdainful best on way to his third half-century in five innings.He shared a 130-run stand off 78 balls with Samson, who has also been in sublime touch since the start of the tournament.Wade dropping Parag on 0 and 6 off star spinner Rashid also cost Titans dearly as the in-form batter found the big hits at will afterwards.The 22-year-old hammered five sixes with three of them coming against left-arm spinner Noor Ahmed via the sweep shot.Parag brought up his fifty with a flat six over long-on off pacer Mohit Sharma.Samson, on the other hand, started with back-to-back fours off Umesh Yadav before taking a backseat to watch Parag go about his business.Besides catching, GT's ground fielding was equally poor.Samson reached his third half-century with a straight boundary off a Mohit full toss that should have been caught by Tewatia at long-on.Frustrated at the turn of events, Titans captain Gill could not hold back his emotions over a wide call that eventually stayed wide.In the penultimate over, Parag pulled a bouncer off Mohit over mid-wicket for another maximum.Early on in Royals innings, Yashasvi Jaiswal (24 off 19) played some exquisite strokes on the off-side before falling to a pre-meditated scoop off Umesh.His opening partner Jos Buttler went for an expansive drive off Rashid in the sixth over but ended up getting caught at first slip.",Gujarat Titans beat Rajasthan Royals by three wickets in a last-ball thriller.

"Ashutosh Sharma: Umpiring for money, depression after row with coach, now IPL fame",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ashutosh-sharma-umpiring-for-money-depression-after-row-with-coach-now-ipl-fame/articleshow/109203963.cms,"NEW DELHI: Before his brilliance in the ongoing IPL, Ashutosh Sharma was best known for breaking Yuvraj Singh 's long-standing record of hitting the fastest fifty in T20 cricket by an Indian. Representing Railways, Sharma blazed to an 11-ball half-century against Arunachal Pradesh at the 2023 Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament – a ball less than Yuvraj's unforgettable 12-ball fifty against England at the 2007 T20 World Cup.Despite his record-breaking feat last year, Sharma's moment in the sun came with back-to-back lion-hearted knocks for Punjab Kings in the IPL.The first one (31 off 17b) resulted in a thrilling victory for Punjab against Gujarat Titans , while the second (33* off 15b) nearly got his team home against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Ashutosh was born in Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh; he played age-group cricket for his home state and then went on to play List A as well as T20s for MP.The streets of Ratlam couldn't give wings to Ashutosh's cricketing dreams so he moved to Indore. ""I left Ratlam as an 8-year-old and moved to Indore for cricket coaching,"" Ashutosh told TOI during an interaction.The shift to Indore also brought some harsh realities with it. ""Khaane ko paise nahi hote the (I didn't have money to sustain myself). I didn't know where the next meal would come from. I was just 10 (years) at that time. It was a small, very small room where I lived.""I then picked up umpiring to earn some money, I also washed clothes to make ends meet,"" the 25-year-old batting allrounder said.If there is anyone who makes Ashutosh emotional it is his childhood coach Amay Khurasiya, the former India left-hander, who has seen him at the MPCA Academy since the age of 12.""Amay sir helped me a lot at the MPCA Academy, he has known me since childhood. He taught me to be disciplined. Batting wise, he is a great coach. I got a lot of tips on mental health from him. I was working with him even before the IPL. I speak to him before every game,"" Ashutosh said.At present, he is the toast of Punjab and its fans, but four years back all was not hunky dory for the hard-hitting batsman. Ashutosh fell out of favour with India's most-celebrated domestic coach Chandrakant Pandit, who had taken over as MP head coach in 2020.""In 2019, I scored 84 in the final T20 game for MP in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. The next year we had a professional coach come to the MP set up. He had his likes and dislikes. He didn't like me and that was pretty clear,"" Ashutosh said, revealing the toughest phase of his cricket life without mentioning Pandit's name.""I scored 90 off 45 balls in a trial match for selection in the MP team. In the evening, I found out that I was not in the team for the 2020 Mushtaq Ali tournament. I was dropped from the team. It was heartbreaking and quite depressing for me.""In the Mushtaq Ali the season before, I played six games and scored three half-centuries. But still the professional coach made me sit out. It was Covid times, and 20 players used to travel, but I was not allowed to go to the ground as well. I used to stay in the hotel… go to the gym and come back to the hotel room. I was totally depressed at that time.""Nobody told me what my fault was, I kept thinking what my mistake was, why I was thrown away from the set up. I was sinking into depression. Those two-three years of my life were hell. I was so much in depression that I couldn't sleep. Night after night, I would be awake and keep thinking what's happening to me.""A job in the Railways came as a beacon of hope for the youngster.""Despite those harrowing times, I didn't leave my practice. Luckily, I got a job in the Railways. It was a God-sent opportunity for me. Railways supported me a lot. Last year, I got a chance in the T20s and I did well in the Mushtaq Ali tournament for Railways,"" Ashutosh said. ""It was tough to come out of that difficult phase, but I had belief that I would be able to do it.""","Ashutosh Sharma was born in Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh.

Can RCB find batters to share Virat Kohli's load?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/can-rcb-find-batters-to-share-virat-kohlis-load/articleshow/109203822.cms,"MUMBAI: How much can one do when a team banks heavily on one batter to lead their charge. Virat Kohli is experiencing that at Royal Challengers Bengaluru this season.While he has done all the heavy lifting for RCB, the others haven't yet come to the party. One look at the numbers suggests that Kohli has been the lone ranger that's trying to keep the RCB ship afloat in the batting department.He has already scored 316 runs in five matches at an average of 105.33 with the help of one century and two fifties.The next best is skipper Faf du Plessis , who has managed to score just 109 runs. It has been a collective failure on part of the rest of the batters-both foreigners and Indians-as none have crossed the 100-run mark. It includes the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Rajat Patidar and Anuj Rawat, among others.When Kohli got his eighth IPL century-an unbeaten 72-ball 113-against Rajasthan Royals in the last match, a lot of noise was made about his strike rate as well with the century coming in 67 balls-the joint slowest in the history of the IPL with Manish Pandey, but with the rest of the batters not providing any sense of confidence, it made sense for Kohli to carry his bat through.He knows that in the current scenario, the team doesn't have a cushion in the batting department like Mumbai Indians or Chennai Super Kings If we compare Kohli's previous season with the ongoing one, there is a conscious effort on upping his strike-rate and playing more attacking shots. Who can forget that dancing down the track aerial extra-cover drive off Kagiso Rabada at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. Also, he has already hit 12 sixes in five games compared to just 16 in 14 games last season.The 35-year-old is scoring runs at a strike-rate of 146. 30 this season which is the second best of his IPL career after his 152.03 in 2016 and the way he is playing, it may go higher. His career strike-rate in IPL is 130.63.There have been murmurs about dropping him from the T20 World Cup squad. But if selectors take into consideration the IPL numbers this season, he is well ahead of the rest. He is top-scorer in the league and the next best opener is Shubman Gill with 183 runs and his strike-rate mirrors Kohli's.Reece Topley, RCB's left-arm pacer, agreed that there has been a collective failure, but they still have time to turn around their season.""You can say that Virat has taken a lot of load in the run scoring department. If you look at everyone's performance, you can say it hasn't been up to scratch and that's in all aspects of the game. I think the exciting part is it's relatively young into the tournament, so we have a lot of time to turn that around,"" said Topley.",Virat Kohli has scored 316 runs in five matches at an average of 105.33.

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill on Wednesday etched his name in the history books of the Indian Premier League (IPL) by becoming the youngest player to reach 3000 runs in the tournament.Playing against Rajasthan Royals , Gujarat Titans skipper Gill, who also completed 4000 T20 runs, achieved this impressive milestone at the age of 24 years and 215 days, surpassing the previous record held by Royal Challengers Bengaluru's batting maestro Virat Kohli , who did it in 26 years and 186 days.Sanju Samson (26 years and 320 days) is at the third spot followed by Suresh Raina (27 years and 161 days) and Rohit Sharma (27 years and 343 days).Gill's accomplishment at such a youthful stage of his career underscores his exceptional talent and potential as a batsman. Since his debut in the IPL, Gill has consistently showcased his batting prowess, combining classical technique with innovative stroke play. His ability to anchor innings and score runs consistently has established him as a key player.At just 24 years old, Gill's achievement serves as a testament to his maturity and cricketing acumen beyond his years. It highlights his significance not only for teams he played in IPL but also as one of the brightest talents in Indian cricket. As he continues to evolve and grow, Gill's record-breaking feat sets a high bar for future generations of cricketers.Gill, who took 94 innings, also became the joint-fourth fastest player to register 3000 runs when it comes to fewest innings taken in the history of the IPL. West Indies legend Chirs Gayle sits at the top, achieving it in 75 innings followed by KL Rahul (80) and Jos Buttler (85).",Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill becomes youngest player to reach 3000 runs in IPL.

IPL 2024: Hardik Pandya's role in focus as MI host RCB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2024-hardik-pandyas-role-in-focus-as-mi-host-rcb/articleshow/109203739.cms,"MUMBAI: Has the constant booing affected Hardik Pandya 's performance? His numbers and uncertainty over when he bats or bowls seems to suggest it has.In the opening match against Gujarat Titans, while chasing a target of 169, the Mumbai Indians skipper held himself back and came in at No. 7. In a high-scoring chase against Sunrisers Hyderabad, he pushed himself to No.5. Against Rajasthan Royals, he batted at No. 6 before coming in at No. 4 in the last match against Delhi Capitals.In his first stint at MI, he had the role of a finisher. But during his two-year stint with GT, he mostly played at No. 4, sometimes No. 3, and mostly played the role of anchoring the innings before opening his shoulders towards the end.At MI, the batting line-up is well settled with the top three consisting of Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav and the finisher's role being assigned to Tim David and Romario Shepherd, after his heroics in the last match. With most of the slots taken, Pandya will have to play a similar role for MI as he did as GT and decide quickly whether he wants to come in at No. 4 or 5, so that Tilak Varma also knows at which position he bats. We saw a glimpse of it when he walked at No. 4 against DC and held the innings from spiralling out of control when MI had lost four quick wickets. So don't be surprised henceforth if he walks in at that number.So far, things haven't gone Pandya's way. In the chases against GT and SRH, he couldn't get the team over the line and that Pandya finishing touch, which earned him his stripes during his first stint with MI, was missing.Maybe, because he is coming back after a long break, he is still feeling his way back. Before the IPL, he last played in the 2023 ODI World Cup where he injured his ankle during the match against Bangladesh.Australia allrounder Tim David backed Pandya to come good. “Yeah, we've had conversations about how we played. Hardik has been playing a really important role for our team. If you look at the last match, we struggled really hard for momentum towards the back end and Hardik played perfectly and it set the platform for myself and Romario. Hardik's been phenomenal in the way he's been playing and that's what we need at some point. Sometimes it will be me, sometimes other guys. We have full faith in him. We know he has the power and when he gets into that situation he is going to win the game for us,” said David.The uncertainty has creeped in his bowling as well. He bowled in the first two games but hasn't rolled his arm over since. In the last match against DC, Shepherd bowled his full quota of four overs and ended up conceding 54 runs. MI could have done with Pandya bowling an over or two as it could have given them more variation on a track that stayed true throughout the match.It's crucial for MI that their skipper starts bowling again starting with the encounter against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.If one takes away Jasprit Bumrah's spell against DC, where he conceded just 22 runs in four overs and took two wickets, MI's attack looks a bit pedestrian and they will be served well if Pandya bowls regularly if not the full quota.For that to happen, Pandya will have to cancel the outside noise and focus on the process that has brought him much success.It will be a must-win encounter for both the teams to keep their playoffs hopes alive. MI have just two points after four matches while RCB have equal number of points but have played one match more.",Hardik Pandya's numbers and uncertainty over when he bats or bowls seems to suggest it has.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of their clash against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, fast bowler Reece Topley highlighted that Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's overseas batters have ample opportunity to turn around their poor start and revive the team's faltering campaign in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ).RCB find themselves under immense pressure after losing four out of their five matches in the tournament so far.The overseas batters, in particular, have struggled collectively, compounding the team's challenges.Despite Virat Kohli 's stellar performance with 316 runs at an impressive average of 105.33, the lack of support from other key overseas players has been a major concern.Incumbent captain Faf du Plessis has only managed to score 109 runs at a disappointing average of 21.80, while star all-rounder Glenn Maxwell and Cameron Green have also struggled, contributing just 32 and 68 runs respectively in the five matches they have played.With RCB's bowling unit also failing to fire consistently, the team faces an uphill task in their quest to turn their fortunes around. However, Topley remains optimistic that the overseas batters have the talent and potential to resurrect the team's campaign and help RCB climb up the IPL standings.""You can take away the fact that it is the overseas batters (only) and you can probably say, Virat has had quite a load in the run-scoring department,"" Topley replied when asked if the failure of the overseas batters has had a strong impact on RCB's fortunes this season.""I do not think anyone needs to be an expert to sort of look at everyone's performances and say they haven't been up to scratch and that's all aspects of the game, and obviously now we've had five games,"" he said.Topley emphasised that despite the challenging start, it's still early in the tournament, and RCB possess the determination and resolve needed to reverse their fortunes.""The exciting part is that it's still relatively young into the tournament. There's a lot still to play for and what is exciting is that there's a lot of time to turn that around and still showcase how good we are.""At the start of the season (the goal) is to qualify for the finals. To there's still an opportunity to do that, we're working hard to make that achievable,"" he added.RCB have encountered significant challenges at the Wankhede Stadium against Mumbai Indians, having lost seven out of their ten matches played there so far.""It's always dangerous when things haven't been going so well for a side, there's even more of an emphasis to go out and put the onus on the opposition. We need to put them under pressure and we'll be doing everything we can to do that,"" he added.Meanwhile, a lot of the big guns from both Mumbai and Bengaluru camps opted for rest on the pre-match day. While MI skipper Hardik Pandya did not train along with Suryakumar Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah. Rohit Sharma was present during the training session and also batted.Similarly, Kohli, who had trained in the afternoon along with du Plessis, Maxwell and a few others on Tuesday, opted for rest on the match eve.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru have lost four out of their five matches in the IPL.

NEW DELHI: India's bowling coach, Paras Mhambrey , reckons both Virat Kohli and Mohammed Shami possess exceptional mental strength, despite their contrasting personalities. Mhambrey attributes this mental fortitude as a significant factor contributing to Team India 's success.During the ODI World Cup last year, Kohli demonstrated his batting prowess by amassing an impressive 765 runs at an astounding average of 95.62, securing the top spot on the batting charts.On the other hand, Shami showcased his bowling prowess by claiming 24 wickets at a remarkable average of 10.70, topping the bowling charts. Their stellar performances played a crucial role in India's journey to the runner-up finish in the tournament.Despite their differences in personality, Kohli and Shami's mental resilience and ability to thrive under pressure have been instrumental in India's achievements on the cricketing stage. Their contributions highlight the importance of mental strength in the highly competitive world of international cricket, showcasing their invaluable leadership and talent within the team.""Both are different personalities altogether, but in terms of mental strength, both are up there,"" Mhambrey said at the launch of book 'G.O.A.T.S Must Be Crazy' authored by management professional Vishnu Govind at the International Institute of Sports and Management in Mumbai.""Virat is purely aggressive, on the face all the time. Shami is complete in contrast, never on his own. You will see a lot more bowlers being pumped out in celebration after taking a wicket but Shami will do the usual 'hello' kind of stuff.""Shami appears to be laid back, but he understands his game in and out. He knows what's expected of him. I've worked a lot with Shami in the recent past. He's completely different in terms of training and he will do something that suits him. He knows what works for him and knows his body inside out,"" he said.Talking about Kohli, Mhambrey said: ""Virat is one of the best at chasing. Chasing in shorter formats was always difficult but if you look at the records in the recent past, it has improved a lot. He's the prime reason why India have chased mammoth scores.""The common factor is they understand their roles quite well. They may have different approaches but by their mental strengths we get similar results. In terms of mentally absorbing pressure, both are at the top,"" he added.Shami has been sidelined from cricket since the ODI World Cup due to an injury. As a result, he missed out on participating in the tour of South Africa and the subsequent Test series against England.Mhambrey further said that Kohli's work ethics have rubbed on the young cricketers in the Indian team.""To be able to see the work put in by Virat day in and day out is an eye opener. You see youngsters talking to him and trying to learn from him. It gives everyone a fantastic insight into how he prepares.”""I see a lot of younger people in the team taking out those minutes to have that conversation with him because those words of wisdom are fantastic.""Unless you are not crazy or obsessed in any profession that you are, you can never be one of the greatest and that's common with all sportspersons.”Asked how to become GOAT -- the greatest of all time -- Mhambrey said: ""I think you're born with certain skills. Skills that Shami has cannot be replicated unless you have it... Same with (Jasprit) Bumrah. These are guys who are born with that skill.""You become GOAT with the attitude that you have, the work that you put in, the vision that you had about yourself, the inspiration that you want to be. These combinations with other factors will make you a GOAT.""",India's bowling coach Paras Mhambrey says both Virat Kohli and Mohammed Shami possess exceptional mental strength.

NEW DELHI: Riyan Parag and Sanju Samson continued their scintillating form by crafting aggressive fifties, propelling Rajasthan Royals to a formidable total of 196 for three in the IPL clash against Gujarat Titans in Jaipur on Wednesday.Initially at 43 for two within the powerplay, the Titans seemed to have control before skipper Samson (68 not out off 38) and Parag (76 off 48) orchestrated a momentum shift in favor of the Royals.The duo's partnership saw the team amass a staggering 123 runs in the last 10 overs.Parag, flourishing in his new batting position at number 4, exhibited his prowess with a commanding half-century, marking his third in five innings.His partnership with Samson, who has also been in exceptional form throughout the tournament, yielded a formidable 130-run stand off 78 balls.The costly drops by Matthew Wade, missing chances to dismiss Parag on 0 and 6 off the bowling of star spinner Rashid Khan , proved detrimental for the Titans. Parag, who was in sublime form, capitalized on these opportunities and unleashed big hits with ease thereafter.The 22-year-old hammered five sixes with three of them coming against left-arm spinner Noor Ahmed via the sweep shot.Parag brought up his fifty with a flat six over long-on off pacer Mohit Sharma.Samson, on the other hand, started with back-to-back fours off Umesh Yadav before taking a backseat to watch Parag go about his business.Besides catching, GT's ground fielding was equally poor.Samson reached his third half-century with a straight boundary off a Mohit full toss that should have been caught by Rahul Tewatia at long-on.Frustrated at the turn of events, Titans captain Shubman Gill could not hold back his emotions over a wide call that eventually stayed wide.In the penultimate over, Parag pulled a bouncer off Mohit over mid-wicket for another maximum.Early on in Royals innings, Yashasvi Jaiswal (24 off 19) played some exquisite strokes on the off-side before falling to a pre-meditated scoop off Umesh.His opening partner Jos Buttler went for an expansive drive off Rashid in the sixth over but ended up getting caught at first slip.",Riyan Parag and Sanju Samson hit aggressive fifties for Rajasthan Royals.

'Mayank Yadav is really exciting, Sanju Samson standout captain'

'India's biggest challenge in T20 WC will be adapting to conditions'

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former England skipper Eoin Morgan believes that Rishabh Pant has wasted no time in regaining his form after recovering from a serious car accident, making him a shoo-in for India's playing eleven at the T20 World Cup .Despite being out of action for 14 months, Pant has made a remarkable comeback, scoring two half-centuries in just five games with an impressive strike rate of 154.54 in the Indian Premier League (IPL).While there are other contenders for the wicketkeeper-batsman position, such as Sanju Samson , Ishan Kishan, and Jitesh Sharma , Pant's stellar performance in the IPL has elevated him to the top of the selection list. His ability to perform consistently and deliver impactful performances under pressure has made him the preferred choice for Morgan and many others.Pant's remarkable comeback from adversity, coupled with his dynamic style of play, makes him a valuable asset for the Indian team, particularly in the high-stakes T20 World Cup tournament.When asked why he would pick Pant over others, Morgan spoke with crystal clarity.""(I would pick him) because he is the player that he is. I don't see him being hampered in anyway coming back from his car crash. For me he is a very disruptive player.""As a leftie he can play a big role in the middle order and add a huge amount of pressure as opposed to generic right handers,"" said the ODI World Cup winning captain in his response to a PTI query during an interaction organised by Jio Cinema.The selectors are anticipated to finalise India's squad for the ICC event in the first week of May, with former captain and batting maestro Virat Kohli expected to be a definite inclusion in the final fifteen.Morgan, known for his astute leadership, has emphasised that Kohli's impressive strike rate in the IPL should not be doubted, particularly considering the lack of support from other batters in the team.Despite the ongoing nature of the IPL season, Kohli has surged to the top of the batting charts with an outstanding aggregate of 316 runs in just five innings, boasting a commendable strike rate of 146.29.However, despite Kohli's stellar performance, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) find themselves at the bottom of the table, primarily due to underwhelming performances from other players.""It is very difficult to point fingers at a guy who is the holder of the orange cap and the rest of the batting line is not scoring runs. I don't see a point in that. For RCB they are struggling with the bowling and the rest of the batting. Why would I place blame on someone who is scoring the majority of the runs,"" said Morgan.Before Mayank Yadav was sidelined with fitness issues, the IPL rookie showcased his talent by delivering back-to-back Man of the Match performances in the tournament.Demonstrating impressive pace, consistently clocking around the 150 kmph mark, Yadav posed a formidable challenge for opposing batters, hurrying them with his speed while also impressing cricketing legends with his accuracy and control.""He is just an x-factor player. I am trying to remember after I first saw him ball, bowling upwards of 150kmph, who would have been the quickest Indian bowler that I would have played against. There is nobody who bowls quicker than he does or with the accuracy that he does. That is exciting.""On the best Indian captain in the IPL so far, Morgan picked Sanju Samson of Rajasthan Royals.""If you look at Hardik Pandya, he had success in a short span of time with GT. Now he is with Mumbai and starting to turn things around. You can't put a price on winning, as a captain that is what you are judged on.""Probably the stand out skipper has been Sanju Samson. I say that because of one key factor. His use of Riyan Parag , not just promoting him up the order at number four, shows how outspoken he has been about wanting him to bat at four.""One of the hardest things to do as captain is to instill confidence and belief in a player to make them better players. Sanju has done with Riyan,"" highlighted Morgan.In a couple of months, India will be trying to win an elusive ICC trophy. They play all their league games in the T20 World Cup in the USA before moving to the Caribbean for the Super Eight stage of the competition.""India's biggest challenge in T20 WC will be adapting to conditions,"" said Morgan.""They play Ireland and Pakistan in New York on a pitch we don't know what it is going to be like. It should be an excellent venue but there is no previous information about the pitch. For me that can cause issues.""It is one of the hardest things. Winning away from home is about how you play conditions and in T20 it can be difficult,"" added Morgan.","Eoin Morgan believes Rishabh Pant has wasted no time in regaining his form after recovering from a serious car accident. Pant has made a remarkable comeback, scoring two half-centuries in just five games with an impressive strike rate of 154.54 in the Indian Premier League.

The ball was floated in from the right corner and Tachikawa volleyed the ball into the net with his left foot.Three minutes later, Javi Siverio could have extended the lead but his shot from the centre hit the woodwork.

Alen Stevanovic played a through ball from the left and Doungel made no mistake of latching on it before making a run and finishing with a lob over the onrushing goalkeeper.At that point, it seemed that Jamshedpur would at least finish their season with a point but Goa went all out in search of the win after that.
