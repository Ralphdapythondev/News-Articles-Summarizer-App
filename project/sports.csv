'We are in Paris to give India its 9th Olympic hockey gold': Captain Harmanpreet promises the nation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/we-are-in-paris-to-give-india-its-9th-olympic-hockey-gold-captain-harmanpreet-promises-the-nation/articleshow/112237660.cms,"Every time adrenaline gushes through Harmanpreet's forearms to send those drag-flicks whizzing past defenders and bring the opponent post crashing down in Paris, mind goes back to the January evening of 2023 in Bhubaneswar. A dejected India skipper, carrying the nation's hopes on his penalty-corner skills, appeared clueless. The ball almost refused to roll up his stick on those flicks.The New Zealanders sent India out of the World Cup.It was not even the quarterfinal. Dream dusted in the crossovers, a desperate D-top flick by Harmanpreet during one-on-one shootout against the Kiwi custodian defined the tournament for India and its skipper.Head hung in disappointment, Harmanpreet dragged himself to the mandatory press conference along with Graham Reid, who almost knew it was his last meeting with the media as the India coach.It was about a year and half to go for the Paris Olympics then. Hockey India brought in a new coach in Craig Fulton, and his partnership with Harmanpreet as the team's think-tank has not just won India titles, including the Asian Games gold, but also saw Harmanpreet returning with his lethal short-corner skills that have taken India to the quarterfinals of theParis Games .With six goals in five matches, Harmanpreet is playing like Rocky Balboa returning to the ring.India's two slightly nervous opening matches were salvaged by Harmanpreet's last-minute goals, resulting in a 3-2 win over New Zealand and a 1-1 draw against the 2016 Olympic champions Argentina. The clean sheet in the 2-0 win over Ireland, courtesy Harmanpreet's brace, was comforting. But the real test at the pool stage was always going to be defending Olympic champions Belgium and nemesis Australia.With a place in the quarterfinals sealed before the two big games, India gave the Belgians a run for their money before losing 1-2. But the story of the men's hockey competition so far was written in the match against Australia.After 52 years, India finally managed to bell the cat and beat the Aussies in an Olympic match -- the last instance being a 3-1 win at the Munich Games in 1972.Harmanpreet's stick continued to fire, scoring two goals in India's 3-2 win, taking the tally of his international goals to 190 in 224 matches.Opposite to the trend against the Aussies over the years, it was India who led 2-1 at half-time, showing the promise that the team wants to deliver on in Paris.“That's what we are looking for -- to give India its ninth (hockey) gold. We are giving (it our) everything to win that gold medal,"" Harmanpreet told FIH (International Hockey Federation) after the win over Australia.""But the main tournament is starting now. So the quarterfinals, the semifinals, those matches are very crucial. So we're just looking to give our best,” said the two-time FIH Men’s Player of the Year.Having finished second in Pool B with 10 points, India will take on Pool A's third-placed team, Great Britain. The match is scheduled for 1:30 pm IST on August 4.Decoding the historic win over Australia, Harmanpreet said: ""We started (the Paris Olympics by) winning, and we decided we were going to finish with a winning match. We put them under pressure and the pressure was so good from the frontline. And our motto was to score the first goal. So we did it and I think after that we managed very well. Because everybody knows that the Australians come full press, so the positioning and scanning was good today, the way we managed the ball.""The real tournament, though, begins with the knockouts, where the losing team packs its bags to go home. And Harmanpreet summed it up in few and precise words.""There's no room to make mistakes.""","Harmanpreet scored two goals in India's 3-2 win over Australia. India finished second in Pool B with 10 points. India will take on Pool A's third-placed team, Great Britain, on August 4. India beat Australia for the first time in 52 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112237765,imgsize-61570,width-400,resizemode-4/112237765.jpg"

India's run-chase in the first ODI against Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday ended 13 balls early when they needed just one run to win the game with two wickets in hands.Sri Lanka skipper Charith Asalanka (3 for 30) took matters in his hands and struck twice off successive deliveries to end the game in a stange and dramatic tie with the wickets of Shivam Dube and Arshdeep Singh , who tried to hit a boundary when all he was required to do was to tap it around to find the single run needed for victory.Sri Lanka scored a competitive 230 for 8 after opting to bat first, led by half-centuries from opener Pathum Nissanka (56) and Dunith Wellalage (67) lower down the order against a disciplined Indian bowling attack that shared the spoils and was led by left-arm spinner Axar Patel's 2 for 33.Arshdeep, who took 2 for 47 earlier, ended the game on the wrong note when he tried a big heave on the leg-side down on one knee, but missed connection and was hit on the back leg to be adjudged out lbw. He went for the review, but all the parameters were in bowler's favour on replays.The left-arm Indian pacer's effort with the bat led to fans trolling him for trying to go for glory, when he was expected to keep a cool head and find a single.India's run-chase was set up by skipper Rohit Sharma's 47-ball 58 and his 75-run opening partnership with Shubman Gill (18), but Wellalage (2 for 39) removed both the Indian openers with his left-arm spin in quick succession to bring the hosts back in the game.Wanindu Hasaranga then kept India on the backfoot with his spell of 3 for 58, which included the important wickets of Virat Kohli (24) just when he looked to have got his eye in and KL Rahul, who was also well set at 31.Axar (33) and Dube (25) then kept India in the chase, but it didn't prove enough. Dube was the penultimate wicket to fall, after which the last-wicket pair of Arshdeep and Mohammed Siraj needed to score just one run. However, Arshdeep tried to hit Asalaka for a boundary and faltered in the process.He was heavily trolled on social media by the fans after the match.However, there were also fans who came out to support Arshdeep, who was India's highest wicket-taker in the T20 World Cup triumph earlier this year in June.",India's run-chase in the first ODI against Sri Lanka ended 13 balls early. They needed just one run to win the game with two wickets in hands.

NEW DELHI: Manu Bhaker positioned herself for a historic third successive Olympic medal while Lakshya Sen progressed to the badminton semifinals after claiming a historic win at the Paris Games on Friday.The Indian hockey team also ended a 52-year drought defeating Australia 3-2 in their final Pool B game.But despite the achievements, India remains at 44th in the overall medal tally, with three bronze medals, all from shooting events.Bhaker advanced to the 25m pistol competition after finishing second in the qualifications with a score of 590. She has already won two bronze medals in the 10m air pistol and 10m air pistol mixed team events, partnering with Sarabjot Singh.Bhaker's performance is particularly noteworthy as she is the reigning world champion in the 25m event. If she secures a podium finish on Saturday, she will become the first Indian athlete to achieve three successive Olympic medals in a single edition.Star shuttler Lakshya Sen achieved a significant milestone in the evening, defeating Chinese Taipei's Chou Tien Chen 19-21, 21-15, 21-12 to advance to the semifinals.With the win, Sen became the frst Indian male badminton player to enter Olympic semis. Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu previously reached similar feat in women's game.Lakshya's next match will be against the winner of the clash between 2021 world champion Loh Kean Yew from Singapore and Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen of Denmark.

We needed a match like this before the quarterfinals. From the start we put them under pressure. It's a proud moment to beat Australia,"" a proud Harmanpreet said after the match.Veteran goalkeeper PR Sreejesh, playing in his last international tournament, was instrumental in the win, making crucial saves to prevent the Australians from scoring.Shubhankar Sharma delivered two eagles in his second round but lost four shots mid-game, resulting in a two-under 69, placing him 25th in the golf competition.Combined with his first-round 70, he stands at three-under after two days at Le Golf National near Paris.The other Indian participant, Gaganjeet Bhullar, improved on his first round score of 75 with a two-under 69 and is now tied for 52nd.Asian Games-medallist shooter Esha Singh ended 18th in the 25m pistol qualification at the Paris Olympics.Judoka Tulika Mann lost in her opening round against London Games champion Idalys Ortiz, while rower Balraj Panwar finished 23rd in the men's single sculls event.Esha scored a total of 581, with 291 in precision and 290 in rapid, finishing 18th out of 40 shooters.

The 25-year-old from Haryana clocked 7:02.37, his best timing of the Games, in Final D, which was not a medal round.Balraj was India's lone representative in rowing at the Paris Olympics and had earlier finished fifth in his quarterfinals heat race on Tuesday.","Lakshya Sen becomes the frst Indian male badminton player to enter Olympic semis.

Indian batters choke as Sri Lanka earn a dramatic tie in ODI series opener,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/sri-lanka-in-india/indian-batters-choke-as-sri-lanka-earn-a-dramatic-tie-in-odi-series-opener/articleshow/112231396.cms,"NEW DELHI: The first ODI between India and Sri Lanka at Colombo ended in a thrilling tie, highlighting India's vulnerability against quality spin bowling despite a dominant performance from skipper Rohit Sharma .Chasing a modest target of 231, India were propelled by Rohit's blistering 58 off 47 balls. His innings, studded with powerful strokes and aggressive intent, contrasted sharply with the struggles of his teammates against a disciplined Sri Lankan spin attack.Rohit's dismissal, adjudged leg-before off Dananjaya, exposed India's fragility against spin.The pitch, which seemed benign during Rohit's innings, began to offer turn and variable bounce, troubling the Indian middle order.KL Rahul (31 off 43 balls), known for his measured approach, struggled to rotate the strike, putting pressure on the incoming batsmen. Virat Kohli (23), Shreyas Iyer (24), and Axar Patel (33) all got starts but failed to convert them into substantial scores.Sri Lanka's spinners, led by Wanindu Hasaranga (3/58), Akila Dananjaya (1/40), Dunith Wellalage (2/39), and skipper Charith Asalanka (3/30), bowled with discipline and guile, choking the run flow and picking up wickets at crucial junctures. Asalanka, in particular, turned the tide in Sri Lanka's favour with two wickets in two balls, pushing India on the back foot.Earlier, Sri Lanka, opting to bat first, were bolstered by crucial half-centuries fromPathum Nissanka (56) and debutant Dunith Wellalage (67*). Nissanka anchored the innings with a composed knock, while Wellalage displayed maturity and confidence beyond his years, guiding Sri Lanka past the 200-run mark.The Indian bowlers, despite the eventual tie, performed admirably on a helpful surface. Mohammed Siraj struck early, while Shivam Dube , returning to ODIs after a five-year hiatus, impressed with a wicket. Kuldeep Yadav, though wicketless, bowled economically, keeping the pressure on the Sri Lankan batsmen.The match, ultimately ending in a tie thanks to late hitting from Shivam Dube, exposed India's over-reliance on Rohit Sharma and their susceptibility against spin. It served as a timely reminder that despite boasting a formidable batting lineup, India needs to address their vulnerability against spin bowling to achieve consistent success in the ODI format.","India and Sri Lanka play out thrilling tie in first ODI in Colombo.

India captain Rohit Sharma was in full flow with the bat during the practice sessions in Sri Lanka after joining the ODI squad for the three-match series beginning on Friday, and one of his big hits in the nets got even head coach Gautam Gambhir looking skywards to see where the ball was headed.After announcing his retirement from T20Is following India's T20 World Cup triumph in the Caribbean on June 29 this year, a well-rested Rohit is back to lead India in 50-over internationals.Also returning to the squad is Virat Kohli, who also decided to retire from T20Is after India became the T20 world champions.But it didn't take time for the two seasoned pros to get back in the groove for the longer version of white-ball cricket , as both Rohit and Virat had a good feel of the Sri Lankan conditions, which, however, are not much dissimilar to India.During one of the training sessions in Colombo , with Rohit facing the bowlers in the nets, the skipper launched himself into a big aerial shot.

NEW DELHI: Imane Khelif ’s Olympic journey in Paris began with a victory shrouded in controversy, setting the stage for a dramatic and polarizing narrative.The Algerian boxer , who had been reinstated for the Games despite a previous disqualification from the 2023 World Championships due to a failed gender eligibility test, found herself at the centre of a storm before she even stepped into the ring.In her opening bout, Khelif faced Italy’s Angela Carini , a seasoned fighter with high expectations.However, the match ended abruptly after just 46 seconds, a rare occurrence in Olympic boxing .Carini, visibly distraught and bleeding from her nose, cited intense pain from the initial exchanges as the reason for her sudden withdrawal.She vehemently denied any political motivation behind her decision, saying, ""If an athlete is this way, and in that sense it’s not right or it is right, it’s not up to me to decide. I just did my job as a boxer. I got into the ring and fought. I did it with my head held high and with a broken heart for not having finished the last kilometre.”Yet, the tension was palpable when Carini refused to shake Khelif’s hand after the fight.Carini’s refusal to engage in the customary post-fight handshake was seen by many as a silent protest, though she insisted it was merely a result of her physical distress. The incident, however, intensified the scrutiny on Khelif’s presence at the Games.Khelif is not a transgender athlete .She was born female but has a disorder of sex development (DSD) that results in XY chromosomes and testosterone levels similar to those of male athletes.The IOC's Framework on Fairness, Inclusion, and Non-discrimination based on gender identity and sex variations provides guidelines for sports federations to promote inclusion and fairness, particularly for athletes with Differences of Sexual Development (DSD).DSD encompasses a group of rare conditions that affect genes, hormones, and reproductive organs.Individuals with DSDs may be raised as female but possess XY chromosomes and testosterone levels typically found in males.Despite the controversy, Khelif, a silver medalist at the 2022 IBA World Championships, remains undeterred in her Olympic aspirations.Her next challenge is a quarterfinal bout against Hungarian trailblazer Anna Luca Hamori, a match that holds significant weight. A victory would not only secure Khelif an Olympic medal but also potentially reignite the ethical and sporting debates surrounding her eligibility.",Algerian boxer Imane Khelif is not a transgender athlete.

Hopefully, we will get to listen to several more one-liners,” Surya was heard saying with a smile in a video shared by the BCCI after India's T20I series win.Surya was appointed India's full-time T20I skipper ahead of allrounder Hardik Pandya, a topic that became a hot debate in India before BCCI announced the white-ball squads for the Sri Lanka tour.India whitewashed Sri Lanka 3-0 in the T20I leg of the tour.In the last match of the series, Surya was celebrated as a bowling hero when he decided to bring himself on to bowl the last over when Sri Lanka required just six runs to win. The 33-year-old Surya not just picked up two wickets in the over but also restricted Sri Lanka to five runs, which took the match to a 'Super Over' tie-breaker.It was Surya's boundary that won India the match in the 'Super Over'.With Rohit and Virat Kohli back in the squad for ODIs, India will look to continue the winning momentum. After the first ODI on Friday at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, the second and third match of the series will be played on July 4 and 7 at the same venue.","India's T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav has flown back home after leading the team to a series win over Sri Lanka.

Who is Imane Khelif? The boxer shaking up Paris Olympics with a 46-second victory amid gender row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/who-is-imane-khelif-the-boxer-shaking-up-paris-olympics-with-a-46-second-victory-amid-gender-row/articleshow/112197754.cms,"NEW DELHI: Imane Khelif , a 25-year-old Algerian boxer, has become a focal point of controversy at the Paris Olympics , where she recently won her opening bout in the women’s 66kg category in a swift 46 seconds.This victory, however, is overshadowed by the ongoing debate over her gender eligibility, which has divided opinions within the sporting community.Khelif’s participation in the Olympics comes after she was disqualified from the 2023 World Championships for failing to meet the International Boxing Association's (IBA) gender eligibility criteria.The issue arose due to elevated levels of testosterone, leading to her exclusion from that event alongside Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, who faced similar disqualification.Despite this setback, Khelif had been cleared by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to compete in the Paris Olympics, where she is now advancing toward the quarter-finals.The IOC's decision to allow Khelif to compete has not been without controversy. Critics argue that differing standards between the IBA and IOC create confusion and potential unfairness in competition.Italy's Family Minister Eugenia Roccella and Sports Minister Andrea Abodi have expressed concerns about the lack of uniform criteria at the international level, questioning the fairness and safety of allowing Khelif to compete against other female athletes.The Algerian Olympic Committee (COA) has come to Khelif’s defence, condemning what they describe as “malicious and unethical attacks” by foreign media. The COA has emphasized their unwavering support for Khelif, denouncing the scrutiny as ""baseless propaganda"" aimed at undermining her credibility and morale as she competes at the pinnacle of her career.During her brief but impactful fight in Paris, Khelif faced Italy’s Angela Carini, who suffered a badly hurt nose and was unable to continue, leading to an official abandonment of the match.The swift victory was met with mixed reactions, with Algerian fans in the North Paris Arena showing their support by chanting Khelif’s name, while Carini’s emotional response highlighted the intense pressure and stakes involved in the competition.As the debate over gender eligibility in sports continues, Khelif’s journey at the Paris Olympics is likely to remain under the spotlight, reflecting broader discussions about fairness, safety, and the evolving standards in women’s sports. Despite the controversy, Khelif remains focused on her Olympic goals, buoyed by the support of her nation and the determination to prove herself on the world stage.",Algerian boxer Imane Khelif has become a focal point of controversy at the Paris Olympics.

Andre Russell says more than money behind West Indies stars' Test absence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/andre-russell-says-more-than-money-behind-west-indies-stars-test-absence/articleshow/112232320.cms,"NEW DELHI: London Spirit's Andre Russell has asserted that the primary reason some prominent West Indies cricketers have turned away from Test cricket and focused on limited-overs formats is a lack of interest rather than a lack of financial incentives.The West Indies, once a dominant force in cricket, recently suffered a 3-0 Test series defeat against England.Notably, several current Caribbean star players were absent from the series, instead preparing for their lucrative participation in the English domestic cricket competition, The Hundred.Russell is among five West Indian players in the highest £125,000 ($160,000) salary bracket for this year's edition of The Hundred. He is joined by his Spirit teammate Shimron Hetmyer , Nicholas Pooran at Northern Superchargers, Rovman Powell at Trent Rockets, and Kieron Pollard at Southern Brave.Despite their reputations as dynamic batsmen in franchise cricket, Pooran, Powell, and Pollard have never played a single Test match, while Russell's sole appearance in the red-ball format came back in 2010.For a considerable time, it has been widely believed that the limited financial resources of Cricket West Indies have made franchise cricket a highly appealing choice for players from the Caribbean. However, according to Russell, there are other factors at play when examining the reasons behind the decision of many regional players to curtail their first-class careers prematurely.""I don't think it's the money, I don't think money is the issue,"" he told Britain's PA news agency, as quoted by AFP.""Based on the amount of T20 and leagues around the world, I think a lot of players are just not interested in playing Tests.""The 36-year-old added: ""I'm always excited watching the other West Indian batters, especially when they're hitting boundary after boundary.""As long as you can do well from contracts outside your nation I think they are going to grab that opportunity but everyone wants to play on the big stage.""So, if the big stage comes in Test cricket, I know youngsters will be happy to play. I just don't think it's about money or anything like that.""Russell expressed his empathy towards his compatriots after their devastating 3-0 defeat against England in the recently concluded Test series. The entire series lasted a mere 10 days, despite being originally scheduled for 15.""Red-ball cricket is not my cookie, I don't think my body will keep up with Test cricket,"" Russell explained. ""But those in the team at the moment are fit enough and taking on the challenge.""They had a few moments in the Test series where they could have turned things around.

IPL mulls rule change for retired players ahead of next season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-mulls-rule-change-for-retired-players-ahead-of-next-season/articleshow/112232098.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League ( IPL ) is considering a rule change that could significantly impact player retention and auctions. The proposal would grant ""uncapped player"" status to players who retired from international cricket for at least five years. This means these players wouldn't be subject to the higher base price reserved for capped Indian players, according to a report from ESPNCricinfo.This proposal has sparked debate among franchise owners. Some, like Sunrisers Hyderabad owner Kavya Maran , oppose the rule, arguing it disrespects retired internationals and could set a precedent where uncapped players earn more than seasoned veterans. They suggest these players should enter the auction, allowing their value to be determined by market demand.Other franchise owners support the rule change, believing it would provide more opportunities for experienced players who haven't represented their country recently. They argue that the current system forces these players to enter auctions at inflated base prices, making them less attractive to franchises and often leading to them going unsold.IPL CEO Hemang Amin supports lowering the base price for such players, believing it would increase their chances of being picked. He cites instances where capped Indian players, absent from the international scene for extended periods, went unsold due to high base prices.This debate has implications for prominent players like MS Dhoni , who retired from international cricket in 2020. While a recent report erroneously linked Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to the rule change as a strategy to retain Dhoni, the franchise's stance on the matter remains unclear.Dhoni himself has stated he will decide on his IPL future after the league finalizes its retention rules. Despite successful knee surgery in 2023 and a commendable performance in the 2024 season, Dhoni's future remains uncertain.The IPL governing council faces a crucial decision – balancing the interests of franchises, respecting the legacy of experienced players, and ensuring a fair and competitive auction process. The outcome will undoubtedly shape the landscape of the IPL for years to come.","The proposal would grant ""uncapped player"" status to players who retired from international cricket for at least five years.

Score was gettable but we never had momentum: Rohit Sharma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/score-was-gettable-but-we-never-had-momentum-rohit-sharma/articleshow/112231822.cms,"NEW DELHI: A visibly disappointed India captain Rohit Sharma conceded that his team should have managed to score the single run needed off the last 14 deliveries.However, he acknowledged that the team struggled to maintain a consistent scoring rate throughout their innings, despite chasing a relatively modest target of 231 in the opening ODI against Sri Lanka in Colombo on Friday.India got off to a promising start, with Rohit leading the charge with a brisk 58 off 47 balls, helping the team amass 71 runs in the first 10 overs.However, the middle order failed to capitalize on the strong foundation, as Virat Kohli (24), Shreyas Iyer (23), and KL Rahul (31) all got starts but found it challenging to score freely against the well-rounded Sri Lankan spin attack.Ultimately, India were bowled out for 230 in 47.5 overs, falling agonizingly short of the target.""The score was gettable but you have to bat well to get that. We batted well in patches but there was no consistent momentum. We started well but knew the game would start once spin comes on. We lost a few wickets and fell behind,"" skipper Rohit said, as quoted by PTI, at the post-match presentation ceremony.India staged a recovery with a 57-run partnership between Rahul and Axar Patel, who contributed 33 runs. However, their quick dismissals shortly after shifted the momentum of the match once again.""We came back through the stand between Axar and Rahul. Disappointed to not get that one run with 14 balls, but I won't read too much,"" the skipper didn't want to be too critical.He believed the wicket was the same for both teams.""The bite was there at the start and then the ball became softer as the seam wore off. It was not a game where you can play your shots (straightway). You had to apply yourself and dig in. Proud of how we fought but it was important to hold our nerves,"" the skipper said.Young Sri Lankan skipper Charith Asalanka, who took the final two wickets with consecutive deliveries, believed they should have won the game.""I did believe we should have done a bit more well to restrict them under 230.

Mohammed Shami eyes India return through domestic cricket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/mohammed-shami-eyes-india-return-through-domestic-cricket/articleshow/112231109.cms,"KOLKATA: Mohammed Shami is still not sure when he would be able to wear the India jersey again, but the pacer has decided to make his comeback through domestic cricket. Shami, who is recuperating from an ankle surgery which he underwent in February this year, has already started bowling at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. However, he is yet to bowl at full throttle.“It’s difficult to say when I will be back. I am trying hard but hopefully you will get to see me in Bengal colours before I don the India jersey again,” he said while being felicitated by the East Bengal club in Kolkata.“I will come to play two-three matches for Bengal and will come fully prepared for it,” he added, making him available for the upcoming domestic season.Interestingly, BCCI secretary Jay Shah has also asked centrally-contracted India players to “prove” themselves in domestic cricket if they aspire to play for the country.The 33-year-old pacer said the injury came to hurt him at a time when he was trying to recover from India’s ODI World Cup final defeat.“We never thought the injury would be this serious. The plan was to address it after the T20 World Cup since we had the IPL and the ICC T20 mega event coming almost back-to-back after last year’s World Cup. But it turned worse during the ODI World Cup itself and I also did not find it right to risk playing on with it,” he recalled. “Even the doctors could not fathom that the injury will take such a serious turn and will take so much time to heal,” the pacer said.India’s highest wicket-taker in the 2023 World Cup, Shami thus had to miss this year’s IPL and also watched India’s T20 World Cup triumph sitting at home.“To tell you frankly, I got tense when South Africa were pulling things back in the final. For a moment memories of our 2023 WC final loss returned to haunt me. But luckily Suryakumar Yadav took that great catch to fetch us the Cup and it took time to sink in that India have actually won it,” Shami stated.Former India skipper Sourav Ganguly , who was also honoured in the evening, also looked forward to Shami’s comeback.“I am actually surprised to see Shami has played only 101 ODI matches. Somebody with his calibre and talent should have played many more,” Ganguly said.The former BCCI chief remembered seeing Shami first while playing for Bengal in late 2000s.“Laxmi (Ratan Shukla) was the Bengal skipper then and I immediately told him that this boy (Shami) is an exceptional talent. I am happy to see him converting that talent into performance,” he added.“It’s said that (Jasprit) Bumrah is the best pacer, but Bumrah has become the best because he got Shami at the other end. So you have pressure from both ends,” Ganguly pointed out.","Mohammed Shami is still not sure when he would be able to wear the India jersey again.

He (Kohli) has been amongst the best when it comes to world cricket. And the fact that I could bat a lot with him during the middle overs was a lot of fun because we used to take a lot of twos and threes in the game, so it has always been fun. It is not like we meet very often, but whenever we get a chance, we make sure that we go on the side and chat for sometime, we will talk about what is going on, so that is our relationship,"" said Dhoni, as quoted by ANI.Virat recently contributed to India's victory in the ICC T20 World Cup , where they defeated South Africa by a narrow margin of seven runs in the final held at Barbados. In what became his last T20I match for India, the 35-year-old played a crucial role, scoring a match-winning 76 runs.Presently, Virat is engaged in the ongoing ODI series as part of India's tour to Sri Lanka. The series, consisting of three matches, commenced on Friday.Following a triumphant knee operation, Dhoni returned to the IPL in 2024. Although he occasionally appeared to be having difficulty and limping on the field, these sporadic struggles did not diminish his desire to amuse the audience.Dhoni batted lower down the order with only a few balls remaining, yet he still managed to score 161 runs in 11 innings, maintaining an impressive average of 53.66 and an extraordinary strike rate of 220.54.

NEW DELHI: Virender Sehwag , one of India's greatest Test openers, expressed his approval of youngsters starting their cricket journeys with T20, if it helps them develop an aggressive streak that enhances their Test performances.Speaking at an event in New Delhi on Friday, where he was revealed as the Brand Ambassador for the inaugural Delhi Premier League (DPL), Sehwag acknowledged that the allure and financial viability of T20 cricket are strong attractors for young players.Sehwag highlighted the evolving nature of Test cricket by referencing England's current style of playing Test matches, where they score at a rate of five runs per over. He reminisced about how Australia scored at four runs per over during his own playing days. He emphasized his belief in the value of attacking play in Test matches, saying it presents more opportunities to secure wins for the team.""The manner in which England is playing Test cricket, scoring at five runs an over.

He noted that without the presence of IPL during his own youth, the aspirations then were different compared to now when youngsters have the IPL and DPL as platforms.""Look, my elder son is 17 and he played three-day cricket for Delhi U16 but there are a lot of boys who might be waiting for that opportunity. When we were 18, there was no IPL.

Will 'Skeleton bone test' be able to end the age fraud menace in Indian grassroots football?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-skeleton-bone-test-be-able-to-end-the-age-fraud-menace-in-indian-grassroots-football/articleshow/112229085.cms,"What is a skeleton bone test?

NEW DELHI: If you google "" age fraud in Indian football "", you'll find countless entries, articles, short-form, long-form, evidence-driven ones, written by countless writers, journalists, and observers of the beautiful game of football.One can find the news of the Indian under-15 football team's captain turning out to be almost eighteen months over the age limit for the Asian under-16 championship in April 2019 or an under-17 player initially rejected by coach Nicolai Adam for his ""unnatural height"" at age 14 was later accepted into the team under Luis Norton de Matos, everything is already so well-documented.While age fraud remains a persistent issue in Indian football, we should now be looking for a more permanent and accurate solution to fight it.And it should begin early, from the grassroots level of Indian football, like the Subroto Cup , an annual school football tournament held in India, named after Subroto Mukerjee, the founder of the Air India Football Club. The prestigious tournament, established in 1960, was once graced by players like Baichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri and will enter its 63rd edition on August 5.Aimed at promoting the sport at the grassroots level, it will host a jaw-dropping 111 teams across three categories, with the sub-junior (under-15) category introduced for the first time this year. It will also have some teams from foreign countries too.To fight the demon of age fraud, the organizers are going to implement the skeleton bone test for the tournament, offering a promising solution to address this issue effectively.During the opening press conference of the Subroto Cup, TimesofIndia.com raised concerns about age fraud. Answering, an Air Force Sports Control Board (AFSCB) spokesperson stated, ""All and every footballer (who will be participating in the Subroto Cup) is registered on the AIFF website. And each of them gets a unique code. We also want to avoid age fraud. As per the AIFF guidelines, a skeleton bone test will be done for the under-15 boys category. For the under-17 category, it will be normal medical. The skeleton bone test or the age-detection test will all be done under the guidelines of AIFF.""The skeleton bone test, commonly known as a bone age assessment, estimates a person's age, especially in children and adolescents, by analyzing their bones.This process typically involves taking an X-ray of the left hand and wrist, as this area contains bones that undergo predictable developmental changes with age. The X-ray is then compared to standard reference images, such as those in the Greulich-Pyle Atlas, to determine the bone's developmental stage, including the appearance of growth plates and the fusion of epiphyses.It is understood that 22 teams in the under-14 category were disqualified and did not participate in the Subroto Cup after failing the age-determination test last time. According to AIFF guidelines, if four or more players from a team are found to be over-aged, that team will be immediately disqualified and barred from the tournament.""Apart from that, all the players who have already registered through AIFF and CRS (central registration system), have their age verified. The people who are coming are less in numbers. So, in times to come, age fraud, which is prevalent in football, is likely to reduce,"" he ended on a positive note, sounding hopeful, as we all are, of a better future.","The Subroto Cup is an annual school football tournament held in India.
