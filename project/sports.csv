Can't change the wicket: Mitchell

FROM THE DUG-OUT

Mohd Siraj has taken just 19 wickets in the 13 Tests that he has played at home.

Kuldeep Yadav has played nine of his 13 Tests at home with an average of 23.39 and a strike rate of 38.

New dad Sarfaraz Khan, who turned 27 on Tuesday, was to join the team later.

PUNE: 'Home advantage' seems to be the rallying call ahead of the second India-New Zealand Test starting here from Thursday. Already trailing 0-1 in the three-match series, India need a win, not just in a bid to clinch the series but also to keep them in the hunt for a World Test Championship final spot.The importance of the match could be gauged by two contrasting practice sessions on Tuesday.The visitors, who will again be without star batter Kane Williamson , had a three-hour stint in the morning. The match pitch was largely covered during this time. However, when the Indians arrived at 1:30 pm, the covers were removed and the pitch was allowed to breathe easy.What followed was a game of instructions to the groundsmen. Captain Rohit Sharma , coach Gautam Gambhir, MCA curator Jyotiram Phalke and BCCI curators Ashish Bhowmick and Taposh Chatterjee were the centre of attraction. First, four members of the ground staff were seen scrubbing the entire 22-yard strip, with emphasis on certain areas. The pitch already looked devoid of grass before this exercise began.Then the grass cutter came out. Are India trying to edge the Kiwis out of the game before it begins? Or is it a simple case of utilising home conditions to the fullest?India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate indicated that all is well with Rishabh Pant - who injured his knee in the Bengaluru Test - and he is in a position to keep wickets too. Pant was at the centre, looking eager to play and observing the pitch closely. Ten Doeschate also said there was nothing wrong with KL Rahul's batting form but they (the team management) ""have to fit seven pieces into six spots"" as recovering top-order batter Shubman Gill is ""good to go"" for thePune Test .The assistant coach also said Akash Deep was ""not far off getting on the team"" since he was bowling really well, and hailed Mohammed Siraj 's quality spell in the second innings in Bengaluru. He also clarified that R Ashwin is not carrying any niggle and didn't blame India's spin unit for the below-par show in the first Test, reminding that there wasn't much help from the pitch.In a nutshell, the home team is playing their cards close to their chest regarding the likely combination and playing XI.Ten Doeschate said, ""Rest assured, we (Team India) are going to do everything in our capability to give the best assessment of that wicket. We got it slightly wrong in Bengaluru the other day. I don't think it was a massive miss. The conditions just caught us on the back foot a little bit (choosing to bat first and getting all out 46). So you can be sure that the preparation and the assessment of the wicket is going to be as close to perfect as we can make it.""Visiting middle-order batsman Daryl Mitchell said, ""One thing we can't do is, we can't change the surface. It's about reacting to what's coming at us and adapting on the fly. As Kiwis, that's what we pride ourselves on. We get stuck in the moment, we stay where our feet are and we stay in the present. And we can't change the wicket. What will be, will be. But I'm sure we'll come up with a plan and find a way to take 20 wickets and score a few runs.""The former WTC winners, who shattered India's dreams in Southampton in 2021, experienced another high on Sunday by winning a Test in India after 36 years. Their women's team also won the World T20 for the first time on the same day.","India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate indicated that all is well with Rishabh Pant - who injured his knee in the Bengaluru Test.

PUNE: Left-arm finger spin is easily the most preferred form of spin for captains against right-handed batters in Test cricket. Left-arm finger spinners can bowl attacking lines - with variations in flight, trajectory and length - around the wicket, bringing LBW into the equation.They can also resort to negative tactics of bowling over the wicket and way outside leg-stump in red-ball cricket. The famous examples are of Ashley Giles against Sachin Tendulkar in 2001 and Nilesh Kulkarni in the Ranji Trophy final of 1997 against Delhi in Gwalior.Of course, off-spinners bowling around the wicket can be far more tricky for the left-handed batters. When a right-handed batter faces a left-arm spinner around the wicket and off-spinner over the wicket, he can see the ball with his full visual arc.But the left-arm spinner's angle makes it more challenging due to the blind-spot situation. Plus the latter can bowl flattish lines more easily due to more flexibility in arm rotation and the angle of the wrist coming into play.This left-arm advantage, besides his smartness, fielding and batting contributions, has made Ravindra Jadeja India's first-choice Test spinner.Four left-arm spinners played the last Test in Bengaluru in the ongoing India-New Zealand series - Ajaz Patel , Rachin Ravindra, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav . None of them was economical. Even off-spinners R Ashwin and Glenn Philips were not spared. Being a wrist spinner, Kuldeep got his share of rough treatment.Despite having another left-arm spinner in their ranks in Axar Patel , India have added off-spinner Washington Sundar to the squad for the second Test in Pune.India's South African assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said here on Tuesday, ""There are four left-handers in the New Zealand team. And we wanted someone who could take the ball away from them.""Ashwin, owner of 250-plus Test dismissals of left-handed batters, also bowls that line. But maybe he is not in peak form. Even Kuldeep takes the ball away from the left-hander. But being a wrist spinner, there is always concern about control and economy rate.With the Pune pitch expected to assist spinners far more than in Bengaluru, NZ may consider playing Mitchell Santner . Definitely, there is history of Indian batsmen struggling against unfancied left-arm spin at home.",Left-arm finger spin is the most preferred form of spin for captains against right-handed batters. Ravindra Jadeja is India's first-choice Test spinner. India have added off-spinner Washington Sundar to the squad for the second Test in Pune.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114486903,imgsize-44060,width-400,resizemode-4/114486903.jpg"

Table-topping Villa

Real Madrid came from behind to beat Borussia Dortmund 5-2 in the Champions League on Tuesday with Vinicius Junior scoring a hat-trick, as Aston Villa maintained their 100 percent record to go top of the table.Vinicius struck three times in the second half as Madrid bounced back from two goals down to inflict further anguish on Dortmund -- in the repeat of last season's final which Real won 2-0.First-half goals in quick succession by Donyell Malen and Jamie Gittens had given Dortmund a two-goal lead at half-time.""Things were very quiet when we got to the dressing room 2-0 down at half-time,"" Vinicius, 24, told Movistar.""But we listened to the boss (coach Carlo Ancelotti) and agreed one simple thing: if we can score first then we'll fight back and win once again.""The 15-times champions duly struck back early in the second period via Antonio Rudiger and Vinicius, before Lucas Vazquez sent Real ahead and the Brazilian netted two more inside the final 10 minutes.After the surprise defeat at Lille last time out, Madrid's hunt for a record-extending 16th Champions League crown is back on track as they move to ninth in the standings, on six points.Malen swept the Germans into the lead on the half-hour following a deft pass from Serhou Guirassy that split open the defence.Madrid defender Eder Militao was then left beating the turf in frustration four minutes later when Gittens flew in at the back post to double Dortmund's lead.Rudiger halved the deficit with a powerful header from a Kylian Mbappe cross on 60 minutes.Vinicius equalised two minutes later by tucking away a stray ball, the goal being awarded by VAR after Mbappe was shown to have been onside in the build-up.A rare Dortmund foray forward resulted in a fine Thibaut Courtois save, with the holders then racing straight down the other end and Vazquez lashing home on 83 minutes.Vinicius then completed his hat-trick in the 86th and 93rd minutes, his second coming after a lung-busting sprint down the line from inside his own half.Arsenal emerged 1-0 winners at home to Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk thanks to an own-goal from the visitors' goalkeeper.Dmytro Riznyk could only grasp at thin air after Gabriel Martinelli had cut in from the left and smacked the ball against the near post before it rebounded back off the goalie and over the line.Leandro Trossard missed a penalty near the end, but Arsenal had already done enough to secure their second win of the tournament.Fellow Premier League side Aston Villa are enjoying an excellent return to European football's top table after 41 years as they won their third match in three Champions League outings this term with a 2-0 victory against Bologna.""We are playing seriously, we are playing focussed, responsible and the team is progressing and mature in everything,"" manager Unai Emery told TNT Sports.John McGinn opened the scoring at Villa Park 10 minutes after the interval and Jhon Duran wrapped up the points in the 64th minute, sending Emery's side to the top of the league phase table on nine points with zero goals conceded.Stuttgart sank Juventus 1-0 in Turin, thanks to a stoppage-time winner by El Bilal Toure.The Italians were reduced to 10 men when Danilo picked up a second yellow while conceding a penalty in the 84th minute.Mattia Perin looked to have saved his side when he stopped the resulting spot-kick from Enzo Millot, but Toure slammed home in the 92nd minute for Stuttgart.PSV Eindhoven surprised Paris Saint-Germain with a Noa Lang goal against the run of play in the first period, before Achraf Hakimi hit back on 55 minutes to ensure the points were shared.AC Milan beat 10-men Club Brugge at the San Siro with Christian Pulisic and a Tijjani Reijnders brace giving the Italians a 3-1 victory.Monaco won 5-1 at home to Red Star Belgrade, while Sporting Lisbon beat Sturm Graz 2-0 in Austria.Last season's Spanish league surprise-packages Girona picked up their first points in the competition with a 2-0 win at home to Slovan Bratislava.On Wednesday, five-time winners Barcelona host six-time champions Bayern Munich and Liverpool visit RB Leipzig.",Real Madrid come from behind to beat Borussia Dortmund 5-2 in the Champions League.

New Zealand squad for white-ball series v Sri Lanka:

Mitchell Santner (c), Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Josh Clarkson, Jacob Duffy, Lockie Ferguson, Zak Foulkes, Dean Foxcroft, Mitch Hay (wk), Henry Nicholls, Glenn Phillips, Tim Robinson, Nathan Smith, Ish Sodhi, Will Young

WELLINGTON: The senior national men's selection committee of New Zealand has called upon promising all-rounder Nathan Smith and up-and-coming wicketkeeper-batsman Mitch Hay for next month’s white-ball tour of Sri Lanka .Bowling all-rounder Smith and wicketkeeper-batsman Hay have earned their maiden Black Caps call-ups, joining a 15-strong squad led by Mitchell Santner for two T20Is and three ODIs starting in Dambulla on November 9.Smith’s maiden call-up continues a memorable twelve months for the 25-year-old who was crowned the Men’s Domestic Player of the Year at the New Zealand Cricket Awards in March, before receiving his first central contract last month.Smith claimed 24 wickets across both white-ball competitions for his domestic team, Wellington Firebirds, last summer, including career-best T20 figures of 4-5 against the Otago Volts in Alexandra in the Dream11 Super Smash. Hay, who debuted for New Zealand A last year, has been a consistent performer across all three formats in recent seasons with the 24-year-old crowned Canterbury’s male Player of the Year in April.The pair joins a fresh-looking Black Caps squad, made up of a host of experienced internationals and a selection of newer faces who have made international debuts in the past two years. Lockie Ferguson will spearhead a pace bowling group featuring Duffy and Canterbury’s Zak Foulkes, alongside all-rounders Smith and Josh Clarkson.Powerful opener Tim Robinson earns his second call-up after excelling on his maiden international voyage to Pakistan in April, along with Clarkson who impressed in last summer’s ODIs against Bangladesh. Leg-spinner Ish Sodhi is the most experienced T20I player in the squad with 117 appearances.Michael Bracewell and Glenn Phillips are the spin-bowling all-rounders, alongside Santner, while Dean Foxcroft offers some off-spin alongside his specialist batting skills. The experience of Phillips, Will Young and Henry Nicholls bolsters the batting, with Nicholls coming off an impressive Ford Trophy campaign last summer where he scored 301 runs in six games at 75.25.Six of the current Black Caps Test squad in India have been included and will relocate straight to Sri Lanka after the third Test against India in Mumbai. Bracewell will join the white-ball squad from New Zealand, following his return home from India this week for the birth of his second child. Tom Blundell, Devon Conway, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Will O’Rourke, Rachin Ravindra, Tim Southee and Kane Williamson were not considered for selection as they prioritise the upcoming three-Test series against England, starting in Christchurch on November 28.Ben Sears (knee), Ben Lister (side-strain), Kyle Jamieson (back) and Adi Ashok (back) were not considered for selection due to injuries. Canterbury spinner Cole McConchie made himself unavailable for selection as he and his wife are expecting twins in early December.New Zealand selector Sam Wells said the mix of youth and experience in the squad reflected the planning for upcoming ICC tournaments.“This tour is the beginning of the build-up towards the ICC Champions Trophy in February 2025 and we also have an eye towards the 2027 one-day Cricket World Cup,” he said. “Building depth is of critical importance due to the demands of the international schedule and the need to peak for pinnacle events. For that reason, it’s particularly exciting to include a number of players that we believe represent the future of the Black Caps,” he said.Wells congratulated Hay and Smith on their maiden call-ups. “It’s a special moment for any player to be selected for the BLACKCAPS for the first time,” he said. “Nathan and Mitch have demanded selection through the weight of performance and I am sure they will be looking forward to showcasing their skills on the international stage.”Wells described Smith as a talented bowling all-rounder who was an elite athlete in the field. “Nathan’s led the Wellington attack with distinction for a number of years across all three formats and we are excited about his potential with the bat.”Wells said Hay was a player the selectors believed had a big future ahead of him. “Mitch has been one of the standout domestic players over the past few seasons and brings all-round ability with both bat and gloves. He’s a very organised batsman and has displayed good power in the white ball formats.”Head coach Gary Stead will lead the coaching group alongside bowling coach Jacob Oram. Former England international James Foster will rejoin the group as batting coach, while full-time batting coach Luke Ronchi heads home to focus on the start of the New Zealand home summer.The New Zealand-based players depart for Sri Lanka on November 4 ahead of the first T20I in Dambulla on November 9.",All-rounder Nathan Smith and wicketkeeper-batsman Mitch Hay have earned their maiden Black Caps call-ups.

Replying to that, Zaman said he ""felt compelled"" to speak on the issue, adding that ""PCB is our institution and we will continue to respect it"".Basit also advised Aaqib to include Zaman in the squad for the Australia tour.""Do send Fakhar Zaman (to Australia).

NEW DELHI: Batting maestro Virat Kohli and head coach Gautam Gambhir were seen sharing light moments during Team India 's net session on Tuesday ahead of the second Test against New Zealand in Pune.The former teammates, who have had their share of on-field rivalries during the IPL in the past, seemed to enjoy each other's company as their casual interaction was a refreshing sight for fans, as India look to bounce back against the Kiwis after losing the first Test by 8 wickets in Bengaluru.With both legends bringing immense experience to the table, the team appears relaxed yet focused. Kohli and Gambhir's light-hearted exchange added a positive vibe to the session.Team India is optimistic that Rishabh Pant will be able to continue as the wicketkeeper in the second Test, despite sustaining a knee injury during the first match, according to assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate.In the opening Test, which marked New Zealand's first victory in India since 1988, Pant played a courageous innings, scoring 99 runs. However, while performing his wicketkeeping duties, he suffered an injury in the same knee that had undergone surgery following a severe car accident in December 2022, which had kept him out of action for over a year.As the home team aims to equalise the three-match series in the upcoming Test in Pune on Thursday, Pant's fitness remains a key concern.Ten Doeschate addressed reporters, saying, ""Rishabh's pretty good. He was having a little bit of discomfort at the end range of his movement with the knee. But fingers crossed he'll be good to keep in this Test as well.""India faced a challenging start in the opening Test, being dismissed for a mere 46 runs. However, a remarkable comeback was staged, led by Pant and Sarfaraz Khan , who formed a formidable 177-run partnership.Sarfaraz, who replaced Shubman Gill in the lineup, showcased his prowess by scoring an impressive 150 runs.With Sarfaraz's maiden Test century, Team India now faces a selection dilemma as Gill is expected to return for the second match. The team management has expressed support for senior batsman KL Rahul , despite his recent inconsistent batting performances.""There's certainly no concerns about KL,"" affirmed ten Doeschate, ""He's batting nicely, he's in a good mental space, but yeah, we're certainly going to have to fit seven pieces into six spots for this Test and look at the pitch now and decide what's going to be best for the team.""",Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir seen sharing light moments during Team India's net session on Tuesday ahead of the second Test against New Zealand in Pune.

New Zealand are upbeat after the eight-wicket win in the rain-hit first Test against India in Bengaluru, and their middle-order batsman Daryl Mitchell says the team is ready to face any challenge, including a spinning track, in the second match of the series in Pune beginning this Thursday.Kiwi pacers bowled India out for an embarrassing 46 in the first innings at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, which is India's lowest total in a Test at home.The hosts did fight back in the second innings by erasing the 356-run Kiwi lead, but eventually lost the match.The black soil in Pune and the red soil in the third Test in Mumbai will present different challenges to the visitors, but Mitchell believes his team is prepared with answers for everything.""Every country has its different challenges. Galle (in Sri Lanka) was a different spinning wicket again to what we'll receive here and the likes of Mumbai in the next Test as well. Different soils, different clays,"" said Mitchell after New Zealand's training session on Tuesday.""It's understanding the threats that each pitch will give you and trying to find ways to negate that, but also try to find ways to put pressure back on the bowlers as well. That's the nature of playing spin over here. You've got to be confident in your plans and how you want to go about your business and try and repeat that for long periods of time,"" he added.It was New Zealand first Test win in India in 36 years, but a wounded India is expected to come back hard, especially keeping the World Test Championship (WTC) points in mind.India are currently on top of the WTC table and would want to consolidate their position with another win.""One thing we can't do is we can't change the surface, so for us it's reacting to what's coming at us and adapting on the fly,"" Mitchell""As Kiwis, that's what we pride ourselves on is (that) we get stuck into the moment, we stay where our feet are and we be as present as possible. We can't change the wicket. What will be, will be. But I'm sure we'll come up with a plan and find a way to take 20 wickets and hopefully score a few runs as well,"" he added.Mitchell was also in awe of Rishabh Pant, who scored 99 despite batting with a dodgy knee in Bengaluru in India's second innings.""Rishabh, he's a world-class player and I seriously respect how he goes about playing his cricket and it was a great partnership (with Sarfaraz Khan). But for us, we know that in Bengaluru, it's a fast-scoring ground. Where we were in the game, we knew that we just need to keep trying to take wickets, keep trying to put pressure on them,"" Mithell concluded.",New Zealand beat India by eight wickets in rain-hit first Test in Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: Former Australian opener David Warner is gearing up for a potential return to Test cricket , offering to fill Australia 's crucial opening slot in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India.After stepping away from the longest format, Warner has expressed his readiness to make a comeback and provide experience at the top of the order.Australia's opening position has faced scrutiny, and Warner’s return could be a timely solution ahead of the high-stakes series.Known for his aggressive style and extensive experience in Aussie conditions, Warner’s inclusion could bolster the home team's chances in the challenging five Test matches against India. His availability will certainly add depth to Australia's lineup.“I’m always available, just got to pick up the phone,” Warner told Code Sports.“I’m always dead serious. Honestly, if they really needed myself for this series, I’m more than happy to play the next Shield game and go out there and play,” said Warner while stressing the sincerity of his proposal, rejecting any notion that his statements were intended as a joke or made in a lighthearted manner.Warner, considered one of Australia's finest opening batsmen, stepped away from the game earlier this year. Throughout his career, he amassed an impressive 8,786 runs and 26 centuries, with his highest score being an unbeaten 335.As the Australian team faces challenges such as Cameron Green 's injury and Steve Smith 's return to his usual position at No. 4 after a short stint as an opener, the 37-year-old cricketer suggests that the team may need to re-evaluate their choices for the opening slots.“I did retire for the right reasons to finish the game, and I wanted to finish. But my hand is up if they desperately need someone. I’m not going to shy away from that,” Warner said, adding that he had cheekily messaged both Australia’s head coach Andrew McDonald and chief selector George Bailey about the situation. “I’ve spoken to Torch (McDonald) and his answer back to me was, ‘you retired,’” Warner laughed. “I don’t think he wants to give me the pleasure of him saying, ‘can you come back?’”",Former Australian opener David Warner is gearing up for a potential return to Test cricket.

NEW DELHI: South African wicket-keeper Kyle Verreynne 's determined century helped his team establish a commanding position on the second day of the first Test against Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka.Verreynne's 114 runs guided South Africa to a total of 308, giving them a substantial 202-run lead over Bangladesh's first innings score of 106.In response, Bangladesh struggled early in their second innings, with Kagiso Rabada , who had reached the milestone of 300 Test wickets on the first day, taking two quick wickets to leave them reeling at 4-2.However, opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy and veteran Mushfiqur Rahim steadied the ship with an unbeaten 42-run partnership, taking Bangladesh to 101-3 at the close of play due to bad light.

Lothar, can you share your thoughts on Bayern Munich’s impending clash with Hansi Flick’s Barcelona in the Champions League?

Will you be happy if Barcelona tops Bayern Munich?

Last season Bayer Leverkusen got the better of Bayern. Your thoughts on how this season will unfold…

You just said that Bayern Munich is fun to watch again…

So, tell us a bit more about how Kompany is bringing fun to Bayern’s game…

How do you see the German national team shaping up?

You played two World Cup finals with Maradona. He admired you as his best rival. Which one did you enjoy the most, Mexico 1986 or Italy 1990?

(Watch Bayern Munich in action in Bundesliga on October 27,2024 against VfL Bochum Live on Sony Sports Ten 2 SD & HD from 8:00 PM IST)

Lothar Matthaus started playing two years after Pele retired and hung up his boots two years before Cristiano Ronaldo made his international debut. In between, the only German to win the FIFA Player of the Year award, Matthaus won everything for club and country, including the World Cup in 1990 as the captain of Die Mannschaft. A Bayern Munich legend, Matthaus talked toabout the Bavarian giants’ impending Champions League clash against Barcelona, Leverkusen’s rise and his memories of his greatest rival Diego Maradona Excerpts from a video interview...You know, I am going for the match tomorrow (Wednesday) to work for my TV channel! I was watching Barcelona play Sevilla, and I saw both teams playing the same style, very high line, attacking early and playing with the fourth defenders on the middle line. They leave a lot of space between the defence and the goalkeeper. This can be the space for the striker. And I am happy for my friend Hansi Flick who is doing a fantastic job in Barcelona. I think it's similar in Bayern Munich with Vincent Kompany who has given Bayern its DNA back. I was missing it for the last two years. It will be a nice game, especially for football fans.I think it's a special game for Hansi because he will not forget his time with Bayern as a coach and as a player. He played four years in Bayern Munich and got good results as a coach when he won seven titles in twelve months. I think it's a fantastic story for him and for Bayern Munich. I think he found in Barcelona a place where he can impart the style he wants. Hansi likes to work the same with the young players and Barcelona has a lot of young, talented players.For me it’s a football game. I’m a fan of Bayern Munich. Because I played twelve years for this club. I’m friends with Hansi. And for this, the best will be if nobody wins (with a cheeky smile). But both teams have lost one game each already. And this means when you lose now, you can have a maximum of 18 points if you win the next five. But nobody can give you the guarantee. You go with 18 points straight into the next round. Or, one must go through a playoff game. No team likes that. The team that loses tomorrow will find it very difficult to qualify straight to the second round. Both Bayern and Barca are leading in their domestic leagues. And both teams have played in the offensive mode. Both have players with similar styles. Two experienced strikers, Harry Kane (Bayern) and Robert Lewandowski (Barca), are in fine goal-scoring form. Both have fast wingers. I think Bayern has the edge because of Manuel Neuer, their goalkeeper who is far more experienced than Pena Sotores, the Barca goalkeeper who is filling in place of injured Marc-Andre ter Stegen.Last year Bayer Leverkusen were almost perfect. Last year they were playing with a positive energy. They were under no pressure. Now the fans and journalists expect similar standards from Leverkusen. That is not possible this season. And Bayern Munich will not play like the last two years. They will be better. Bayern Munich’s curve in on the rise. Leverkusen’s graph has somewhat plateaued. Now they have to fight 95 minutes to win every game. Last year things were looking much easier. They were moving the ball around at will and were controlling the game. Now when they played Bayern, they had 30% possession. Last year they enjoyed 60% possession against them. There is more surround sound that Leverkusen is dealing with this season regarding transfers. You have a lot of stories now around the team in Leverkusen than last season. It creates pressure.Yes.Kompany has understood the pulse of the players. Thomas Tuchel never could do that. Kompany had a good conversation with the players. He allows the players to express themselves, go for attack and score. That’s what players like to do. He has given the players confidence to show their quality. See how Musiala (Yamal) is playing freely. Kompany has been a great defender but if he tries to teach Musiala how to dribble, then it will be a mistake. Tuchel tried to change players. Tried to make them do things that didn’t come naturally to them. Tuchel tried to give the team a style that’s not in their DNA. And I think this was the problem between Tuchel and the team. Tuchel is a good trainer but was not the right coach for Bayern Munich.We cannot be happy with Germany’s results in the last two World Cups where we could not escape from the group. But now we are very happy with our current national coach Julian Nagelsmann. He gives them happiness on the field. They come to the national team with a smile. There was too much disturbance in the German federation, and it affected the national team. Now, director Rudi Voeller is acting as the wall to keep the disturbance away from the team. The teams in Russia and Qatar had quality, no doubt. But outside problems affected the team. Now Voeller is cleaning things up before it reaches the team. Voeller and Nagelsmann's relationship is good for the national team. And we must remember that the fate of the German team and Bayern Munich are intertwined. When Bayern performs well, the national team does well too.I enjoyed Italy 1990 more not only because we won the World Cup. I was playing for Inter Milan at that time. I won the World Cup in my ‘home’ country. I am a German who was living in Italy, and I felt like I was at home. It was a home World Cup. And we had a fantastic team. We were the team to beat. When somebody will win this World Cup, they must first win against Germany. This was not the feeling in Mexico, when we lost the final to Diego Maradona’s Argentina. We lost our third game against Denmark. We played a draw against Uruguay. The feeling was not the same. In Italy, we got tremendous support too. The final in Rome was a ‘home’ game for us. In Mexico City, it was a ‘home’ game for Argentina. We had 65,000 supporters for Germany in Rome. Italian fans also supported us. because most of our national team players then were playing in Serie A. For me, 1990 was better. For Diego, it was 1986.","Lothar Matthaus played with Diego Maradona at the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals. Matthaus won everything for club and country, including the World Cup in 1990 as the captain of Die Mannschaft. Bayern Munich face Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday night. The Bavarian giants are currently top of the Bundesliga.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114484422,imgsize-31496,width-400,resizemode-4/114484422.jpg"
Odisha FC hand East Bengal their sixth successive loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/odisha-hand-east-bengal-their-sixth-successive-loss/articleshow/114484302.cms,"Odisha vs East Bengal (@OdishaFC on X)

Even as Odisha FC ’s fortunes seem to be on the rise, there appears to be no change in the fate of East Bengal .And on Tuesday, at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar, hosts Odisha added to their woes as they eked out a convincing 2-1 victory over the Kolkata giants, who were also reduced to 10 men for the last 15 minutes on way to their sixth defeat in as many games.Dimitrios Diamantakos did cancel out a Roy Krishna 22nd-minute opener with the last kick of the first half, incidentally from the spot. However, Oscar Bruzon’s men had no answer to a Mourtada Fall aerial winner as Sergio Lobera ’s men climbed to the sixth spot on the Indian super League table with seven points from five matches.There was, however, no respite for East Bengal who are languishing at the bottom of the 13-team table — still waiting for their first point after a run of six defeats so far.The visitors made their aggressive intent clear from the first whistle and Amrinder Singh had to come to Odisha’s rescue in the 5th minute to clear a Nandhakumar Sekar shot after Mohamad Rakip sent in a swerving cross to the far left box from the right wing to his onrushing teammate.Just a minute later, it was Diamantakos who challenged the Odisha custodian again with his left-footed shot from the right side of the box. In the 11th minute, Amrinder was once again called into action as East Bengal’s Majih Talal made a run into the middle of the box, past the Odisha defenders, but could not beat the outstretched right hand of the Odisha goalkeeper.The missed chances gave Odisha the time and determination to grow into the game and soon they found the weak link in Bruzon’s tactic of high press that left a huge space for the Odisha playmakers to utilise and feed the poaching skills of Krishna.With East Bengal’s most expensive player — Anwar Ali — clearing the Fijian’s attempt just a minute earlier with a brilliant tackle, an inch-perfect Isak Ralte cross from the Odisha half found Krishna just outside the box in the 22nd minute. And the veteran ISL striker made no mistake to send it past East Bengal goalkeeper Prabhsimran Singh for his first goal this season.East Bengal, who had nine shots on target till the 45th minute but none inside the net, were lucky to have not fallen behind again as the Odisha counter-attacks became more optimistic. However, they lacked Krishna’s perfect final touch to increase the lead.Meanwhile, the Kolkata giants found the lifeline in the 4th minute of added time when a shot from Frenchman Talal struck the hand of defender Thoiba Singh and the referee pointed to the spot. The visitors equalised with their 10th shot on goal as Diamantakos’s penalty kick was powerful enough to beat Amrinder despite the ’keeper going the right way for the save.Both teams came back stronger after the change of ends and kept up their pursuit for a winner. While Nandhakumar’s optimistic piledriver went over the Odisha goal in the 67th minute, Odisha were awarded a foul in the 69th with their next attack.Despite having an off-season so far, Fall put Odisha in the lead again by rising above his marker and converting the header from the ensuing freekick by Ahmed Jahouh.While East Bengal tried to get back on their feet and find another answer, it was Odisha who looked more likely to change the scoresheet with Krishna, and substitute Diego Mauricio in the last 10 minutes, failing to make the most of some positive moves into the box.The frustration, however, got the better of East Bengal as Provat Lakra was sent off for his second yellow card of the game for an unnecessary tackle on Jahouh in the 76th minute. The visitors seemed to have given up as Odisha kept toying near their defence, with Bruzon — who, too, earned himself a yellow — not a witness to the disappointment on the field.",Odisha FC beat East Bengal 2-1 at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar. Mourtada Fall and Dimitrios Diamantakos scored the goals for the hosts. Roy Krishna opened the scoring for the visitors in the 22nd minute.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114484322,imgsize-73922,width-400,resizemode-4/114484322.jpg"

While hosts Odisha FC have managed just one win to take into the international break and sit on 10th spot on the Indian Super League table, visiting East Bengal FC are still on the lookout for their first point to take them out of the bottom of the 13-team table.However, the fans at the home turf are sure to anticipate a firework duel between these two eastern outfits — as has been the case earlier — and an end-to-end battle that pushes each team to put their best efforts forward to walk away with three points.Sergio Lobera and his men are finally discovering their mojo this campaign and this fixture might give them their best opportunity to go all the way, given their seven-game-long unbeaten streak against East Bengal in ISL, in which they have struck 23 goals.“Odisha FC need to get the best performance possible from the entire squad,” Odisha head coach Sergio Lobera said at the pre-match press conference on Monday.“We need to manage the squad well. If you have a very good squad, you have more chances to win the game. If you have good options coming from the bench, we can change the game. We need to manage the timings and substitutions well and this is our job as the coaches to get the best performance possible not only from the players who are starting the match, but also the ones who are coming from the bench.”While the coach’s tactics will be crucial, the hosts will depend on the likes ofDiego Mauricio and Hugo Boumous to fire as Lobera looks to move upwards on the table. It will be the same kind of expectation at the other end from their yet-to-fire stars like Dimitrios Diamantakos and newest recruit, Frenchman Madih Talal .One-match-old East Bengal coach Oscar Bruzon pointed at specific facets of the gameplan in which his team needs to uplift their performance and stressed on the importance of a win in raising the team’s confidence.“East Bengal need a positive result,” the Spaniard said on Monday. “We need to understand where to shape, the offensive triggers, to be more intense, to win duels, win second balls, to go big on the defensive transitions and to have fewer spaces in between our lines. We need a positive result to keep everyone in full confidence.”With a victory and all three points on both teams’ radar, Kalinga awaits nothing short of a great contest to decide the same.",Odisha FC host East Bengal in the Indian Super League (ISL) on Tuesday. The hosts are unbeaten in seven games and sit 10th in the table.

Khalid Jamil may be a man of few words but evidently not a man of few feats. And on Monday, at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur, his men took another leap of success as Jamshedpur FC overtook Mohun Bgan Super Giant on the Indian Super League (ISL) table with a 2-1 win against Hyderabad FC .The win — scripted with first-half strikes from Rei Tachikawa and Jordan Murray — took the Men of Steel to the second spot on the table, banishing the Kolkata giants to third place with 12 points from five matches and staying just a point behind current leaders Bengaluru FC Hyderabad, meanwhile, could not climb out of the penultimate position with just one point from four games.The southern visitors’ desire to rise from their 12th spot on the table was evident from the beginning as Lenny Rodriguez, Ramhlunchhunga and Abdul Rabeeh all had shots on target in the opening 25 minutes.However, the deadlock was broken a little against the run of play in the 29th minute when Jamshedpur winger Sanan Mohammad sent a cross from the left of the box that reached Imran Khan at the other end of the box. But the midfielder’s shot was saved by Hyderabad custodian Arshdeep Singh before the rebound reached the feet of an onrushing Tachikawa, who ran in with the ball for his second goal of the season, continuing his goalscoring touch against the same opponents.The goal seemed to have raised the home side’s confidence as they went on the lookout for more. While Arshdeep was able to save an optimistic shot from Tachikawa in the 34th minute, he was not able to repeat the feat 10 minutes later.This time, too, it was Sanan who was the provider as he sent a through to Murray after a good transition and a pass from Tachikawa. The Australian was exquisite in his finish as he chipped the ball with his right feet over the reach of the onrushing Arshdeep.Hyderabad were more determined for a comeback after the change of ends as they produced some exciting moves that didn’t take long to attain the desired result. However, it was as much the miscommunication between the Jamshedpur backline as was the presence of mind of Cy Goddard that earned them the goal.The miscommunication led defender Pratik Chaudhari to duck the ensuing header in the box from a throw-in on a verbal call from Albino Gomes and Japanese Goddard made no mistake to sneak into the goalmouth medley and send it past the goalkeeper.The goal raised hopes in the Thangboi Sinto-coached side for an equaliser even as Jamshedpur began to get their act together after the shock of conceding. And, in the end, it was Jamil’s men who came out on top and made a statement and a place for themselves among the title contenders this season.","Jamshedpur FC overtook Mohun Bgan Super Giant on the Indian Super League (ISL) table with a 2-1 win against Hyderabad FC.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian superstar Neymar Jr marked his return to professional football after a year-long absence due to injury, featuring in Al-Hilal 's dramatic 5-4 victory over Al-Ain in the Asian Champions League group stage on Monday.The high-scoring encounter at the Hazza bin Zayed Stadium saw Al-Hilal establish a commanding 5-3 lead by the 77th minute, fueled by Salem Al-Dawsari's hat-trick and goals from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Renan Lodi .It was at this point that Neymar replaced the injured Nasser Al-Dawsari, marking his first appearance since suffering a cruciate ligament injury during a World Cup qualifier with Brazil in November 2022.Despite the lengthy layoff, Neymar displayed glimpses of his trademark flair and nearly found the back of the net late in the game, only to be denied after a swift counter-attack.Al-Ain, led by Soufiane Rahimi's own hat-trick, mounted a late comeback, converting a penalty in stoppage time to reduce the deficit to a single goal. Al-Hilal, however, weathered the storm in a tense period of added time to secure the victory and maintain their position atop the West Asian group standings.This win further solidifies Al-Hilal's dominance, as they also currently lead the Saudi Pro League with a comfortable 21 points.Understandably emotional after the final whistle, Neymar expressed relief and satisfaction with his return, stating, ""I feel good, it's so hard. I always have a good team. But I'm so happy. I'm back.""Neymar's return is a significant boost for Al-Hilal, who acquired the Brazilian forward from Paris Saint-Germain for a reported €90 million in August 2022.Prior to his injury, Neymar had only featured in five games for the Saudi Arabian club, grappling with persistent muscle issues.His return injects a much-needed dose of star power and attacking prowess into Al-Hilal's lineup as they aim to conquer both domestic and continental competitions.",Al-Hilal beat Al-Ain 5-4 in the Asian Champions League on Monday.

Learning lessons from last campaign

CHENNAI: Chennai will play host to the Indian Women’s League ( IWL ) for the first time as Tamil Nadu-based club Sethu FC will hold their home matches at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium .Last season, when the home-and-away format was introduced in the IWL, Sethu played their home games at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco after Chennai’s Nehru stadium was made unavailable.Since the venue hosted the Khelo India Youth Games and Indian Super League (ISL) club Chennaiyin FC’s matches in the early part of the year, Sethu were forced to shift base.This time, Sethu, over the coming months, will share the Nehru stadium with Chennaiyin, who are currently competing in ISL Season 11. It is to be recalled that the IWL fixtures are yet to be announced by the All India Football Federation (AIFF).“We approached the Tamil Nadu government (which owns the venue) and the process was completed swiftly. For every game, we will rent the stadium for the matchday and the day prior to the matchday,” Sethu founder and owner M Seeni Mohaideen told TOI on Monday.Seeni said that the club would benefit from playing on home soil. “We are the only team from TN in the IWL; we have been playing for the last eight years. There was no home-and-away format in the IWL until last season; when we won the title in the 2018-19 season, we did not get to play at home. We have been one of the most consistent teams in the league. Playing at home will be a good thing and will give us exposure,” added Seeni.After an underwhelming campaign last season, finishing fourth, Sethu are keen to perform much better. They have made big changes behind the scenes, including the appointment of Shareef Khan, who has replaced Kanan Priolkar as the head coach.“Last season, we had a few setbacks like injuries to key players and unavailability of some players due to other reasons. To ensure that we have a good matchday squad for every game, we have decided to include 30 players in the squad. We have made good foreign signings and the announcements will be made soon. All IWL teams are well balanced and I feel that there will be stiff competition for the title,” said Seeni.","Chennai will play host to the Indian Women’s League ( IWL ) for the first time.

Kolkata: Mohammedan Sporting faced some home truth again as Kerala Blasters rode a second-half fightback to beat the Indian Super League debutants 2-1 at the Kishore Bharati Stadium on Sunday.The hosts went ahead in the 28th minute when Brazilian Carlos Franca earned a penalty and his Uzbekistani teammate Mirjalol Kasimov converted it much to the joy of the partisan crowd.But Kerala Blasters stormed back into the contest through goals from Kwame Peprah (67) and Jesus Jimenez (75).This was the first victory in three consecutive matches on the road for Mikael Stahre ’s Blasters, who had earlier drawn their clashes with NorthEast United FC and Odisha FC.Mohammedan SC , on the other hand, remain winless at home, their latest setback coming after a 0-3 mauling at the hands of Mohun Bagan SG two weeks ago. Their defensive frailties came to the fore again as they lost another plot after taking the lead. Andrey Chernyshov ’s side suffered an early jolt when Ghanaian defender Joseph Adjei had to leave the ground with a serious leg injury, thus paving the way for new recruit Frenchman Florent Ogier to make his debut in the black-and-white colours.The hosts, however, took the lead deservedly when Franca latched on to a brilliant ball from his half and fell under the challenge of Blasters custodian Som Kumar, leading to the penalty. Kasimov sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot.Blasters announced their intention of a comeback when they finished the first half with Jimenez hitting the crosspiece.Franca missed a golden chance to extend the lead on the hour mark when he went for glory himself instead of sending the ball to an unmarked Fanai at the other end. Thus reprieved, Blasters came calling, Adrian Luna whipping in a long cross and Noah Sadaoui — who was a constant threat to the hosts’ box from the left — sent it back across the six-yard box for Peprah to make it 1-1, two minutes after replacing fellow defender Alexandre Coeff.Sadaoui then missed a sitter, failing to beat Mohammedan SC goalkeeper Padam Chhetri from a one-on-one situation. But it didn’t prove costly as Jimenez rose to the occasion, meeting Huidrom Naocha’s cross with a perfect header, taking Ogier’s challenge in his stride.Fanai could have salvaged a draw deep in stoppage-time but Blasters goalkeeper Som produced a brilliant save to ensure that his team returned home with a win.",Kerala Blasters beat Indian Super League debutants Mohammedan Sporting 2-1 at the Kishore Bharati Stadium.

Akanksha Nitture stunned second seed Vaishnavi Adkar to set up an all-Indian final against Tanisha Kashyap in the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru on Saturday.In a match of see-sawing fortunes, Mumbai girl Akanksha overcame ebb and flow in her own form as well as a three-hour rain interruption to beat Pune's Vaishnavi 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 in the semifinals of the hard court event.Tanisha pulled off an upset of her own in the other semifinal at the KSLTA stadium , beating fourth seed Carolann Delaunay of New Caledonia 6-1, 7-5.Akanksha, who reached the quarterfinals last week in Mysuru, remained in contention in doubles as well.The 21-year-old and local girl Soha Sadiq, the reigning National champions, were leading 5-4 against Russia's Arina Arifullina and Jo-Leen Saw of Malaysia when rain returned to suspend play for the day.The winners will face top seeds Humera Baharmus and Pooja Ingale, who powered into the final with a 7-6 (2), 6-4 victory over Sai Samhitha and Diva Bhatia.Akanksha came out with her guns blazing from the get-go, troubling her rival, who is yet to fully recover from chikungunya, with her big serves, deep returns and clever drop shots, which Vaishnavi, also suffering from an abdominal strain, made any effort to get to.Despite the limitations and icing her swollen knee during the changeovers, she troubled Akanksha with her power-packed ground strokes, coming up with winners off both flanks.Vaishnavi broke back in the eighth and 10th games to level at 5-5. But before much damage could be done, Akanksha stepped up her game a notch to close out the set in the 12th game.She broke Vaishnavi's serve in the first game of the second set before the heavens opened up.The three-hour delay seemed to break Akanksha's momentum. The second seed didn't let that affect her as she began to dictate terms and took the issue to the decider.She wasn't the same player in the final set, as she was broken in the fourth game, serving a double fault at breakpoint.Akanksha, whose previous best was a semifinal appearance in Ahmedabad two years ago, didn't prolong her rival's agony, closing out the match by breaking Vaishnavi's serve again in the eighth game.","Akanksha Nitture beat Pune's Vaishnavi Adkar 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 in the semifinals of the hard court event.

Every kid watches cartoons, right? But I didn’t watch cartoons. I just used to watch sports, tennis specially.“So, my parents were like, ‘she likes it.We have to put her on to that’. So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.
