IPL 2024: Kuldeep Yadav steals a march over Yuzvendra Chahal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2024-kuldeep-yadav-steals-a-march-over-yuzvendra-chahal/articleshow/109964133.cms,"|

|

Around five years back, Kuldeep Yadav 's career was at the crossroads, especially in the white-ball formats. Playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders , he endured a horrid IPL 2019, taking just four wickets in nine matches @71.50, with an economy rate of 8.66. In the ODI World Cup that year in England, he managed to take just six wickets in seven matches@56.16, with an economy rate of 5.02.Many felt that he needed to bowl much quicker through the air, as he was giving time to the batters to play their shots. However, those days are now well behind the Chinaman bowler from Kanpur.In the current IPL, Kuldeep, now bowling much faster through the air (so quick that he even broke a bail in one of the matches when he cleaned up a batter), has been brilliant, having taken 14 wickets in just nine matches@20.50, and an economy rate of 8.20.Despite missing a few games due to a groin niggle, the 29-year-old didn't lose his rhythm. His fine show with the ball has been critical to the Delhi Capitals . They are still in the race for a playoffs berth, having won six of their 12 matches. It's clear that Kuldeep, presently probably the best spinner in IPL-2024, will be India's No 1 spinner in the T20 World Cup next month in the West Indies and USA.In comparison, Yuzvendra Chahal , whose impressive start for the Rajasthan Royals in this IPL helped him stage a return into the Indian team for the World Cup, has struggled for form in the last few matches, and, in a worrying sign for India, is being taken apart by the batters. In the last five matches, Yuzi's figures read 1-54, 1-48, 0-41, 0-62 & 1-48.When batters have gone after him, Chahal has struggled to find a way to survive. The flat pitches and the 'Impact Player' rule, which allows another specialist batter to come in, have hurt his case.At this rate, Chahal could mostly be sitting in the dugout in the World Cup, with Kuldeep joining Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel in the XI. Still, Chahal, who has bagged 14 wickets in 11 matches@29.71 in the IPL so far and has performed superbly in this tournament in the past, can bounce back with a much better show in the business end of the tournament.",Kuldeep Yadav has taken 14 wickets in just nine matches for Delhi Capitals. The 29-year-old will be India's No 1 spinner in the T20 World Cup next month. Yuzvendra Chahal has struggled for form in the last few matches.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109964104,imgsize-53214,width-400,resizemode-4/109964104.jpg"

This is not five runs per over wicket.Somebody needed to show intent. They had one of the slowest Powerplays. That took the innings nowhere. When the opposition team has Travis Head , Heinrich Klaasen, your intention should be to go at 10s and over. 160-170 will never be enough,"" Hayden remarked while doing commentary, pinpointing the fundamental flaw in LSG's approach to batting.Despite LSG's head coach, Justin Langer , suggesting that 160 would be a competitive total on the allegedly difficult pitch, Sunrisers Hyderabad's record-breaking chase swiftly debunked that notion. Travis Head's explosive unbeaten knock of 89 off just 30 balls, supported by Abhishek Sharma 's blistering 75 not out, underscored the missed opportunity for Lucknow.Following the defeat, LSG find themselves in a precarious position in the IPL standings, with their playoff hopes hanging by a thread.Former RCB coach Mike Hesson emphasized the impact of injuries on LSG's bowling lineup, pointing out the absence of key players like Mayank Yadav and Mohsin Khan.""I think yes,"" Hesson remarked on Jio Cinema, regarding LSG's dwindling playoff chances. ""With Mayank Yadav missing, they don't really have that X-factor in their bowling. Even Mohsin Khan didn't play today. Ravi Bishnoi hasn't been at his best this IPL. So their bowling attack doesn't look threatening. Their slide will continue,"" he added.The successive defeats have cast a shadow over Lucknow Super Giants' campaign in this year's IPL, raising questions about their ability to bounce back and secure a playoff berth amidst mounting challenges.","Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden criticizes Lucknow Super Giants.

NEW DELHI: Real Madrid showcased their renowned comeback prowess to secure a dramatic 2-1 second-leg victory over Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabeu , sealing their path to the Champions League final .Trailing behind on aggregate, Real faced the prospect of elimination as Bayern substitute Alphonso Davies unleashed a stunning strike in the 68th minute.However, a late surge from Real, orchestrated by substitute Joselu, turned the tide of the match.Joselu's equalizer in the 88th minute, capitalizing on a rare error from Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer , injected new life into the Bernabeu.

NEW DELHI: Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma 's unreal assault, featuring blistering half-centuries, propelled Sunrisers Hyderabad to the fastest chase of a 160-plus target en route their convincing 10-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL on Wednesday.Pursuing a relatively modest target of 166, Head (89 not out, 30 balls, 8x4, 8x6) and Sharma (75 not out, 28 balls, 8x4, 6x6) made a mockery of the LSG bowling attack, effortlessly finding the fence and clearing the ropes at will, cruising to victory in a mere 9.4 overs.The comprehensive win catapulted SRH to the third spot on the points table with 14 points from 12 matches, while LSG find themselves in a precarious position at sixth place, having accumulated 12 points from an equal number of games.The result also meant that five-time champions Mumbai Indians, currently ninth with eight points from 12 matches, are out of the play-off race.The dance of destruction by Head and Sharma even left the legendary Sachin Tendulkar gushing.""A destructive opening partnership would be an understatement tonight. Had these boys batted first, they would've scored 300,"" Tendulkar wrote in his X account.The Head and Sharma show came after SRH bowlers started brilliantly before losing the plot a bit.Ayush Badoni (55 not out off 30 balls) and Nicholas Pooran (48 not out off 25 balls) stitched crucial 95-runs off 55 balls for the unbeaten fifth-wicket stand to guide LSG to a competitive 165 for four on a sluggish pitch.But the Head and Sharma took any hint of competition out of the match once they bludgeoned 107 runs in the Power Play.It was an awesome hitting display from the Indo-Australian pair as they didn't spare a single LSG bowler, clobbering them to all parts of the ground.LSG's decision to start with Krishnappa Gowtham also backfired badly as both Head and Sharma, who are really good against spin, dismantled the off-spinner.Such was the brutal assault that the likes Yash Dayal, Ravi Bishnoi and Naveen-ul-Haq were also taken to the cleaners, raining sixes and fours.Earlier, LSG were struggling at 27 for 2 at the end of the powerplay after opting to bat.The visitors lost Quinton de Kock, who replaced an injured Mohsin Khan, early, caught brilliantly by Nitish Kumar Reddy at deep backward square-leg off Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/12) in the third over.Bhuvneshwar struck again in the fifth over, dismissing the dangerous Marcus Stoinis but the credit for the dismissal should go to young Sanvir Singh, who took a stunning diving catch just inches from the ground at mid-on.The pitch also didn't help LSG's cause as the ball was coming on to the bat a bit slow, as their batters found it difficult to find the timing.While skipper KL Rahul (29) held one end up, Krunal Pandya (24) took it on himself to up the ante.Krunal pummelled Jaydev Unadkat for a six over long-on and then hit the bowler straight over his head for another maximum to accumulate 15 runs in the eighth over.Rahul hit the first boundary of LSG innings in the 10th over, slamming SRH skipper Pat Cummins over mid-off.But Rahul never looked at his usual best as he struggled to get his timing and finally departed in search of quick runs, caught by T Natarajan at deep backward square leg in the final delivery of the same over.SRH were brilliant on the field as Cummins' direct throw from mid-on sent Krunal packing soon when the batter went for a quick single.Badoni pressed the feet on the accelerator soon with three boundaries of left-arm pacer Natarajan's 14th over which yielded 17 runs.The Lucknow side finally got going as Pooran and Badoni struck a six and a four to accumulate 12 runs off the 15th over bowled by leg-spinner Vijayakanth Viyaskanth.They showed intent from the word go and didn't hesitate to play their strokes when the opportunity was presented to them.It was brilliant batting from Badoni as he swept and cut Natarajan for two consecutive boundaries in the 17th over.Badoni displayed some cheeky shots as the right-hander notched up his fifty in 28 balls.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Lucknow Super Giants by 10 wickets in IPL.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: West Indies pace legend Courtney Walsh expressed no surprise at India's strategic move to include four spinners in their T20 World Cup squad, citing it as a strategic alignment with their strengths.India's selectors recently announced the inclusion of Kuldeep Yadav , Yuzvendra Chahal , Axar Patel , and Ravindra Jadeja in their 15-man squad for the prestigious event, scheduled to commence on June 1 in the USA and West Indies.""India picking four spinners I'm not surprised... it seems to be their strength,"" Walsh told PTI on the sidelines of the launch of the Big Cricket League.""West Indies have picked three spinners. It's going to be different conditions and everybody has to balance the team,"" Walsh added.India's skipper Rohit Sharma recently revealed his preference for having four spinners in the side, though he didn't explicitly state the rationale behind this decision. Speculation suggests it could be due to the slow and sluggish wickets expected in the West Indies or the unusually early starts.Walsh, a highly esteemed figure in cricketing circles, believes that India's choice aligns with their potential challenges on the pitch. He further acknowledges that India possesses a quality pace-bowling unit to complement their spinners, indicating a balanced approach to their bowling lineup.""India still have quality fast bowlers, most of the teams do, so it will be a very competitive tournament. The majority of the teams have good-quality fast bowlers and spinners.""It's (the tournament) going to be dominated by the bat possibly. But it is difficult to predict who is going to win it, difficult to predict which bowler is going to be a standout. The teams that execute well will be successful.""With West Indies co-hosting the tournament, former captain Courtney Walsh holds an optimistic outlook on the two-time champions' prospects at the upcoming T20 World Cup this summer.""I'm expecting them to do very well. It's a nice balanced team and I am very optimistic that they'll play quality cricket. The group is not the easiest but once we reach the super sixes, there's a really good chance.""The first bowler to achieve the historic milestone of 500 Test wickets, gracing the cricketing field from 1984 to 2001, was none other than Walsh himself. Over the course of his illustrious career spanning 17 years, Walsh claimed a total of 519 scalps from 132 Tests.Partnered with another legendary fast bowler, Curtly Ambrose, Walsh formed one of the most formidable and iconic pace-bowling pairs in cricketing history.Remarkably, Walsh enjoyed a relatively injury-free career, a testament to his exceptional skill, endurance, and dedication to the game.Asked what advice he'll give to Bumrah, Walsh said, ""Stay fit, have fun. The more you play the more experienced you get.""""It's all about managing the injuries well. That will help him become fitter, stronger and better. You can only play if you are fit enough.""Young pace sensation Joseph captured the cricketing world's attention earlier this year with his remarkable skills, playing a pivotal role in bowling West Indies to their first Test victory in Australia in 27 years.Amidst the trend of Caribbean players participating in various T20 leagues worldwide, Walsh emphasises the importance of protecting the 24-year-old Joseph to ensure a sustainable and prosperous career for the promising talent.""West Indies have to (protect him), he's got to protect himself. When I watch his interviews he has a very level head, which is very, very good to see. He loves the game, has passion for the game.""I think the West Indies have to make sure to look after him. Keep him injury-free for longevity.

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans ' star spinner Rashid Khan on Wednesday revealed that he underwent back surgery after the ICC World Cup last year, citing the challenges of playing the tournament at a suboptimal fitness level.After Afghanistan's sixth-place finish in the 2023 World Cup in India, Rashid took a break from cricket to undergo back surgery. He made his comeback during a T20I series against Ireland in March this year.Currently, he is playing for Gujarat in the Indian Premier League, where he has taken eight wickets and scored 102 runs at an average of 20.40.Speaking to ESPNCricinfo's The Cricket Monthly, Rashid said that before the World Cup, the doctor had told him to go for surgery, but he delayed it to represent his country in the tournament. He decided to take a couple of injections before the tournament.""Even before the World Cup, the doctor had told me I had to go for surgery, but I deferred the decision since I wanted to play that tournament. He warned me the back issue could become bigger in case I played, especially considering it was 50 overs, where my workload would be significantly large because I would play a minimum of nine ODIs. He feared I would need a major surgery. But I told him I had to play in the World Cup. I cannot say no to the World Cup. So we decided I would take a couple of injections before the tournament,"" said Rashid.Rashid mentioned that after their significant victory over Pakistan, he celebrated vigorously, dancing all night without showing any signs of his back issue.""Our physio kept reminding me I needed to be careful. The entire Afghanistan squad was surprised to see me dancing and celebrating; they had never seen me in that kind of mood. That happiness was different because that jashn was in the whole country [Afghanistan],"" he added.However, when he woke up the next day, he was in complete pain and played the rest of the tournament on painkillers and low fitness. ""I told the physio I couldn't walk properly. He just gave me such a hard stare. I used painkillers to keep going, but in the final three matches of the World Cup, I was literally playing at 40 per cent fitness,"" he said.Rashid said that his back issues were affecting him a lot while bending and the pain was going down to his shins.""I could not sleep. I would sleep only at four or five in the morning at times. The only way I could sleep was by taking sleeping tablets and painkillers,"" he said.He said that during the final three games of his side during the World Cup, his hamstrings were sore, forcing him to slide rather than walk.""I could not lift my feet properly. I started having all my meals in my room. By the last match, the coach said to me I did not need to play, but I said I would manage with painkillers. Because when I was warmed up, I was not feeling the discomfort. I could run, dive and all that. But after the game, for like an hour, I could not move,"" he added.Rashid said that after the tournament, he decided to go for surgery. ""The doctor said to me, ""This is your first MRI and this is your second MRI, after the World Cup, so you see how much bigger the disc bulge has become."" I was nervous, to be honest. It was my first ever surgery in my career,"" he added.The spinner revealed that his doctor revealed to him that a failed surgery could mark the end of his playing career, which left him tensed.""I had to sign that undertaking. I was so tense the whole night before the surgery. I didn't tell my family that I was having surgery,"" he added.Rashid said that during the surgery, the entire GT staff, including head coach Ashish Nehra, director of cricket Vikram Solanki and assistant coach Naeem Amin, supported him a lot. He also revealed that he was pain-free following the surgery, but wanted to return to the game quickly.""Ashish bhai, who had gone through lots of surgeries, spoke to me a lot and told me not to worry. When I came out of the surgery, I felt no pain. I felt so relieved. The rehab part, though, was the toughest. I badly wanted to return to playing and was missing it. In fact, I was part of the Afghanistan squad for the T20 series in India in January this year because I wanted to have the feeling of being on the ground,"" he added.Rashid revealed that during the last T20I against India, which involved two super overs, he instinctively became ready to bat despite the fact he was not in the eleventh.""Finally, when I started to play again, it was one of the best feelings to be back on the field. I thank Naeem a lot because he helped me a lot during my rehab when I was in the UK for nearly two months. He would come early every single day at 5-6 am and stay late and help with my recovery,"" he added.Rashid opened up that the surgery has affected his bowling too, like while bowling his wrong'un because he would need to use his back more and it would scare him if there was any bit of stiffness in his back.""That feeling lasted through the series against Ireland, which Afghanistan played before the IPL, and then, like I said, the first few matches here (the IPL),"" he added.The spinner spoke to the franchise's video analyst, Sandeep Raju, about his problem and Raju revealed to him that he was not hitting his lengths right like before.""He also pointed out that my wrong'un was finishing on the leg stump instead of the middle. That is when I told him I was not getting the feeling, because I am not using my whole body. I am just using the fingers. There is nothing wrong with my back, but I only had this fear in my mind: what if the injury resurfaced?.""""Then, two days before the IPL match in Lucknow, I told him [Raju] I would do spot bowling, which I did for about an hour. I might have bowled 14-15 overs in that session without any strain on my back. I bowled again the next day, on the eve of the match. That's when I felt everything was okay,"" he concluded.","Rashid Khan underwent back surgery after the ICC World Cup last year.

Kylian Mbappe: Kylian Mbappe's final match for Paris Saint-Germain ends in Champions League semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/champions-league/top-stories/kylian-mbappes-final-match-for-paris-saint-germain-ends-in-champions-league-semi-final-defeat-to-borussia-dortmund/articleshow/109933341.cms,"NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe 's dream of bidding farewell to Paris Saint-Germain by leading them to their first-ever Champions League title has been shattered following their unexpected semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. The 2018 World Cup winner, who is set to leave PSG when his contract expires at the end of the season, likely to join Real Madrid , had hoped to sign off by guiding the club to European glory at Wembley next month.Despite PSG's status as favourites and their 31 attempts on goal, they failed to overturn a one-goal first-leg deficit, with Mats Hummels scoring the only goal of the night to secure a 2-0 aggregate victory for Dortmund. Mbappe, one of four PSG players to hit the woodwork in the second half, admitted that they needed to be more clinical in front of goal.""I don't really like to talk about bad luck. When you are good, you don't hit the post, you score. I tried to help the best I could. When I say we needed to be more clinical, I am the one who has to be scoring. But this is life, we need to pick ourselves up,"" Mbappe said after the loss.The defeat marks the closest Mbappe has come to lifting the European Cup with his hometown team, for whom he is their all-time top scorer with 255 goals, including 42 in the Champions League. The French sports daily L'Equipe described the result as ""the end of his dream"" and gave a scathing assessment of Mbappe's performance, rating him just two out of 10.PSG's elimination by a team sitting fifth in the Bundesliga is seen as a significant disappointment for a club that has invested heavily since the Qatari takeover in 2011. It is the latest in a series of Champions League knockout round failures, with their 6-1 defeat by Barcelona in 2017 still the most notable.Despite the presence of Mbappe, this PSG side was not seriously expected to reach this stage of the competition, having undergone a major overhaul following the departures of Lionel Messi and Neymar. Coach Luis Enrique, brought in to oversee the new project, acknowledged that his objective was to compete as well as possible for every trophy. Mbappe's final game for the club will now be the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25.The lack of experience at this level may have ultimately cost PSG, with their starting line-up having an average age of just 24 years and 157 days, the youngest for any team in a Champions League semi-final since Arsenal faced Manchester United in 2009. Captain Marquinhos emphasized the need to focus on the positives, saying, ""We need to remember that it is a new project with a new coach, with lots of changes. There are lots of positives and good things to take forward into next season.""However, it remains to be seen how PSG can improve their chances of winning the Champions League without Mbappe, even with the likely significant investment in a replacement.The coach's strategy of resting Mbappe or substituting him in domestic league games over the past three months, apparently in preparation for next season, has not ultimately helped PSG secure the trophy they most desire. As Mbappe, now 25, prepares to leave Paris, he will hope to finally get his hands on the Champions League trophy with his next club.",Kylian Mbappe is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season. PSG lost 2-0 on aggregate to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League semi-final. The defeat is seen as a significant disappointment for the French club.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109934269,imgsize-61554,width-400,resizemode-4/109934269.jpg"
Parthib Gogoi a step away from achieving his dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/parthib-gogoi-a-step-away-from-achieving-his-dream/articleshow/109926682.cms,"KOLKATA: “Every young footballer dreams of playing for India,” was how Parthib Gogoi — named for the first time by Igor Stimac among the probables for the crucial World Cup qualifiers — put it when asked about his national team aspirations.“Playing for India is always a different kind of feeling. All of us have a lot of passion for playing in national colours.There is this feeling that we will give our lives to win the game for India. So that’s the feeling I get and get connected emotionally when representing India.”While the 21-year-old has chosen to stay low before the final squad selection, the Assam footballer is one of the new faces that head coach Stimac chose to give a shot ahead of India’s vital June fixtures in quest to progress to the third round of World Cup qualifiers. He will join NEUFC teammate and fellow first-time India probable Jithin MS for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar set to begin this week.And if NEUFC’s only player to score in four consecutive games for his club makes it into Stimac’s final squad, it will be a milestone in Gogoi’s journey from his father’s football training centre in Assam’s Sivasagar to donning the jersey for the senior national team.“My idol is Sunil Chhetri . And if I get to share the dressing room with him, I can learn so much from him. If young players get a chance in the Indian squad, we can learn so much from the senior players. But it depends on the coach. If he picks me, I will give my best,” Parthib said during a freewheeling interaction with TOI.Parthib, along with Jithin this season, has been a bright spot in the Highlanders’ last two Indian Super League campaigns and has been getting better with time and experience. He had eight shots on target, of which three were goals, in 18 appearances in 2022-23 and continued the form at Durand Cup this year with his first hat-trick for NEUFC.Having extended his NEUFC contract till 2026-27, Parthib scored five goals for his team this ISL season while also providing two assists. But what captivated fans are three spectacular strikes from long range – against title winners Mumbai City, Chennaiyin and East Bengal.Parthib expressed his love for such piledrivers during the interaction. “That’s something I really love to do. Even while playing FIFA on Playstation, I always look for opportunities to shoot from distance,” he said.Having started his football journey as a two-year-old by following his brother Pragyan – also his teammate and “mental support” at NEUFC – to the field, Parthib has had the support of his entire family in his pursuit.“My father and his colleagues started a football training centre in 2005 that trains kids even today. My brother used to go there for training from 2005. My father, who was not a footballer but loves the game, used to carry me to the ground when I was two to watch my brother play and if I liked it, I could play it too. So that's how my football journey started in 2007. Also, papa used to get football clips on his phone, like those of Messi or Ronaldo, for us and watching these clips, I got attracted to the game,” Parthib said before adding with a laugh, “I have broken many doors in my house.”Having climbed through the ranks of Assam age-group teams, Bengaluru’s Ozone Football Academy and Indian Arrows, Parthib has also represented India at age-group competitions, the most recent being U23 AFC Cup Qualifiers in China followed by friendlies in Indonesia.But the bigger test begins for him this week as he looks to grab a place in Stimac’s scheme of things and add a goalscoring touch to the squad against Kuwait and Qatar.Asked about his future goal, the Messi fan and self-proclaimed “Barcelona boy” said, “I want to become one of the best footballers in India.”The dream bodes well for India, too, with the team in dire need of goal scorers as Chhetri approaches his twilight days with the team.",Parthib Gogoi named among probables for India's World Cup qualifiers. The 21-year-old is one of the new faces that head coach Igor Stimac chose to give a shot. He will join NEUFC teammate and fellow first-time India probable Jithin MS for the four-week camp.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109926665,imgsize-90938,width-400,resizemode-4/109926665.jpg"

Their chances of securing European football for the upcoming season are rapidly diminishing. Palace, on the other hand, sit in 14th place with 43 points from 36 matches.United's injury woes were compounded by the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who missed a match due to injury for the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career. The ease with which they were defeated will be a significant concern for everyone associated with the club.This marks the first instance in the Premier League era that United have suffered 13 defeats in a single season, and the scoreline could have been even more lopsided.Under the guidance of new manager Oliver Glasner, Palace have found their rhythm, while United are stumbling towards the end of a season that cannot conclude soon enough for Ten Hag.","Crystal Palace defeated Manchester United 4-0 at Selhurst Park on Monday.
