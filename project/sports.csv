T20 World Cup selection: Too many loose ends,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-selection-too-many-loose-ends/articleshow/109675512.cms,"Agarkar-led selection panel has a tough job to do

Third opener and second wicketkeeper

Sticking with tried and tested seam attack

Power game in the middle

NEW DELHI: With the deadline to announce the teams for the upcoming T20 World Cup fast approaching, the selection committee and the team management have been working overtime to strike the right combination.By no means, this is going to be a straightforward selection for the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee.He was in the Capital on Saturday to watch the match between Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians. It is speculated that Agarkar had an informal meeting with Rohit Sharma about the team.According to sources, there are three major contentious issues that need to be resolved before BCCI secretary Jay Shah convenes the meeting to formally announce the 15-member team. The team is slated to leave for the World Cup on May 21 with the players who will be out of the IPL by then.TOI understands that the selectors are torn between Sanju Samson and KL Rahul for the second wicketkeeper-batsman slot with Rishabh Pant having done enough to prove his fitness and form to be the first choice for this position.Rahul's intent at the top of the order has always been debatable. However, as the ongoing IPL season has progressed, the picture has changed with two young openers - Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill - looking off the boil. Both Rahul and Samson's international records are not great. But Gill, with his struggling form in the IPL, doesn't command automatic selection yet.This is where Rahul could pip Samson in the race even though Samson has been having a dream season while leading Rajasthan Royals. Rahul's experience at the top of the order and his willingness to bat in the middle order gives him a chance.With Mohammed Shami injured, the Indian seam attack suddenly looks shaky. The IPL has been particularly cruel on the bowlers with team totals touching unprecedented highs. Sources told TOI that the team management wants to stick with the lot which has been part of the setup for the last two-three years even though. Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj have gone for around nine runs per over so far in the IPL.""The team management wants to trust the players it has groomed. There are concerns about Siraj and Arshdeep going for so many runs but one has to look at the context. In these matches, you have to think about defending the target set by your team-even if you do it by 10 runs. Jasprit Bumrah is different class. The others should not be compared with him. There won't be 'impact player' rule in the World Cup. Axar Patel, for example, has been exemplary with his economy rate,"" the source told TOI.Bowlers who could give them competition are Avesh Khan and Mukesh Kumar who have been growing into the role of bowling the tough overs. The selectors will have to decide if they want to go in with an extra spinner Ravi Bishnoi or the extra pacer because Hardik Pandya's seam bowling can't be ignored. Bishnoi is seen as someone who can bowl at any stage of an innings.The biggest challenge will be to have the power hitters in the middle order. Rohit and Virat Kohli have been steady run-getters but the onus to post humongous scores will fall on power-hitters in the middle and late middle-order. The striking abilities of Hardik and Ravindra Jadeja have not been very inspiring.The team management had groomed Rinku Singh for that role. Shivam Dube has also emerged as an option. But him not bowling enough may pull him down a bit. Sources say the selection committee isn't keen on getting swayed by IPL performances but someone like Tilak Varma can't be ruled out.",The deadline to announce the teams for the upcoming T20 World Cup fast approaching.

Hardik Pandya 's elevation to the Mumbai Indians captaincy has not gone down too well with the loyal fans of the five-time champions as he replaced the highly successful Rohit Sharma , a bonafide India legend and also the all-format national team captain.While some of the booing and hooting at the Wankhede has been toxic and unnecessary, the skipper has not done too much on the field to change the perceptions about him off it.Not bowling Jasprit Bumrah straight up, changing the playing XI repeatedly, changing his own batting slot constantly, he has shown all signs of a confused and a stressed leader. What's worse, it doesn't seem as if he has the dressing room pulling in one direction.What many felt was needless after the team's 10-run loss to Delhi Capitals was his criticism of Tilak Varma , the team's top run scorer with 63 off 32 balls, saying his lack of intent against Axar Patel cost MI the game.""Axar bowling to a left-hander (read Tilak), the better option could have been to go after him,"" Hardik told the official broadcasters after the game. ""I think it was just a little game awareness that we missed out. At the end of the day, that cost us the game.""Really? Let's analyse. Axar Patel bowled six balls to the promising left-hander off which he scored 14 runs. He had bowled to Tilak when MI had scored 72 for 3. Hardik was batting with Axar in the middle as MI had lost the wicket ofSuryakumar Yadav with the team score at 65.Tilak scored four off four balls off Axar in an attempt to momentarily consolidate till Hardik got his eye in. Once the partnership was set, he hit Axar for a six and a four prompting DC skipper Rishabh Pant to take him out of the attack.Moreover, if Hardik wanted Tilak to attack, wasn't he the best man to tell him as he was in the middle?If the skipper really wants to look at the reasons for MI's loss on Saturday, may be a closer look at his bowling figures 2-0-41-0 and the decision in sending an in-form Tim David out to bat at No. 7 on a small ground, may provide those.Picking on a youngster scouted and groomed by the franchise and an ex-skipper's favourite, won't help.",Hardik Pandya's elevation to the Mumbai Indians captaincy has not gone down too well with the loyal fans of the five-time champions. Some of the booing and hooting at the Wankhede has been toxic and unnecessary. He has not done too much on the field to change the perceptions about him off it.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109675613,imgsize-64922,width-400,resizemode-4/109675613.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad 's aggressive 98, paired with a precise bowling performance led by pacer Tushar Deshpande , guided the Chennai Super Kings to a 78-run victory over the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League on Sunday.After being invited to bat, Gaikwad's impressive 54-ball innings powered CSK to a formidable 212 for three. He was supported by Daryl Mitchell 's return to form, contributing a key 52 off 32 balls, while Shivam Dube added an unbeaten 39 off 20 balls to push CSK past the 200 mark.In response, SRH's overly cautious batting approach failed once again as they couldn't recover from Deshpande's (4/27 in 3 overs) early three-wicket burst and the subsequent pressure in the middle overs, ultimately being bowled out for 134 in 18.5 overs. This win ended CSK's two-game losing streak.With the victory, CSK climbed to third place with 10 points, the same as the Kolkata Knight Riders, Lucknow Super Giants, and Delhi Capitals. SRH, also with 10 points, fell to fourth after their fourth loss.Chasing 213 to win, Travis Head (13) and Abhishek Sharma (15) made rapid starts but Deshpande got rid of the former with a slower wide ball and then returned to remove impact sub Anmolpreet Singh with an outswinger on the stumps as the batter went for a golden duck.Abhishek was next caught at deep point as Deshpande broke their back, leaving SRH at 40 for 3 in the fourth over.Nitish Reddy (15) and Aiden Markram (32) tried to steady the ship but Ravindra Jadeja bamboozled the former with a bouncer, while Matheesha Pathirana produced a superb yorker to uproot the middle stump of the South African.At 85-5 in 10.5 overs, Heinrich Klaasen and Abdul Samad joined hands but runs were tough to come by as the bowlers executed their plans to perfectly.While Jadeja completed a superb spell of 4-0-22-1, Shardul Thakur kept bowling at wide outside off to frustrate the batters as CSK conceded just two boundaries in nine overs after the powerplay.With an improbable 104 needed off 30 balls, Klaasen, Samad, Pat Cummins and Shahbaz Ahmed all holed out as Mitchell claimed five catches in the outfield during the match.Earlier, Gaikwad missed out on a successive hundred by a whisker but his 107-run stand with Mitchell was the cornerstone of CSK's innings. It is CSK's 35th 200-plus total, the most by any side in T20 cricket.Gaikwad was the star of the CSK batting as he hit 10 fours and three sixes in his innings.Opening the innings, Ajinkya Rahane (9) perished early again with Bhuvneshwar Kumar earning his prized wicket in the third over but Gaikwad kept CSK going. The skipper did not back down and attacked the bowlers at will as the hosts ended the powerplay at 50 for one.In no time, the 27-year-old Gaikwad brought up his 17th IPL half-century off just 27 deliveries.Gaikwad and Mitchell batted sensibly as they managed to keep the boundaries coming, with the latter chipping in periodically too after a slow start (12 off 11).With dew setting in the 12th over, the batting duo tried to take advantage of it as Mitchell soon brought up his maiden IPL 50 off 29 deliveries in the 13th over.But the New Zealander failed to get going for too long and perished in the following over to Jaydev Unadkat after depositing a full-toss into the hands of Nitish Kumar Reddy in the deep mid-wicket.In-form Shivam Dube then joined Gaikwad and the two decided to up the ante. SRH skipper Pat Cummins was targeted by the batters, having been dispatched for 49 in his four overs.Gaikwad looked set to back-to-back tons but the heat and humidity of Chennai seemed to affect him as his vigil ended with a tired-looking shot as T Natarajan sent him back in the final over.Crowd-favourite MS Dhoni scored five off two deliveries that included a four, while Dube deposited a full toss in the stands as the final four overs yielded 53 runs.",Chennai Super Kings beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 78 runs. Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad top scored with 98 off 54 balls. Daryl Mitchell made 52 off 32 balls.

Siraj's remarks shed light on the evolving dynamics of T20 cricket, where batsmen hold the upper hand in exploiting conducive playing surfaces to set daunting targets.""See, nowadays cricket is really different, now 250-260 is made in every second match, earlier 250 was a rare thing,"" said Siraj after RCB overhauled the 201-run target set by Gujarat Titans in 16 overs in Ahmedabad.""There is no help for bowlers, there are smaller grounds and flat wickets, there is no swing in the ball, so lots of changes. Bowlers can just keep playing and keep getting hit.""Life has indeed been challenging for bowlers, particularly in this IPL season, as teams prioritise aggressive batting to maintain high run-rates throughout the innings, even beyond the powerplay overs.""As a bowler, you have to keep the self-belief. I have seen lots of ups and downs in life, so I don't give up if 1-2 matches don't go my way. I look for a comeback,"" Siraj said.""After one month, there is the World Cup... so I tell myself that if I get hit on a good ball, it is fine but I need to keep bowling less bad balls. I have not really bowled too badly this IPL, now 40 runs (in quota of four overs) is normal in T20 cricket.""Siraj, with six wickets in nine IPL games this season, acknowledged the significant role of luck in T20 cricket.""T20 is all about luck, you don't get a wicket with good balls and sometimes even a full toss gets you a wicket. so luck matters a lot. I keep working on my flaws during training.""My mindset is always like I am the best bowler, when I go to the field, my attitude and mindset remains the same and it helps in my execution.""Despite Gujarat Titans enduring their third loss in four games, Sai Sudharsan maintained that there are no glaring issues within the team. However, he emphasised the critical importance of winning all remaining matches to bolster their chances of qualifying for the playoffs.""I don't think many things are going wrong. As a team we are doing well, definitely. It's just the result. If we had won this game, maybe many things would have been good. Getting better and just showing up (for) the next game is what is very important,"" said Sudharsan, who hit a 49-ball 84.GT are now at seventh place with eight points in the IPL standings.""I think winning all the games is the only possibility which we can see. But I think taking it game by game, just getting better from this game. There were many positives from this game as well. Thinking of qualifying is a little longer. So, we just have to play the way we want.""The left-handed batter said the pitch eased out with time which helped RCB chase down the target without much ado.""Like 10-15 overs after when we were batting, it got a little better because when we started to play, the wicket was q little damp but eventually it got better under the lights. It remained the same, obviously, during the RCB's innings as well.""",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) pacer Mohammed Siraj expressed frustration over the challenging conditions for bowlers in T20 cricket. Siraj highlighted the trend of teams consistently surpassing the 250-run mark in this IPL season. RCB overhauled the 201-run target set by Gujarat Titans in 16 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109670392,imgsize-41702,width-400,resizemode-4/109670392.jpg"

Like losing their head coach Des Buckingham who left the club to take over at hometown club Oxford United last November.Like losing key players like Greg Stewart and Rostyn Griffiths , who both parted ways with Mumbai City in January.Like signing Spanish striker Iker Guarrotxena in the January window, only to then lose him for the remainder of the season to a knee injury. Each time, Mumbai bounced back to ensure their league form didn't suffer and eventually only missed out on becoming the first team in the competition to defend the League Winners Shield after a gutting final-day loss to Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Kolkata.It was that same resilience that surfaced at a critical juncture last Wednesday, as Mumbai stunned the hosts with three late goals to snatch an incredible victory that has now put them in a favourable position to reach the Indian Super League final next Saturday.Ahead of Monday's return leg at the Mumbai Football Arena, Kratky, who took charge in December, spoke glowingly about the character of his team, but made it a point to play down their one-goal advantage.""It wasn't easy, there were a couple of setbacks as everyone knows but we can be proud of ourselves how we have handled it and how we kept going,"" the Czech-Australian said at his pre-match press conference. ""What I really like in this group is they stick together in hard times and push through it, so I'm very proud of every single one of them.""That said, he was keen to remind his side about the importance of stepping onto the pitch on Monday with the right approach. ""If you put it into perspective, we were losing 2-0 in 90 minutes, so everything certainly was not perfect. But we have addressed that,"" Kratky said.""We know it will be a difficult game. Goa is a quality team. We have to respect that. But what happened last game, it doesn't matter. For me, it starts 0-0 and we have to go for the win.""Goa coach Manolo Marquez admitted the manner in which his side saw their 2-0 lead turn into a 3-2 defeat inside six minutes had been tough to swallow, but the Spanish coach insisted the Gaurs would carry no psychological scars into the second leg.""It's a process because it was a tough defeat and then it's normal to be very sad after the game. It was difficult to sleep that night, it was difficult the next day in the training session, Marquez said, adding: ""I am completely sure that even if we did lose the last match, we will arrive in very good conditions mentally for the second leg.""Mumbai won't be able to count on left back Akash Mishra who is injured, while Kratky said he was hopeful of having Spanish attacking midfielder Alberto Noguera available for selection.

Mohun Bagan brace for a 'final' before the final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/mohun-bagan-brace-for-a-final-before-the-final/articleshow/109660259.cms,"KOLKATA: Antonio Lopez Habas , the grand old man of Indian Super League , has deservedly earned his reputation as a manager who seems to have a trick up his sleeve, knowing how to produce the right performance for the right game.Mohun Bagan SG have been the undisputable beneficiary of the veteran Spaniard's Midas touch, having transformed themselves from a mid-season wobble to a late bloom, clinching the ISL Shield for the first time since the award was introduced five seasons ago.However, an engine which looked to be chugging along in first gear until a few days ago is now making some rattling noises. It is against this backdrop that Habas's team is preparing to face Odisha FC in the second leg of ISL semifinals at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday, having lost the first leg 1-2 in Bhubaneswar.""It's not a semifinal, but the final for us,"" Habas told reporters before shepherding his team to the Salt Lake Stadium's practice ground on Saturday. ""After winning the league, it's normal for players to relax sometimes. Two accidental moves and we lost the match in Odisha. There will be plans and tactical discussions. Now everything depends on what the players are going to do in the field,"" he added.Although Mohun Bagan are leading 4-1 on head-to-head count against Sunday's visitors with 5 games ending in stalemates, Odisha FC underSergio Lobera has emerged a pinprick in the Kolkata side's aspirations. Mohun Bagan failed to beat them in the league stage this season while Lobera's side came to stun them 5-2 at the Salt Lake Stadium on way to knock the green-and-maroon brigade out of the AFC Cup.Habas was not in charge of the team at that time, but Lobera did touch upon that AFC Cup result, emphasizing that his team is capable of silencing the vociferous Salt Lake Stadium crowd again.""When you are playing in front of a lot of people in a stadium like this, full (stadium), (it) means you are playing for something important. I think it is a big motivation for me as a coach, for the players,"" Lobera said ahead of the latest clash between the two sides.With all tickets for Sunday's match already sold out, Mohun Bagan will certainly bank on home advantage to turn things around again - they pipped Mumbai City FC 2-1 to seal the league here two weeks ago. But Habas knows that Odisha can challenge them defensively.The visitors will miss Carlos Delgado, who scored the equalizer against Bagan in the first leg, but in Roy Krishna and Diego Mauricio they have two in-form strikers having scored 13 and 11 goals respectively. Krishna may be in the fag-end of his career in Indian club football, but the Fijian - who was developed into a lethal player during Habas's previous times at the Kolkata club - has shown remarkable consistency in influencing a match.While the duo will pose another test to the Bagan defence, Habas is set to demand more conviction and character from his team in turning the corner.In absence of suspended Armando Sadiku, Jason Cummings is set to start with Dimitri Petratos in the upfront but it's the presence of the likes of Manvir Singh and Liston Colaco on the width which becomes central to their attacking play.""We have a chance to win the third trophy of the season (after the Durand Cup and ISL Winners' Shield). So, we'll treat it as a final and go at full blast against Odisha FC at home,"" Manvir said.",Mohun Bagan SG face Odisha FC in the second leg of ISL semifinals.

Meanwhile, league leaders Real Madrid edged past Real Sociedad 1-0 on Friday, and third-placed Barcelona host Valencia on Monday.Before the match, Atletico supporters paid tribute to retiring Athletic forward Raul Garcia, who was part of their 2014 La Liga-winning squad. The game was briefly halted in the 36th minute due to apparent racial abuse directed at Athletic's Nico Williams as he prepared to take a corner.Moments later, Williams responded by scoring the equalizer, celebrating by tapping his arm in an apparent reference to his skin colour.Atletico regained the lead in the second half through Correa, who controlled Koke's chipped pass before calmly beating Simon.

The league's top scorer now has nine goals in seven appearances this season.A massive crowd of over 65,612 spectators gathered at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, the venue shared by the Revolution and the NFL's New England Patriots, to witness the Argentine World Cup winner in action.Despite being affected by a flu outbreak and languishing at the bottom of the Eastern Conference, New England stunned the home fans just 40 seconds into the game through their own Argentine, Tomas Chancalay. After receiving a lofted pass from Spanish midfielder Carles Gil , Chancalay capitalized on Drake Callender's advanced position and chipped the ball over the stranded Miami goalkeeper to open the scoring.Messi equalized for Miami in the 32nd minute, latching onto Robert Taylor's through pass and calmly slotting the ball home. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner then put Miami ahead in the 68th minute, collecting a brilliant defence-splitting pass from his former Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets and finishing with his trademark composure.In the closing stages, Miami added two more goals, both orchestrated by Messi. Substitute Benjamin Cremaschi made it 3-1 in the 83rd minute, pouncing on the rebound after a Messi shot was parried away. Luis Suarez completed the scoring by finding the top corner following an inside pass from Messi.","Lionel Messi scores twice in Inter Miami's 4-1 victory against New England Revolution.

Despite having opportunities to secure a win, they were unable to capitalize on them. The Gunners sit atop the table with 77 points, two ahead of Liverpool with a game in hand, while reigning champions Manchester City have 76 points with two games in hand on the Reds.Jarrod Bowen gave West Ham the lead just before halftime, but Liverpool showed improvement in the second half, equalizing through Andy Robertson before West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola scored an own goal.However, the home side found an equalizer in the 77th minute when Bowen set up Michail Antonio for a headed goal, resulting in a 2-2 final score.

Arne Slot: Liverpool reach agreement for Jurgen Klopp's replacement to become new manager,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/arne-slot-liverpool-reach-agreement-for-jurgen-klopps-replacement-to-become-new-manager/articleshow/109638938.cms,"(Inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: According to British media reports, Liverpool and Feyenoord have reached an agreement for Arne Slot to replace Jurgen Klopp as the manager of the Premier League club. The Press Association reported that a compensation package for the 45-year-old, who had two years remaining on his contract, has been agreed upon. The BBC stated that the deal is worth up to £9.4 million (10.9 million euros).Slot expressed his confidence in securing the Anfield job on Thursday, saying, ""I would like to go to Liverpool.Now I'm waiting to see whether the clubs reach an agreement. I'm very confident in that."" He joined Feyenoord in 2021 after an impressive stint as the manager of AZ Alkmaar. In his first season with Feyenoord, Slot led the team to the inaugural Europa Conference League final, where they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma. The following season, he guided the club to their second league title in 24 years before signing a new three-year contract.Klopp, who will step down at the end of the current season after a successful nine-year reign that included winning the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League in 2020, praised Slot's qualities, saying, ""I like the way his team plays football . If he is the one, I like that he wants it."" He added, ""I don't know him, but some people who know him say he's a good guy. I like that a lot. So good coach, good guy. Looking forward for the club, if he is the solution, if he is the man, I'm more than happy.""Currently, Feyenoord sit second in the Eredivisie table, nine points behind leaders PSV Eindhoven. Failing to win the Dutch title would be a disappointment for Slot, similar to Klopp's frustration with Liverpool's faltering title bid. The Reds are third in the Premier League, three points behind leaders Arsenal and two points behind second-placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand. Liverpool's recent form has been poor, with defeats against Crystal Palace and Everton, as well as quarter-final exits in the FA Cup and Europa League.Initially, Bayer Leverkusen manager and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso was considered the favorite to succeed Klopp. However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title. Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool job but has reportedly held talks with West Ham about replacing David Moyes next season.Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes that Slot's attacking tactics could be an ideal fit for the Premier League club, stating, ""I think Arne Slot is perhaps one of the better Dutch coaches at this moment. I think the way of playing and the philosophy he has, that he could be a Liverpool coach.""","Liverpool and Feyenoord have reached an agreement for Arne Slot to replace Jurgen Klopp. A compensation package for the 45-year-old, who had two years remaining on his contract, has been agreed upon.

""It was clear that everyone thought we were coming here for a walk,"" Ancelotti told reporters. ""The only ones who didn't think so were the players. They had commitment and attitude. They had the desire and enthusiasm to keep winning.""Real Sociedad, currently in sixth place and vying for a Europa League spot, controlled possession throughout the match, which was played in heavy rain. They created several good opportunities, but Real Madrid goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga made crucial saves to keep them at bay.The visitors capitalized on their only chance in the first half when Gueler, a 19-year-old Turkish midfielder making his first start for Real Madrid since joining from Fenerbahce, converted Dani Carvajal's cross in the 29th minute. Three minutes later, Takefusa Kubo thought he had equalized for Real Sociedad, but the goal was disallowed after a VAR check revealed a foul in the build-up.In the second half, Real Sociedad continued to press for an equalizer, but they had another goal ruled out due to Mikel Merino being offside. Benat Turrientes also had a shot from the edge of the box saved by the impressive Arrizabalaga. Real Madrid nearly doubled their lead late in the game, but Alex Remiro made a fantastic reflex save to deny Eduardo Camavinga's close-range effort.Ancelotti praised his team's mentality, stating, ""We have a spectacular squad.

NEW DELHI: Amelie Mauresmo , the tournament director of Roland Garros , indicated on Thursday that former world number one Rafael Nadal is unlikely to receive a seed at the upcoming French Open next month.Nadal himself expressed uncertainty on Wednesday regarding his participation in this year's tournament, despite his remarkable record of winning the French Open a record 14 times.At 37 years old, Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, has seen a significant drop in his ranking, currently standing at 512, following an extended absence due to a hip flexor injury that kept him sidelined for almost a year.Although he has secured a place in the main draw of the French Open via his protected ranking, this ranking does not guarantee seeding, as seeding is determined by the top 32 ranked players.Without a seed, Nadal could potentially face formidable opponents in the early stages of the tournament.Traditionally, Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam event that did not strictly adhere to the ATP and WTA rankings, instead considering a player's past performances on grass courts when determining seeding. However, this approach faced criticism from players, including Nadal, leading to its abandonment in 2020.Asked about Nadal being seeded at this year's French Open, Mauresmo told reporters: ""Right now it's not a topic...""Wimbledon did it for a very, very, very long time, and it certainly brought some advantages but we also saw all the disadvantages it could bring. For the moment, it's not on the table.""We're keeping our fingers crossed for him above all, for us too obviously. We're keeping a close eye on what's happening for him on court.

However, his return was cut short due to a muscle issue sustained in Australia, limiting him to just five matches this season.Last week, he began his clay campaign in Barcelona, exiting in the second round. Now, he is poised to take on 16-year-old American Darwin Blanch in his Madrid opener on Thursday.""I don't think I'm ready to play at my 100 percent but I'm prepared to go out and play tomorrow. It's important for me to play one last time here in Madrid, for me it means a lot,"" said the 37-year-old Nadal.As he attempts to resume his 'Last Dance' in Madrid and say goodbye to one of his favourite tournaments on court, rather than on the sidelines, the 22-time major champion admits his farewell tour hasn't been as enjoyable as he would have hoped.""A few weeks ago, I didn't know if I will be able to play again on the professional tour, so today I am playing,"" he added.""It's not perfect, of course not perfect, but at least I am playing and I can enjoy again, especially in the few tournaments that are so emotional for me. I'm able to enjoy the fact that I can say probably good-bye on court.""Nadal says he's hitting the ball well when he is able to be on court but ""it's about more body limitations. I went through a lot of things last year and a half, two years"".""So body feelings are not enough good to feel myself playing with freedom enough in terms of body issues. That's not allowing me to compete the way that I would like to compete.""","Rafael Nadal says he'll only participate in the upcoming French Open if he feels ""capable enough to compete well"" The 14-time Roland Garros champion acknowledged that if the event commenced today, he wouldn't be ready to take part.

I'm enjoying being on the tennis court: Sumit Nagal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/im-enjoying-being-on-the-tennis-court-sumit-nagal/articleshow/109560007.cms,"Nagal's mid-season training block is about building on the gains of the last four months

BENGALURU: Sumit Nagal 's latest hairdo is short fade. It's as sharp as his tennis game.The India No.1, who climbed to a career-high 80 in the world on Monday last, took care of the style element on his arrival in Delhi. Nagal, who spent a few days with family and friends while getting his visa sorted, heads back to Europe this week to kick-off a three-week training block at the Nensel academy in Peine, Germany, before returning to his beloved clay courts.The timing of Nagal's training block - when the clay court swing is in full blast in Europe - raised injury worries.The 26-year-old brushed aside concerns with an insouciant shrug, insisting it's a good time for a training block. Nagal explained that he has played from March to March, including in the off-season in December. Ranked 138 at the time, Nagal played the Tennis Premier League , hoping the money would give him the financial freedom to schedule his 2024 season.Nagal will look at his net game and serve, which he noted has been on and off in the last weeks, besides build on his fitness in his time away from the Tour.The Indian is aiming to get a tournament in, perhaps in Lyon, before arriving at Roland Garros.Nagal has enjoyed an inspirational run in the first four months of the year, climbing almost 60 rungs in the ranking, especially coming into his own on clay.Nagal describes his relationship with clay in one word 'smooth', like a sharp cup of espresso. It awakens the competitor in him.""The more time I have, the better I am at chasing down the ball,"" he told TOI.Nagal learnt his tennis on the clay courts of Paschim Vihar in West Delhi as an eight-year-old.""It was probably fast,"" he said of those courts. ""I don't think we have slow clay courts in India. Clay courts are different everywhere, the clay courts in France are very different to Germany, Germany and Austria are similar, they are heavy, wet. France is a little bit hard and fast. Italy has a mix of both, but more on the faster side.""While the tennis world has played on the Nadal, Nagal surname, the Indian gave the legendary Spaniard a verbal salute.""What Rafa has done on clay is just insane,"" he said. ""His game is ridiculous, he moves incredibly, you just cannot hit past him and with that forehand jumping over your head for three or four hours… It's crazy.""The career he has followed with great personal interest, however, is that of the 25-year-old world No.6 Casper Ruud .""I've learnt a lot from watching Ruud,"" Nagal said. ""I have seen him from his junior days, playing under-14, under-16. The way he has developed his game, is very good.''""I feel like I can play a similar game to him. Serve smart, use a big forehand and have a solid backhand. And use the backhand smartly to get the ball to your forehand side. He has been playing at that level for a long time and I think that's the next step for me, to keep playing at this level, keep playing the ATP Tour level .""Nagal isn't surprised with his form of the first four months of the year, where he scored two top-50 wins and took a set off the world No.7 Holger Rune in Monte Carlo.""I know I can play top-50 tennis and keep improving,"" he said. ""When you lose there are a lot of things you feel you could've done better, but I don't think I lost a match (in the last few months) because of energy or focus. I have matured as a competitor.""The Indian is in a whole different headspace these days. ""I am enjoying being on the tennis court ,"" he said. ""I'm enjoying playing matches, enjoying fighting.""","India No.1 Sumit Nagal heads back to Europe this week for a three-week training block.

That's obviously what I work towards, to try and get better and to win tournaments. So, nice to win my second Tour title, almost 10 or 11 months from now (after the first), and to do it on different surfaces, very very happy with that,"" Bhambri said following his victory in the company of French Albano Olivetti on Sunday.The pair defeated the German wildcard combination of Andreas Mies, a two-time doubles Grand Slam winner, and Jan-Lennard Struff, a four-time titleist, 7-6, 7-6.""I hope me and Albano can continue improving and continue getting better with more clay court events and the French Open coming up.""Coach Balachandran Manikkath, who has been working with Bhambri as part of the ""Doubles Dream of India"" programme, provided some insights on the adjustments the Delhi lad has made in his game for the slowest of the three surfaces.""Yuki has been working on playing on clay since Marrakech (ATP 250 event in Morocco). It is obviously different from hard and certain adjustments have to be made with serves, returns, volleys, smash, etc,"" Balachandran said.""He has done a tremendous job as the results show this week. On slow, wet clay courts he is able to hold serve comfortably and his returns are good, volleying is solid.""This win with Olivetti will help confidence on both sides. They are already fixed to play the clay season all the way up to French (Open). So nothing changes there except that both are moving up the rankings.""Bhambri's ranking rose a career-high 54 on Monday while Olivetti moved up to a personal best 45.The rankings at the end of the French Open will determine the entries for the tennis competition at the Olympics , which will be held at the Roland Garros as well.Doubles star Rohan Bopanna is sitting pretty well at World No. 2 at the moment, which gives him a direct entry and a partner of his choice subject to the latter's ranking being in the top-300 – in either singles or doubles.""Olympics is not in my control. The selection committee or the AITA decides the team, so I'm focused on trying to improve my ranking, improve my game and just continue on the Tour,"" Bhambri said.""Whether I like to play the Olympics, I absolutely would. It's every Indian's dream to represent the country and I'm no different. The Olympics is the biggest stage but, again, this is not in my hands.""Returning to what is in his control, Bhambri said the Munich triumph would not change his preference for hard.""Hardcourt is always going to be my preference. Just for the sole purpose that it requires less adjustment for me because I've played on it all my life,"" he said.""So, no matter how many titles I am gonna win on clay or grass, hardcourt is going to be the preference.""It (doubles) is a bit different compared to singles. Doubles is less movement, which makes it a bit easier but there's still technical aspects of doubles, which in general doesn't involve so much side to side movement.""There is a lot of serving and volleying, and returning fast points. So you have to be good at that, regardless of any surface if you want to succeed in doubles.""Given the necessities of the modern game where entries into big tournaments breaks and makes partnerships, Bhambri, who decided to focus on doubles only two seasons back, has become adept at playing on both sides of the court.""Yuki plays ad court with Olivetti. He played deuce with Robin Hasse in Dubai and reached semis. In Madrid last week he played deuce with Arel Behar too,"" Balachandran said.""Now he is comfortable playing on either side. Just that he has played more on ad court, and people recognise him as an ad court player. That will change soon as he plays on either side with different partners.""Known for avoiding late hours, playing on the Tour has also brought a bit of change to Bhambri's personal side.""Well, I've been part of the Tour for a long time now. So I know most of them. Of course, I miss partying with with Roger (Federer) and Rafa (Nadal), enjoying nights out with them. Since they are not much around on the Tour, it's not the same,"" he said.""Maybe the next generation I can hang out with more, stay out late and socialize with them more – the Alcaraz's and the Kyrgios's of the tour.""",Yuki Bhambri won his second Tour title with a win at the BMW Open in Munich. The 31-year-old has won his first two titles on the doubles Tour on grass and clay.

NEW DELHI: Casper Ruud 's triumph at the Barcelona Open final against Stefanos Tsitsipas marked a significant milestone in his career.

The significance of this triumph was amplified by the fact that Ruud had visited the tournament as a 13-year-old spectator, admiring the likes of Nadal and others.With his sights set on the upcoming French Open , where he finished as the runner-up in 2022, Ruud's victory in Barcelona serves as a confidence booster.
