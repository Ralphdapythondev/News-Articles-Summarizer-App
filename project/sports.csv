How can RCB still qualify for IPL 2024 playoffs?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/how-can-rcb-still-qualify-for-ipl-2024-playoffs/articleshow/109585208.cms,"(Inputs from ANI)

NEW DELHI: Following Delhi Capitals ' victory over Gujarat Titans , Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) find themselves in a precarious position in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL). With just two points from eight matches and a negative run rate of 1.046, their chances of securing a playoff berth seem bleak. However, there's still a glimmer of hope for RCB to turn the tide in their favour with six games remaining.Currently languishing at the bottom of the table, RCB needs to win all of their remaining matches to have a shot at making it to the final four. Their upcoming clash against Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium holds significant importance in this regard.If RCB emerge victorious in their remaining fixtures, their points tally would reach 14. To bolster their chances further, they would also need other results to align in their favour, particularly in terms of net run rate (NRR).Considering the current points table, if the top three teams—Rajasthan Royals, Kolkata Knight Riders, and Sunrisers Hyderabad—win a specific number of their remaining matches, RCB could potentially secure the fourth spot with 14 points.Alternatively, in an even more unlikely scenario, RCB could aim for the third position if the top three teams stumble and only manage to win one match each in their remaining fixtures.However, these possibilities hinge on RCB's ability to not only win their matches but also improve their NRR significantly.RCB's remaining fixtures include encounters against Sunrisers Hyderabad, Gujarat Titans (twice), Punjab Kings, Delhi Capitals, and Chennai Super Kings . Each of these matches presents a crucial opportunity for RCB to claw their way back into contention for a playoff spot.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) currently languishing at the bottom of the table.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan captain Babar Azam remains optimistic that his team will find their footing before the start of the T20 World Cup , despite suffering a narrow four-run loss to New Zealand in the fourth T20I in Lahore. The defeat allowed the Kiwis to take a 2-1 lead in the series at the Gaddafi Stadium, even though they are missing several key players.""We are trying something new and different in every game.Hopefully, we will be settled before going for the T20 World Cup,"" Babar said after the game.The New Zealand openers, Tim Robinson and Tom Blundell , got off to a flying start, making the most of the powerplay overs. Pakistan, on the other hand, struggled in the first six overs, losing three wickets compared to New Zealand's one.Fakhar Zaman's impressive 61 and Imad Wasim 's unbeaten 22 brought Pakistan back into the game with some brilliant batting. However, their efforts were not enough to help Pakistan reach the target, which Babar believed was achievable.""They started nicely but our bowlers made a good comeback, we stuck to a length. In the first six overs, we lost quite a number of wickets. Fakhar's innings was outstanding, unfortunately, we couldn't chase it down, Imad also played good innings. It was a different surface, the average score here is 190 and we did well to restrict them and it was a chaseable total.

RCB have registered only two wins in nine matches so far in the ongoing season. Their first victory came against Punjab Kings on March 25, followed by a second win on April 25 after a month-long wait. IPL 2024: POINTS TABLE Reflecting on their recent performances, Du Plessis highlighted the fighting spirit displayed by RCB in their last two matches.""Last two games, we've shown great signs of fight. SRH game was 270 plus, we got 260. KKR game as well - 1 run. We've been close for a while, but you need to win matches to get confidence as a group. Will sleep easier tonight,"" he said during the post-match presentation ceremony.The South African skipper emphasized the importance of tangible performances in boosting the team's confidence. ""You can't speak confidence into the group, can't fake confidence into the group. Only thing that gives confidence is performances,"" he asserted.While acknowledging Virat Kohli 's consistent run-scoring for RCB, Du Plessis expressed satisfaction with the resurgence of other batters.""The competition is so strong, the teams are so strong that you'll get hurt if you're not at 100 percent. More guys are scoring runs now. First half of the tournament only Virat was scoring runs. Greeny scoring runs now will be massive for him,"" he noted.In the match, chasing a formidable target of 207, SRH's aggressive batting approach backfired as they slumped to 69/5 in the 8th over and failed to recover thereafter.

T20 World Cup: Axar Patel makes his case; has Ravindra Jadeja done enough though?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-axar-patel-makes-his-case-has-ravindra-jadeja-done-enough-though/articleshow/109607852.cms,"Axar Patel 's staggering show with the bat while batting at No.3 for Delhi Capitals against Gujarat Titans on Wednesday has triggered a debate about whether India need to pick the lanky all-rounder over Ravindra Jadeja in the T20 World Cup team.Both are left-arm spinners, both are gun fielders, and both can bat well. But in terms of T20 batting skills, one feels Axar is more equipped to play the big shots than Jadeja and bat in different gears as one saw on Wednesday.Of course, Jadeja did win Super Kings the IPL title by hitting Mohit Sharma for a six and a four to win the trophy in the heart-stopping rain-affected final vs Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad last May.If we take just this IPL as a sample size, both the players have similar stats. Axar has scored 123 runs in nine matches at a strike-rate of 132.36, while Jadeja has scored 157 at a strike-rate of 131.93.But it is the six-hitting, a key element of T20 cricket, where Axar seems to have outshone his more illustrious compatriot.Jadeja has struck two maximums so far and Axar has belted five. His more round-arm quickish action from a taller trajectory also might make him more effective with the ball if the wickets grip in the West Indies.While Jadeja is a fantastic bowler in ODIs and Tests, his T20 bowling, because of his consistency in line and length does tend to get predictable for batters to take him down.In this IPL, Axar has taken seven wickets in nine matches at a fantastic economy rate of 7.06. Considering wickets have been flat, it is a terrific performance. He has also bowled 53 dots in the 186 balls he has bowled. Rishabh Pant has also used him in the powerplay with success.Jadeja has taken only four wickets so far despite bowling in spin-friendly conditions. His economy rate has also been higher at 7.85. Jadeja has also bowled fewer dots (43).Their T20I records are similar too. In 52 games, Axar has scored 361 runs at a strike-rate of 144.40 and has taken 49 wickets at an economy rate of 7.26. Jadeja has played 66 games and scored 480 runs at a strike-rate of 125.32. As a bowler, he has taken 53 wickets at an economy rate of 7.10.What one would have noticed in this IPL though is the fact that the Saurashtra and CSK all-rounder could not move the game forward at brisk pace when he was batting at No.4. A case in point being the innings against LSG where he made 16 off 19 balls in a partnership of 52 with skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad.In contrast, Axar Patel, started off slowly at No.3 and then accelerated and showed his full range of strokes against Gujarat Titans.","Axar Patel has scored 123 runs in nine matches at a strike-rate of 132.36, while Ravindra Jadeja has scored 157. Jadeja did win Super Kings the IPL title by hitting Mohit Sharma for a six and a four to win the trophy in the heart- stopping rain-affected final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109607839,imgsize-73982,width-400,resizemode-4/109607839.jpg"

Excerpts from the conversation...

How has it been taking over the Gujarat Titans captaincy from

Hardik Pandya

?

How do you react to the tag of 'prince of Indian cricket'?

Do you try to remain the same Shubman that you were before the stardom?

Last year you played

WTC final

straight after IPL. Now, there's the

T20 WC

after the IPL. How difficult is it to work on your game in these situations?

There's a lot of discussion around strike rates both in T20 and Test cricket…

Whenever there's a

, there's a lot of debate on selections. How do you deal with that during IPL? Do you speak to senior teammates?

How much do you think about the stump mic given what all was said during the recent England series?

Shubman Gill is now one of the big emerging brands in Indian cricket. Having gone through half a season after taking charge of a new but successful IPL franchise, Gujarat Titans , he spoke to TOI to offer a peek into the carefree, street-smart brand of cricket he and his generation play.It's very interesting captaining a franchisee which has been there for two years and played two finals. I have to see what more I can do than what I was doing as a player. It's the same great bunch of players.I think about how I can contribute to the team and how I can make my team win from any situation-be it for my country or Gujarat Titans. I just hate losing. People criticize you when you aren't doing well and then when they like you, they come up with these tags. It's not like I don't listen to the criticism but enjoy the tags that I get. When you are walking to the pitch, you don't think if you are the prince of Indian cricket or you haven't scored in the past 10 innings. You think about the next ball that you're going to face. And you think about the situation and how you're going to overcome it.I don't want to. I have worked very hard to get where I am. It doesn't make sense if I'm the same person that I was five years ago. I'd rather grow and maybe lose what I have right now than be stagnant here. I'd rather crash trying to thrive rather than trying to think about surviving.It's challenging, especially right now. It's very challenging when you switch to Test cricket , because the intensity at which T20 is played right now is completely different to maybe four years or eight years back. The mindset of the players also has changed quite a bit. It's not really a challenge, based on skills. It's more of a mental challenge. But that's also the best part about it.As a batter, from any given situation, if you need to play slower then you have to get the job done for the team. But if you are chasing over 200, you need to play at a 200 strike rate, you should have the game to be able to play that way. In Test cricket, people have started playing a bit faster because they think that is the best way to get the results. Now you don't really see that many draws with the WTC coming in. You wouldn't see too many flat wickets. There's always something for bowlers wherever you go because the teams want results.If I'm captaining the Titans and I'm thinking about my selection in the World Cup then that would not be fair to the team. I want to be able to give my 100% to each player and to all the people that are there in the team. If I'm not thinking about my team right now then I don't think I would be doing a good job as a captain.When you're in that moment, you're not really thinking about the stump mic. I often think it's extra pressure than anything.","Shubman Gill is now one of the big emerging brands in Indian cricket.

"SRH vs RCB, IPL 2024 Highlights: Rajat Patidar, Virat Kohli, spinners help Royal Challengers Bengaluru snap six-match losing streak",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/srh-vs-rcb-ipl-2024-highlights-rajat-patidar-virat-kohli-help-royal-challengers-bengaluru-snap-six-match-losing-streak/articleshow/109602419.cms,"(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Rajat Patidar 's explosive half-century and a strong performance from the spinners led Royal Challengers Bangalore to a 35-run victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL on Thursday, snapping their six-match losing streak.Patidar's quick-fire 50 off 20 balls provided a sharp contrast to Virat Kohli 's steady 51 off 43 balls, helping RCB post a total of 206 for seven after choosing to bat.Although the team had surpassed the 250-run mark three times this season, the usually strong SRH batting line-up fell short of expectations this time, finishing at 171 for eight in their 20 overs.This victory was crucial for RCB, who had lost seven of their first eight games. It marked SRH's third loss in eight matches.Considering the effectiveness of the spinners in the first innings, RCB opened the bowling with part-time off-spinner Will Jacks. The English man had the destructive Travis Head (1 off 3) caught at third man to give RCB a massive boost.Head's opening partner Abhishek Sharma (31 off 13) did entertain the home crowd until his attempted slog ended up in the hands of wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik.Left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh, making his RCB debut, struck twice in his first over removing the dangerous South Africa duo of Aiden Markram and Henrich Klaasen. While Markram missed a full toss to be adjudged lbw, Klaasen was caught at mid-on after mistiming a lofted drive, leaving SRH at 56 for four in five overs.Leggie Karn Sharma then dismissed Nitish Reddy and Abdul Samad to shut the door on the opposition.Earlier, Patidar did the bulk of the work in his 65-run stand with Kohli who was focused on giving the strike to his partner, an approach which was questioned by Sunil Gavaskar on air.Cameron Green (37 not out off 20) and Swapnil Singh (12 off 6) came up with timely strikes in the death overs to take RCB past 200.RCB were all guns blazing in the first three overs with Kohli and Faf du Plessis (25 off 12) going hard at the SRH bowlers, including opposition skipper Pat Cummins who conceded 19 runs in his first over.However, from 43 for no loss of the first 18 balls, RCB could only reach 61 for 1 by the end of the powerplay.Du Plessis was deceived by a slow short ball from T Natarajan to be caught by Aiden Markram at mid-off.Will Jacks (6 off 9) went for a wild slog sweep off a flighted delivery from leg-spinner Mayank Markande but could not make contact to be bowled, leaving RCB 65 for two in seven overs.That was when Kohli and Patidar got together to take the innings forward.The spinners were able to put pressure on the batters after the powerplay. As Kohli went for rotation of strike in this tough phase for RCB, Patidar broke the shackles by smashing Markande for four straight sixes in the 11th over.The first two hits were down the ground before Patidar read Markande's googly to send it over mid-wicket. The fourth and final six came off a wide and loopy delivery which Patidar dispatched over extra cover.Such was the contrast in the style of approaches that Patidar took 19 balls to reach his fifty, while IPL's leading run-getter Kohli took 37.",Royal Challengers Bangalore beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 35 runs. Rajat Patidar scores quick-fire 50 as RCB post 206-7 in their innings.

HYDERABAD: As they say, cricket is a great leveller. When you think that you are on top of your game, it quickly brings you down. Sunrisers Hyderabad , who were in rampaging form with four back-to-back wins and who had racked up totals over 250 for fun, suffered a 35-run loss to bottom-placed Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium.The last time these two teams met, Sunrisers had posted IPL 's record total of 287/3. RCB had their revenge on a searing hot day. The trend this season for Sunrisers has been to seal the fate of the match in the powerplay with openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma providing blistering starts.Not here on Thursday as they collapsed, losing four wickets for 62, chasing down a par total of 206/7. The hosts ended up with 171/8 in 20 overs. For the Faf du Plessis-led side, it was their second win and the first after six straight losses.Sunrisers had a horrible start losing Head in the first over to Will Jacks . Abhishek hit Jacks for 20 runs to get going. But Yash Dayal dismissed the left-hander for 31 off 13 balls (3x4, 2x6) in the fourth over.Spinner Swapnil Singh struck vital blows dismissing both Aiden Markram (7) and Heinrich Klaasen (7) in the fifth over to derail the chase. While Markram missed a full toss to be adjudged lbw, Klaasen, after hitting the bowler for a six, holed out the next ball as the hosts were reduced to 56/4 in five overs.When Karn Sharma bowled Nitish Kumar Reddy in the eighth over and dismissed Abdul Samad in the 10th, the writing was on the wall. Though Pat Cummins entertained the crowd with a 15-ball 31 (3x6), it was all over. Shahbaz Ahmed delayed the inevitable with an unbeaten 40.Earlier, Du Plessis (25) and Kohli added 48 runs in 23 deliveries for the opening stand before the former was dismissed by Natarajan. Kohli took them to 61/1 in powerplay. With Kohli opting to play the anchor, the run rate dipped.Jacks was bowled by Mayank Markande, which brought Rajat Patidar to the crease. He hit Markande for four consecutive sixes in the 11th over and scored 50 of the 65 runs he added with Kohli.Patidar smashed two boundaries and five sixes on his way to a 20-ball 50 while Kohli, who struggled to find the fence, scored a 43-ball 51.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 35 runs.

Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja are finishers in the Indian team, and Shivam Dube is the kind of batter who comes in at No. 4 or 5. When the spinners are operating and conditions are slow, he can hit boundaries and accelerate to change the game.

As Kohli went for rotation of strike in this tough phase for RCB, Patidar broke the shackles by smashing Markande for four straight sixes in the 11th over.The first two hits were down the ground before Patidar read Markande's googly to send it over mid-wicket. The fourth and final six came off a wide and loopy delivery which Patidar dispatched over extra cover.Such was the contrast in the style of approaches that Patidar took 19 balls to reach his fifty, while IPL's leading run-getter Kohli took 37.SRH, who have amassed 250-plus totals thrice this season, would be expected to gun down the target.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru posted 206 for seven in IPL match against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool 's Premier League title aspirations were dealt a severe blow as they suffered a 2-0 loss to their Merseyside rivals Everton , while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a hard-fought 4-2 victory over bottom-placed Sheffield United on Wednesday.Everton took the lead in the 27th minute through Jarrad Branthwaite, who prodded the ball past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker via the post following a poorly cleared free-kick.Despite Mohamed Salah 's efforts, Liverpool failed to equalize, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin sealed the win for Everton with a header in the 58th minute.""

NEW DELHI: Barcelona 's head coach Xavi has decided to remain in his position, despite previously announcing his intention to leave at the end of the season due to the challenging nature of the job.The Spanish club confirmed this news on Wednesday, following reports of meetings between Xavi, club president Joan Laporta, and sporting director Deco.The decision comes amidst a difficult period for Barcelona, who were recently eliminated from the Champions League by Paris Saint-Germain and fell 11 points behind Real Madrid in the La Liga title race after a 3-2 Clasico defeat.Xavi had expressed feeling ""liberated"" when he initially decided to step down, citing the immense pressure and lack of appreciation for his work. He had mentioned that other coaches, such as Pep Guardiola, Ernesto Valverde, and Luis Enrique , had also experienced similar struggles.Barcelona appointed Xavi as their manager in November 2021, and he helped the club win the league title last season. However, this season has been more challenging, with the team suffering a 4-1 defeat to Real in the Spanish Super Cup and being eliminated from the Copa del Rey by Athletic Bilbao. Financial issues have also plagued the club in recent years.Following Xavi's initial announcement to leave, there was a lack of experienced coaches linked to the job, with onlyRafael Marquez , the current Barcelona B team manager, being considered a serious contender.Despite the team's inconsistent performance this season, there are promising signs for the future, with the emergence of young talents such as Lamine Yamal , Pau Cubarsi, and Fermin Lopez.",Xavi had previously announced his intention to leave the club at the end of the season.

NEW DELHI: Atalanta seized their spot in the Coppa Italia final with a thrilling 4-1 victory over Fiorentina in the second leg of their semi-final clash on Wednesday.The win gave them a 4-2 aggregate triumph, setting up a showdown with Juventus in Rome on May 15. Juventus, who have won the competition a record 14 times, advanced despite a 2-1 loss to Lazio in their second leg, progressing with a 3-2 aggregate score.Atalanta, fresh off their Europa League quarter-final elimination of Liverpool , reached their sixth Italian Cup final, with their only previous trophy coming in the 1962-63 season. Fiorentina had taken a 1-0 lead in the first leg at home, thanks to a strike from Rolando Mandragora.However, Atalanta wasted no time in levelling the tie, with Teun Koopmeiners scoring in the eighth minute. Gianluca Scamacca thought he had doubled the lead shortly after, but his goal was disallowed for a foul in the buildup. Atalanta continued to threaten, with Koopmeiners and Charles De Ketelaere both coming close before the break.Fiorentina's task became even more challenging when Nikola Milenkovic was sent off early in the second half for fouling Scamacca just outside the box. Despite being down to ten men, Fiorentina managed to equalise through Lucas Martinez Quarta's header from a free kick.However, Scamacca restored Atalanta's lead with a stunning scissor kick in the 75th minute. Ademola Lookman, who came on as a substitute, added a third goal in stoppage time, which was initially ruled out for offside but later awarded after a VAR review.

Liverpool, who have played one fewer match than Arsenal, face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.""We have made our people very proud, it is a big derby for us and I know what it means,"" said Arteta.The Arsenal manager acknowledged his team's strong start but noted their failure to convert all their chances and some sloppiness in certain areas. However, he praised their second-half performance, citing improved discipline and ruthless finishing.Chelsea suffered a significant setback before the match even began, as their key player Cole Palmer was ruled out due to illness. Palmer has been involved in nearly half of Chelsea's Premier League goals this season, and his absence was keenly felt by the visitors.Despite an unbeaten run of eight league games prior to their FA Cup semi-final loss to Manchester City, Chelsea were outclassed by an Arsenal side eager to reassert their title credentials following a home defeat to Aston Villa.Mauricio Pochettino expressed his disappointment with the result and his team's performance, stating, ""Today we didn't compete against a team fighting for the Premier League. We need to be aware we need to compete in a different way.""Arsenal started the match with incredible intensity, taking the lead within five minutes through Trossard, who has proven to be a more effective signing than Chelsea's January acquisition of Mykhailo Mudryk. Chelsea goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic made several impressive saves to keep his team in the game before halftime, but Arsenal's relentless pressure eventually paid off.White's curling effort from a corner doubled Arsenal's lead early in the second half, and Havertz, who has found consistent form under Arteta, scored twice to put the game out of reach. White's attempted cross, which flew into the top corner, capped off a night to forget for Chelsea, who remained in ninth place, three points behind the European qualification spots.Arsenal's next challenge is a daunting away fixture against Tottenham in the north London derby on Sunday.

It was Ahmed Jahouh, with his third assist of the season, who sent in a cross in front of goal from a corner and the dependable Carlos Delgado was there to meet it with his body and send the ball in.The equaliser got Sergio Lobera ’s team more pumped as Roy Krishna , Amey Ranawade and Isak Vanlalruatfela kept piling pressure on the Bagan defence with runs down the middle and the flanks. The Shield winners, too, kept pushing for another goal but the Delgado and Fall-led Odisha defence kept the dangers at bay.On the other hand, Odisha’s chief playmaker Jahouh fell to Habas’s plan of not being given the space for his long balls and his frustration led to a yellow card in the 23rd minute.But it was Juggernauts’ custodian Amrinder who became the provider in the 39th minute and sent a long ball ahead of the half line. Odisha’s top scorer, Krishna, received the ball with a header and on finding Subhasish Bose a bit out of position, beat Hector Yuste with his pace to send the ball in with a clinical finish between the legs of Vishal Kaith rushing from the goal and become the joint-top scorer in the league.Petratos and Manvir had chances to level the score soon after but the home side went into the break with a one-goal lead.Lobera’s men came back with new vigour after the change of ends but could only create half chances as Odisha held fort at the back.The second half, however, was put in the spotlight for the wrong reason as both teams saw themselves go down by a player to red cards.Armando Sadiku, who received a yellow for an outburst of frustration in the first half, got shown the red card for an aerial tackle on Jahouh in the 67th minute. Seven minutes later, it was Delgado who received the marching orders for a second yellow shown for what appeared to be a harsh penalty for an unintentional handball just outside the box.With both teams a man down, the coaches resorted to more cautious approach with a slew of substitutions and the best attacking chance after that went to Bagan who saw the ball hit the crossbar after a goalmouth melee.The scoreline, however, stayed 2-1 in Odisha’s favour ahead of Sunday’s second leg in Kolkata.",Odisha FC maintained their unbeaten streak at home as they got the better of Shield winners Mohun Bagan Super Giants 2-1 in the first leg of their ISL semifinal in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday.

I faced in Milan what Vinicius is facing in Madrid: Marcel Desailly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/i-faced-in-milan-what-vinicius-is-facing-in-madrid-marcel-desailly/articleshow/109517434.cms,"(The writer's in Madrid on the invitation of Laureus)

MADRID: The city is still reeling under the Clasico hangover and everyone is praising Jude Bellingham . Marcel Desailly , the former captain of France and a World Cup-winner, did not miss out on joining the chorus on England’s new-found ace who decided the Clasico at the Bernabeu on a raucous Sunday night.What makes Desailly stand out, apart from his outstanding physical appearance, is his composed articulation on matters others are apprehensive talking about.TOI asked about Vinicius ' offfield challenges with racism while playing for Real Madrid and Desailly spoke his mind.""He's ambitious and he's a bit too touchy. But he's right at the same time. I experienced this at the time when I was playing for Milan. He doesn't understand. I understand the situation because I'm originally from Africa. You see where he's coming from, Brazil, where it's completely different, the approach. So it's not surprising that he has made the noise. Because it's not about him, it's about the La Liga .""We have the power to change things, but we are not doing enough. Samuel Eto'o had the same issue at his time. So Vinicius is also part of these players who will suffer because the administrative people are not willing to hit harder. Otherwise, we are happy about his growth,"" he said.""Vinicius is 24. I think he has improved. Remember when he came? Four years ago. He didn't have the ability to finish. You see now his clinical assist and finishing."" Immediately his French soul took over and he referred to Dembele. ""The stats are very poor. Two goals or three goals, but he has great potential.""The one player who is living up to potential is Bellingham . With Euro 2024 round the corner, Desailly feels the Real Madrid star will influence Gareth Southgate's forever underachieving bunch rather positively.""I don't think that he was outstanding last night, but he's been key for his team. (Carlo) Ancelotti could have substituted him. But he took Vinicius out because he knew Bellingham had the legs to defend and to position himself and identify the correct moment to find the killer goal. He is just a good player for now. You try to compare him with Zidane. It's difficult for us to accept that. The use of the ball is different with Zidane and Bellingham. Jude is a bit more straightforward on acceleration. Zizou was more pattern-weaving, ballet-like. But the potential of the talent is quite similar.""With his experience of English football while playing for Chelsea, Desailly is cheekily penetrative in his assessment.""Quality kills the quality. That is England's problem. The Dutch were having this kind of problem too. They all have a high expertise, they all have their own belief every time. It was difficult for them to unite all together at the same moment to perform. So England might have to improve on this aspect because the talent is there. So let's see how the coach is going to be able to adjust and make the choice.""Desailly was born in Accra, Ghana but moved to France with his mother when he was just four.","Marcel Desailly believes Jude Bellingham is living up to his potential.

Odisha have never beaten MBSG in their past nine ISL encounters, having gone down on four occasions out of those.Sergio Lobera ’s boys will certainly leave no stone unturned to break that winless streak against their much-fancied, confident opponents at home before travelling to the Mariners’ Kolkata citadel for the second leg.

They secured their historic semis berth with a thrilling 2-1 comeback win against Kerala Blasters in the playoffs at home.Ahead of taking on the Shield Winners, Odisha FC head coach Sergio Lobera banked on their record at home this season. “Tomorrow’s game will be a difficult game. We are going to play against the current shield winners’ team. They have a very good team, but we also have a very good team and we are unbeaten in Kalinga. We want to keep the momentum in terms of our results at home. Our target is to finish the season unbeaten (at home),” Lobera said ahead of the game on Monday.Asked how special it will be to reach the ISL final, the Spanish coach said, “It will be very special for us to reach the semifinals. We are creating a lot of pages in terms of creating a story in the club. We want to do one step more. It will be amazing to reach the final.”Praising their opponents, Mohun Bagan coach Antonio Lopez Habas said ahead of the game, “For me, the past is not one to think about. I have to live in the present. Odisha are a very difficult opponent because they have a good coach, they have players with experience, and it will be a difficult match for us.”About their preparations for the semis clash, the Spanish gaffer said, “We need to prepare for this match as any league match, we need to win this match in the 90 minutes. We can’t think about the second leg, that is how we think about it. This semifinal is very difficult to win in the first leg, but we should not lose it in the first match.”With great tacticians at the helm of two talented bunch of players fighting for supremacy, Tuesday’s clash at Kalinga calls for an exciting first part of the two-legged battle for a berth in the final.","Odisha FC host Mohun Bagan Super Giant in the first leg of the high-octane last- four clash in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Jude Bellingham 's dramatic late winner in the El Clasico clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona on Sunday has virtually sealed the La Liga title for Los Blancos. The 19-year-old English midfielder's stoppage-time strike secured a 3-2 victory for Real Madrid, extending their lead at the top of the table to a commanding 11 points with just six matches remaining.The match was a thrilling encounter, with both teams displaying resilience and determination.Barcelona took the lead twice, through Andreas Christensen and Fermin Lopez, but Real Madrid fought back on both occasions, equalizing through Vinicius Junior and Lucas Vazquez . It was Bellingham's decisive goal in the dying moments that ultimately settled the contest in Real Madrid's favour.Bellingham's performance in his debut season in Spain has been nothing short of remarkable. With 21 goals across all competitions, he has emerged as Real Madrid's top scorer, showcasing his prowess and maturity beyond his years. His brace in the reverse Clasico fixture against Barcelona in October further underscored his ability to rise to the occasion in high-stakes matches.The victory at the Santiago Bernabeu was a testament to Real Madrid's grit and determination, qualities they have consistently displayed throughout the season. Their ability to bounce back from setbacks, as they did against Manchester City in the Champions League, has been a hallmark of their campaign.Lucas Vazquez, who played a pivotal role in all three of Real Madrid's goals, praised the team's resilience and acknowledged the significance of the win in their pursuit of the La Liga title. ""We've had a very good season, we're on a very good path, now we just have to polish it off and we'll go for everything,"" he told Real Madrid TV.For Barcelona, the defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, especially after their impressive performance following their Champions League exit at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain. Head coach Xavi expressed his frustration with the lack of goal-line technology in La Liga, which denied them a potential goal when Lamine Yamal's flick appeared to have crossed the line.Despite the setback, Barcelona showcased their fighting spirit and determination, with youngsters like Yamal and Pau Cubarsi impressing against the seasoned Real Madrid side. The future looks promising for the Catalan club, but for now, they must focus on securing their position in the league and preparing for the next campaign.Real Madrid find themselves in a commanding position, thanks in no small part to the exploits of Jude Bellingham.

"Rafael Nadal seeding for French Open not being considered, says Mauresmo",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/rafael-nadal-seeding-for-french-open-not-being-considered-says-mauresmo/articleshow/109597412.cms,"(With Reuters inputs)

NEW DELHI: Amelie Mauresmo , the tournament director of Roland Garros , indicated on Thursday that former world number one Rafael Nadal is unlikely to receive a seed at the upcoming French Open next month.Nadal himself expressed uncertainty on Wednesday regarding his participation in this year's tournament, despite his remarkable record of winning the French Open a record 14 times.At 37 years old, Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, has seen a significant drop in his ranking, currently standing at 512, following an extended absence due to a hip flexor injury that kept him sidelined for almost a year.Although he has secured a place in the main draw of the French Open via his protected ranking, this ranking does not guarantee seeding, as seeding is determined by the top 32 ranked players.Without a seed, Nadal could potentially face formidable opponents in the early stages of the tournament.Traditionally, Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam event that did not strictly adhere to the ATP and WTA rankings, instead considering a player's past performances on grass courts when determining seeding. However, this approach faced criticism from players, including Nadal, leading to its abandonment in 2020.Asked about Nadal being seeded at this year's French Open, Mauresmo told reporters: ""Right now it's not a topic...""Wimbledon did it for a very, very, very long time, and it certainly brought some advantages but we also saw all the disadvantages it could bring. For the moment, it's not on the table.""We're keeping our fingers crossed for him above all, for us too obviously. We're keeping a close eye on what's happening for him on court. We're in touch with his team. Whether there's a tribute depends very much on him. We'll follow his wishes.""Nadal is in action against 16-year-old American Darwin Blanch in the Madrid Open later on Thursday.",Rafael Nadal unlikely to receive a seed at the upcoming French Open.

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal declared on Wednesday that he'll only participate in the upcoming French Open if he feels ""capable enough to compete well.""The 14-time Roland Garros champion acknowledged that if the event commenced today, he wouldn't be ready to take part. However, he pledged to persevere in his efforts to secure the opportunity to play at his most triumphant tournament for one final time.""I don't know what's going to happen in the next three weeks.I will keep fighting and doing the things I believe I have to do so I can try to play in Paris, and if I can play, I play, if I can't, I can't,"" the former world number one told reporters at the Madrid Open on Wednesday.""I will not play in Paris if I am the way I am now. If Paris were today, I wouldn't take to the court. That's the reality. I will only play in Paris if I feel capable enough to compete well.""Nadal made his tennis comeback in Brisbane in January after nearly a year of sidelined recovery from a psoas injury. However, his return was cut short due to a muscle issue sustained in Australia, limiting him to just five matches this season.Last week, he began his clay campaign in Barcelona, exiting in the second round. Now, he is poised to take on 16-year-old American Darwin Blanch in his Madrid opener on Thursday.""I don't think I'm ready to play at my 100 percent but I'm prepared to go out and play tomorrow. It's important for me to play one last time here in Madrid, for me it means a lot,"" said the 37-year-old Nadal.As he attempts to resume his 'Last Dance' in Madrid and say goodbye to one of his favourite tournaments on court, rather than on the sidelines, the 22-time major champion admits his farewell tour hasn't been as enjoyable as he would have hoped.""A few weeks ago, I didn't know if I will be able to play again on the professional tour, so today I am playing,"" he added.""It's not perfect, of course not perfect, but at least I am playing and I can enjoy again, especially in the few tournaments that are so emotional for me. I'm able to enjoy the fact that I can say probably good-bye on court.""Nadal says he's hitting the ball well when he is able to be on court but ""it's about more body limitations. I went through a lot of things last year and a half, two years"".""So body feelings are not enough good to feel myself playing with freedom enough in terms of body issues. That's not allowing me to compete the way that I would like to compete.""","Rafael Nadal says he'll only participate in the upcoming French Open if he feels ""capable enough to compete well"" The 14-time Roland Garros champion acknowledged that if the event commenced today, he wouldn't be ready to take part.

I'm enjoying being on the tennis court: Sumit Nagal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/im-enjoying-being-on-the-tennis-court-sumit-nagal/articleshow/109560007.cms,"Nagal's mid-season training block is about building on the gains of the last four months

BENGALURU: Sumit Nagal 's latest hairdo is short fade. It's as sharp as his tennis game.The India No.1, who climbed to a career-high 80 in the world on Monday last, took care of the style element on his arrival in Delhi. Nagal, who spent a few days with family and friends while getting his visa sorted, heads back to Europe this week to kick-off a three-week training block at the Nensel academy in Peine, Germany, before returning to his beloved clay courts.The timing of Nagal's training block - when the clay court swing is in full blast in Europe - raised injury worries.The 26-year-old brushed aside concerns with an insouciant shrug, insisting it's a good time for a training block. Nagal explained that he has played from March to March, including in the off-season in December. Ranked 138 at the time, Nagal played the Tennis Premier League , hoping the money would give him the financial freedom to schedule his 2024 season.Nagal will look at his net game and serve, which he noted has been on and off in the last weeks, besides build on his fitness in his time away from the Tour.The Indian is aiming to get a tournament in, perhaps in Lyon, before arriving at Roland Garros.Nagal has enjoyed an inspirational run in the first four months of the year, climbing almost 60 rungs in the ranking, especially coming into his own on clay.Nagal describes his relationship with clay in one word 'smooth', like a sharp cup of espresso. It awakens the competitor in him.""The more time I have, the better I am at chasing down the ball,"" he told TOI.Nagal learnt his tennis on the clay courts of Paschim Vihar in West Delhi as an eight-year-old.""It was probably fast,"" he said of those courts. ""I don't think we have slow clay courts in India. Clay courts are different everywhere, the clay courts in France are very different to Germany, Germany and Austria are similar, they are heavy, wet. France is a little bit hard and fast. Italy has a mix of both, but more on the faster side.""While the tennis world has played on the Nadal, Nagal surname, the Indian gave the legendary Spaniard a verbal salute.""What Rafa has done on clay is just insane,"" he said. ""His game is ridiculous, he moves incredibly, you just cannot hit past him and with that forehand jumping over your head for three or four hours… It's crazy.""The career he has followed with great personal interest, however, is that of the 25-year-old world No.6 Casper Ruud .""I've learnt a lot from watching Ruud,"" Nagal said. ""I have seen him from his junior days, playing under-14, under-16. The way he has developed his game, is very good.''""I feel like I can play a similar game to him. Serve smart, use a big forehand and have a solid backhand. And use the backhand smartly to get the ball to your forehand side. He has been playing at that level for a long time and I think that's the next step for me, to keep playing at this level, keep playing the ATP Tour level .""Nagal isn't surprised with his form of the first four months of the year, where he scored two top-50 wins and took a set off the world No.7 Holger Rune in Monte Carlo.""I know I can play top-50 tennis and keep improving,"" he said. ""When you lose there are a lot of things you feel you could've done better, but I don't think I lost a match (in the last few months) because of energy or focus. I have matured as a competitor.""The Indian is in a whole different headspace these days. ""I am enjoying being on the tennis court ,"" he said. ""I'm enjoying playing matches, enjoying fighting.""","India No.1 Sumit Nagal heads back to Europe this week for a three-week training block.

That's obviously what I work towards, to try and get better and to win tournaments. So, nice to win my second Tour title, almost 10 or 11 months from now (after the first), and to do it on different surfaces, very very happy with that,"" Bhambri said following his victory in the company of French Albano Olivetti on Sunday.The pair defeated the German wildcard combination of Andreas Mies, a two-time doubles Grand Slam winner, and Jan-Lennard Struff, a four-time titleist, 7-6, 7-6.""I hope me and Albano can continue improving and continue getting better with more clay court events and the French Open coming up.""Coach Balachandran Manikkath, who has been working with Bhambri as part of the ""Doubles Dream of India"" programme, provided some insights on the adjustments the Delhi lad has made in his game for the slowest of the three surfaces.""Yuki has been working on playing on clay since Marrakech (ATP 250 event in Morocco). It is obviously different from hard and certain adjustments have to be made with serves, returns, volleys, smash, etc,"" Balachandran said.""He has done a tremendous job as the results show this week. On slow, wet clay courts he is able to hold serve comfortably and his returns are good, volleying is solid.""This win with Olivetti will help confidence on both sides. They are already fixed to play the clay season all the way up to French (Open). So nothing changes there except that both are moving up the rankings.""Bhambri's ranking rose a career-high 54 on Monday while Olivetti moved up to a personal best 45.The rankings at the end of the French Open will determine the entries for the tennis competition at the Olympics , which will be held at the Roland Garros as well.Doubles star Rohan Bopanna is sitting pretty well at World No. 2 at the moment, which gives him a direct entry and a partner of his choice subject to the latter's ranking being in the top-300 – in either singles or doubles.""Olympics is not in my control. The selection committee or the AITA decides the team, so I'm focused on trying to improve my ranking, improve my game and just continue on the Tour,"" Bhambri said.""Whether I like to play the Olympics, I absolutely would. It's every Indian's dream to represent the country and I'm no different. The Olympics is the biggest stage but, again, this is not in my hands.""Returning to what is in his control, Bhambri said the Munich triumph would not change his preference for hard.""Hardcourt is always going to be my preference. Just for the sole purpose that it requires less adjustment for me because I've played on it all my life,"" he said.""So, no matter how many titles I am gonna win on clay or grass, hardcourt is going to be the preference.""It (doubles) is a bit different compared to singles. Doubles is less movement, which makes it a bit easier but there's still technical aspects of doubles, which in general doesn't involve so much side to side movement.""There is a lot of serving and volleying, and returning fast points. So you have to be good at that, regardless of any surface if you want to succeed in doubles.""Given the necessities of the modern game where entries into big tournaments breaks and makes partnerships, Bhambri, who decided to focus on doubles only two seasons back, has become adept at playing on both sides of the court.""Yuki plays ad court with Olivetti. He played deuce with Robin Hasse in Dubai and reached semis. In Madrid last week he played deuce with Arel Behar too,"" Balachandran said.""Now he is comfortable playing on either side. Just that he has played more on ad court, and people recognise him as an ad court player. That will change soon as he plays on either side with different partners.""Known for avoiding late hours, playing on the Tour has also brought a bit of change to Bhambri's personal side.""Well, I've been part of the Tour for a long time now. So I know most of them. Of course, I miss partying with with Roger (Federer) and Rafa (Nadal), enjoying nights out with them. Since they are not much around on the Tour, it's not the same,"" he said.""Maybe the next generation I can hang out with more, stay out late and socialize with them more – the Alcaraz's and the Kyrgios's of the tour.""",Yuki Bhambri won his second Tour title with a win at the BMW Open in Munich. The 31-year-old has won his first two titles on the doubles Tour on grass and clay.
