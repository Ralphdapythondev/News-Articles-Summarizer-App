NEW DELHI: Lockie Ferguson made history with the most economical spell in T20Is as New Zealand ended their World Cup campaign with a dominant seven-wicket win over Papua New Guinea in Trinidad on Monday.Ferguson's stunning spell of 4-4-0-3 helped New Zealand bowl out PNG for just 78 in 19.4 overs. The Kiwis then chased down the target with 46 balls to spare.Ferguson's performance was remarkable as he joined Canada’s Saad Bin Zafar as only the second bowler in T20I history to bowl all four overs as maidens and return with three or more wickets. Zafar had previously recorded 4-4-0-2.Despite New Zealand’s strong showing against Oman and PNG in the Group stage, they were ousted from the T20 World Cup after earlier losses to Afghanistan and West Indies, which led to their early elimination from the tournament.PNG faced its own challenges, losing each of its four Group C fixtures.New Zealand's bowlers, led by Ferguson, consistently troubled the PNG batters.Kabua Morea put up a fight for PNG, dismissing Finn Allen for a duck on the second ball of New Zealand’s chase and later taking the wicket of Rachin Ravindra.Devon Conway was pivotal with a 32-ball 35, including three sixes and two fours, laying a solid foundation for the win. Skipper Kane Williamson and Daryl Mitchell then ensured the chase was completed smoothly.Earlier in the match, Ferguson's magical spell restricted PNG to a low score. New Zealand’s bowlers successfully kept PNG’s batters on the defensive throughout their innings.Trent Boult played his last T20 World Cup match, starting with a tight two-run over. Tim Southee struck first, getting PNG opener Tony Ura caught at deep backward point. Boult didn’t take any new-ball wickets, but Ferguson struck immediately with his first delivery, dismissing Assad Vala.The pacer continued to dominate, preventing PNG from scoring off his next three overs. His second wicket came when he trapped Charles Amini lbw, adding to his tally.Mitchell Santner chipped in by dismissing Sese Bay, who was caught by Finn Allen at long-on attempting an aggressive shot. Ferguson completed his spell without conceding a run, later removing Chad Soper who edged to the keeper.Ferguson matched the record set by Zafar, who was the first to bowl four maidens in a T20I back in November 2021 against Panama during the T20 World Cup Americas Region Qualifier.Boult returned to the attack, cleaning up Hiri Hiri for his first wicket of the match. Southee took another wicket shortly afterward, dismissing Kiplin Doriga.Ish Sodhi, who had struggled initially, grabbed two late wickets to wrap up the PNG innings in the final over.The comprehensive win marked New Zealand's exit from the tournament with their heads held high.",Lockie Ferguson's spell of 4-4-0-3 helped New Zealand bowl out PNG for just 78 in 19.4 overs.

NEW DELHI: Gary Kirsten , the head coach of the Pakistan cricket team , has expressed his deep disappointment and frustration with the team's performance in the ongoing T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies.In a scathing criticism, Kirsten stated that there is ""no unity"" within the team, and he has ""never seen such a situation"" throughout his extensive coaching career.Pakistan's dismal showing in the tournament culminated in a group stage exit, a far cry from their runner-up finish in the previous edition.The team's lackluster performance was marked by a shocking defeat against tournament debutants USA, followed by a loss to their arch-rivals India. Pakistan managed to salvage some pride with a consolation victory over Ireland, but it was too little, too late.According to PTI, reports from Pakistani media outlets suggest that Kirsten, who famously led India to their ODI World Cup victory in 2011, did not mince his words when assessing the team's shortcomings after their elimination from the T20 World Cup.His candid remarks underscore the urgent need for the Pakistan cricket team to address the apparent lack of cohesion and unity within their ranks if they hope to bounce back from this disappointing campaign.""There's no unity in Pakistan's team. They call it a team, but it isn't a team. They aren't supporting each other; everyone is separated, left and right. I've worked with many teams, but I've never seen such a situation,"" Kirsten said as per reports quoting a senior scribe.According to sources cited by Geosuper.tv 4, Kirsten conveyed his dissatisfaction regarding the players' fitness levels. He also mentioned that the team's skill level is significantly lower compared to other teams worldwide.Following Pakistan's loss against India, Kirsten attributed the team's defeat to subpar decision-making on their part.""Disappointing loss, that's for sure,"" Kirsten had said.""I knew 120 was not going to be an easy target. If India got only 120, it was always going to be not the easiest. But I think we had the game at 72 for 2 with six or seven overs left. Disappointing not to get across the line from the position we got ourselves into.""Pakistan emerged victorious against Ireland by a margin of three wickets in their final encounter of the T20 World Cup on Sunday.Prior to their last group stage match, Pakistan had already been knocked out of the tournament due to their losses against the USA and India.By securing a win against Ireland, Pakistan managed to claim the third position in Group A, having achieved two victories out of their four matches played in the event.","Gary Kirsten, head coach of Pakistan cricket team, has expressed his disappointment and frustration with the team's performance in the T20 World Cup.

Smriti Mandhana elated after scoring first ton at home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/smriti-mandhana-elated-after-scoring-first-ton-at-home/articleshow/111066718.cms,"BENGALURU: It is a dream for any Indian player to score a hundred at home. Smriti Mandhana was also waiting for that opportunity to celebrate the magical three-figure mark in front of Indian fans. Eleven years after making her white-ball debut, it came true on Sunday against South Africa women in the first ODI at M Chinnaswamy Stadium .Smriti, who has played 83 ODIs, scored a match-winning 127-ball 117 in her 36th home ODI, also sixth ton in one-dayers. The opener has ten half-centuries at home in ODIs with her best being 86 against England in 2018. In T20Is, her best (at home) remains the 79 against Australia in Mumbai, 2022 while in Test matches, a 74 against the same team last year at Wankhede is her best score.Smriti was also happy that she scored a ton in a winning cause. “I was mad with myself in the last 4-5 years. Whenever I played at home, be it Tests or one-dayers, I ended up scoring 70-80 runs and throwing away my wicket. More than scoring in India, I could get the team through. But I am also pleased to know that it (century at home) has happened. I hope that it keeps coming and it stays,” Smriti said.The left-hander, who loves to take on the bowlers, had to play according to the situation after India were restricted to 99/5. Being a 50-over game, Smriti had the luxury to be patient and change her game plan to reconstruct the innings. She did just that during the sixth-wicket partnership (81) alongside Deepti Sharma and another stand of 58 runs with Pooja Vastrakar .“The format of one-day cricket is such where you play according to the ball and not think too much. Whenever I was thinking of taking the game on, we lost a wicket, and maybe that helped me stay on. Sometimes I (tend to) go after the bowler around the 80-90 mark, but I did not have that chance (this time). I had to cut down my shots in the middle, and I also played a few dot balls, still had to be calm about it. (Partnership with) Deepti and Pooja also really helped,” Smriti added.","Smriti Mandhana scored a match-winning 117 in her 36th home ODI, also sixth ton in one-dayers.

NEW DELHI: Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has indicated that spinners might play a crucial role, even during the death overs, when India begin its ICC T20 World Cup Super Eights campaign against Afghanistan in Barbados, starting June 20.The Indian team maintained an unbeaten record in the group stage, securing wins against Ireland, Pakistan, and the USA, with their final match against Canada on June 15 being washed out by rain.Afghanistan is also undefeated, achieving significant victories against Uganda, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. They have a group-stage game against West Indies on Tuesday.Speaking to Star Sports, Jadeja mentioned that the pitches in the West Indies are slow and dry, which benefits spinners in the middle overs.""Whenever we play in the West Indies, the wicket remains a bit slow and dry. The match timing is also in the morning so spinners will have help. Even in India, there are many wickets where spinners get help.

Kohli and Jadeja have intense batting session

NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket team commenced their Caribbean leg of the T20 World Cup with a focused and intense practice session. Virat Kohli , Ravindra Jadeja , and Kuldeep Yadav put in extra effort to prepare for the Super 8s stage of the tournament, PTI reported.Kohli struggled to find his footing on the challenging pitches in New York, scoring only 1, 4, and 0 in the group stage matches. Fans and experts alike are hoping for the superstar batsman to regain his form and make a significant impact in the crucial Super 8s and knockout stages.India's first Super 8 match is scheduled for Thursday against Afghanistan at the renovated Kensington Oval.T20 World Cup 2024: Points Table Jadeja, too, has yet to make a notable contribution with either bat or ball. However, the all-rounder was only required to bat once and was not heavily relied upon for his bowling due to the pace-friendly conditions in New York.Kuldeep, who has not featured in the playing eleven thus far, is expected to play a crucial role in the Caribbean conditions, which have traditionally favored spinners.The entire Indian squad participated in the practice session, eager to make the most of the opportunity after not having played since completing the New York leg on June 12. Poor weather conditions in Fort Lauderdale prevented any training or play, making this session all the more important.The pitches in New York were heavily criticized, and now attention turns to the surfaces being prepared at the six Caribbean venues.In the tournament, a score of 200, considered par in the IPL, has only been surpassed twice, both times in the Caribbean. Even a total of 150 has often proven to be competitive.As Indian captain Rohit Sharma entered the practice area, he asked his teammates about the condition of the training pitches. Given the circumstances, his inquiry was not completely unexpected.""Pitch kaisa hain (how is the pitch)?"" he asked his lead pacer Jasprit Bumrah who seemed to be pleased with the surfaces provided for training.Virat Kohli, the first player to enter the nets after warming up on the field, spent at least 30 minutes facing throwdowns before taking on Kuldeep and Hardik Pandya .He focused on lofted drives down the ground and over extra cover, as well as practicing the pull shot against Jasprit Bumrah. One delivery from Bumrah rose sharply from back of length, and Kohli hooked it towards the fine-leg region, resulting in an exchange of wry smiles between the two players.Following a short break, Kohli received gentle throwdowns from Yuzvendra Chahal and coach Rahul Dravid. In the adjacent net, Jadeja worked on his slog sweep and inside-out drive over extra cover against a leg-spinner from the net bowlers.Rishabh Pant, India's most impressive batter in the tournament so far, faced deliveries from Bumrah, Hardik, Kuldeep, and Axar Patel in the nets. Later, Hardik returned to the field to practice his range hitting.The next group to bat in the nets consisted of Suryakumar Yadav , Shivam Dube, and Yashasvi Jaiswal.With the breeze blowing across the facility, Mohammed Siraj and Arshdeep Singh managed to generate significant swing with the ball.","Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav put in extra effort to prepare for Super 8s stage.

Even the other team has to play on the same pitch, and it is our job to change the way we play. We are representing a country and have to take that responsibility,"" Hasaranga said during the post-match press conference.The skipper acknowledged that the team failed to make necessary adjustments, calling it the ""main flaw"" of their campaign.He expressed gratitude towards the Sri Lankan Cricket ( SLC ) board for organizing a preparatory camp and ensuring the team reached the venues 10 days in advance.""That was a big thing. It was important to get used to conditions, weather, and the time zone here. But then when we moved from one region in the USA to another, the pitches were not the same. Even though in some countries pitches are more similar from place to place, that is not the case in the USA.""""We adjusted as well as we could, but we unfortunately got New York for the first match, and it did not go well for us. In the second match, we went to Dallas and did not adjust well to that pitch. As a team and as a captain we have to take the responsibility for that,"" he concluded.Sri Lanka, once dominant in ICC tournaments, struggled again this year.Since winning the T20 World Cup in 2014, they have not reached the knockout stages in ICC events, except for the 2015 50-over World Cup where they made it to the quarterfinals.In the match against the Netherlands, Sri Lanka was put to bat as the Netherlands won the toss and chose to bowl.Contributions from Kusal Mendis (46 in 29 balls), Charith Asalanka (46 in 21 balls), Dhananjaya de Silva (34 in 26 balls), and Angelo Matthews (30* in 15 balls) helped Sri Lanka set a target of 201/6 in their 20 overs.Logan van Beek was the standout bowler for the Netherlands with figures of 2/45.During their run chase of 202 runs, the Netherlands had a solid start with an opening partnership of 45 runs between Michael Levitt (31 in 23 balls) and Max O'Dowd (11 in 8 balls), but they soon began losing wickets regularly. Skipper Scott Edwards (31 in 24 balls) tried to mount a fight but lacked the necessary support, leading to the team's collapse at 118 in 16.4 overs.Nuwan Thushara emerged as the pick of the bowlers for Sri Lanka with figures of 3/24. Matheesha Pathirana (2/12) and Hasaranga (2/25) also delivered impressive spells.Charith Asalanka was named the 'Player of the Match' for his all-round performance.Sri Lanka ended up third in Group D with one win, two losses, and a no result, tallying three points in total.

NEW DELHI: With a scrappy win over Ireland in their final group A game on Sunday, Pakistan wrapped up their woeful 2024 T20 World Cup campaign.Chasing a lowly 107, Ireland gave Pakistan batters a run for their money as the 2009 champions nearly botched up again before crawling past the finish line in the penultimate over for the loss of 7 wickets.While the bowlers performed decently, the batting unit once again, barring Babar Azam , disappointed.The flop show from the batters, that resulted in loss against USA and India and their early ouster from the tournament, was once again exposed against Ireland.Dissecting Pakistan's horror run in the tournament, former England skipper Michael Vaughan said that there was no power in the former champions' batting line-up.""I just look at the way Pakistan bat and it's very rare that you kind'a say this about any world batting line-up but I don't think any bowler would be running into bowl, fearful of bowling to any of those players,"" Vaughan said on a Cricbuzz show.""Babar, you know, is not hurting anybody, staying in.

Slovakia stun wasteful Belgium as VAR twice denies Romelu Lukaku in Euro 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/slovakia-stun-wasteful-belgium-as-var-twice-denies-romelu-lukaku-in-euro-2024/articleshow/111066557.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ivan Schranz 's lightning-fast goal propelled Slovakia to a hard-fought 1-0 upset victory over a profligate Belgium side in their European Championship Group E clash in Frankfurt on Monday.The defeat marked Belgium's first loss in 16 matches under the guidance of coach Domenico Tedesco and evoked memories of their disappointing 2022 World Cup campaign, despite having two goals disallowed by VAR.Romelu Lukaku had both goals chalked off, the first for offside and the second due to a handball in the build-up, compounding a frustrating day for the powerful striker, who also squandered several clear-cut opportunities.Slovakia's win sees them join Romania at the top of the group standings following the latter's 3-0 triumph over Ukraine in Munich earlier on Monday. Belgium will face Romania next in Cologne on Saturday.Pre-match discussions about Belgium's new generation, shedding the ""Golden Generation"" label and brimming with young talent, were overshadowed by familiar issues.Tedesco's team controlled the majority of the game but lacked clinical finishing, and when they did find the net, they were thwarted by VAR and a resolute Slovakian defense.The absence of Belgium's preferred central defensive duo, Jan Vertonghen and Arthur Theate, coupled with the deployment of left winger Jeremy Doku on the right in the first half and Yannick Carrasco as a left wing-back, contributed to a lack of balance in the team.This uncertainty led to Slovakia's opener, as Doku's poor pass into his own box was not cleared by the defense, allowing Juraj Kucka's effort to be saved before Schranz pounced on the rebound, beating Belgium goalkeeper Koen Casteels from a tight angle just six minutes and five seconds into the match.Belgium had chances to equalize, with Lukaku denied from close range by Slovakia goalkeeper Martin Dubravka after a mesmerizing run from Doku. Lukaku, who had scored 17 goals in 11 games under Tedesco, had two more significant opportunities in the first half.Slovakia also had their moments, with Casteels making a superb diving save to deny Lukas Haraslin's excellent volley, and their players celebrated every tackle as if they had scored a goal, demonstrating their excellent defensive discipline.Belgium came close again when substitute Johan Bakayoko seemed certain to score following a goalmouth scramble, only for Slovakia defender David Hancko to clear the ball off the line.They were denied once more when Lois Openda handled the ball after his persistence on the left-hand side had set up Lukaku.",Ivan Schranz scores only goal as Slovakia beat Belgium 1-0 in Frankfurt. Romelu Lukaku had two goals disallowed by VAR for offside and handball. Defeat marks Belgium's first loss in 16 matches under coach Domenico Tedesco.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111066553,imgsize-84260,width-400,resizemode-4/111066553.jpg"

Lunin was at fault for the second goal, which slipped underneath him as he dove.Ukraine struggled to capitalize on their early possession, while Romania absorbed the pressure and struck on the counter after regaining possession deep in their own half.Before the match, Romania's coach Edward Iordanescu had promised, ""My players would fight for every metre on the pitch,"" and they delivered, defending fiercely and launching counter-attacks as their supporters cheered them on.The outcome was all but sealed shortly before the hour mark when forward Dennis Man drove into the box from a corner and set up Denis Dragus for an easy tap-in.Romania's solid defense prevented Ukraine from getting any significant goal chances, securing their second win in 17 European Championship matches. Their first victory was a 3-2 win over England at Euro 2000.For Iordanescu, the win was a special birthday gift, coming a day after his celebration.

NEW DELHI: Belgium and Slovakia will start their Euro 2024 journeys on Monday in Group E . The match is scheduled to take place in Frankfurt at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT). Romania and Ukraine are also part of this compelling group of fixtures.Both teams have strong ties to Italian football, adding an interesting layer to the match. Slovakia is coached by Francesco Calzona, a former interim coach at Napoli who worked under Mauricio Sarri. Belgium’s head coach, Domenico Tedesco, was born in Italy but grew up in Germany and holds German citizenship.This will be Slovakia’s third consecutive European Championship since the competition expanded to 24 teams. They reached the round of 16 in 2016 before losing 3-0 to Germany. Historically, Slovakia, when it was part of Czechoslovakia, won the European Championship in 1976.In 1980, Belgium reached the finals, narrowly losing to West Germany. The two teams have no competitive match history, with their last game being a friendly 11 years ago. Belgium won that match 2-1 in Brugge, featuring a young Kevin De Bruyne.Belgium will be without Thibaut Courtois, regarded by many as the world’s top goalkeeper, despite his crucial role in Real Madrid’s Champions League win. Courtois reportedly had a falling out with Tedesco after not being made captain for a game last year. Defensively, Belgium also faces challenges with injuries to Axel Witsel, Jan Vertonghen, and Arthur Theate. This situation allows young talents like Zeno Debast and Maxim De Cuyper a chance to step up.On Slovakia's side, experienced players Peter Pekarík and Juraj Kucka, both 37, are expected to participate. They are Slovakia’s oldest players and the remaining squad members from the team that knocked out defending champions Italy in the 2010 World Cup group stage.Belgium is entering the tournament ranked No. 3 by FIFA, despite a disappointing 2022 World Cup where they didn’t make it past the group stage. Belgium has been in the top-five FIFA rankings for seven years and held the top spot from 2018 to 2021. Meanwhile, Slovakia is ranked No. 48.At 31 years old, Romelu Lukaku has already scored 85 goals for Belgium, making him the top scorer for his country. This achievement overshadows the combined total goals scored by Slovakia’s top three scorers since 1994. Marek Hamsik, who has recently retired and is now an assistant coach, holds Slovakia’s goal-scoring record with 26 goals.Belgium’s captain, Kevin De Bruyne, recently celebrated his 100th national team appearance by scoring a goal in a 2-0 win against Montenegro. On the other hand, Slovakia set an unfortunate record in March for conceding the fastest goal in men’s international soccer history. Austria’s Christoph Baumgartner scored just six seconds into their match.These narratives set the stage for an exciting start to Group E's Euro 2024 campaign. Both Belgium and Slovakia are eager to make a strong opening statement and set the tone for their respective journeys.The Euro 2024 match between Belgium and Slovakia will be on Monday, 17 June at 9:30 PM IST at Deutsche Bank Park.This match will be telecasted in India on Sony Sports Network.You can live stream the match between Belgium and Slovakia on SonyLIV App.The live telecast of the Euro 2024 match will be on BBC, ITV at 4:15pm.You can watch the match live on FOX Sports, Fubo TV at 12:00 pm ET/ 9:00 am PT on Monday, June 17","Belgium and Slovakia will start their Euro 2024 journeys on Monday in Group E.

Poland and the Netherlands join them in Group D , ensuring a highly competitive environment. The match will begin at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT).France heads into the tournament with strong momentum, having won eight out of ten matches in 2023, with their only defeat coming against Germany.

Impressive victories over Germany and Turkey reflect Austria's growing confidence.France is dealing with a midfield issue as Aurélien Tchouaméni recovers from a foot injury, causing him to miss Real Madrid'sChampions League final.

This marks Kanté's comeback to international play since 2022.Austria, with the exception of defender Gernot Trauner, practiced at full capacity in Berlin before the upcoming match. Coach Rangnick explained Trauner's absence as a precautionary measure, not injury-related.Attacking midfielder Christoph Baumgartner discussed Austria's strategy, emphasizing a high pressing tactic aimed at disrupting the flow of France's top attackers, Kylian Mbappé and Dembélé.Kylian Mbappé is set to make his 80th appearance for France, with an opportunity to achieve 50 international goals if he scores a hat trick. He previously had success against Austria, scoring in their last two matches in 2022.Antoine Griezmann, the experienced Atletico Madrid forward, is on the verge of becoming only the fourth French player to reach 130 international appearances if he plays against Austria.Christoph Baumgartner's ability to score has been a vital asset for Austria, having found the net in each of their last five matches.Austria's connections to German football are significant.

NEW DELHI: Belgium , under the leadership of Kevin De Bruyne , is gearing up to start their European Championship journey against Slovakia in Group E. They share the group with Romania and Ukraine. The match will take place in Frankfurt at 6 p.m. local time on Monday.There’s a notable Italian influence on both teams.

NEW DELHI: The football world's attention is fixed on Germany as it plays host to Euro 2024. This 17th edition of Europe's premier football tournament guarantees a thrilling showcase of talent and passion. From June 14 to July 14, the continent's top 24 teams will compete for the coveted title.Portugal 's star forward Cristiano Ronaldo is determined to create more European Championship history this summer, aiming to add another major international trophy to Portugal's Euro 2016 triumph. The 39-year-old veteran, set to appear in a record-extending sixth Euros, believes his team deserves further success.Portugal begins its campaign against Czech Republic in Leipzig, with Ronaldo expected to play a crucial role. Managed by Roberto Martinez, Portugal had a flawless qualification and is likely to advance comfortably from Group F, which also includes Turkey and Georgia.Ronaldo, now playing for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia, scored twice against the Republic of Ireland in a recent friendly, increasing his international goals record to 130. His 14 goals in European Championships make him the competition's all-time top scorer, surpassing France 's Michel Platini.Having first appeared at the Euros in 2004, Ronaldo has scored in every edition since, except for one game. He aims to become the oldest Euros goalscorer, currently held by Austria's Ivica Vastic.In other Euro 2024 news, England started their campaign with a 1-0 victory over Serbia, thanks to Jude Bellingham's header. The Netherlands also secured a late 2-1 win over Poland. Denmark, with Christian Eriksen scoring, drew 1-1 against Slovenia in a poignant return to the tournament three years after Eriksen's cardiac arrest.While England is considered one of the tournament favourites, their performance in the opener was underwhelming, with Bellingham being a standout player. Manager Gareth Southgate aims to lead England's talented squad to their first major tournament title in 58 years.GROUP A - Germany, Switzerland, Hungary and ScotlandGROUP B - Spain, Italy, Albania and CroatiaGROUP C -

Euro 2024: England hang on to beat Serbia 1-0 with Jude Bellingham header,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/euro-2024-england-hang-on-to-beat-serbia-1-0-with-jude-bellingham-header/articleshow/111047384.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jude Bellingham 's first-half header gave England a 1-0 victory over Serbia, kicking off their Euro 2024 campaign on a high note. The match began confidently for England but ended with them holding on for the win.Bellingham timed his run perfectly to meet Bukayo Saka's deflected cross, scoring from close range in the 13th minute. The goal came after Bellingham started the move himself, helping put England ahead early in the game.This win placed England at the top of Group C, following Denmark and Slovenia's 1-1 draw earlier in the day. Bellingham stayed involved throughout, driving England's attack and drawing loud cheers from fans at the Arena AufSchalke.Gareth Southgate 's team initially created opportunities down the right side, with Saka combining well with fullback Kyle Walker. Walker's runs were a consistent threat in the first half.However, Serbia gained momentum in the second half, posing more of a challenge. England struggled to replicate their early dominance after halftime.By the end of the match, there were only 11 total shots, with Serbia taking six and England five. This was the lowest shot tally in a European Championship match since at least 1980, according to Opta data.When asked if the loss of momentum indicated that England was still a work in progress, Bellingham took issue with the suggestion.""I don't agree with that,"" he said. ""I think the first half shows why we can score goals against any team and the second half shows why we can keep a clean sheet against any team.""At the start of the second half, Serbia improved their play after coach Dragan Stojkovic substituted Ivan Ilic for defensive midfielder Nemanja Gudelj. Striker Dusan Vlahovic soon sent a dangerous cross through England's box, energizing the Serbian fans.Stojkovic then intensified his offensive strategy by bringing on Dusan Tadic and Luka Jovic just past the hour mark.In response, England's coach, Gareth Southgate, introduced the energetic Conor Gallagher, replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold, who was playing in an unusual midfield position.Another substitute, Jarrod Bowen, set up a precise cross for captain Harry Kane . Kane's header was dramatically saved by goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic, hitting the bar in the 77th minute.Five minutes later, Jordan Pickford made a crucial save, tipping over a powerful shot from Vlahovic as Serbia maintained their pressure.Despite the onslaught, England's restructured defense, featuring the impressive Marc Guehi in his first major tournament and right-footed Kieran Trippier as a stand-in left back, managed to secure the win.Kane acknowledged the performance was not a classic by England. ""Overall a deserved win. It's just about getting through,"" said the England captain.""There was a spell in the second half where we got camped in our box and we found it hard to get out but it was an important win tonight.""England next play Denmark on Thursday after Serbia take on Slovenia.","Jude Bellingham's first-half header gave England a 1-0 victory over Serbia.

The decision, driven by concerns over potential injury risks, highlights the demanding physical challenges faced by professional athletes navigating a packed tournament calendar across diverse playing surfaces.Jabeur's withdrawal centres on the Olympic tournament's utilization of clay courts, the same surface used for the French Open .Having concluded her clay court season earlier this month with a quarter-final appearance at the French Open, the world no. 10 is currently transitioning to grass court competitions, followed by the hard courts of the US Open shortly after the Olympics This rapid succession of surface transitions poses a significant challenge for athletes. Adapting to the unique characteristics of each surface – clay's slow bounce and high friction, grass's low bounce and speed, and hard court's medium bounce and pace – requires significant physical adjustments. These adjustments impact movement patterns, footwork, and the strain placed on various muscle groups, particularly the knees.Jabeur, in consultation with her medical team, determined that subjecting her body to such a rapid transition, particularly after an already demanding clay court season, would significantly increase the risk of injury to her knee.""After consulting with my medical team regarding attending the Olympics in Paris we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardise the rest of my season,"" Jabeur wrote on social media.""I have always loved representing my country in any competition. However, I must listen to my body,"" she added.While representing Tunisia in the Olympics holds immense personal significance for Jabeur, as evidenced by her participation in three previous Games, prioritizing her physical well-being is paramount to ensure continued success throughout the season and beyond.
