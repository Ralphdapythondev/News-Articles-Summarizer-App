KL Rahul's Test cricket returns continue to confound,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/kl-rahuls-test-cricket-returns-continue-to-confound/articleshow/113649585.cms,"Versatility has been KL Rahul's calling card to stay relevant.

The talented & versatile batter has some sublime hundreds to his name but has not been as prolific as would have been expected, in spite of being backed by successive captain-coach combinations. If he regains his confidence,

could be an asset Down Under...

Who is the only Indian opener to score Test hundreds in England, South Africa, and Australia? KL Rahul Who is the only visiting batter to score two Test hundreds at Supersport Park, Centurion, often considered a graveyard for non-South African batters? KL Rahul.Who is the only Indian batter to score seven successive Test 50s? KL Rahul.Who is the only Indian batter who prompted MS Dhoni - a man not known to be philanthropic while praising younger players - to say before an ODI in Ranchi, ""I think India have found an all-format opener""? KL Rahul.And yet, when we see the career stats of a man who is one among only 22 specialist batters to have played 50 or more Tests for India, it feels like Rahul's potential has had a rocky marriage with performance. A sub35 average for someone who has played 51 Tests makes Rahul fans - and there are many - grumble in disbelief.""Confused approach"", ""over-thinking"", ""scoreboard inertia"", ""batting-order changes"", ""looked at only as injury back-up"", ""ruthless and incessant trolling"" - these have been just some phrases used to justify the modest figures. Looking for words resembling ""lack of opportunity"" and ""misfortune""? Keep looking.On the contrary, Rahul has caught quite a few lucky breaks. Like the one in England in 2021, when he found himself opening the innings after Shubman Gill and Mayank Agarwal, both designated partners for Rohit at the top of the order, picked up injuries. Rahul was slotted in as opener. A gritty match-winning hundred followed at Lord's.The solid 76 in Nottingham in the previous Test was a promising appetizer.Fortune smiled on him in the Asia Cup 2023 too in Sri Lanka, when just before the toss against Pakistan, Shreyas Iyer picked up a back injury and Rahul got in as a 'keeper batter and smashed a brilliant hundred. He enjoyed a productive ODI World Cup in that role, keeping Ishan Kishan out.Being articulate and having led astutely in franchise cricket, Rahul was looked at as a worthy deputy to both Kohli and Rohit. Their injury-led absences saw him become India's 34th Test captain in Johannesburg in Jan 2022 and later in the year in Bangladesh for two Tests.However, while the 'C' next to his name elevated his profile, Rahul's form nosedived. He averaged only 17.12 in four Tests in 2022. He lost his place in the T20 side after a below par T20 World Cup Down Under, in which it seemed he started to bat conservatively.Yet, he has repeatedly found backing both in the Kohli-Shastri regime and the Dravid-Rohit regime. He found support from Rohit again in Chennai, where he was preferred over Sarfaraz Khan , who had impressed in the three outings against England earlier in the year and whose game against spin is flawless.""The kind of message that has been given to him from our side was very simple: we wanted him to play all games. We want him to bring the best out of him. And it is our duty as well to bring the best out of him,"" Rohit stressed.As captain, Rohit has earned the reputation of giving players the freedom, comfort and security. The vote of confidence for Rahul illustrated that. Rohit also acknowledged Rahul's ton in the Centurion Test in difficult conditions batting at No. 6, and also the 86 batting at No. 4 in Hyderabad against England before getting injured.""He's got the game to play spin and seam. I don't see any reason why he can't flourish in Test cricket. Obviously, the opportunities are there now. It's for him to understand how he wants to take his career forward,"" Rohit stated.The team think-tank knows that a confident Rahul in Australia will be an asset as a backup 'keeper to Rishabh Pant , allowing the selectors to pick another bowler or batter in the travelling squad. He was safe as a church with the 'keeping gloves on the pace-friendly surfaces in South Africa.Versatility has been Rahul's calling card to stay relevant. An opener, he effortlessly embraced the role of keeper and middle-order enforcer-cum innings builder in ODIs and played notable knocks like the 97 not out vs Australia in Chennai in the ODI World Cup opener to rescue India from 2-3, chasing 200.But his knock of 66 off 107 balls in the final against the same opponents in Ahmedabad gave enough ammunition to the troll army to attack him again.Having the comfort of Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin to bat behind him - and being sandwiched between them and the flamboyant Rishabh Pant at No. 5 - could give Rahul enough confidence to make a name for himself at No. 6.For inspiration, he can look at how VVS Laxman prospered at that number. Another option: Watch his own knock on Boxing Day in 2023 in Centurion.","KL Rahul is one of only 22 specialist batters to have played 50 or more Tests for India.

The Indian team started assembling in Kanpur on Tuesday for the second Test against Bangladesh, after taking an unassailable 1-0 lead in the two-match series with a dominating win in Chennai.In a video floating on social media, Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant could be seen being welcomed at the team hotel, which involved an 'oops' moment for the staff while welcoming the former.Like it is usually seen, a group of people, presumably the top officials of the hotel, had assembled to welcome the players. Just when one of them presented a bouquet of flowers to Kohli and the batting legend accepted it with a 'thank you', another official wanted to shake hands with the batting icon.But with a bag in one hand and the bouquet in the other, Kohli said: 'Sir, do hi haath hain (I have two hands only),"" and walked past them.Before arriving in Kanpur, India had defeated Bangladesh by a mammoth 280 runs in the first Test at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai inside four days, with local man and veteran allrounder Ravichandran Ashwin starring with a century in the first innings and a six-wicket spell on the final day of the match.Ashwin was named the 'Player of the Match' for his all-round show.Among the other star performers were Pant and Shubman Gill, as both hit centuries to swell India's lead past the 500-run mark. Ravindra Jadeja scored 86 in his partnership with Ashwin and took five wickets in the match.India's bowling spearhead, paceman Jasprit Bumrah, also took five wickets in the match, which included a four-wicket spell in Bangladesh's first innings.Kohli, however, had a poor outing with scores of 6 and 17 in his two innings.","The Indian team started assembling in Kanpur on Tuesday for the second Test against Bangladesh.

Pakistan's next assignment is the Test series at home against England, but as per claims made by country's former batsman Basit Ali , the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is working overtime to ensure the team does well in ICC Champions Trophy that the country is set to host in February-March next year.Talking about a meeting before the one that was held to pick the squad for the first Test against England, Basit made serious claims, alleging that white-ball coach and former South Africa batsman Gary Kirsten is now part of the politics in Pakistan cricket.""Pehle dosti yaari group ka jo head tha ab woh change ho gaya hai.

3rd ODI: England end Australia's winning streak with Harry Brook show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/3rd-odi-england-end-australias-winning-streak-with-harry-brook-show/articleshow/113648414.cms,"Harry Brook (Reuters Photo)

In a thrilling encounter at Chester-le-Street on Tuesday, England' captain Harry Brook led his team to a 46-run victory against the world champions Australia, keeping their hopes alive in the five-match ODI series.Despite a shaky start, losing openers Phil Salt and Ben Duckett to Mitchell Starc's bowling, England fought back through a remarkable 156-run partnership between Will Jacks (84) and Brook (110 not out) in a rain-hit chase after Australia put up an impressive 304 for 7 on the board.Rain interrupted play with England at 254 for 4 off 37.4 overs, but they were comfortably ahead of the required target under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method, securing the victory and ending Australia's 14-match winning streak in ODIs.Earlier in the day, Alex Carey's unbeaten 77 and Steven Smith's 60 led the visitors' batting card. England paceman Jofra Archer claimed 2 for 67. Despite losing wickets at crucial moments, Australia's middle-order partnerships, particularly between Carey and Glenn Maxwell (30), and later with Aaron Hardie (44), helped them reach a challenging total.England's bowlers made early inroads, but Smith's half-century and Carey's aggressive batting kept Australia in the game.Cameron Green, who replaced the injured Travis Head, was dismissed for 42. In the following over, Australia's score of 131 for 3 quickly became 132 for 4 when Labuschagne fell for a duck, mistiming a paddle-sweep off spinner Jacks that was easily caught by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.Smith reached his half-century by pulling a short ball from Jacks for his fifth boundary, having faced 71 deliveries. However, he was dismissed when Brydon Carse made a spectacular diving catch on the boundary off a forceful pull shot from Archer.Carey, on the other hand, struck Carse through midwicket for one of his four boundaries in a 48-ball fifty that also included a straight six off Jacob Bethell.The series, now standing at 2-1 in Australia's favour, will continue at Lord's on Friday, with both teams eager to secure a victory in the remaining two matches.Initially in the home team's run-chase, their supporters might have been concerned when Salt clipped Starc's delivery straight to midwicket, and Duckett, attempting to play across the line, edged the left-arm fast bowler to backward point.However, Jacks and Brook managed to turn the game around against an Australian bowling attack that was missing their key leg-spinner, Adam Zampa, due to illness.Jacks, made a fourth fifty in 10 ODIs but missed out on a maiden century when he uppercut a bouncer from Cameron Green to backward point to end an 82-ball innings featuring nine fours and a six.Jamie Smith's hook shot off a Green found the deep square leg fielder, leaving England at 197 for 4 in the 32nd over.An edgy four to fine third-man brought up Brooks' maiden ODI century in his 18th match, scored off 87 deliveries with 12 fours and two sixes. His second fifty came off just 33 balls.","England beat Australia by 46 runs in their fifth ODI at Chester-le-Street. Alex Carey's unbeaten 77 and Steven Smith's 60 led the visitors' batting card.

Will Kuldeep get a go?

CHENNAI: They are 17 going on 18, and the sound of music in the India camp is getting sweeter by the day.Barring Virat Kohli , R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja , none of the Indian players in the current set-up know what it is to lose a Test series at home.India have won 17 consecutive series since the loss to England in 2012, a phenomenal record.Even the opposition teams know they are virtually fighting a losing battle.In every conversation that the Bangladeshi players or support-staff had with the media over the last few days, the refrain was: ""Yes, we won in Pakistan, but Team India is a different kettle of fish.""Rohit wants to seal the World Test Championship Final berth before they leave for Australia and the first hurdle has been cleared with a resounding 280-run win against Bangladesh at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday.Not just the margin of victory, it's the aura of this team playing at home that is quite incredible. It seems as if they want to increase the degree of difficulty themselves so that the team can be tested before the Australia series.In Chennai, they chose not to play on their favoured black-soil pitch despite having the best spin troika in the world. A red-soil pitch with decent bounce seemed good preparation for Australia and after being reduced to 144/6, the batting prowess of the two bowling allrounders Ashwin and Jadeja once again underlined India's depth.Virtually every box was ticked in Chennai barring two back-to-back low scores by the two superstars of Indian batting - Virat Kohli and Rohit. But all the others got runs and the five bowlers did what was expected of them.""It was a great result, looking at what lies ahead. We were playing after a while but were in touch with the game. It was important that we work as a group and that's what happened here as we got the win,"" Rohit said.There's hardly a grey area to worry about and it will be interesting to see what India's gameplan is for the Kanpur Test starting on Friday. There's a theory that Jasprit Bumrah shouldn't be overworked before Australia, but he has bowled only 21 overs in the first Test and there's no reason to rest him in Kanpur.If it is a black-soil pitch at the Green Park, there is a possibility that left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav will get a go. He was in magnificent form in the last Test series against England at home and can be a genuine wicket-taking option in Australia. If there's a chance of the ball turning a bit, the spinner should an ideal candidate in place of Akash Deep.Not that there's any reason to drop the Bengal pacer. He got two important wickets in the first innings and looked good with the new ball but the Indian team management should look to keep Kuldeep's morale high.","India have won 17 consecutive series since the loss to England in 2012.

Kohli, turning 36 in November, and Rohit, who turned 37 in April, have retired from T20Is after their successful T20 World Cup campaign but remain active in other formats.Kapil shared his views on MyKhel, saying, ""In my opinion, the period between 26 and 34 years is your prime and thereafter the fitness of the players will ensure their longevity.""Kapil himself retired at 35 after an illustrious career, playing 131 Tests and 225 ODIs. He bagged 434 and 253 wickets in each format, respectively. He also had notable batting stats with 5248 runs in Tests and 3783 in ODIs.However, Kapil emphasized that retirement is a personal choice. He feels that as long as players maintain their fitness and enjoy the game, they should continue.He noted, "" Ravi Shastri retired at a very early age while Sachin Tendulkar had a longer stint. So it is completely up to the individual to decide their ways of life. My way of thinking is to stay fit and keep playing as long as you are enjoying the game.""Kapil's perspective sheds light on the career trajectories of modern players. He offers a guideline, yet acknowledges personal decisions.As Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli navigate their post-prime years, Kapil Dev's philosophy provides them, and fans, a framework for understanding their future career decisions.","Kapil Dev believes a cricketer's prime years are between ages 26 and 34.

NEW DELHI: The Maharashtra cabinet has given the green light for the transfer of a 2,000 square meter plot of land in Mumbai's affluent Bandra area to cricketer Ajinkya Rahane Rahane will lease the land to develop a top-notch sports complex.Originally, the plot was allocated to cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar in 1988 for an indoor training academy.Despite the plan, Gavaskar could not utilize the plot for over 30 years.As per an official statement, the Revenue Department's proposal to lease the land to Ajinkya Madhukar Rahane for 30 years was approved by the Maharashtra cabinet.A Cabinet note highlighted that Gavaskar's earlier allotment was meant for an indoor cricket academy. However, due to a lack of activity, the government reclaimed the land.The land is reportedly in poor condition, as it has been used by slum dwellers for various unauthorized activities.MHADA (Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority) passed a resolution to lease the plot to Rahane. The resolution received the council of ministers' approval.Former state Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad in 2021 brought attention to the plot's non-utilization by Gavaskar.""I had almost decided to cancel the allotment of the 2,000 sq metre plot located in Bandra. Despite its huge size and prime location, the proposed cricket academy has not yet been established. I did not cancel the allotment because of Gavaskar's stature and his great contribution to the game,"" Awhad had stated earlier.Awhad emphasized that the plot was given to Gavaskar specifically for a cricket academy. He should have utilized it for the intended purpose.In May 2022, the Sunil Gavaskar Cricket Foundation Trust returned the plot to the state government after Gavaskar decided he could no longer use it.","The Maharashtra cabinet has given the green light for the transfer of a 2,000 square meter plot of land in Mumbai's affluent Bandra area to cricketer Ajinkya Rahane Rahane will lease the land to develop a top-notch sports complex.Originally, the plot was allocated to cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar in 1988 for an indoor training academy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113604613,imgsize-25340,width-400,resizemode-4/113604613.jpg"

Star off-spinner

gives insights into working style of India's coaches

NEW DELHI: It was in 2015 that Indian cricket last saw a foreigner as the head coach of the men's team. Zimbabwean Duncan Fletcher was at the helm of affairs till the 2015 ODI World Cup before his contract wasn't renewed. Since then, the Indian team has got four full-time head coaches - Ravi Shastri Rahul Dravid and now Gautam Gambhir Sanjay Bangar and VVS Laxman chipped in on an interim basis when required.Dravid was in charge from Nov 2021 till the recent T20 World Cup triumph. Gambhir has taken over since then. Star off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has been a member of the team since the Duncan Fletcher days and has seen the functioning style of all four Indian coaches from close quarters.Speaking about the current head coach and his predecessor, Ashwin gave Gambhir the moniker of ""relaxed rancho"", while terming Dravid to have a ""regimented"" style of functioning. Contrary to Gambhir's perceived fiery persona, Ashwin said the former India opener is quite laid-back.""I think he (Gambhir) is very relaxed. I want to call him 'relaxed rancho'. There's no pressure at all. In the morning, there will be a team huddle. He is very relaxed about that as well. He will be like, 'Are you coming, please come'; it's like that with him,"" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.Highlighting the difference between Gambhir and Dravid's coaching styles, Ashwin said, ""With Rahul bhai, as soon as we come, he demanded everything to be in order. Even a bottle should be kept at a particular place at a particular time. He is very regimented.""Ashwin said Gambhir, in comparison, is quite the opposite. ""With Gambhir, he doesn't expect all that. He has a relaxed order and will be a people's man. He will capture everybody's heart, and I think he will be loved by the boys,"" the off-spinner said.When Shastri was India's head coach, his working style was more like a ""big brother"". Ashwin had earlier highlighted how Shastri arranged for a karaoke night and sang Hindi songs to lift the mood in the camp when the team was bowled out for 36 in Adelaide.""We were not even thinking about a series win because we were just bowled out for 36. The mood in the dressing room was down. Ravi bhai, like a big brother, organised a team dinner. He arranged for a karaoke night; he himself started singing. He sang old Hindi songs. Everybody joined in,"" Ashwin said. ""We didn't think of the series, we kept small targets, and we took each match individually after that.""In the past, Ashwin has spoken highly about Kumble. ""There is a saying that whenever you come too close to a celebrity, you get disappointed, but not with respect to Anil bhai,"" Ashwin had said.","Ravichandran Ashwin gives insights into working style of India's coaches.

The match, which concluded on day four, drew only 9,000 spectators, filling just one-third of the stadium's capacity.The series against India is the second biggest attraction after the Ashes involving Australia.After the Sri Lanka Test, England's stand-in captain Ollie Pope expressed surprise at the low attendance.""It was just like 'jeez, it seems quiet today',"" Pope had said.""I'm not sure if people expected the game to be done by day four or not.

NEW DELHI: Veteran Australian spinner Nathan Lyon believes there is very little margin for error when bowling to Rishabh Pant Lyon noted that Pant possesses an extraordinary amount of talent capable of challenging the best bowlers in the world.Pant will be a crucial component of the Indian batting line-up during the upcoming five-Test Border-Gavaskar series starting in Perth on November 22.The 26-year-old Pant recently returned to Test cricket after a hiatus of nearly 21 months, following a near-fatal car crash in December 2022. He marked his return with a century against Bangladesh in the first Test in Chennai.""You're bowling against someone like Rishabh Pant, who is electric. He's got all the skills in the world,"" Lyon, who has snared 530 Test scalps and will be expected to play a key role in the series against India, told Star Sports.""As a bowler, your room for error is so small. So, you've got to be good. It's a challenge as a bowler if I'm going to get hit for six,"" added the 36-year-old Lyon.Pant has been outstanding in the last two Test series against Australia, accumulating 624 runs in 12 innings at an average of 62.40. This includes a century and two half-centuries, with a top score of 159 not out.The wicketkeeper-batter scored an unbeaten 89 in the second innings of the Brisbane Test in 2021, leading India to a historic victory. This marked Australia's first Test loss at the venue in 32 years, resulting in India sealing the series 2-1 and retaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Lyon mentioned that his strategy would involve pushing Pant on the back foot to provoke mistakes.""I'm not afraid of getting hit for a six. The challenge is that I can provide the batters and try and keep someone like Rishabh in his crease and potentially try and get him to defend me a lot more... and, hopefully, bring a couple of chances along the way.""","Nathan Lyon believes there is very little margin for error when bowling to Rishabh Pant.

NEW DELHI: The New Zealand cricket team faces a formidable challenge on their upcoming Test tour of India.Former Black Caps opener Martin Guptill believes that the most difficult part for the Kiwi batters will be handling the turning ball, especially the occasional delivery that skids through.India and New Zealand, finalists of the inaugural World Test Championship (2019-21 cycle), are set to compete in three Tests in Bengaluru, Pune, and Mumbai starting on October 16.""You feel like you can never score sometimes, that's the hardest thing about coming here to India. The ball's turning square, then the same sort of ball comes through and it skids on straight.""You never know which one's going to turn and which one's going to go straight, so you have to always be thinking, you have to always be mentally on song and on (the top of) your game,"" Guptill told PTI in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of Legends League Cricket.Guptill emphasized the need to leverage any advantage against India, who have an impressive streak of winning their last 17 series at home.""To try and get on top of India is extremely difficult. But when you feel like you are, you have to try and take that as long as possible in the game,"" he said.""It's a tough place to play. It's hot, sweaty and you feel like everything's against you. But as I said, if you can get try and get on top of them and you feel like you are getting on top of them, you've got to try and go as deep as possible in the game,"" added the former opener.On the subject of India's threats, Guptill finds it challenging to decide between Ravichandran Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah as the Kiwis’ biggest threat.""Both of them. I mean, you can't take away (the fact) that (Ravindra) Jadeja scored 86, 89 or something, wasn't it?""(They had a) 199 run partnership, you think you've got India against the ropes and then you've got these two come out and bat.""Jadeja and Ashwin had a crucial 199-run stand in the opening Test against Bangladesh in Chennai, rescuing India from a precarious position of 144 for six on the first day, effectively taking the game away from Bangladesh.""While Jadeja is probably the better batter, I mean, Ashwin goes about his work in a completely different way and is very effective in the way he scores his runs,"" he said.""So you never feel like you're on top of India because they've got such depth, and then, obviously, you've got them as a partnership of the ball as well,"" he said.Guptill praised young Kiwi pacer Will O Rourke for his extra pace, which troubled Sri Lankan batsmen, taking eight wickets in the Galle Test. He believes the extra pace was something missing from their current seam attack.""I first faced him maybe three years ago and I was really, really impressed in how he bowled. For him to have developed further in the last couple of years and get his chance in Test cricket, man, he's had a really good start,"" he said.""He's got a little bit of extra pace behind him, which some of our bowlers don't have and he's got a bit of height, which gives him that little bit of extra bounce, which on our wickets at home helps a lot more than maybe what it does here in the subcontinent,"" Guptill added.Acknowledging the inevitable changes in New Zealand's Test side, Guptill said it remains to be seen if the younger generation can fill the void left by experienced players like Kane Williamson.""Only time will tell. I can't comment on that at the moment. I mean, you don't know until these new guys come through and start playing whether they're up to it or not,"" he said.""Once Kane and the likes have finished playing and when these new guys come in, it's going to take time for them I guess,"" he said.",Martin Guptill says New Zealand must be on top of their game against India.

The team also reached the WODI World Cup final in 2017.Harmanpreet was part of both teams and led the squad in the 2020 T20 World Cup.""This is the best team we are going forward with.

We first had a fitness and fielding camp. Then we had a 10-day skills-only camp. We brought in a sports psychologist also (Mughda Bawre). She has been fantastic with the group.""""We focused on enhancing athletic ability, all-round fielding abilities, there were yoga sessions and psychological sessions were added,"" he continued.Regarding the lack of recent game time, Muzumdar remains positive. ""We are prepared for everything. In the skills camp, we had nets and five games in 10 days' time.

Mumbai give maiden call-ups to four players, including 17-year-old Ayush

MUMBAI: Ishan Kishan ’s resurgence in red-ball cricket is gathering steam. On Monday, the national selectors picked the wicketkeeper-batsman, who hasn’t played for India since returning from India’s tour of South Africa in December last year, in the Rest of India squad for the Irani Cup clash against Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow from October 1–5.In February this year, Kishan had lost his BCCI contract due to failure to turn up for Ranji Trophy matches for Jharkhand. However, the left-hander cracked a hundred for Jharkhand in the Buchi Babu Tournament and two weeks ago, followed that up with a counter-attacking century in his comeback first-class match in the Duleep Trophy. It helped him pip Sanju Samson, who too scored a ton in the Duleep Trophy.Apart from Kishan, the other wicketkeeper in the ROI squad is Dhruv Jurel, who has been picked subject to India not picking him for the second Test in Kanpur from September 27 to October 1. Another man continuing his red ball resurgence is Karnataka pacer Prasidh Krishna, who impressed in the Duleep Trophy while bowling for India A, helping them win the title with his three wickets.One man who can consider himself unlucky to have been ignored from the ROI squad is Haryana leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who picked 18 wickets for Northamptonshire in the English County Championship recently, with the selectors preferring to pick leggie Rahul Chahar instead.Meanwhile, showing yet again that it has begun prioritizing participation in domestic cricket now, the BCCI on Monday announced that it will release batsman Sarfaraz Khan, Jurel and left-arm pacer Yash Dayal from the squad for the Kanpur Test, subject to them not being selected in the XI, to enable the trio to play in the Irani Cup tie, which will be played in nearby Lucknow around almost the same time.""Dhruv Jurel and Yash Dayal have been selected in the Rest of India squad and their participation is subject to them not being involved in the second Test match against Bangladesh in Kanpur. The 2nd Test will begin from 27th September. Sarfaraz Khan, who has been retained in the Team India squad for the 2nd Test, will be released to represent the Mumbai team subject to him not being involved in the second Test match against Bangladesh in Kanpur,"" BCCI secretary Jay Shah stated in a release, while announcing a 15-man ROI squad, led by Maharashtra’s India opener Ruturaj Gaikwad for the important domestic fixture.TOI had reported on September 24 that the BCCI will release Sarfaraz from the national squad for the Kanpur Test, in order to enable the batsman to turn out for the upcoming Irani Cup tie.Additionally, led by former India Test captain Ajinkya Rahane, Mumbai are also likely to enjoy the services of India allrounder Shivam Dube, if he isn't picked for India's home T20I series against Bangladesh, which starts on October 6. ""Sarfaraz Khan and Shivam Dube will join the team if released from India duties,"" the Mumbai Cricket Association informed in a release. As expected, a fit-again Shardul Thakur and Shreyas Iyer are available for Mumbai. Middle-order batsman Siddhesh Lad, who had left Mumbai to play for Goa, has been recalled.Meanwhile, in a bid to provide them with big-match exposure, Mumbai's selectors, led by Sanjay Patil on Monday gave maiden call-ups to 17-year-old batsman Ayush Mhatre, off-spinner Himanshu Singh, who was recently called up to bowl in the Team India nets before the Chennai Test against Bangladesh, pacer Mohd Juned Khan and wicketkeeper-batsman Sidhaant Addhatrao while naming a 16-member squad for the Irani Cup tie.Ayush, a talented teenaged batsman, who hails from Virar, had put in an impressive performance for Mumbai as an opener in the recently-held Dr (Capt) K Thimmappiah Memorial Tournament, where he scored 271 runs in three matches@67.75, including one century (173 against Gujarat) and one fifty. Like Ayush, Juned Khan too played for Mumbai's second-strong team in Bangalore.""Both Ayush and Juned come from extremely humble backgrounds. Juned has been a net bowler for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the recent past. He has done well for PJ Hindu Gymkhana in local cricket. He isn't an exceptional bowler, but bowls a decent line and length. Juned's selection was also hastened due to the unavailability of pacer Tushar Deshpande due to an ankle injury, for which he will undergo a surgery at the end of this month,"" a source told TOI.Mumbai squad: Ajinkya Rahane (Captain), Prithvi Shaw, Ayush Mhatre, Musheer Khan, Shreyas Iyer, Siddhessh Lad, Suryansh Shedge, Hardik Tamore (WK), Sidhaant Addhatrao (WK), Shams Mulani, Tanush Kotian, Himanshu Singh, Shardul Thakur, Mohit Avasthi, Mohd.

The Haryana Police DSP who played a pivotal role in guiding India to their historic 2007 ICC T20 World Cup triumph is Joginder Sharma His name got etched in Indian cricket folklore when he bowled the final over in the nerve-wracking final against Pakistan , sealing India’s victory.However, many may not know that Joginder was soon appointed as Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) with the Haryana Police, for his meritorious achievements in the field of sports.Joginder’s moment of glory came in the high-pressure final at Johannesburg when captain MS Dhoni threw him the ball to bowl the final over with Pakistan needing 13 runs to win with one-wicket in hand.Despite his relative inexperience at the international level, Joginder showed immense composure and bravery in that moment.After conceding a six to Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq , Joginder delivered the ball that led to Misbah’s famous attempted scoop shot, which was caught by Sreesanth at short fine leg.India clinched the inaugural T20 World Cup, and Joginder became an overnight hero.Before the iconic moment, Joginder had a brief ODI stint but a steady domestic career, representing Haryana in first-class cricket. His all-round abilities with both bat and ball made him a useful addition in the Indian squad for the T20 World Cup.However, it was his mental strength that helped him rise to the occasion during the high-pressure moments of the tournament.Post his cricketing career, Joginder joined the Haryana Police and was appointed to the rank of DSP. His contribution to Indian cricket, particularly the unforgettable final over, remains a proud chapter in India’s sporting history.Incidentally, India won the inaugural T20 World Cup title 17 years ago on this day in 2007.","Joginder Sharma bowled the final over in the nerve-wracking final against Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Subrata Paul , considered one of India's best goalkeepers, earned 67 caps for the national football team winning the SAFF Championship once and Nehru Cup twice. His illustrious career spanned over 16 years.His performances under the bar against Australia and Korea Republic during the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar earned him the nickname ‘Spiderman’.He also won the prestigious Arjuna Award in 2016 and hung up his boots last year at the age of 36.As a human being, I believe in giving back to society and making a positive impact. Beyond my professional pursuits, I find solace in reaching out, and some of my efforts include empowering kids of sex workers in Kolkata through football coaching, tournaments, and equipment distribution at my academy, impacting over 200 fatherless kids. We are coaching over 500 underprivileged children (girls and boys) and counting at my football academy . I am leading my NGO, SP One, aiming at the empowerment of women and the protection of animal rights—contributing and helping shelters. We are introducing football ethics and philosophy to drug addicts and patients in an effort to keep them away from vices. We have formed ‘ Players for Humanity ,’ an organization comprising 45+ retired professional players, including former national team captains and Arjuna Award winners, contributing and raising funds through football programs and exhibition matches to be in sync with social causes. I am promoting the ‘Make in India’ brand—exporting my own brand of tyres to Africa, contributing to India’s revenue. I provide recruitment to many families through my small-scale industry, helping them earn a living, among other efforts.It’s my baby. (smiles). It’s the platform for my academy players – both boys and girls to go and play at the highest level. I understand that unless they get game time, the transition process will hit them hard. And it gives me immense pride when all these kids go on to sign for the big clubs, allowing them to make a future for themselves. I want to take AIPL FC to the I-League. It’s one step at a time.As a player, that was a motivation for me to realise that I am doing the job right. If post-match, Mark Schwarzer, a hero of two World Cups, and a regular for Chelsea, Fulham, Leicester City, Middlesbrough comes and knocks the Indian Dressing room asking to exchange his goalkeeping jersey with me – I will always be left speechless. The tag stayed with me all throughout, and wherever I have travelled since then – all over Asia and even in Europe – people still refer to me as the ‘Spiderman’. I do have plenty of individual accolades but playing a team sport as football, I will never put any individual above the team. That I was the Number 1 in a country of 1.5 billion will always be my proudest moment. After all, there are 10 players on the field, but only one goalkeeper.It’s not just an individual’s retirement. It’s a team sport, and we need to understand that – the sooner the better. The potential is huge, but that’s a kind of cliché. It’s time to deliver – right from players to the staff and all stakeholders. We need to take the onus, otherwise, we will remain stagnant. I wait for a chance with a timeframe of 10 years, without any intervention from any – and I am confident of taking the team to knock at the doors of the World Cup – both men and women. I know that’s possible.The societal approach needs to change. Every 4 years we wake up and mention that we haven’t done well. Athletes will try their best and there has been a huge improvement in the Indian sports paradigm in the last 10 years. But have we wakened up as a society yet? Are we ready to push our kids into sport? Are we game to our kids playing sport? Till the time, we aren’t, let’s not complain.I have been fortunate to travel the world and have always been in awe of the sporting infrastructure abroad, which has long been lacking in India. However, on my first visit to Woxsen University, I was completely amazed. What struck me the most was the thoughtful planning behind the investment—an effort to bridge the gap between sports and academics. I urge all stakeholders— the Government, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS), the corporate world, and club and franchise owners—to take note of these facilities and use them to nurture champions for India across all fields.Follow your passion. Believe in yourself. Be patient. You cannot achieve it in one day. But you certainly will.","Subrata Paul won 67 caps for India and won the SAFF Championship once and Nehru Cup twice.

You can play against 11 players but not against the elements: NEUFC coach Benali,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/you-can-play-against-11-players-but-not-against-the-elements-neufc-coach-benali/articleshow/113641748.cms,"NorthEast United FC head coach Juan Pedro Benali (Photo credit: ISL)

KOLKATA: “Sometimes, football is unfair,” were the very first words of NorthEast United FC head coach Juan Pedro Benali as he began addressing the media after their 3-2 loss to Mohun Bagan Super Giants in Kolkata on Monday.While there was no dearth of appreciation from the NorthEast United fans at the Salt Lake Stadium, or those following it from elsewhere, for the show put up by their players despite the defeat to their glorified opponents, it was the second goal by Mohun Bagan captain Subhasish Bose that dominated the chatter on social media.With the score reading 2-1 in the visitors’ favour, it was a fumble from NEUFC custodian Gurmeet Singh in collecting a header by Tom Aldred in the 61st minute that helped Bose in putting the ball into the net and giving the hosts the crucial equaliser.Replays showed the Bagan skipper’s shoes stamping on Gurmeet’s left arm to get the ball in even as the goalkeeper was still holding the ball, albeit unconvincingly, leading some critics and NEUFC coach to feel that the goal needed to be disallowed.“You only need to see the arm of the goalkeeper, Gurmeet, in blood. That’s enough!” Benali said at the press conference on Monday. “You can play against 11 players but not against the elements. And sometimes it’s the small details that are the game changers.”While Bose’s equaliser dominated most of the interaction, Benali was also quick to acknowledge his team’s efforts on the field that made the Shield winners work hard for their first win of the season.“But I am really happy and proud of my players because they showed that we are growing. We made silly mistakes, but we are growing. We went head-to-head against Mohun Bagan in this stadium and with a crowd like this,” said the Spaniard.Last season’s top scorer for the Highlanders, Mohammed Ali Bemammer and star of their Durand Cup final against the same opponents, Alaeddine Ajaraie, were both on the scoresheet on Monday as the likes of Jithin MS kept the expensive Bagan defence on their toes. And the Michel Zabaco-led NEUFC will be eager to get the full points and their second win of season when they play their season’s first home game against Kerala Blasters next week.For now, Benali, who believes ‘the fair result would be a 2-2 draw’, is ready to move on in quest for a memorable season.“Today, we feel our scratches from the previous game and tomorrow we’ll start thinking about Kerala,” said Benali while signing off by reiterating, “Football is unfair and today (Monday) it was unfair on the NorthEast.”",NorthEast United FC lost 3-2 to Mohun Bagan Super Giants in Kolkata on Monday.

Scent of revenge as Mohun Bagan down NorthEast United in 5-goal thriller,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/scent-of-revenge-as-mohun-bagan-down-northeast-united-in-5-goal-thriller/articleshow/113618217.cms,"KOLKATA: From Mohun Bagan SG 's perspective, it might be a revenge served in the rain.A little over three weeks after losing the Durand Cup final to NorthEast United FC , Mohun Bagan SG got even with the Highlanders 3-2 in their Indian Super League clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday.Juan Pedro Benali 's NorthEast raced to a 2-1 lead inside the opening half an hour when their Moroccan recruits Alaaeddine Ajaraie (5) and Mohammed Bemammer (24) rattled the Bagan defence.Although Jose Molina 's hosts found in young defender Dipendu Biswas an unlikely scorer to bring things on level terms briefly in the 10th minute, NEUFC were the better side, giving some hard evidence that their triumph over the green-and-maroon brigade in the Durand Cup final last month was not a fluke.But when the second half started amid heavy downpour, Bagan changed the complexion of the game in a spectacular manner, pouring cold water on the visitors' aspirations. Full-back Subhasish Bose swooped on an opportunity to make it 2-2 in the 61st minute and Jason Cummings, who replaced Manvir Singh on the hour mark, completed the turnaround, delivering the killer punch with a sumptuous strike in the 87th minute.The match had all the ingredients of being a classic: Brilliant goals, superb counter-attack and a remarkable fightback. Molina even handed Jamie Maclaren his much-anticipated debut 10 minutes before the winning goal. But as far as Bagan's fightback was concerned, it started with Greg Stewart's corner and ended with NEUFC goalkeeper Gurmeet Singh failing to hold on to a headed pass towards his goal from Bagan defender Tom Alfred and letting the ball slip out of his hands. After Dimitri Petratos missed his chance, Subhasish was on hand to push it in.NEUFC players cried for a foul on their goalkeeper but referee Jamal Mohamed remained unmoved.The game got off to a boisterous start with both teams eager to play with an extra degree of intensity. It was the visitors who fired the early warning shot when Ajaraie hit the post in the second minute following a Jithin cross from the other end.When Ajaraie came calling again three minutes later, the Bagan defence failed to stop the inevitable. Unable to make room for lining up his shot in the face of twin challenge from Asish Rai and Apuia, Ajaraie coolly delivered the ball for his countrymate Bemammer to meet it with a sweetly-timed volley with the outstep of his boot, the ball swerving inwards and settling into the net giving Kaith no chance to react.Bagan reacted immediately. Petratos whipped in a free-kick towards the box and Dipendu rose to the occasion, brilliantly placing his header into the far corner of the box.But NorthEast United regained the lead through a wonderful counter-attacking goal. The moment Bagan lost the ball in the rival box, Jithin injected a whole new meaning in it, launching into a quickfire countermove that scythed through the Bagan defence, which was still retreating to take shape in transition. Playing a diagonal 1-2 with Ajaraie, Jithin sent the ball again across the edge of the box and his Moroccan teammate came up with a brilliant left-footed finish, drilling it in past a diving Kaith.A torrential rain welcomed the players back to the field after the break and this was where NEUFC lost the plot and Bagan turned it in their favour.NEUFC custodian presented an opportunity and Subhasish swooped on it to make it 2-2. Then, a minute after Maclaren failed to cash in on another bloomer by Gurmeet, when he failed to clear a danger properly after coming out of his box, Cummings came to the fore, meeting another substitute Sahal Abdul Samad's lay-off with a powerful strike from inside the box, sending the rain-bathed crowd into rapture.",Mohun Bagan SG beat NorthEast United FC 3-2 in their Indian Super League clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday.

– 3 Red Cards

The UEFA Champions League is celebrated for its exhilarating football and moments of individual brilliance. However, with the pressure and intensity of the competition comes heightened emotions, leading to disciplinary actions. While many players have been cautioned in the heat of battle, a select few have accumulated the most red cards in the tournament’s history.Here's a look at the top five players who were shown red more often than any others in the Champions League:Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid icon, is widely regarded as one of the best defenders of his generation. Known for his leadership and aggression, Ramos often found himself on the wrong side of referees. His four red cards reflect his fearless, sometimes reckless, defending style that made him both a hero and a villain on the pitch.Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a striker with flair and confidence, earned a reputation not only for his stunning goals but also for his fiery temperament. The Swede's confrontational nature on the field saw him receive four red cards in the Champions League, showcasing that his passion sometimes boiled over into clashes with referees and opponents alike.Nicknamed ""The Pitbull,"" Edgar Davids was renowned for his aggressive, combative style of play in midfield. His fearsome tackling and relentless pressing earned him four red cards in the Champions League. While his physicality intimidated opponents, it also led to multiple dismissals, cementing his legacy as a no-nonsense player.Patrick Vieira, one of the finest central midfielders of his era, was celebrated for his imposing physical presence and leadership. However, his passion often led to disciplinary trouble. His three red cards in the Champions League are a testament to his confrontational style and the fine line he walked between controlled aggression and ill-discipline.Arturo Vidal is known for his fierce competitiveness and combative play in midfield. His ""warrior"" mentality has earned him a reputation as one of the most aggressive players in world football. However, his hard tackles and confrontational attitude led to three red cards in the Champions League, making him a regular target for referees.","The UEFA Champions League is celebrated for its exhilarating football and moments of individual brilliance.

The judge, however, has allowed the polls to go ahead.The writ petition has made the central government party to the case, claiming it had not made an effort to ensure the AITA was compliant with the sports code.The next date of hearing is Oct 14.""The court has said that election results are stayed, they will not be published by the Returning Officer,"" Mehra, the counsel for the petitioners, said.""They will be kept in a sealed cover and placed before the court. Elections are subject to the final decision in the matter.""And the court has also observed that in case (they) find that the violations are there, as alleged by the petitioners, then we will have an independent administrator who will run the body, and that person will then sense the entire thing up.""Listing the alleged violations, Mehra said ""the very electoral college is vitiated"".""There are violations of Rahul Mehra judgment of 16th of August, 2022. Number one being, the age and tenure restrictions are only being applied to the top three posts of president, secretary, treasurer, while now they have to be, you know, across the board on all the elected members,"" he said.""There are almost 12 people on whom cooling off period applies. And they are all contesting, they're all in the nomination list approved by the RO.""Number three, none of the states and the district federations (sic) .. in that sense, are compliant with the Code as interpreted by the judgment.""So, since everybody comes from the bottom of the pyramid, the very electoral college is vitiated in that sense.""Then they have a managing committee, which is very unique to tennis, other than executive committee. Executive Committee, otherwise, is the top most body. But out here, it's a managing committee which has handpicked nominations of anybody who may or may not be even concerned with the sport of tennis.""And they are kind of a super body sitting over the executive body, which is unknown to sports administration.""Then, (in) the executive committee, they have 25 members. You can't have more than 12.""Then, it's mandatory to have a minimum 25% eminent sports persons of outstanding merit, both in the General Assembly and the executive committee. They don't have that.""They don't have a mechanism of Athlete Commission's elections, because all these players have to come through elections and not hand picked by the federation bosses, so that they're independent and don't toe the line of these administrators.The draft constitution of the IOA -- framed by Justice L Nageswara Rao under the supervision of the Supreme Court in conjunction with the International Olympic Committee -- mandates the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer in place of an honorary secretary general.Mehra clarified that while the All India Football Federation's constitution allows for a paid secretary, the essential idea of the clause was to differentiate the executive arm and the administration of the sport.He categorically said that the appointment of a CEO has to be done as per due process.""The CEO runs the entire show, not the elected president or the secretary,"" he said. ""There has to be interviews, there has to be advertisement, there has to be a certain income, salary, all of that.""Mehra said he was aware of the recent controversy surrounding the country's No. 1 men's player Sumit Nagal's skipping the Davis Cup tie against Sweden and India's subsequent 0-4 loss in Stockholm.""Our entire thing is that the administration should be out of the hands of these people and there should be an independent administrator. Once the independent administrator comes, then all of these will be looked into.""",Delhi High Court stays publication of AITA's election results.

I'm not going to lie -- I have felt this way a few times already. Sometimes I don't feel motivated at all. But as I've said many, many times, I play my best tennis when I smile and enjoy it on court.

If you win, you will get this much as a bonus, and if the team wins this much extra.""The committee then decided to authorize the captain to discuss it with the player.""Rajpal refused to comment on the matter but another member of the executive committee who attended the meeting confirmed, without revealing details, that Nagal's request was agreed to.An AITA source familiar with the subject said, ""It ($50,000) is roughly Rs. 40-45 lakh for two ties in a year. So essentially, he has asked for Rs. 20 lakh per tie, which I think is fine. A (No. 1) player gets anywhere around Rs. 7 to 12 lakhs at the moment.""As a standalone figure it might seem exorbitant, but to put it in perspective, a player earned $100,000 simply for turning up in the singles first round at the US Open this year. At the French Open, a first-round appearance made a player richer by 73,000-euros.It is also understood that Nagal had requested for a change in support staff attached to the Indian Davis Cup team. It is not clear whether he wanted both Rajpal (as captain by Mahesh Bhupathi) and Zeeshan Ali (as coach by Somdev Devvarman ) to be replaced, or only the latter. Devvarman is Nagal's mentor.The AITA subsequently appointed Ashutosh Singh as coach after Ali resigned.Nagal issued a detailed statement on the subject while also responding to the attack from the AITA that he skipped the Stockholm sojourn despite being fit.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup, as playing for the national team is a moment I cherish deeply. However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team’s chances,"" said Nagal, who on Thursday pulled out of the ATP 250 event in Hangzhou.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""","Sumit Nagal had asked to be paid $50,000 a year for playing Davis Cup.

However, Nagal defended this by stating that it is common practice for athletes to be compensated for their participation.Nagal had opted out of the recent Davis Cup tie against Sweden, citing a back strain. This injury had also forced him to withdraw from the US Open men's doubles competition last month.Without a singles specialist, India lost 0-4 to Sweden on their home turf.The team, primarily composed of doubles players and debutants, failed to win a set in the World Group I tie.On Thursday, AITA expressed its displeasure, claiming top players like Nagal, Yuki Bhambri , and Sasikumar Mukund had refused national duty.Nagal was scheduled to play in the ATP 250 Hangzhou Open but withdrew, again citing his back issue.""You tell me why should a player be asking for money to play for the country. This is a big question. He had demanded an annual fee of $50,000 (approx 45 lakh) and said if he is not paid, he will not play,"" Dhupar told PTI.India plays only two ties per season in the World Group I, typically in February and September.""Let the country decide if it is right or not. Then, it is the decision of the government and everybody. The players are also paid by TOPS. And it's not that they don't get paid for playing the Davis Cup. They do get paid,"" Dhupar insisted.Dhupar was referring to the prize money that AITA receives from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) for Davis Cup participation, which is distributed among team members.For a World Group I tie, AITA receives around Rs 30 lakh, of which 70 per cent is distributed among participating players. The remaining 30 per cent is kept for administrative expenses by the national federation.The prize money decreases for lower group ties.""No other player asked for additional money over and above their share of the ITF prize money.""A former Indian Davis Cupper confirmed that there have been past instances where leading players asked for money to play Davis Cup and those demands were accepted.Nagal did not deny AITA's claim. He defended his stance through a statement on social media.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""AITA was displeased that Nagal skipped Davis Cup by citing injury but seemed to recover in time for the Hangzhou Open. Nagal withdrew from the ATP 250 tournament two days after AITA's statement.Nagal emphasized the honor of representing his country.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup...However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team's chances.""""I believe it is better for the team and for the country to have someone at 100 per cent rather than risking further injury and potentially disrupting the match. I had informed AITA well in advance about my inability to participate.""It was learned that Captain Rohit Rajpal took Nagal's proposal to the AITA Executive Committee. After initial reluctance, the committee agreed to pay him, but requested the captain to renegotiate the figure.However, before an agreement could be reached, Nagal withdrew from the tie and the discussion ended without progress.During the tie, Nagal criticized AITA on social media, stating that many team members were there only to enjoy junkets.He justified his break further.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Nagal reaffirmed his commitment to representing the country.""I look forward to future opportunities to wear the national colours and make my country proud, both on and off the court.""Nagal had also skipped the tie against Pakistan earlier this year, stating that the grass court surface did not suit his style of play as well as hard courts do.Skipper Rajpal faces criticism on social media, with many questioning his suitability as Davis Cup captain.Rajpal was appointed captain in 2019, replacing Mahesh Bhupathi , who hesitated to travel to Pakistan due to security concerns.A team official noted that receiving payment like cricketers is acceptable, but tennis players should also be willing to go through a selection process.""They want contracts, but do they play Nationals? Do they come to the national side through selection trials like shooters and badminton players? Tennis players get paid through Davis Cup prize money and are also funded by the government through TOPS,"" he asserted.","All India Tennis Association ( AITA) claimed Sumit Nagal demanded an annual fee of $50,000 to play Davis Cup ties for India.
