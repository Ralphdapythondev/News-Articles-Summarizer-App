Top Picks For You India vs Bangladesh, 1st Test: Gill, Pant strike centuries before Ashwin grabs three to leave Bangladesh facing heavy defeat

CHENNAI: Stats don't necessarily reveal the entire story, but they do leave an indicator. So, when Rishabh Pant matches MS Dhoni 's six-Test-centuries feat — achieved over 90 Tests — in just 34 games, it's a very special achievement indeed. The Pant story is all the more special because of the cruel turn that life had taken on a wintry morning in 2022.Lucky to be alive after a car accident, not too many gave him a chance to play top-flight cricket again, let alone play Tests.Pant's comeback story is well documented. His return in the last IPL was a tale of determination while his role as a No. 3 batter on the most difficult pitches of the T20 World Cup spoke volumes of his grit. There were still doubts whether his body would be able to take the rigours of five-day cricket, but after Saturday, all those speculations have been put to rest. The comfort with which he batted against the Bangladesh bowlers showed that the cobwebs in the mind have been taken care of. Shubman Gill , who has seen him from close quarters and shared a 167-run partnership on Saturday, said that it was special to see Pant score the comeback ton. ""I've spent a lot of time with him on and off the field and watching him score his first 100 after his comeback gives me so much pleasure. I've seen him work so hard for it when he was coming back from the injury and I think he also must be feeling really good,"" Gill said.A couple of months ago in New York, as India were preparing for a game against Pakistan, the pitch in one of the nets had so much variable bounce that most batters refused to bat there. But Pant asked the throwdown expert to hurl the white ball at him from 18 yards on that pitch. He kept getting hit on the body, but connected a few as well with the bat. While Pant was trying to get used to the short ball, he was also trying to test his pain threshold, and now we can see all the hard work has paid off.While former coach Rahul Dravid was effusive in his praise of Pant, current boss Gautam Gambhir , too, had a lot of good things to say about the dynamite that he possesses in his arsenal. ""He's got runs everywhere around the world, and not many wicket-keepers of that age have done it so consistently in red-ball cricket . It is always good to have someone like him who can open the game for us, and more importantly, can bring a lot of impact as well,"" Gambhir had said before the Test.As we keep discussing about Pant the batter, sometimes we forget how well he has kept on Indian pitches as well. In this Test too, he has looked in top shape and his glovework has been on point. ""Probably his batting overshadows his 'keeping many times. It's not easy to keep against the likes of Ashwin, Jadeja and Kuldeep on Indian conditions and what he has done behind the stumps has been remarkable as well,"" Gambhir said.For Pant, things can only get better from here and we all believe the best is yet to come.",Rishabh Pant matches MS Dhoni's six-Test-centuries feat in just 34 games. Pant story is all the more special because of the cruel turn that life had taken on a wintry morning in 2022.

India Vs Bangladesh: Shubman Gill 'satisfied' with his batting display against spin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/shubman-gill-satisfied-with-his-batting-display-against-spin/articleshow/113563002.cms,"Top Picks For You Rishabh Pant reminds everyone why he is special

CHENNAI: Moments after completing a stroke-filled century against Bangladesh on the third day of the first Test here, the flamboyant Shubman Gill , in his trademark fashion, bowed to the crowd in celebration. While Gill was accorded a standing ovation, even by the players and coaches, he fully deserved an imitation of his celebratory act from the fans, who got their money's worth.The No.3 batter moved his feet like a nimble-footed ballet dancer, especially against spinners Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Shakib Al Hasan , both of whom were treated with disdain.During the course of his unbeaten 119, Gill landed many punches on Miraz, launching the offspinner for four sixes over deep midwicket. His well-compiled knock was a fruit of the work he put in ahead of the twomatch Bangladesh assignment.""Scoring runs against any opposition gives you a lot of confidence. Playing against spin is what I have been working on. It (the innings) gives me a lot of satisfaction,"" said Gill, who scored 80 of his 119 against the visiting slow bowlers.""I trained before this series and had some plans. I think that I executed them well. It is not only about having a good defence; I must also not miss out on the opportunities that I get as a batter to score runs,"" added the 25-year-old. Gill proved to be a constant menace for the opposition attack, regularly dancing down the wicket and using his feet against the spinners.""It is something that I trained at when I was young. I have always been a tall guy, so it is easier for me to use my feet and play along the ground. Playing the ball in the air and hitting sixes came later, when I got more power (strength) in my body. It is hard for bowlers to settle on a pitch like this, where the odd one is turning but not all balls are turning.""Gill was extra keen to make it count after falling for a duck in the first essay: ""It (the duck) further motivated me to spend more time in the middle.""",Shubman Gill scores unbeaten 119 as India beat Bangladesh in first Test. Gill hits four sixes against visiting spinners Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Shakib Al Hasan. Gill scored 80 of his 119 against the visiting slow bowlers.

Former World chess champion Vladimir Kramnik tried to create some flutter in the ninth round of the Chess Olympiad on Friday but the authorities dealt with the issue swiftly and restored normalcy.Uzbekistan captain Kramnik, 49, complained about the presence of mobile phones on the Indian boards which are used to relay video recording for the live webcast.The Russian cited a rule in the FIDE handbook and claimed that it states that no electronic device can be allowed inside the playing hall. He added he was fine with just the video camera but not with the phone using video recording mode since data can be transmitted via bluetooth and other technological advancements. Without claiming that players were cheating by taking help from outside, he said that the bluetooth was on.However, Bojana Bejatovic, secretary of the FIDE Fair Play Commission, clarified that the cell phone fixed for D Gukesh vs Nodirbek Abdusattorov game was taken away for inspection on Kramnik’s request.""We found nothing wrong or suspicious with the cell phone. It was not connected, there was no SIM card. The bluetooth and Wifi were not on. We switched on the bluetooth, checked history and found everything to be satisfactory. No rule was broken. The phone was used as just a filming object,"" she told Chess24 and Chessbase India webcast. ""The phone was taken back to the playing hall and the video transmission was allowed.""Bejatovic also made it clear that the rule of not carrying electronic devices without prior permission is only for the players and captains and there are different regulations for the media. Chessbase India and organisers have a contract (for using phones for video transmission) and all the correct procedures were followed, she added.Kramnik said that it was his duty as captain of defending champions Uzbekistan to protect his players but he failed to furnish any proof as to how their interest was compromised. The Uzbek team did not lodge any protest about the incident either.Former seven-time national champion Praveen Thipsay said, ""Actually, a protest can be made only against Arbiter’s ruling on a game situation etc. Permitting a phone is not in the scope of Arbiter’s powers. There is a Fair Play Team which checks this.""India-Uzbekistan matchup was a pivotal contest in the ninth round. India had drawn with the eventual champions in the last edition as Gukesh stretched the winning position against Abdusattorov and lost on the top board. But India played with maturity on Friday and kept their march towards the gold medal alive.Kramnik had dethroned Garry Kasparov from the World chess throne in the 2000 match. But the Russian was accused of cheating by challenger Veselin Topalov for his frequent visits to the toilet during their epic unification match in 2006. Kramnik refused to recognise V Anand as real world champion after the Indian won it in tournament format in 2007.

Najmul Hossain Shanto (51) and Shakib Al-Hasan (5) were at the crease for Bangladesh when the umpires called off play.The day could have been better for Bangladesh if they had been more careful with their shots against R Ashwin , who took 3 for 63.Pant and Gill’s centuries were the highlights of the day as they overcame personal challenges to shine on third day.Pant's struggles have been well-documented, especially following a severe car crash in December 2022. His reaction to reaching his sixth Test hundred with a two off Shakib Al-Hasan highlighted the significance of this innings to him. Pant stood in the middle of the pitch with closed eyes, head tilted upwards, and bat raised, possibly offering a silent prayer for his return to cricket.Gill watched from a distance, respecting Pant's private moment.Soon after, the two embraced warmly as the crowd at Chepauk cheered.The moment also paid tribute to Pant equaling MS Dhoni's record for the most Test hundreds by an Indian wicketkeeper-batsman -- six.Gill's struggles were more mental than physical, primarily due to a lack of confidence in the traditional format.Since scoring a century against England in Visakhapatnam earlier this year, Gill showed progress, further validated by his fifth Test hundred, achieved with a single off Mehidy Hasan Miraz.While Gill started at 33 overnight and Pant at 12, their emotions were kept aside as they focused on tackling the Bangladesh bowlers with contrasting styles.Pant began cautiously, looking to get his eye in before opening up. The turning point came when he pulled off-spinner Miraz for a four around the first drinks break of the day. From then on, Pant's dismantling of Miraz was a constant as he reached his fifty off 88 balls.After reaching fifty, Pant showcased some of his trademark shots.Pant's movements around the crease resembled a trapeze artist, and his scooped six over fine leg off Hasan Mahmud thrilled the crowd.He was dropped on 72 by Shanto off Shakib but continued to push forward. He eventually completed his century before offering a return catch to Mehidy.Gill's batting was marked by minimalism, with precise shots rather than extravagant strokes. His short-arm pull or the punch through the covers, often executed against pacers Nahid Rana and Hasan, didn't look conventional but were effective.Gill then added another 53 runs off 51 balls with KL Rahul for the fifth wicket, pushing India's lead past 500.Facing a significant chase, Bangladesh applied themselves better than in the first innings. Shanto played a key role in their resistance. However, some of his teammates, Zakir Hasan (33) and Shadman Islam (35), lost their wickets to poor shot selection.Shanto remained steady, hitting Ashwin for three sixes, including one that brought up his fifty off 56 balls.The final session was played under floodlights due to deteriorating light conditions.","Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill score emotional centuries on third day of first Test.

After umpire Kettleborough raised his finger in favour of the bowler, Kohli opted against reviewing the decision.However, UltraEdge later revealed a spike-there was an inside edge, and even Kohli wasn't aware of it.Kohli's costly error left Rohit visibly baffled, as he appeared frustrated with Kohli's decision not to take the DRS review.

Daniel Dubois knocks out Anthony Joshua to retain IBF world heavyweight title,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/boxing/daniel-dubois-knocks-out-anthony-joshua-to-retain-ibf-world-heavyweight-title/articleshow/113562589.cms,"(Reuters Photo)

Daniel Dubois successfully defended his IBF world heavyweight championship by delivering a devastating fifth-round knockout against fellow Briton Anthony Joshua in a thrilling encounter at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night. The event drew a passionate crowd of 96,000 spectators.From the opening bell, the 27-year-old champion asserted his dominance, flooring the former two-time heavyweight titleholder on multiple occasions.Dubois had previously expressed his resolve to ""legitimise"" his reign as IBF champion, having been awarded the title vacated by Oleksandr Usyk in June.The challenger's powerful performance raises serious doubts about Joshua's boxing future, although his promoter, Eddie Hearn, indicated that he anticipates Joshua will seek a rematch.Despite entering the fight as the underdog, Dubois relentlessly pursued his renowned opponent from the outset, with his heavy punches visibly affecting the 2012 London Olympic champion throughout the contest.In a gripping fifth round filled with intense action, Dubois landed the fight-ending punch, having weathered some concerning moments himself as Joshua finally found his rhythm.The victory solidifies Dubois' position as a formidable force in the heavyweight division.""Are you not entertained?"" he said, speaking to DAZN after the biggest win of his 24-fight career. It's been a journey and I'm grateful to be in this position. I'm a gladiator, I'm a warrior until the bitter end. I want to get to the top of this sport and reach my full potential.""Before the explosive fireworks display over Wembley, Liam Gallagher of Oasis energized the eager audience with a three-song live performance.In a thrilling opening round, the British opponents clashed, culminating in Joshua being rescued by the bell after being knocked down by a vicious overhand right.Joshua, weighing 1.8 kilograms more than his younger rival, was in complete survival mode in the second round. Dubois floored him again in the third round with a left hook that caused his legs to give way.Following a standing eight count, the bell rang, and as the fourth round commenced, Joshua hit the canvas for the third time, despite his objection that it was not a valid knockdown.The fifth round was action-packed, with Dubois briefly stunned by two right hands. As Joshua attempted to capitalize on the situation, he was caught by consecutive right hands and found himself on the canvas once more, this time unable to beat the count.Both boxers stepped into the ring with the goal of securing a chance to face Tyson Fury or Usyk for the undisputed world championship.Usyk achieved a historic feat in May by becoming the first boxer to hold all four major heavyweight titles simultaneously, including the IBF, WBO, WBC, and WBA belts, after defeating Tyson Fury.Instead of facing the mandatory IBF challenger, Dubois, Usyk opted for a rematch with Fury. Dubois won the interim IBF title in June and was elevated to world champion status when Usyk vacated the belt.Joshua had aspirations of joining the prestigious group of three-time heavyweight champions, which includes legendary figures such as Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, and Evander Holyfield. However, Joshua's career took a significant hit after suffering defeats against Andy Ruiz in 2019 and two subsequent losses to Usyk.Despite bouncing back with four consecutive victories, Joshua aimed to reclaim his position at the top of the heavyweight division.Following his devastating loss to Dubois at Wembley, which marked his fourth defeat in 32 professional bouts, Joshua suggested he would continue his boxing career, but the setback will undoubtedly require introspection and careful consideration of his future in the sport.""We came up short as a team,"" he said. ""You know I'm ready to kick off in the ring but I'm going to keep it respectful. Before I came here, I always say to myself I'm a fighter for life. You keep rolling the dice. I had a fast and sharp opponent, a lot of mistakes from my end.""","Daniel Dubois successfully defended his IBF world heavyweight championship by delivering a devastating fifth-round knockout against fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.

CHENNAI: There's been an air of inevitability about this Test match since the time Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja had that partnership of 199 in the first innings. On Saturday afternoon in fading light, the duo was in ‘let's finish the Test today' mode after the young entertainers Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill had raced away to their centuries.But captain Rohit Sharma felt he needed a bit of variety and decided to introduce paceman Mohammed Siraj The light meter came in immediately, the light was offered, and Bangladesh lived to fight another day.Chasing 515 for victory, Bangladesh were 158-4 and not looking too comfortable against the spinners when the third day's play was called off due to bad light. Ashwin (3-63) was in his element, causing maximum damage while Jadeja was looking threatening with turn from the rough outside the left-hander's off-stump.But they will have to come back on Sunday and finish the job as captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (51 batting) and Shakib Al Hasan (5 batting) will try to battle on. There's a bit of rain round the corner, but the excellent MA Chidambaram Stadium drainage should allow enough game time for India to wrap things up.In fact, it was the drainage which had a role in the match starting at the right time after some strong showers in the early hours of Saturday. Under a murky sky, it was on Pant and Gill to entertain the weekend crowd and how well they did it.The lead, of course, was already over 300 and there wasn't too much pressure on the duo. The two young guns gave themselves a little bit of time to get set, apprehending a bit of moisture on the pitch. But it didn't take them too long to find out that it might not be that threatening after all and they launched into their shots.Shubman looks beautifully balanced at the crease and when the lateral movement isn't too alarming, he looks crisp on both sides of the wicket. The drives that he plays on the up are a thing of beauty and the Bangladesh pacers who got the better of him in the first innings were soundly beaten on Saturday.And when it comes to playing spin, he is as good as anybody in the business. His use of the feet, the way he dances down the track, makes it a treat and the weekend crowd had its share of fun as the 25-year-old raced away to his fifth Test ton.The biggest round of applause was reserved for the Delhi boy with whom Gill shared the 167-run partnership off 36.1 overs. Everyone loves a beautiful story and there's none better than Pant's, who matched Chennai's beloved MS Dhoni's record of the highest number of centuries by an Indian wicketkeeper in Tests.This was Pant's first Test since his comeback from a life-threatening injury a couple of years ago. And the wicketkeeper-batter hasn't put a foot wrong so far in this game. The Saturday show once again was an exhibition of his versatility as he brought his 360 degree game to the fore. The bowling was lacking the bite and Najmul dropped one sitter that he offered on 72, but that doesn't take anything away from the shots he played.The best thing about Pant's batting is that the bowler at times feels helpless. If one ball is hit over the bowler's head, the next one can be a pick-up shot over fine-leg. The crowd got ecstatic when all those shots came off and when the century came with a punch on the off-side, Pant looked up at the sky. The gods up there might also have been cheering for the boy who never gave up.",Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill raced away to their centuries.

The achievement places him above Virat Kohli , Rishabh Pant, and Mayank Agarwal who each have four centuries in WTC.Captain Rohit Sharma holds the overall record for the most centuries by an Indian in WTC, with nine centuries in 33 matches.""Scoring runs against any opposition gives you a lot of confidence and that's what I've been working on, so it gives me a lot of satisfaction, I practised before the series. I had certain plans, so I think I executed them. It's about having a good defense, but then also not missing out on the opportunities that you get as a batsman to be able to score runs.""I started practising when I was very young because I was always a tall guy, so it was easier for me to be able to use my feet and play along the ground. Playing in the air and hitting sixes actually came a bit later when I got a little bit more power in my body. But initially, when I used to practice, especially against spinners, it used to be a lot more me stepping down, trying to rotate. Because it's then hard for bowlers to settle on a wicket like this, where the odd one is turning but not all the balls are turning,” he added.Bangladesh ended the third day at 158 for 4, still needing another 357 runs for victory.","Shubman Gill scores unbeaten 119 as India set Bangladesh 515 to win.

This confirmation aligns with Pant's stellar performance, scoring a century in the ongoing Test match against Bangladesh in Chennai.The decision also dismisses rumors of disagreements between Pant and the Capitals' management concerning his retention fee, which had previously clouded his future with the franchise.Although the BCCI has yet to announce the official retention rules, sources within Delhi Capitals have informed Cricbuzz that Pant will be their top retention choice.This choice was made after a recent meeting between Pant and co-owner Parth Jindal in Mumbai. Pant's current IPL salary stands at Rs 16 crore, a figure expected to rise following new retention fee guidelines from the BCCI.Pant, who captained the side last year but missed the 2023 season due to an accident, has returned to cricket with remarkable form. Both his batting and wicket-keeping have been sharp, as evidenced by his 109-run inning at the Chepauk Stadium.In the 2024 IPL season, his comeback year, Pant has impressed with 446 runs in 13 games, at a striking rate of 155. Pant also holds the record for the highest runs scored for the franchise, totaling 3284 runs.It appears that the management has also finalized other retention decisions. If the BCCI allows more than five players to be retained, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav are expected to stay, followed by Jake Fraser-McGurk and Tristan Stubbs as the designated overseas players. Additionally, if uncapped player retentions are allowed, 21-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman Abhishek Porel is likely to be retained.Delhi Capitals' two co-owners, the GMR and JSW Groups, manage the franchise alternately every two years. Currently, the GMR Group is in charge. While each co-owner has the freedom to manage the team independently, decisions on retentions and auctions are made jointly through mutual agreement.","Rishabh Pant will remain with the Delhi Capitals.

However, he had a tough time as Rishabh Pant hit him for six fours and two sixes.This has been a challenging year for Shakib, who has managed to score just 295 runs in 18 innings across all formats with an average of 19.66, including one fifty.Additionally, he has taken 18 wickets at an average of 39.88, with best figures of 4/35.Karthik, who was handling broadcasting duties for the match, mentioned to ESPNCricinfo that Shakib has undergone finger surgery on his bowling hand.""Having seen him and known him for such a long period of time, I did go up to him and ask the reason why he has not bowled enough. And the thing which he said to me is something I completely resonate with. He has had a finger surgery on his bowling finger, which is the point of his finger of his left hand. It is swollen, it is rigid, there is no movement, no suppleness to it. So he feels he is not getting any feeling out of it. As a spinner you need the feeling. Also he is having issues with his shoulder so it is a combination of both and it's tough to bowl in Test cricket where you need that feel as a spinner,"" said Karthik.Shakib sustained a left index finger injury during a match against Sri Lanka in the 50-over World Cup last year, sidelining him for a few months.He also had an eye issue that delayed his return to the Bangladesh team until March this year.Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal stated that if Bangladesh picked Shakib despite his injuries, they are essentially playing with one bowler less.""Murali Kartik said that Shakib is having trouble gripping the ball due to this finger injury. If that is the case, Bangladesh are playing with four frontline bowlers. The team management should inform whether they knew about this injury or not,"" Tamim said.However, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chief physician Dr. Debashish clarified that they are unaware of any recent discomfort in Shakib's finger or shoulder.""Shakib had a fracture in his finger from the World Cup in India.

I knew his next question would be, 'What happens if I get out early with the new ball?'""""I said, 'You know, it doesn’t matter if you fail because you’re doing something for the team. You’re doing something out of your usual position, something you’ve never done before. So even if you don’t score runs as an opener, we will find an opportunity for you to bat down the order.'""

Kylian Mbappe , who has now scored in four straight matches for the club, added a late penalty to put the result beyond doubt.Meanwhile, league leaders Barcelona, boasting a 100% record with five wins from five games, face a tough test on Sunday as they visit fourth-placed Villarreal, who are yet to taste defeat this season.

""It's quality, character, commitment from the team, everyone is ready when called on... those are the key factors.""Carlo Ancelotti, the coach of Madrid, decided to rest Vinicius for the start of the match, given the team's busy schedule. Instead, he chose to play Arda Guler alongside Mbappe and Rodrygo.Throughout the first half, Madrid dominated the game but failed to score. Mbappe was heavily involved, seeking his sixth goal of the season across all competitions. Joan Garcia, the Espanyol goalkeeper, made an impressive save at his near post to deny Mbappe's attempt from a tight angle.Following the corner, Eder Militao's header narrowly missed the target.

Growing increasingly frustrated, Mbappe received a booking for arguing against a decision made against him.Jude Bellingham struck a powerful shot from the edge of the box, but Garcia saved it comfortably, resulting in a goalless scoreline at halftime. Madrid has only managed to score one first-half goal in eight matches this season.In the second half, Carlos Romero's off-target strike provided a glimmer of hope for the newly-promoted visitors, but Madrid continued to dominate possession and create chances.However, in the 54th minute, Madrid were left stunned as Courtois inadvertently deflected Jofre Carreras' cross into his own net, giving the underdogs a surprising lead.Ancelotti quickly introduced Vinicius, but it was Carvajal who equalized just four minutes later, tapping in on the line after Bellingham's cross eluded the previously unbeatable Garcia.As Madrid intensified their pressure, Espanyol's defense eventually crumbled. Vinicius showcased his skill with a sublime outside-of-the-boot cross, setting up Rodrygo for Madrid's second goal.The Brazilian then turned provider, unselfishly playing Vinicius through on goal to score the third. Mbappe capped off the resounding victory by converting a late penalty, securing a comfortable win for the home side.","Real Madrid beat Espanyol 4-1 to close gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona to a single point.

This win helped the Reds recover from last week's surprising 1-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest.In the first half, Diaz was in exceptional form. His dazzling performance on the left wing overshadowed Liverpool's occasional defensive lapses and effectively decided the match by halftime.Bournemouth initially thought they had taken the lead through Antoine Semenyo, but it was ruled offside after a VAR review.The Anfield crowd's initial apprehension turned into jubilation following the overturning of the goal.Diaz then took center stage, challenging Kepa Arrizabalaga with a fine save in the eighth minute and consistently posing a threat. He eventually found the back of the net in the 26th minute, beating Kepa to a long ball and finishing with precision.Just three minutes later, Diaz doubled his tally. In a swift five-on-four counter-attack, he used his left foot to steer the ball between Kepa's legs, marking his fifth goal in five league matches.Darwin Nunez then added another goal, advancing down the right before cutting inside and curling a left-footed shot past Kepa to make it 3-0.The second half saw fewer noteworthy moments, with Liverpool introducing Enrico Chiesafor his Premier League debut.The young talent, acquired from Juventus for a reported 10 million pounds ($13.32 million), offered promising glimpses of his potential.Despite their offensive strength, Liverpool occasionally showed vulnerabilities at the back.

It was an inch perfect aerial ball from the right by Imran Khan and Murray, who started the game in place of Rei Tachikawa, timed his jump perfectly to head the ball into the net and score his second goal of the season.With their fans egging them on at the Furnace, JFC were in no mood to sit quietly, and they took the lead through Javi Hernandez eight minutes later.Imran once again played his part to win the foul just outside the box and Hernandez curled the ball into the left-bottom corner of the net directly from the free-kick.Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa should have done well to collect it but he failed to predict the cross.Even after the change of ends, Jamshedpur kept up the pressure and Hernandez scored his second of the night to make it 3-1 for the hosts. This time Seiminlen Doungel - brought in place of Mohammed Sanan at half-time - collected the ball from Murray, made the run down the left and laid it up for Hernandez, who ran in and blasted the ball into the net.At that moment it seemed that Jamshedpur had done enough to bag the win, but Mumbai weren't going down quietly. Petr Kratky’s men reduced the lead when Yoell van Nieff scored another superb goal in the 77th minute and then kept pressing for the equaliser.The match became quite physical at times and a total of nine yellow cards - 7 for JFC and 2 for MCFC - were shown as none of the two teams took their foot off the pedal. But after almost 10 minutes of injury time, the referee blew the final whistle as Jamshedpur earned their second successive win of the season.Earlier, even as Jamshedpur tried to take an early lead, it was Mumbai City who struck first and what a goal it was from their Greek striker Karelis.Collecting the ball in the midfield following a header, the No. 9 made a small run, made some space, and then fired the ball from the right into the top right corner of the net with his left foot from about 10 yards outside the box. It was certainly one of the goals of the tournament and goalkeeper Albino Gomes could do nothing to keep it out.In the next few minutes, Mumbai went all out in search of the second. Bipin Singh was outstanding on the left and along with Lallianzuala Chhangte and Karelis, the trio made life difficult for the Jamshedpur defenders.But the hosts did well to hold on and survive the onslaught.And once they got the opportunity to strike back, they pounced on it and scored the three goals.

However, he has shown strong form this season, already netting four goals in six appearances in all competitions.Chelsea have won all three of their away league matches this season, suffering just one defeat, which came against champions Manchester City in their five top-flight games.Despite reports of a power struggle between Chelsea co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali, Maresca, who took over from Mauricio Pochettino in the close-season, has made a positive impact.After finishing sixth and 12th in the last two seasons, there are signs that Maresca could guide Chelsea's costly but underperforming squad to become top-four contenders.West Ham's poor start under new boss Julen Lopetegui has put him under pressure, with fans expressing their frustration well before the final whistle.West Ham have managed just one win in their five Premier League outings, losing three consecutive home games to start the season.Chelsea kicked off quickly, with Jackson capitalizing on a defensive lapse in the fourth minute, taking Jadon Sancho's pass and beating Alphonse Areola easily.The goal marked Chelsea's earliest in a Premier League London derby since Daniel Sturridge’s strike against QPR in 2012.Jackson's dominance continued as he set up Cole Palmer for a shot that narrowly missed.Chelsea's pressure paid off again, with Jackson scoring in the 18th minute after a slick team move and a precise pass from Moises Caicedo.West Ham's Jarrod Bowen epitomized the team's struggles with a poor shot that soared over the bar from a promising position.Crysencio Summerville, making his first league start for West Ham, appealed for a penalty after a challenge from Wesley Fofana, but VAR dismissed the claims.Lopetegui showed his displeasure with his team's effort by substituting Argentina midfielder Guido Rodríguez before halftime.However, Rodríguez's replacement, Thomas Soucek, did not improve the team's fortunes, missing a chance to score by firing straight at Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez.Sancho, on loan from Manchester United, looked rejuvenated, causing problems for the West Ham defense with his dribbling. This was his first Premier League start since May 2023.Palmer sealed the win for Chelsea in the 47th minute, finishing past Areola after receiving a pass from Jackson.",Nicolas Jackson scored twice as Chelsea beat West Ham 3-0 at London Stadium.

From a position of dominance at the start, the hosts were found wanting in the second half.That prompts the obvious question: will there be changes?""For sure, it won't be the same lineup,"" Manolo said during the pre-match media interaction on Thursday. ""I don't know whether it would be one or four changes.""Manolo will have to refresh his squad to get the campaign back on track. But with five players nursing injuries, the changes might only be cosmetic. Spanish midfielder Iker Guarrotxena, star defender Sandesh Jhingan and goalkeeper Lara Sharma are all recovering from surgeries. Mohammad Yasir and Alan Saji picked up injuries during the Bhausaheb Bandodkar Memorial Trophy. None of them are available, until after the FIFA international window ends on Oct 15.""When you lose one game, you remember the players who are unavailable. But that was not the reason (for the loss). The bench, and the players on the field, did not judge the situation correctly in the second half. The injured players cannot return before the window, but it's true that three of them -- Yasir, Sandesh and Iker -- will be available very soon, just after the break,"" said Manolo.Mohammedan were unlucky on their debut, conceding a last-gasp goal againstNorthEast United . The experienced Manolo knows he has to brace himself for another tough battle.""I liked everything about their game; the atmosphere on the pitch, the people at the stadium, everything was good. They were unlucky. I agree with (NEUFC coach Juan Pedro) Benali that Mohammedan will be a very difficult opponent this season. But, again, we won't be easy for them.""It is true that Mohammedan's pre-season was short, and you could see that. During the last minutes, they were very tired, with a lot of players having cramps. This is normal. They will get better after some games,"" said Manolo.Mohammedan qualified for the top tier after winning the I-League last season. It was coach Andrey Chernyshov who guided them to a title-triumph in the second tier of Indian football and he knows his defensive as well as offensive players will require more time to get accustomed to the opposition in ISL.""We need to improve in defensive situations, as well as in attacking ones,"" said Chernyshov. ""We try to change some situations and be better in the next match. It's not easy for players coming in from other countries to adapt quickly to the game here.

Jamshedpur though had to forfeit the game later on and Mumbai were awarded a 3-0 win by the AIFF disciplinary committee after the hosts finished the game with just six Indians on the field in place of seven.It was a big blow to the Men of Steel who were then on a brilliant streak after coach Khalid Jamil took charge midway into the season and looked to finish on a high.The verdict expectedly took the steam out of their campaign and they sadly finished second from the bottom of the table for the second consecutive season.However, Jamshedpur have made a dream start to the new season as they grabbed a comeback 2-1 win at FC Goa and will be looking to continue their winning run against defending champions Mumbai City at home on Saturday.While Jamshedpur’s performance at Fatorda Stadium wasn’t always impressive, they were able to do just enough to bag the win thanks to a brilliant goal from Jordan Murray in added time. The other goal was scored from the spot by Javi Siverio.But the win is in the past for coach Jamil as he wants the team to remain grounded for the next encounter. ""We must believe in ourselves in what we can do. We have to prepare, and we should not be overconfident. The next game is also a big game at our home ground. We have to be prepared, and we must get positive results,"" said the coach.Jamil, who also coached NorthEast United FC earlier, has an enviable record against the Islanders having lost only once in five matches and will certainly take confidence from that.Mumbai though will be a tough nut to crack. After winning the ISL trophy last season, Petr Kratky’s men are looking to bag their first win of the season on Saturday. They faced a difficult test against Mohun Bagan Super Giant in the opener in Kolkata and were able to deny the hosts a victory with a solid second-half performance which helped them overcome the two-goal first-half deficit for a 2-2 draw.Speaking ahead of the game, Mumbai City coach Kratky said, ""I wouldn’t say that playing away from home is a pressure. It’s a challenge that every footballer has to face. At the end of the day, we want fans to enjoy the game tomorrow, but hopefully we win the match.""However, Jamshedpur will surely hope to make life difficult for the visitors in front of their home crowd, who are expected to turn up in numbers at the Furnace for their first home match of the season.JFC, who for most part of the game against FC Goa were happy to stay back and defend, will likely have the same strategy for Mumbai but their goalkeeper Albino Gomes will have to put up a better show. Despite making some good saves in Goa, Gomes conceded in a terrible fashion and Jamil will be more than happy to not see anything remotely similar to that on Saturday.","Jamshedpur FC take on defending champions Mumbai City FC on Saturday.

If you win, you will get this much as a bonus, and if the team wins this much extra.""The committee then decided to authorize the captain to discuss it with the player.""Rajpal refused to comment on the matter but another member of the executive committee who attended the meeting confirmed, without revealing details, that Nagal's request was agreed to.An AITA source familiar with the subject said, ""It ($50,000) is roughly Rs. 40-45 lakh for two ties in a year. So essentially, he has asked for Rs. 20 lakh per tie, which I think is fine. A (No. 1) player gets anywhere around Rs. 7 to 12 lakhs at the moment.""As a standalone figure it might seem exorbitant, but to put it in perspective, a player earned $100,000 simply for turning up in the singles first round at the US Open this year. At the French Open, a first-round appearance made a player richer by 73,000-euros.It is also understood that Nagal had requested for a change in support staff attached to the Indian Davis Cup team. It is not clear whether he wanted both Rajpal (as captain by Mahesh Bhupathi) and Zeeshan Ali (as coach by Somdev Devvarman ) to be replaced, or only the latter. Devvarman is Nagal's mentor.The AITA subsequently appointed Ashutosh Singh as coach after Ali resigned.Nagal issued a detailed statement on the subject while also responding to the attack from the AITA that he skipped the Stockholm sojourn despite being fit.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup, as playing for the national team is a moment I cherish deeply. However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team’s chances,"" said Nagal, who on Thursday pulled out of the ATP 250 event in Hangzhou.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""This is not about personal gain.

This injury had also forced him to withdraw from the US Open men's doubles competition last month.Without a singles specialist, India lost 0-4 to Sweden on their home turf.The team, primarily composed of doubles players and debutants, failed to win a set in the World Group I tie.On Thursday, AITA expressed its displeasure, claiming top players like Nagal, Yuki Bhambri , and Sasikumar Mukund had refused national duty.Nagal was scheduled to play in the ATP 250 Hangzhou Open but withdrew, again citing his back issue.""You tell me why should a player be asking for money to play for the country. This is a big question. He had demanded an annual fee of $50,000 (approx 45 lakh) and said if he is not paid, he will not play,"" Dhupar told PTI.India plays only two ties per season in the World Group I, typically in February and September.""Let the country decide if it is right or not. Then, it is the decision of the government and everybody. The players are also paid by TOPS. And it's not that they don't get paid for playing the Davis Cup. They do get paid,"" Dhupar insisted.Dhupar was referring to the prize money that AITA receives from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) for Davis Cup participation, which is distributed among team members.For a World Group I tie, AITA receives around Rs 30 lakh, of which 70 per cent is distributed among participating players. The remaining 30 per cent is kept for administrative expenses by the national federation.The prize money decreases for lower group ties.""No other player asked for additional money over and above their share of the ITF prize money.""A former Indian Davis Cupper confirmed that there have been past instances where leading players asked for money to play Davis Cup and those demands were accepted.Nagal did not deny AITA's claim. He defended his stance through a statement on social media.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""AITA was displeased that Nagal skipped Davis Cup by citing injury but seemed to recover in time for the Hangzhou Open. Nagal withdrew from the ATP 250 tournament two days after AITA's statement.Nagal emphasized the honor of representing his country.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup...However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team's chances.""""I believe it is better for the team and for the country to have someone at 100 per cent rather than risking further injury and potentially disrupting the match. I had informed AITA well in advance about my inability to participate.""It was learned that Captain Rohit Rajpal took Nagal's proposal to the AITA Executive Committee. After initial reluctance, the committee agreed to pay him, but requested the captain to renegotiate the figure.However, before an agreement could be reached, Nagal withdrew from the tie and the discussion ended without progress.During the tie, Nagal criticized AITA on social media, stating that many team members were there only to enjoy junkets.He justified his break further.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Nagal reaffirmed his commitment to representing the country.""I look forward to future opportunities to wear the national colours and make my country proud, both on and off the court.""Nagal had also skipped the tie against Pakistan earlier this year, stating that the grass court surface did not suit his style of play as well as hard courts do.Skipper Rajpal faces criticism on social media, with many questioning his suitability as Davis Cup captain.Rajpal was appointed captain in 2019, replacing Mahesh Bhupathi , who hesitated to travel to Pakistan due to security concerns.A team official noted that receiving payment like cricketers is acceptable, but tennis players should also be willing to go through a selection process.""They want contracts, but do they play Nationals? Do they come to the national side through selection trials like shooters and badminton players? Tennis players get paid through Davis Cup prize money and are also funded by the government through TOPS,"" he asserted.","All India Tennis Association ( AITA) claimed Sumit Nagal demanded an annual fee of $50,000 to play Davis Cup ties for India.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the Italian tennis sensation, has achieved a remarkable feat by winning his second Grand Slam title of the year at the US Open. The 23-year-old world number one defeated American Taylor Fritz in straight sets, with a score line of 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, to secure his maiden US Open crown.This victory comes on the heels of his triumph at the Australian Open earlier this year, making him the first Italian man to win the prestigious US Open title.Jannik Sinner has secured his sixth title of the 2024 season, reaffirming his status as the world number one. Sinner's stellar record this year includes 55 wins and just 5 losses.However, his journey to winning the US Open was not without issues. Before the tournament, an independent tribunal cleared him of any wrongdoing related to a case that had drawn significant public and player attention.Allegations suggested that tennis' anti-doping authorities treated Sinner differently from other players, leading to a divided locker room atmosphere.In March, Jannik Sinner tested positive for Clostebol, a banned substance, twice. However, it was determined that the presence of the steroid was accidental, caused by a massage from his former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi.Naldi had unknowingly transferred Clostebol to Sinner while treating his own finger with a spray containing the substance, provided by Sinner’s ex-fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara. The investigation cleared Sinner of intentional doping, and he faced no suspension.Despite these distractions, Sinner stayed focused and demonstrated his skill on the court. His victory in New York extended his winning streak to 11 matches.Top players such as Novak Djokovic , Carlos Alcaraz , Alexander Zverev , and Daniil Medvedev have faced Sinner's strong performance first hand.These victories underscore Sinner's prominent role in tennis, continuing to impress both fans and competitors.In the video, Jannik Sinner faced off against 21-year-old Carlos Alcaraz. Both players demonstrated strategic gameplay, focusing on precise ball placement. During a crucial moment, Sinner executed a wide shot across the court. Alcaraz managed to reach the ball but couldn't keep it within Sinner's side of the court.In another segment of the video, Sinner played against Novak Djokovic. When Djokovic aimed a shot towards the sideline, Sinner responded with a delicate shot near the net. As Djokovic rushed to intercept, Sinner positioned himself well and directed the ball to the back corner of the court, securing a point against his formidable opponent. Even Djokovic was impressed by Sinner's shot.Jannik Sinner's recent victories have solidified his position as a leading figure in tennis. At a young age, his achievements reflect his talent and commitment. Continuing to secure titles and maintain high rankings, Sinner is a standout player to observe in the future.Sinner's notable performances have displayed his strong serves, precise groundstrokes, and excellent court coverage. His composure and execution indicate he is well-prepared for future competitions.The tennis community is keenly watching Sinner's upcoming matches as he seeks to expand on his successes.

They questioned the management of AITA, the captain and team. Sumit Nagal said he had some back problem, but (is) that problem okay (now)? He is playing a tournament in China, so somebody has to make people understand the right thing,"" AITA secretary Anil Dhupar said, as quoted by PTI.This forced captain Rohit Rajpal to field a lineup heavily reliant on doubles specialists and debutants, leaving India with effectively one dedicated singles player.""There is one point that people should know. Number two, Davis Cup is definitely a very important. It's more than a tournament, every player who is an Indian should participate if selected. So why not?"" Dhupar remarked. ""He (Nagal) said that he had a back injury and now he has entered this Hangzhou Open. He has become alright. My good wishes to him. Let the country decide. Let the people of India decide.""The AITA claims to have made efforts to persuade players, including Mukund Sasikumar, who is currently serving a suspension, to participate. However, these efforts were unsuccessful. ""And it is not the first time that Mukund refused, three times before. Let the people decide, the players decide what can we do? We tried our best to bring these people on board. If they are not available, what to do?"" he added.In response to criticism, the AITA has defended its management of the situation, highlighting its efforts to develop tennis in India through numerous tournaments and coaching courses.This public disagreement between the AITA and some of its prominent players has sparked debate about player commitment to national duty, the role of the AITA in supporting and managing players, and the overall state of Indian tennis .The upcoming change in AITA leadership in October furthermore adds a new layer of intrigue to this evolving situation.",The All India Tennis Association (AITA) has publicly questioned the commitment of India's top tennis players.

"Players miffed with AITA, call for cultural shift, comprehensive plan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/players-miffed-with-aita-call-for-cultural-shift-comprehensive-plan/articleshow/113413405.cms,"BENGALURU: Indian tennis has imploded, hitting a new nadir. That's the good news. That the game in the country could be rapidly barrelling down a bottomless pit is the disturbing part. Until last week Sumit Nagal was the only Indian ranked in the top-300 of the singles ranking on the men's and women's Tours.That piece of statistic is abysmal by itself but hold it up against India being the only Asian nation to have made a Davis Cup final, not once, but thrice (1966, 74 and 87) and it's discomfiting.This week, Sahaja Yamalapalli cracked the top-300 at No. 298 on the WTA list. She's the India No.1.Outside of Nagal, there's little to inspire hope in singles on the ATP Tour. India has enjoyed success in doubles this year with Rohan Bopanna rising to No.1 in the individual doubles ranking, and with ten Indians logged in the top-150 things are looking good in the two-man act. But doubles is not the power index of the sport. That's precisely why an Indian side, sans the 27-year-old Nagal, failed to win so much as a set against Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group 1 tie over the weekend in Stockholm.Playing the singles for the hosts was Elias Ymer ranked 238 and Leo Borg 603. For the visitors it was Ramkumar Ramanathan, ranked 334 in singles and 144 in doubles, and Sriram Balaji, unranked in singles, and No 65 in doubles, playing singles and doubles.It was not the result so much but some of the choices made by non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal that sent shock waves through the fraternity. Playing 34-year-old Balaji, a doubles specialist, in a live singles rubber when 18-year-old Aryan Shah, the most improved of the Indian players in that bracket, was on the bench. Shah may not even have got the purchase Balaji managed in the match, but it would've counted as investment. Experience is real.Siddharth Vishwakarma, who replaced Balaji for the reverse rubber, turns 30 in a couple of weeks and is ranked just 46 slots higher than the teenager.The player community is not amused. They are all over social media and podcasts, exercising their vocal chords, taking on the All India Tennis Association .The timing is particularly sweet given that one of the most poorly performing associations in Indian sport has elections and the AGM scheduled for Sept 28. A 56-member Electoral College will decide on the posts of president, secretary and treasurer while also filling in the Executive Committee for a four-year term.Nagal, recovering from a back injury, joined Somdev Devvarman and Purav Raja on their podcast. The trio spoke on a range of issues from the anaemic levels of trust between players and officials to coaches dozing off during Davis Cup ties when players are on court and the dismal state of the National Tennis Centre in New Delhi. If it weren't real, it would make for good comedy.Over the weekend Bopanna called for a 'cultural shift in the sport', former pro Vishnu Vardhan followed up with a 'comprehensive plan' on X (formerly Twitter).Is AITA listening?When asked to comment on AITA's dismal track record the IOA and the sports ministry preferred silence.Does anyone care?Still should the rumbles from the player community come together in a united voice, it will be hard to muzzle.AITA will look to divide and rule as it has always done, offer a section of the players sops. It's up to the players to stand up not just for themselves, but for the generations to come.Using words is a good beginning, but they will need to do more. Be the change they wish to see. Perhaps.","Indian tennis has imploded, hitting a new nadir. Sumit Nagal was the only Indian ranked in the top-300 of the singles ranking on the men's and women's Tours.
