12 runs per over in Powerplays

No need for consolidation

Featherbed pitches on offer

Fast bowlers are the rage

Almost two-thirds of the league stage is done and dusted. The IPL this season has witnessed new trends and some old patterns turned upside down. TOI takes a look...There were only two 250-plus totals before this edition, one way back in 2013 when RCB raked up 263/5 against Pune Warriors and the other in 2023 when LSG scored 257/5 versus Punjab Kings.This season, there have been 8 totals of more than 250, with Sunrisers Hyderabad leading the way with three such totals. KKR have a pair of 250-plus scores to their credit. Now, a 200-plus total is nothing but a par score.Top-order batsmen like Jake Fraser-McGurk (DC), Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma (SRH), Phil Salt and Sunil Narine (KKR), Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal (RR) among others have just maximised the first six overs to the fullest. Earlier, the standard ""explosive start"" after the Powerplay overs was teams notching up 55-60 runs. This IPL, the benchmark has shifted to 70-plus after the first six. SRH even scored 125/0 against Delhi, the highest-ever score in the Powerplay in the IPL. In their record successful chase of 262 against KKR, Punjab scored 93 /1 in this period. McGurk went berserk to lift DC to 92/0 against MI.With the 'Impact Player' rule helping the batting side's cause, every team is making sure the hitting continues even after the Powerplay. Earlier, the norm was that batters used to rotate the strike and look for a boundary every alternate over before going big once again in the death overs (16th-20th). Teams were happy to score 7-8 runs per over from the 7th over till the 15th. This season, there's been a tectonic shift - batters are taking 10-12 runs per over even during the so-called 'consolidation period'. A batter now thinks six first, then a boundary; and if not the first two, he turns to other options.Earlier, each venue had a distinct characteristic of its own, lending some meaning to the home-and-away concept. The Wankhede stadium's pitch offered pace and bounce and the new ball swung. The wicket in Chennai's MA Chidambaram stadium was a turning track. Delhi's Kotla wicket was slow and low. Bangalore's Chinnaswamy pitch has perennially sounded the death knell for all kinds of bowlers. That tradition is still on in Bangalore, but the other pitches that traditionally offered something to the bowlers have also turned into absolute featherbeds. The batters are ruling the roost.Other than DC, who have kept faith in spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel, most franchises are turning to their pacemen to deliver. Even CSK, which traditionally has won IPLs on the back of spin, have depended on Mustafizur Rahman , Deepak Chahar, Matheesha Pathirana, Shardul Thakur and Tushar Deshpande . Ravindra Jadeja has often been the sole spinner, as Maheesh Theekshana and Moeen Ali have played just three matches each. KKR, a team that relied on spinners in previous IPLs, has also drastically cut down on its overs given to spin. Another startling statistic of this IPL is that among the top-20 wicket-takers, only two are spinners, and they're Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav. The rest are all pacers.","Batsmen are taking 10-12 runs per over even during the so-called 'consolidation period' Earlier, the norm was that batters used to rotate the strike and look for a boundary every alternate over.

AHMEDABAD: Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli take centrestage as the Gujarat Titans host Royal Challengers Bengaluru in an afternoon match at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday.Earmarked as one who could fill in Kohli's shoes, Gill has taken on the mantle with aplomb and has more or less cemented his place in the Indian team across formats.While Gill won his first Orange Cap last year, aggregating 890 runs in 17 matches, Kohli is the leading run-getter in this edition, having totalled 430 runs so far in 9 matches.However, more than the individual runs scored, it's the strike rate that has dominate the conversation. While Kohli's knocks have come at a strike rate of 145.76, Gill has been striking at a similar rate of 146.15, not among the highest this season.Gill will look up to fellow opener Wriddhiman Saha for providing the brisk start. Saha and southpaw David Miller are back among runs but would want to be more consistent. Sai Sudharsan, who bats at number three, is the top run-getter for Titans this season. But the Tamil Nadu batter's 334 runs have come at a strike rate of 128.95.Titans' bowling has also blown hot and cold so far. The predictable Umesh Yadav has been replaced by Sandeep Warrier (five wickets in three matches) but the Tamil Nadu pacer too has leaked runs.While leg-spinner Rashid Khan has taken eight wickets in nine wickets, he has kept the run scoring at bay by going at 7.44 runs an over in a season in which scores in excess of 200 have been the norm. Noor Ahmad and R Sai Kishore too have impressed.Kohli, meanwhile, has been supported by Faf Du Plessis , Dinesh Karthik and Rajat Patidar (211 runs). The batting, though, has not found support from the bowlers.Left-arm pacer Yash Dayal, who is RCB 's highest wicket-taker, is 23rd on the list. Pacer Mohammed Siraj has taken five wickets at an economy rate of 9.65.The inclusion of Will Jacks and Swapnil Singh has provided them with spin-bowling options, and how this bowling line-up fares against Gill and other batters of Titans could very well decide the outcome of this contest.","Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli take centrestage as Gujarat Titans host Royal Challengers Bengaluru in an afternoon match at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Chairman of the national selection committee Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma are set to hold an informal meeting in the national capital to discuss a potential 15-member squad for the T20 World Cup in the Americas.The official announcement is likely to take place in Mumbai on May 1, which is the cut-off date for the ICC event.It is understood that Agarkar specifically flew to Delhi for Saturday's IPL match between Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals, as this provided him an opportunity to have a discussion with Rohit and gain further clarity before meeting with his colleagues to finalize the team selection.There are a couple of slots which will be up for discussion as most of the team picks itself. There won't be many surprises and the only thing that the selection committee and team management needs to be convinced about isHardik Pandya 's bowling fitness.If Hardik is slotted in the 15, then only one among Shivam Dube and Rinku Singh can be accommodated while it seems that KL Rahul, one of the favourites of the current coaching dispensation headed by Rahul Dravid, has left his nearest competitor Sanju Samson far behind.There is very little possibility of a left-field selection and one option could be Mumbai Indians batter Tilak Varma, who is a flamboyant southpaw and can also bowl handy off-spin in case opposition has more left-handers.However, it can't be ascertained how much is the possibility of that happening as Axar Patel and Ravi Bishnoi are fighting for the third spinner's slot.Yuzvendra Chahal, the country's most skillful white ball wrist spinner, is reportedly not a priority choice for an influential member of the coaching staff, who has a lot of say in selection matters.","The official announcement is likely to take place in Mumbai on May 1, which is the cut-off date for the ICC event.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) are set to face Rajasthan Royals (RR) in the 44th match of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Ekana Cricket Stadium on Saturday. Currently, Lucknow hold the fourth position on the points table with five wins from eight games, while Rajasthan sit at the top with seven victories in eight matches.Rajasthan Royals are likely to be the favourites in Saturday's clash, having secured three consecutive wins after a rare loss against Gujarat Titans.Riyan Parag, the young Assam batter, has been the standout performer for RR in the batting department this season, leading the team's scoring with 318 runs from eight games. Additionally, the resurgence of Yashasvi Jaiswal has strengthened RR's batting lineup, as demonstrated by his unbeaten 104 off 60 balls in the previous game against Mumbai Indians, leading his team to a comfortable nine-wicket victory.RR's batting typically revolves around their skipper, Sanju Samson , who has scored 314 runs so far. With the West Indian Shimron Hetymer capable of hitting top gear, the 2008 IPL champions possess a formidable lineup. However, players like Rovman Powell and Dhruv Jurel need to step up and contribute more to the team's success.RR also boast a potent bowling attack, featuring the experienced Trent Boult, Avesh Khan, and Sandeep Sharma, whose impressive figures of 5 for 18 against Mumbai Indians have ignited the team's spirit. The spin department is in the capable hands of the experienced duo, Yuzvendra Chahal and R. Ashwin, although the latter has struggled this season. Chahal, however, remains RR's best bowler, having claimed 13 wickets from eight games.LSG, on the other hand, will be motivated by the desire for revenge after losing the first encounter to RR by 20 runs this season. Apart from seeking revenge, LSG will also be aiming to secure a hat-trick of victories and climb up the leaderboard. KL Rahul 's team is riding high after two consecutive wins, but the Indian player is well aware of the shortcomings in the top order. When Rahul and his opening partner Quinton de Kock are in top form, LSG's batting looks formidable. The challenge arises when the opening duo has an off day. However, this issue was addressed by Marcus Stoinis in their previous game against Chennai Super Kings, where the Australian scored an unbeaten century.In their IPL encounters so far, Lucknow Super Giants and Rajasthan Royals have crossed paths in a total of 4 matches. Out of these encounters, Lucknow have secured victory on one occasion, while Rajasthan have emerged triumphant in three matches, showcasing their dominance in the head-to-head battle between the two franchises.Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, located in Lucknow, India, was formerly known as the Ekana International Cricket Stadium.In terms of batting performance, teams batting first have held a dominant position, winning 5 out of 6 matches, accounting for 83.33% of victories. Conversely, teams batting second have managed to secure victory in only one match, representing 16.67% of wins.Surprisingly, the statistics also reveal a trend where teams winning the toss have won only 33.33% of matches, while those losing the toss have emerged victorious in 66.67% of matches, indicating the stadium's inclination towards favoring the chasing side.With an average runs per wicket of 22.52 and an average runs per over of 7.04, the stadium has witnessed competitive cricketing action, with an average first innings score of 160 runs setting the tone for thrilling encounters.Compared to other IPL 2024 venues, the pitch at Lucknow's Ekana Stadium is expected to be slightly slower. Batsmen may encounter difficulties scoring against the old ball, despite finding it easier to play shots with the new ball.To thrive on this surface, pacers are likely to rely more on variations like cutters and bowling into the pitch as the match progresses. Additionally, spinners are anticipated to find ample assistance, making it challenging for batsmen during the middle overs.In Lucknow, teams batting first have enjoyed considerable success, securing victories in six matches compared to the four won by chasing teams. Consequently, it appears probable that the team winning the toss will opt to bat first.1. With the pitch expected to slow down, pacers who can adeptly adjust their strategies by incorporating variations like cutters and bowling into the pitch as the ball ages could prove to be valuable fantasy picks. Bowlers with such skills are likely to capitalize on the conditions and pick up crucial wickets, thereby accumulating fantasy points for their teams.2. Considering the historical trend of teams batting first enjoying success at the Ekana Stadium, selecting top-order batsmen from teams likely to bat first could be a strategic move in fantasy cricket. Batsmen who can capitalize on the early advantage and set competitive totals on the board stand a higher chance of accumulating fantasy points through significant contributions with the bat.Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul, Devdutt Padikkal/Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Matt Henry/Mohsin Khan, Yash ThakurMayank YadavYashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, Rovman Powell, Ravichandran Ashwin, Trent Boult, Avesh Khan, Sandeep Sharma, Yuzvendra ChahalJos ButtlerIPL 2024 Stats: 302 Runs in 8 MatchesAhead of the match against Rajasthan Royals, KL Rahul of Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) emerges as a formidable fantasy pick. With 302 runs amassed in 8 matches during IPL 2024, Rahul has consistently showcased his batting proficiency and ability to anchor innings. As a top-order batsman, his capacity to accumulate runs consistently makes him a reliable choice for fantasy teams seeking reliable point accumulators. (Here's a list of updated Orange Cap list) IPL 2024 Stats: 285 Runs in 7 MatchesWith the Rajasthan Royals set to take on LSG, Jos Buttler emerges as a prime fantasy prospect ahead of the upcoming match. Displaying his batting prowess in IPL 2024, Buttler has already amassed 285 runs in just 7 matches. As a dynamic opening batsman known for his explosive strokeplay, Buttler poses a significant threat to opposition bowlers and promises to rack up valuable fantasy points.IPL 2024 Stats: 13 Wickets in 8 MatchesYuzvendra Chahal of the Rajasthan Royals emerges as a compelling fantasy pick. With an impressive tally of 13 wickets in just 8 matches during IPL 2024, Chahal has consistently proven his ability to pick up crucial wickets and control the flow of runs in the middle overs. As a skilled leg-spinner, his knack for deceiving batsmen with his variations makes him a valuable asset.

NEW DELHI: It's an open secret that MS Dhoni has huge number of fans and admirers. Dhoni's legendary career has inspired a number of cricketers, both Indian and international.One such admirer of Dhoni is KL Rahul , the captain of Lucknow Super Giants Ahead of LSG 's match against table toppers Rajasthan Royals on Saturday, the host broadcaster shared a video of Rahul talking about IPL and Dhoni.Rahul says, ""Ever since the IPL started, we were all youngsters, we used to watch what a big platform this is, what a big scale cricket is on, how much love the people are giving it and how much they enjoy it how much entertainment IPL is, so that's what draws you to play in the IPL.""""But after playing, I used to see other teams, I used to look at MS Dhoni, his cap always had the No.1, that is he is the first player for CSK . So the cricketers of our batch, we always used to think we won't get the chance of becoming the first player of a team. So when the team of Lucknow came in the IPL, and when they called me asking if I would be interested to play for them, captain the team, the first thing that struck me was that now my cap will also have No. 1 and I'll be the first player to play for Lucknow,"" Rahul adds.Lucknow Super Giants have beaten Chennai Super Kings in both their matches this season.Rahul's experience and leadership skills are invaluable to Lucknow Super Giants, both as a batsman and as a potential leader on the field.Rahul's performances often set the tone for his team's innings, and he's known for anchoring the batting line-up while also accelerating when needed.","KL Rahul is the captain of Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL.

We didn’t get an ideal start but with the partnership me and Hooda had was great. In these sorts of games, the set batter had to score close to a hundred after getting to 50-60. I think we were 150 after about 15 overs, should have capitalized on it a bit more. I think it is clear the team with more sixes ends up winning. We do try to hit our sixes but today we had to change our approach after those two early wickets. If Hooda pushed on and scored 20 more, and I got 20 more then we’d finish around 220.

NEW DELHI: Captain Babar Azam 's solid half-century and spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi's four-wicket haul helped Pakistan secure a nine-run victory over New Zealand in the fifth and final Twenty20 International in Lahore on Saturday.Azam's 69 off 44 balls and Fakhar Zaman's 43 off 33 balls propelled Pakistan to 178 for 5 in their 20 overs. Shaheen then took 4 for 30 to restrict New Zealand to 169 all out in 19.2 overs, leveling the series at 2-2.However, Pakistan's win wasn't certain until the final over, as Josh Clarkson's unbeaten 38 threatened an upset, needing 12 runs.Two run-outs in Mohammad Amir 's over sealed the home win, much to the delight of the packed crowd at Gaddafi Stadium.The first match of the series was abandoned, with Pakistan taking the second and New Zealand winning the third, both by identical seven-wicket margins in Rawalpindi. New Zealand claimed victory in the fourth match in Lahore by four runs.The series served as valuable preparation for both teams ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies in June.While Pakistan would be disappointed not to have won a series against a depleted New Zealand side missing a host of players due to Indian Premier League, unavailability and injuries, the visitors got a boost from their bench strength.Shaheen gave Pakistan an ideal start by dismissing Tom Blundell for four in his first over -- his 15th wicket in his opening over of a Twenty20 international -- and 50th in all T20 matches.Tim Seifert put New Zealand back on track with an aggressive 33-ball 52 -- his ninth T20I half century containing seven boundaries and two sixes.He added 76 for the second wicket with skipper Micheal Bracewell (23) but from 81-1 New Zealand lost four wickets in the space of 25 balls for the addition of just 22 runs.Leg-spinner Usama Mir (2-21) had Seifert and Mark Chapman (12) while fellow spinner Shadab Khan accounted for Bracewell as New Zealand's chase was derailed.Shaheen returned for a second spell to dismiss James Neesham (16), Zak Foulkes (nought) and Ish Sodhi (three) in successive overs.Azam said he used different combinations to test the squad strength ahead of the World Cup.""Look, throughout the series we tried different combinations and we wanted to see where our bench strength stands,"" said Azam.""There are many good signs but we won't be complacent and will focus on improvement which is crucial in international cricket.""Bracewell was delighted that his team came out all-square.""Pretty fair reflection of the series, pretty happy with coming over here and learning how to play in these conditions,"" said Bracewell who captained New Zealand for the first time.""Credit to Pakistan, they played really well today.""Earlier, Azam saw his opening partner Saim Ayub fall in the second over for just one but that did not deter him as he added 73 for the second wicket with Usman Khan who made a brisk 24-ball 31.Azam hit six boundaries and two sixes in his 34th T20I half-century before he was bowled by pacer Ben Sears in the 15th over.Zaman hit four boundaries and a six before he was smartly caught by Chapman on the boundary off Foulkes as Pakistan managed 55 in the last five overs.Shadab Khan hit a six and a four in his five-ball 15 not out.New Zealand made three changes as they brought back Seifert, Cole McConchie and Foulkes while pace spearhead Shaheen returned for the home team.","Pakistan beat New Zealand by nine runs in the fifth and final Twenty20 International in Lahore.

NEW DELHI: Former India off-spinner Aashish Kapoor expressed disappointment with the bowlers' performance in this IPL season, highlighting their struggle to find the right lengths. He warned that the trend of high-scoring matches could soon escalate to teams scoring 300-350 runs in an innings.Teams have consistently surpassed 200-250 runs this season, with Sunrisers Hyderabad exceeding 260 on three occasions and Punjab Kings achieving a record-breaking T20 chase against Kolkata Knight Riders As the assistant coach of Gujarat Titans , Kapoor shared these thoughts ahead of their match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, emphasizing the need for bowlers to correct their approach to avoid escalating run rates.""The batsmen are playing some amazing shots, but the bowling is not up to the mark. (GT head coach Asish) Nehra and I keep talking about it. Absolutely, I am surprised,"" Kapoor said at the pre-match press conference.""I mean if you bowled decently enough you will end up giving away 200 runs, but not 260, 280, 270. Last few matches, every over there have been at least two full tosses, two short balls bowled in their half.""If you are not going to pitch the ball on good length areas and keep bowling on your half, why 260, you will end up seeing 360 also. Now they are bowling two full tosses an over, in future they will bowl four full tosses an over, and you will see 300-plus scores very soon,"" he added.Kapoor was, however, satisfied with the performance of his team's bowlers thus far in the tournament.""I don't think bowling has been our problem this year. They might be having problems but not our bowling.""He also cited example to buttress his point.""In Lucknow, which was a flat wicket we got them out for 160, but we couldn't chase it down. And again, against Delhi it looked a little damp that day (at Ahmedabad).""If we had won the toss we would have bowled. We didn't win the toss, we had to bat...I am not giving an excuse but if we got to 150, we would have probably put up a good fight. Still we ended up taking four-five wickets.""In that game against DC at home, GT were shot out for 89.Kapoor said the team made a conscious decision to play on both black and red soil wickets at home this season, having mostly used red soil pitches in their first two seasons.""Now the wickets in Ahmedabad, half of them are black soil wickets and half of them are red soil. Usually the black soil wicket keeps a little low bounce and it's a little sluggish than red soil wicket.""I think the last two years we played most of our matches on the red soil wickets, or the mixed wicket, whatever you cal it. But this year we also wanted to play on black soil wickets and see if it helps our spinners,"" he said.""Against Mumbai we got 170, but we won the game. And I think against Punjab, it was red soil wicket, we scored 190 and it went to the last stage and we lost the game. I thing we are getting a red soil wicket tomorrow,"" Kapoor said.Asked about the impact player rule, he said it is ""hampering"" the growth of all-rounders in India.""These days we just don't get into the tail, you pick up the fifth wicket a batsman walks in, you pick up the sixth wicket another batsman walks in. It's only 20 overs, so how many batsmen you need.""That (impact player rule) is also one of the reasons why a lot of all-rounders... a guy like Shivam Dube, he is an all-rounder, basically a bowler who could bat. Now, he is batting but he never bowls. And this is also hampering India in producing all-rounders,"" he felt.""Most of the all-rounders who are there are sitting outside, as impact players. They are just batting. So, I don't know how much this is helping,"" Kapoor said.The GT assistant coach also said the absence of experienced pacer Mohammed Shami has not helped the side this season.""Mohammed Shami is a world-class performer, anybody would miss him, right. He has done well for us in the last two seasons, those four overs will obviously make a little bit of difference.""But then you can't keep cribbing. You have to look at different options and move on.""Kapoor also refused to rule any team out of contention for play-offs berth at this juncture of the tournament.""The place where we are in the tournament currently, the mid section even we have to keep winning games. They (RCB) still will be thinking that they have a chance if they win all the remaining games. At the moment every team has a chance,"" he said.""Everybody has something to gain.""Kapoor praised R Sai Kishore and called him ""one of the most confident players in our team.""""He always thinks that he can win us a game. Players like him will keep performing. Yes, we have worked a bit on his bowling, technical part, we have told him that he can become an even better bowler.""",Former India off-spinner Aashish Kapoor expresses disappointment with the bowlers' performance in this IPL season.

NEW DELHI: Talented Jake Fraser-McGurk found himself in a challenging situation during the 2022-23 season when Cricket Victoria downgraded his contract to the level of a rookie.Faced with limited opportunities, Fraser-McGurk made the difficult decision to relocate to South Australia in search of better prospects.Fraser-McGurk's performances during that period lacked the consistency he desired.The free-flowing and uncomplicated style of play that has captivated audiences in the current IPL season was absent from his game.The contract downgrade served as a wake-up call for the young batter. Determined to prove his worth and regain his form, he embarked on a journey of self-improvement, dedicating himself to refining his skills and technique.Cut to 2024, a call from Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting had 22-year-old Fraser-McGurk rushing to India and rest as they say is history.He has already smashed 22 sixes and an equal number of boundaries in five games since his arrival as Harry Brook's replacement.On Saturday afternoon, he owned Kotla by smashing Jasprit Bumrah 's opening over in a manner that the famed Indian slinger would have hardly imagined.The man, who owns the world record of fastest List A hundred (off 29 balls in Marsh Cup) has now done enough that Delhi Capitals have been forced to drop David Warner on pretext of a hand injury.Yes, Warner had injury but he is doing fine and played against Sunrisers. But DC management has understood that it difficult to fit both Warner and Fraser-McGurk in the playing XI.For Fraser-McGurk, the 27-ball-84 felt surreal as watching Bumrah rattle stumps on television is so different from carting him all over the park. At times, truth is stranger than fiction.""It was pretty nervous. I had looked at his (Bumrah's) footage all day. But in the game everything goes out of the window and you just have to see the ball. It is good to test yourself against the best bowler in the world,"" Fraser-McGurk said while collecting his man of the match award.Having already encountered highs and lows in his short career, he felt that these innings are good for his career.""You have to ride the waves of highs and lows. These innings are good for my confidence and for my team.""He had watched a lot of IPL but only after being a part of it did he know that what kind of competition exists.""From outside you don't know the level of the competition, this is such a higher level than the other leagues and it is amazing to be a part of it,"" he said.Life for Fraser-McGurk is moving at an even quicker pace than his three fifties at the IPL and two things, one can rest assured will happen.He will be part of the Australian T20 squad as he has got a hang of playing spinners which will be important in the West Indies.Secondly, Delhi Capitals will for sure retain him along with Rishabh Pant and Kuldeep Yadav before next year's mega IPL auctions.",Jake Fraser-McGurk has smashed 22 sixes and an equal number of boundaries in five games since his arrival as Harry Brook's replacement.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings batting coach Michael Hussey discussed Ravindra Jadeja 's new role as a No. 4 batsman and praised his adaptability to adjust his game according to the situation.Jadeja, traditionally known for his finishing abilities alongside MS Dhoni, has been seen batting at number four this season, experiencing a range of performances and outcomes.""He is playing a different role (batting at number four).He has been coming in very late in the last few years. He has done a good job so far at adapting to the situation and playing accordingly,"" Hussey said ahead of their match against Sunrisers Hyderabad.""He is in a good frame of mind, hitting the ball well in the nets, and there is no concern. He played a quick innings in Lucknow, and his strength is being able to work the ball around the gaps, use his pace and run between the wickets, picking the right time to attack the right bowlers.""CSK faced consecutive defeats in their last two matches, while SRH, also on a strong streak, is coming off a loss against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.In the recent meeting against Lucknow Super Giants at Chepauk, challenging conditions prevailed due to heavy dew, contributing to CSK's first home defeat of the season.""In the last few games, the dew has been really challenging for the bowlers, taking them out of the game. But, we have always had good spinners, and the conditions here have also been friendly,"" Hussey said.“The other night, the spinners found it very difficult to hold the ball, and they couldn't get spin on it. The ball was skidding nicely onto the bat, which made it really challenging.“But again, there is no excuse it is pretty much the same for both teams, and we have to deal with it as best as we can.CSK's top-order batter Ajinkya Rahane has been dismissed for single digit scores in two of the last three games.But Hussey expressed his confidence in the 35-year-old Indian batter and said a calf niggle may have troubled him.""We are 100 per cent backing Ajinkya Rahane, he is batting really well. He just got out a couple of times early, which can happen to anyone.""He did have a niggle in his calf, which probably sent him back a little bit, but overall, we are very happy with what he has done.""Shivam Dube will again be the guy to watch out for the Yellow Brigade, having been their second-highest run-scorer of the season.Hussey said it's about giving him the freedom to play aggressively and express himself.""Our conversations have been about giving him the freedom to hit sixes and fours and dominate the bowling.""We want to give him the trust that even if he misses out, that's the way we want him to play, which has helped him as he has gained confidence,""""We don't really talk about footwork and let him be clear in his mind, as he is playing his best when he is not thinking too much.""He has got unique power and long levers. So, it's more about being nice and stable and using his long reach to clear the boundaries,"" he added.","Michael Hussey praises Ravindra Jadeja's adaptability as a No. 4 batsman.

In his first season with Feyenoord, Slot led the team to the inaugural Europa Conference League final, where they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma. The following season, he guided the club to their second league title in 24 years before signing a new three-year contract.Klopp, who will step down at the end of the current season after a successful nine-year reign that included winning the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League in 2020, praised Slot's qualities, saying, ""I like the way his team plays football . If he is the one, I like that he wants it."" He added, ""I don't know him, but some people who know him say he's a good guy. I like that a lot. So good coach, good guy. Looking forward for the club, if he is the solution, if he is the man, I'm more than happy.""Currently, Feyenoord sit second in the Eredivisie table, nine points behind leaders PSV Eindhoven. Failing to win the Dutch title would be a disappointment for Slot, similar to Klopp's frustration with Liverpool's faltering title bid. The Reds are third in the Premier League, three points behind leaders Arsenal and two points behind second-placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand. Liverpool's recent form has been poor, with defeats against Crystal Palace and Everton, as well as quarter-final exits in the FA Cup and Europa League.Initially, Bayer Leverkusen manager and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso was considered the favorite to succeed Klopp. However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title. Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool job but has reportedly held talks with West Ham about replacing David Moyes next season.Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes that Slot's attacking tactics could be an ideal fit for the Premier League club, stating, ""I think Arne Slot is perhaps one of the better Dutch coaches at this moment. I think the way of playing and the philosophy he has, that he could be a Liverpool coach.""","Liverpool and Feyenoord have reached an agreement for Arne Slot to replace Jurgen Klopp. A compensation package for the 45-year-old, who had two years remaining on his contract, has been agreed upon.

NEW DELHI: Arda Gueler 's goal secured a 1-0 victory for a heavily-rotated Real Madrid side against Real Sociedad on Friday, bringing the LaLiga leaders closer to their 36th Spanish title.With only five games left to play, Real Madrid now have 84 points, extending their lead over second-placed Barcelona to 14 points. Barcelona, who have a game in hand, will host Valencia on Monday.Carlo Ancelotti , Real Madrid's manager, made significant changes to the team that defeated Barcelona 3-2 on Sunday, resting key players such as Jude Bellingham and Toni Kroos in preparation for their upcoming Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich .Despite the changes, Ancelotti's team managed to secure the three points. ""It was clear that everyone thought we were coming here for a walk,"" Ancelotti told reporters. ""The only ones who didn't think so were the players. They had commitment and attitude. They had the desire and enthusiasm to keep winning.""Real Sociedad, currently in sixth place and vying for a Europa League spot, controlled possession throughout the match, which was played in heavy rain. They created several good opportunities, but Real Madrid goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga made crucial saves to keep them at bay.The visitors capitalized on their only chance in the first half when Gueler, a 19-year-old Turkish midfielder making his first start for Real Madrid since joining from Fenerbahce, converted Dani Carvajal's cross in the 29th minute. Three minutes later, Takefusa Kubo thought he had equalized for Real Sociedad, but the goal was disallowed after a VAR check revealed a foul in the build-up.In the second half, Real Sociedad continued to press for an equalizer, but they had another goal ruled out due to Mikel Merino being offside. Benat Turrientes also had a shot from the edge of the box saved by the impressive Arrizabalaga. Real Madrid nearly doubled their lead late in the game, but Alex Remiro made a fantastic reflex save to deny Eduardo Camavinga's close-range effort.Ancelotti praised his team's mentality, stating, ""We have a spectacular squad. They have this attitude that they feel like they have to win every game. There are four points left to clinch the LaLiga title and we are very close.""",Real Madrid extend lead over Barcelona to 14 points with 1-0 win over Real Sociedad.

The Foxes sit atop the Championship standings with 94 points and two games remaining, while Leeds remain second with 90 points and only one match left to play.Ipswich Town , currently in third place with 89 points and three games in hand, have the opportunity to overtake Leeds for the second automatic promotion spot.Leeds manager Daniel Farke acknowledged the situation, stating, ""It's not in our hands anymore (automatic promotion), we need to be honest."" However, he remained hopeful, adding, ""The race is not over, if Ipswich win the next two games then I will say congratulations but if they don't win them then we will have a lot to play for (against Southampton on the final day of the season).""Leicester achieved promotion in their first season following relegation from the Premier League last year. They face Preston on Monday before concluding their season at home against Blackburn on May 4. Leeds' fate depends on Ipswich's results against Hull on Saturday and Coventry in their game in hand on Tuesday. If Ipswich win both matches, they will secure promotion, relegating Leeds to the play-offs.Despite their impressive 5-0 victory over Southampton on Tuesday, Leicester's joy at promotion may be tempered by the Premier League's charges against them in March for alleged breaches of profit and sustainability rules during their last three years in the top flight. If found guilty, the Foxes could face a points deduction upon their return to the Premier League.QPR's well-deserved win over Leeds, with goals from Ilias Chair, Lucas Andersen, Lyndon Dykes, and Sam Field, ensured their survival in the Championship. Manager Marti Cifuentes, who took over from Gareth Ainsworth in October when the team was second from bottom, expressed his delight, saying, ""It was a fantastic evening. We worked really hard to get this type of performance."" He praised the club's resilience and unity in the face of adversity, calling their survival ""the great escape.""","Leicester City secured promotion to the Premier League on Friday following Leeds United's unexpected 4-0 loss against Queens Park Rangers.

Kerala Blasters bid goodbye to Ivan Vukomanovic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/kerala-blasters-bid-goodbye-to-ivan-vukomanovic/articleshow/109632750.cms,"KOCHI: Less than a month after he stated that he had no intention of leaving the club, head coach Ivan Vukomanovic and Kerala Blasters decided to part ways on Friday. The club management announced the decision through a statement, adding that the search for a new coach has begun.""Coach Ivan Vukomanovic’s influence on the team's development over the past three years has been truly invaluable.Working alongside him has been both a privilege and a pleasure. I’m immensely grateful for his contributions to Kerala Blasters FC, and I wish him all the best in all his future pursuits,"" said Blasters’ sporting director Karolis Skinkys.The Serbian was appointed as the head coach by the Blasters before the 2021-22 season. He quickly became a fan favorite at the club and was popularly known as ‘Aashan’. Under Vukomanovic, the Blasters qualified for the ISL playoffs for three successive years, including runners-up finish in his maiden season, but couldn’t guide his side to the title even once.However, his tenure at the club was not free of controversies. The biggest row came after he walked off with his players in the ISL playoff against Bengaluru FC, protesting against a refereeing decision last season. The AIFF disciplinary committee imposed Rs 4 crore fine on the club and handed Vukomanovic a 10-game ban and a Rs 5 lakh fine. Last month, the Blasters lost their appeal against the fine that they had filed at CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport).Indications are that the club management and the coach were never on the same page after the walkout row. However, the Blasters’ management decided to persist with the 46-year-old as he had moulded the team into a cohesive unit. But with Blasters getting knocked out yet again in the playoffs this season at the hands of Odisha FC, the management felt that the time was ripe to look for a new coach, who could end their trophy drought.“This has been a difficult decision for us. I have had a trusting, open, and friendly relationship with Ivan from day one. While the change is difficult, we feel it is the right time to make the next step. I am very grateful to Ivan for what he has done for KBFC, the stability he brought, and the wonderful foundation he has set for the club’s future. He is and will always remain a dear friend and an integral member of our Blasters family. I wish him all the best in his future endeavours,” said club director Nikhil B Nimmagadda.Vukomanovic, who was the first manager to get a contract extension from the Blasters in a decade since its existence, is also the ninth head coach to be sacked by the club. Indications are that the Serbian is actively engaged in talks with a foreign club, which is willing to hire him soon.",Ivan Vukomanovic and Kerala Blasters have parted ways.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool 's Premier League title aspirations were dealt a severe blow as they suffered a 2-0 loss to their Merseyside rivals Everton , while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a hard-fought 4-2 victory over bottom-placed Sheffield United on Wednesday.Everton took the lead in the 27th minute through Jarrad Branthwaite, who prodded the ball past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker via the post following a poorly cleared free-kick.Despite Mohamed Salah 's efforts, Liverpool failed to equalize, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin sealed the win for Everton with a header in the 58th minute."" Arsenal and Manchester City must have a very bad moment. I don't know. I can only apologise for today to the people. We should have done better but we didn't,"" Klopp said when asked if Liverpool can win the title.At Old Trafford, Manchester United found themselves trailing twice to Sheffield United before Bruno Fernandes came to the rescue in the second half.Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton Diaz scored for the visitors, while Harry Maguire equalized for United before half-time. Fernandes levelled the score from the penalty spot and then put United ahead with a long-range strike in the 81st minute. Rasmus Hojlund added a fourth goal to secure the much-needed victory for Ten Hag's side.Referee Stuart Attwell found himself at the centre of controversy once again, disallowing a Wolves goal in their 1-0 defeat to Bournemouth at Molineux.Attwell ruled that Matheus Cunha had fouled Justin Kluivert off the ball in the build-up to Hwang Hee-chan's equalizer.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona 's head coach Xavi has decided to remain in his position, despite previously announcing his intention to leave at the end of the season due to the challenging nature of the job.The Spanish club confirmed this news on Wednesday, following reports of meetings between Xavi, club president Joan Laporta, and sporting director Deco.The decision comes amidst a difficult period for Barcelona, who were recently eliminated from the Champions League by Paris Saint-Germain and fell 11 points behind Real Madrid in the La Liga title race after a 3-2 Clasico defeat.Xavi had expressed feeling ""liberated"" when he initially decided to step down, citing the immense pressure and lack of appreciation for his work. He had mentioned that other coaches, such as Pep Guardiola, Ernesto Valverde, and Luis Enrique , had also experienced similar struggles.Barcelona appointed Xavi as their manager in November 2021, and he helped the club win the league title last season. However, this season has been more challenging, with the team suffering a 4-1 defeat to Real in the Spanish Super Cup and being eliminated from the Copa del Rey by Athletic Bilbao. Financial issues have also plagued the club in recent years.Following Xavi's initial announcement to leave, there was a lack of experienced coaches linked to the job, with onlyRafael Marquez , the current Barcelona B team manager, being considered a serious contender.Despite the team's inconsistent performance this season, there are promising signs for the future, with the emergence of young talents such as Lamine Yamal , Pau Cubarsi, and Fermin Lopez.",Xavi had previously announced his intention to leave the club at the end of the season.

Juventus, who have won the competition a record 14 times, advanced despite a 2-1 loss to Lazio in their second leg, progressing with a 3-2 aggregate score.Atalanta, fresh off their Europa League quarter-final elimination of Liverpool , reached their sixth Italian Cup final, with their only previous trophy coming in the 1962-63 season. Fiorentina had taken a 1-0 lead in the first leg at home, thanks to a strike from Rolando Mandragora.However, Atalanta wasted no time in levelling the tie, with Teun Koopmeiners scoring in the eighth minute. Gianluca Scamacca thought he had doubled the lead shortly after, but his goal was disallowed for a foul in the buildup. Atalanta continued to threaten, with Koopmeiners and Charles De Ketelaere both coming close before the break.Fiorentina's task became even more challenging when Nikola Milenkovic was sent off early in the second half for fouling Scamacca just outside the box. Despite being down to ten men, Fiorentina managed to equalise through Lucas Martinez Quarta's header from a free kick.However, Scamacca restored Atalanta's lead with a stunning scissor kick in the 75th minute. Ademola Lookman, who came on as a substitute, added a third goal in stoppage time, which was initially ruled out for offside but later awarded after a VAR review. Mario Pasalic sealed the victory just before the final whistle, securing Atalanta's place in the final against Juventus.","Atalanta beat Fiorentina 4-1 in the second leg of their semi-final clash on Wednesday.

Liverpool, who have played one fewer match than Arsenal, face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.""We have made our people very proud, it is a big derby for us and I know what it means,"" said Arteta.The Arsenal manager acknowledged his team's strong start but noted their failure to convert all their chances and some sloppiness in certain areas. However, he praised their second-half performance, citing improved discipline and ruthless finishing.Chelsea suffered a significant setback before the match even began, as their key player Cole Palmer was ruled out due to illness. Palmer has been involved in nearly half of Chelsea's Premier League goals this season, and his absence was keenly felt by the visitors.Despite an unbeaten run of eight league games prior to their FA Cup semi-final loss to Manchester City, Chelsea were outclassed by an Arsenal side eager to reassert their title credentials following a home defeat to Aston Villa.Mauricio Pochettino expressed his disappointment with the result and his team's performance, stating, ""Today we didn't compete against a team fighting for the Premier League. We need to be aware we need to compete in a different way.""Arsenal started the match with incredible intensity, taking the lead within five minutes through Trossard, who has proven to be a more effective signing than Chelsea's January acquisition of Mykhailo Mudryk. Chelsea goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic made several impressive saves to keep his team in the game before halftime, but Arsenal's relentless pressure eventually paid off.White's curling effort from a corner doubled Arsenal's lead early in the second half, and Havertz, who has found consistent form under Arteta, scored twice to put the game out of reach. White's attempted cross, which flew into the top corner, capped off a night to forget for Chelsea, who remained in ninth place, three points behind the European qualification spots.Arsenal's next challenge is a daunting away fixture against Tottenham in the north London derby on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Amelie Mauresmo , the tournament director of Roland Garros , indicated on Thursday that former world number one Rafael Nadal is unlikely to receive a seed at the upcoming French Open next month.Nadal himself expressed uncertainty on Wednesday regarding his participation in this year's tournament, despite his remarkable record of winning the French Open a record 14 times.At 37 years old, Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, has seen a significant drop in his ranking, currently standing at 512, following an extended absence due to a hip flexor injury that kept him sidelined for almost a year.Although he has secured a place in the main draw of the French Open via his protected ranking, this ranking does not guarantee seeding, as seeding is determined by the top 32 ranked players.Without a seed, Nadal could potentially face formidable opponents in the early stages of the tournament.Traditionally, Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam event that did not strictly adhere to the ATP and WTA rankings, instead considering a player's past performances on grass courts when determining seeding. However, this approach faced criticism from players, including Nadal, leading to its abandonment in 2020.Asked about Nadal being seeded at this year's French Open, Mauresmo told reporters: ""Right now it's not a topic...""Wimbledon did it for a very, very, very long time, and it certainly brought some advantages but we also saw all the disadvantages it could bring. For the moment, it's not on the table.""We're keeping our fingers crossed for him above all, for us too obviously. We're keeping a close eye on what's happening for him on court.

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal declared on Wednesday that he'll only participate in the upcoming French Open if he feels ""capable enough to compete well.""The 14-time Roland Garros champion acknowledged that if the event commenced today, he wouldn't be ready to take part. However, he pledged to persevere in his efforts to secure the opportunity to play at his most triumphant tournament for one final time.""I don't know what's going to happen in the next three weeks.I will keep fighting and doing the things I believe I have to do so I can try to play in Paris, and if I can play, I play, if I can't, I can't,"" the former world number one told reporters at the Madrid Open on Wednesday.""I will not play in Paris if I am the way I am now. If Paris were today, I wouldn't take to the court. That's the reality. I will only play in Paris if I feel capable enough to compete well.""Nadal made his tennis comeback in Brisbane in January after nearly a year of sidelined recovery from a psoas injury. However, his return was cut short due to a muscle issue sustained in Australia, limiting him to just five matches this season.Last week, he began his clay campaign in Barcelona, exiting in the second round. Now, he is poised to take on 16-year-old American Darwin Blanch in his Madrid opener on Thursday.""I don't think I'm ready to play at my 100 percent but I'm prepared to go out and play tomorrow. It's important for me to play one last time here in Madrid, for me it means a lot,"" said the 37-year-old Nadal.As he attempts to resume his 'Last Dance' in Madrid and say goodbye to one of his favourite tournaments on court, rather than on the sidelines, the 22-time major champion admits his farewell tour hasn't been as enjoyable as he would have hoped.""A few weeks ago, I didn't know if I will be able to play again on the professional tour, so today I am playing,"" he added.""It's not perfect, of course not perfect, but at least I am playing and I can enjoy again, especially in the few tournaments that are so emotional for me. I'm able to enjoy the fact that I can say probably good-bye on court.""Nadal says he's hitting the ball well when he is able to be on court but ""it's about more body limitations. I went through a lot of things last year and a half, two years"".""So body feelings are not enough good to feel myself playing with freedom enough in terms of body issues. That's not allowing me to compete the way that I would like to compete.""","Rafael Nadal says he'll only participate in the upcoming French Open if he feels ""capable enough to compete well"" The 14-time Roland Garros champion acknowledged that if the event commenced today, he wouldn't be ready to take part. Nadal made his tennis comeback in January after nearly a year of sidelined recovery from a psoas injury.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109568476,imgsize-61176,width-400,resizemode-4/109568476.jpg"
I'm enjoying being on the tennis court: Sumit Nagal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/im-enjoying-being-on-the-tennis-court-sumit-nagal/articleshow/109560007.cms,"Nagal's mid-season training block is about building on the gains of the last four months

BENGALURU: Sumit Nagal 's latest hairdo is short fade. It's as sharp as his tennis game.The India No.1, who climbed to a career-high 80 in the world on Monday last, took care of the style element on his arrival in Delhi. Nagal, who spent a few days with family and friends while getting his visa sorted, heads back to Europe this week to kick-off a three-week training block at the Nensel academy in Peine, Germany, before returning to his beloved clay courts.The timing of Nagal's training block - when the clay court swing is in full blast in Europe - raised injury worries.The 26-year-old brushed aside concerns with an insouciant shrug, insisting it's a good time for a training block. Nagal explained that he has played from March to March, including in the off-season in December. Ranked 138 at the time, Nagal played the Tennis Premier League , hoping the money would give him the financial freedom to schedule his 2024 season.Nagal will look at his net game and serve, which he noted has been on and off in the last weeks, besides build on his fitness in his time away from the Tour.The Indian is aiming to get a tournament in, perhaps in Lyon, before arriving at Roland Garros.Nagal has enjoyed an inspirational run in the first four months of the year, climbing almost 60 rungs in the ranking, especially coming into his own on clay.Nagal describes his relationship with clay in one word 'smooth', like a sharp cup of espresso. It awakens the competitor in him.""The more time I have, the better I am at chasing down the ball,"" he told TOI.Nagal learnt his tennis on the clay courts of Paschim Vihar in West Delhi as an eight-year-old.""It was probably fast,"" he said of those courts. ""I don't think we have slow clay courts in India. Clay courts are different everywhere, the clay courts in France are very different to Germany, Germany and Austria are similar, they are heavy, wet. France is a little bit hard and fast. Italy has a mix of both, but more on the faster side.""While the tennis world has played on the Nadal, Nagal surname, the Indian gave the legendary Spaniard a verbal salute.""What Rafa has done on clay is just insane,"" he said. ""His game is ridiculous, he moves incredibly, you just cannot hit past him and with that forehand jumping over your head for three or four hours… It's crazy.""The career he has followed with great personal interest, however, is that of the 25-year-old world No.6 Casper Ruud .""I've learnt a lot from watching Ruud,"" Nagal said. ""I have seen him from his junior days, playing under-14, under-16. The way he has developed his game, is very good.''""I feel like I can play a similar game to him. Serve smart, use a big forehand and have a solid backhand. And use the backhand smartly to get the ball to your forehand side. He has been playing at that level for a long time and I think that's the next step for me, to keep playing at this level, keep playing the ATP Tour level .""Nagal isn't surprised with his form of the first four months of the year, where he scored two top-50 wins and took a set off the world No.7 Holger Rune in Monte Carlo.""I know I can play top-50 tennis and keep improving,"" he said. ""When you lose there are a lot of things you feel you could've done better, but I don't think I lost a match (in the last few months) because of energy or focus. I have matured as a competitor.""The Indian is in a whole different headspace these days. ""I am enjoying being on the tennis court ,"" he said. ""I'm enjoying playing matches, enjoying fighting.""","India No.1 Sumit Nagal heads back to Europe this week for a three-week training block. The 26-year-old will train at the Nensel academy in Peine, Germany, before returning to his beloved clay courts.

That's obviously what I work towards, to try and get better and to win tournaments. So, nice to win my second Tour title, almost 10 or 11 months from now (after the first), and to do it on different surfaces, very very happy with that,"" Bhambri said following his victory in the company of French Albano Olivetti on Sunday.The pair defeated the German wildcard combination of Andreas Mies, a two-time doubles Grand Slam winner, and Jan-Lennard Struff, a four-time titleist, 7-6, 7-6.""I hope me and Albano can continue improving and continue getting better with more clay court events and the French Open coming up.""Coach Balachandran Manikkath, who has been working with Bhambri as part of the ""Doubles Dream of India"" programme, provided some insights on the adjustments the Delhi lad has made in his game for the slowest of the three surfaces.""Yuki has been working on playing on clay since Marrakech (ATP 250 event in Morocco). It is obviously different from hard and certain adjustments have to be made with serves, returns, volleys, smash, etc,"" Balachandran said.""He has done a tremendous job as the results show this week. On slow, wet clay courts he is able to hold serve comfortably and his returns are good, volleying is solid.""This win with Olivetti will help confidence on both sides. They are already fixed to play the clay season all the way up to French (Open). So nothing changes there except that both are moving up the rankings.""Bhambri's ranking rose a career-high 54 on Monday while Olivetti moved up to a personal best 45.The rankings at the end of the French Open will determine the entries for the tennis competition at the Olympics , which will be held at the Roland Garros as well.Doubles star Rohan Bopanna is sitting pretty well at World No. 2 at the moment, which gives him a direct entry and a partner of his choice subject to the latter's ranking being in the top-300 – in either singles or doubles.""Olympics is not in my control. The selection committee or the AITA decides the team, so I'm focused on trying to improve my ranking, improve my game and just continue on the Tour,"" Bhambri said.""Whether I like to play the Olympics, I absolutely would. It's every Indian's dream to represent the country and I'm no different. The Olympics is the biggest stage but, again, this is not in my hands.""Returning to what is in his control, Bhambri said the Munich triumph would not change his preference for hard.""Hardcourt is always going to be my preference. Just for the sole purpose that it requires less adjustment for me because I've played on it all my life,"" he said.""So, no matter how many titles I am gonna win on clay or grass, hardcourt is going to be the preference.""It (doubles) is a bit different compared to singles. Doubles is less movement, which makes it a bit easier but there's still technical aspects of doubles, which in general doesn't involve so much side to side movement.""There is a lot of serving and volleying, and returning fast points. So you have to be good at that, regardless of any surface if you want to succeed in doubles.""Given the necessities of the modern game where entries into big tournaments breaks and makes partnerships, Bhambri, who decided to focus on doubles only two seasons back, has become adept at playing on both sides of the court.""Yuki plays ad court with Olivetti. He played deuce with Robin Hasse in Dubai and reached semis. In Madrid last week he played deuce with Arel Behar too,"" Balachandran said.""Now he is comfortable playing on either side. Just that he has played more on ad court, and people recognise him as an ad court player. That will change soon as he plays on either side with different partners.""Known for avoiding late hours, playing on the Tour has also brought a bit of change to Bhambri's personal side.""Well, I've been part of the Tour for a long time now. So I know most of them. Of course, I miss partying with with Roger (Federer) and Rafa (Nadal), enjoying nights out with them. Since they are not much around on the Tour, it's not the same,"" he said.""Maybe the next generation I can hang out with more, stay out late and socialize with them more – the Alcaraz's and the Kyrgios's of the tour.""",Yuki Bhambri won his second Tour title with a win at the BMW Open in Munich. The 31-year-old has won his first two titles on the doubles Tour on grass and clay.

NEW DELHI: Casper Ruud 's triumph at the Barcelona Open final against Stefanos Tsitsipas marked a significant milestone in his career. After suffering a defeat at the hands of the Greek player in the Monte Carlo Masters final just a week prior, Ruud exacted his revenge by claiming his biggest career title to date.The Norwegian secured a straight-sets victory, winning 7-5, 6-3, and converting three of the six break points he earned.This victory not only ended Tsitsipas' impressive 10-match winning streak on clay but also marked Ruud's first title of the season, following three previous final losses.Ruud's elation was palpable as he expressed his joy at winning on the ""Rafa Nadal Court,"" a court named after his childhood idol. The significance of this triumph was amplified by the fact that Ruud had visited the tournament as a 13-year-old spectator, admiring the likes of Nadal and others.With his sights set on the upcoming French Open , where he finished as the runner-up in 2022, Ruud's victory in Barcelona serves as a confidence booster. The 25-year-old Norwegian has now amassed 11 career titles, with 10 of them coming on clay courts, solidifying his prowess on the surface.For Tsitsipas, the loss marked his third consecutive Barcelona final defeat, having previously fallen short in 2018, 2021, and now in 2023. Despite his impressive 10-0 record on clay this season and his pursuit of a 12th career title, the Greek player was unable to overcome Ruud's determination.Ruud's triumph in Barcelona not only provided him with his biggest career title to date but also served as a testament to his resilience and ability to bounce back from setbacks.","Casper Ruud beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-3 in the Barcelona Open final.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one and two-time Grand Slam champion Garbine Muguruza announced her retirement from tennis on Saturday, following a hiatus of over a year without competing.Speaking at a press conference during the Laureus Awards, the 30-year-old reflected on her illustrious career, stating, ""The time has come to say goodbye. It has been a long and beautiful journey, but I feel that the moment to retire has arrived.""Muguruza's decision marks the end of a remarkable tenure in professional tennis, during which she achieved significant milestones and left an indelible mark on the sport.""It's a decision that I've been taking little by little.""Muguruza's last official match was at the Lyon Open in January 2023, marking her temporary departure from the sport. Following this event, she refrained from competing, leading to her eventual retirement announcement.""When I stopped competing, I returned home and I welcomed the break with open arms,"" said Muguruza who ends her career with 10 singles titles.""Every day that went by I felt better and I didn't miss the discipline and the difficulty of the life I had before, so it has been a progressive thing.""Muguruza's WTA main-draw debut occurred in 2012, marking the beginning of her professional journey. Her breakthrough on the Grand Slam stage came in 2015 when she reached her first final at Wimbledon , where she faced Serena Williams but was unable to clinch the title.However, she swiftly bounced back, securing her maiden Grand Slam victory at the French Open in 2016 by defeating Serena Williams. The following year, Muguruza continued her success by triumphing over Venus Williams to claim the Wimbledon title.These victories solidified her place in tennis history, as her French Open win made her the first Spanish woman to win a Grand Slam since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998, while her Wimbledon triumph made her the first Spanish female champion at the All England Club since Conchita Martinez in 1994.Martinez's influence played a significant role in Muguruza's success, as she coached her to the Wimbledon title.

The girls have had the opportunity to get a lot of points, and we had organised a camp in China.""And they were all playing well. Ankita had just won a tournament (in doubles) in Japan just the week before.""Dhupar, however, brushed aside the questionable team combinations fielded by the captain and the coach.After entering Sahaja Yamalapalli in singles and pairing Rutuja Bhosale with Prarthana Thombare against the strong Chinese team, the team's think-tank opted to put Rutuja in singles and hand Ankita the additional duty of doubles for the remaining three ties.It proved to be disastrous as it left Ankita with little time to recover with only a 30-minute gap between second singles and the decisive doubles matches. Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective. ""If I were the coach or the captain, and if I find my No. 1 player not performing, I would put my No. 3 or any other player in,"" Bal, a former Davis Cup player, said.""Try something different, think out of the box. It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players.
