Reserves:

NEW DELHI: Former cricketer Mohammad Kaif has lauded the Indian cricket team 's composition for the upcoming T20 World Cup made by chief selector Ajit Agarkar and his team. Kaif's remarks came following the announcement of the provisional squad, which witnessed the inclusion of some promising talents and the omission of a few established names.""Isse achchi team Ajit Agarkar nahi bana sakte the [Ajit Agarkar could not have made a better team than this],"" declared Kaif, emphasizing his confidence in the squad's strength and balance.He particularly highlighted the assortment of bowlers, noting the presence of four fast bowlers and four spinners, creating a formidable bowling unit.""A very strong team has been selected. It is very balanced - 4 fast bowlers, 4 spinners. Among the 8 bowlers there are three all-rounders - Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya . There is also Shivam Dube who bowls, but I am not mentioning his name,"" Kaif said on Star Sports.Kaif's analysis delved into the batting order, spotlighting the opening pair of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma. ""Jaiswal always gives a start, plays aggressive cricket. You will play day matches in the US and West Indies, there will be no dew factor there, you have to attack in the powerplay, play agressively. Jaiswal always play aggressive cricket, Rohit Sharma also gives aggressive start,"" he remarked, underlining the necessity of assertive batting, especially in matches without the dew factor.Addressing the middle order, Kaif deliberated on the choice between Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson, leaning towards Samson due to his impressive record in West Indies conditions. He also commended the selection of all-rounders Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, and Hardik Pandya for their versatility and ability to float in the batting order.Furthermore, Kaif applauded the inclusion of Shivam Dube over Rinku Singh, citing Dube's capability to contribute with both bat and ball. ""You can also give an over or two to Dube, so they have taken him, it's a good choice,"" he remarked, highlighting the strategic aspect of Dube's inclusion.Kaif reiterated his confidence in the squad's potential and expressed satisfaction with Agarkar's selections. His endorsement adds weight to the anticipation surrounding India's campaign in the T20 World Cup, scheduled to commence in June.Rohit Sharma (Captain), Hardik Pandya (Vice Captain), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli , Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (WK), Sanju Samson (WK), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

"Sanju Samson: T20 World Cup: Forever padded up, door opens for Sanju Samson",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-forever-padded-up-door-opens-for-sanju-samson/articleshow/109743192.cms,"Rajasthan Royals' captain Sanju Samson gestures after his team's win against Lucknow Super Giants. (AFP Photo)

KOCHI: Just like his batting, Sanju Samson 's name always creates a buzz on social media. His talent has never been in doubt ever since he announced his arrival before the cricketing world with his exploits in the IPL and the Champions League T20 in 2013, as former players rave about his strokeplay.However, after making his international debut in a T20 international in Harare back in 2015, critics have always questioned the Kerala wicketkeeper-batsman 's inconsistency.This has meant that the 29-year-old has only managed to play 25 T20Is and 16 ODIs in the last eight years.However, this IPL season has been different for Samson for more reasons than one. The Rajasthan Royals skipper has led his side with aplomb, which sees his team sitting at the top of the IPL points table with 16 points from nine games.But more importantly, this has been Samson's most consistent run in the IPL, with a match-winning unbeaten 33-ball 71 in Royals’ last game against Lucknow Super Giants being one of the high points of his career. He has amassed 385 runs from nine games at an average of 77 and a strike rate of 161.08 and is placed sixth in the run-scorer's chart in this IPL.Batting at no.3, Samson has been the glue in a star-studded Royals’ batting lineup and has switched his roles as an anchor and aggressor easily.But this change in Samson's batting hasn't come overnight.""For the last eight months, Sanju has trained specifically keeping the T20 World Cup in mind. He knew performance in the IPL just before the World Cup would be crucial. Our focus was more on his mental make-up before he went out to bat and while he was at the crease. He started focusing on the process. This change has reflected in his batting,"" says Bijumon N, who has been Samson's personal coach for the past year.""We did some minor alterations to his batting technique. If you notice now, his bat swing has changed and it is more free flowing,"" he added.Throughout his career, Samson was always at ease against pace bowlers but found himself susceptible to spinners. But as is evident in this IPL, there has been a marked improvement in that facet of his game.""I don’t agree with the assumption that Sanju is not good at tackling spinners. But against the real slow bowlers, at times he has found it difficult. To counter that, he has started to use his feet more now. On the tactical front, he has added a couple more strokes to his armoury against the spinners and has started playing each ball on its merit,"" revealed Bijumon.Bijumon travelled with Samson wherever Kerala played domestic cricket in the last season, and their training sessions always revolved around the bigger goal in mind.""During our training sessions in Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram, and Bengaluru, we did a lot of match simulations keeping in mind the IPL and the T20 World Cup. Even now, we keep talking over the phone after Rajasthan's each match and discuss the scope for improvement in his game,"" he said.However, the composition of the Indian team bound for the US means that Rishabh Pant will, in all probability, be the first-choice keeper of the team management. Having pipped the other contenders for the second wicketkeeper's slot, Samson's chance to make it to the playing XI is only likely to arise if Pant's form dips or if one of the top-order batters has a wretched run.There is a popular joke in Kerala cricket circles that India will only win World Cups if a Malayali is in the squad. Sunil Valson, a Kerala native, who played for Delhi in domestic cricket, was part of Kapil's 1983 World Cup-winning squad while S Sreesanth was in the Indian team that lifted the 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup. Will Samson prove to be Team India’s lucky charm in the US and the Caribbean?",Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson has led his side with aplomb. Samson has amassed 385 runs from nine games at an average of 77. The 29-year-old has only managed to play 25 T20Is and 16 ODIs in the last eight years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109743215,imgsize-43488,width-400,resizemode-4/109743215.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Marcus Stoinis played a steady innings, scoring a composed fifty, to support the exceptional performance of the bowlers as the Lucknow Super Giants secured a tense four-wicket victory over the Mumbai Indians in the IPL on Tuesday, thereby bolstering their chances of securing a play-off spot.The Mumbai Indians' top order struggled, managing only a below-par total of 144 for seven, with contributions from Nehal Wadhera (46), Ishan Kishan (32), and Tim David (35 not out).In response, Stoinis scored 62 off 45 balls, including seven boundaries and two sixes. Despite his departure, LSG faced some nervous moments but managed to seal the win with four balls remaining.With their sixth win in 10 games, LSG moved up to third place in the IPL standings, while MI dropped to their seventh loss in 10 games.LSG made a watchful start to their chase after Nuwan Thushara struck with his fourth ball to remove impact sub Arshin Kulkarni for a duck on his IPL debut.Stoinis cracked two back-to-back boundaries off Gerald Coetzee, who ended up conceding 15 in his first over. K L Rahul (28 off 22) too joined the party, slamming three fours and a six to take 20 runs off Thushara.Stoinis then whacked Bumrah over longoff as LSG reached 52 in the powerplay.Mohammed Nabi held on to a skier at the boundary line as Hardik Pandya produced a breakthrough, removing Rahul.Stoinis, however, kept going strong as he and Deepak Hooda (18) added another 40 runs off 35 balls to take LSG close to 100.Hooda was then removed by Hardik but Stoinis reached his fifty off 39 balls in the 14th over and then dispatched Mohammed Nabi for a four and a six.Coetzee bowled Ashton Turner, while Ayush Badoni was run out to give hopes to MI before Nicholas Pooran (14 not out) knocked off the remaining runs.Earlier, MI dug in a big hole for themselves by losing four wickets in the powerplay. The visitors just couldn't recover from the hiccup despite a 53-run fifth-wicket stand between Wadhera and Kishan.Tim David hit a few shots in the end, including a 17-run last over, to give the total some semblance of respectability.MI's top-order misfired as the visitors managed just 28 for four in the first six overs, the second-lowest powerplay score of this IPL.While Rohit Sharma (4) was sent back by left arm pacer Mohin Khan, Stoinis induced a fine edge with a slow ball to get rid of Suryakumar Yadav (10).MI slipped into further trouble when Ravi Bishnoi's direct throw found in-form Tilak Varma short of the crease.Skipper Hardik then was out for a golden duck after poking at an away going delivery from Naveen Ul Haq, as MI slumped to 27 for four in 5.2 overs.LSG used Stoinis well in the powerplay as his spell of three overs with the new ball yielded a wicket for 19.Returning from injury, pace sensation Mayank Yadav could have had a wicket but Turner dropped Ishan Kishan (32) at deep square leg.Kishan and Nehal Wadhera tried to steady the ship with their fifth wicket stand but LSG bowlers didn't give much away as MI reached 68 for four in 12 overs.With seven overs remaining, Kishan tried to up the ante only to fall for a Bishnoi googly. Wadhera, however, smashed Mayank for two sixes and a four as 16 runs came off the 15th over.Mohammed Nabi then dragged one on to the stumps off Mayank, who left the field immediately, raising concerns of injury.","Lucknow Super Giants beat Mumbai Indians by four wickets in IPL.

Since then, he has redefined the art of opening batting, amassing over 10,000 runs in ODIs with a staggering average of 49.12, including a monumental 264 – the highest individual score in ODI history.Not content with excelling in white-ball cricket, Rohit has also left an indelible mark in the longest format of the game. With over 4,000 runs in Test cricket at an average of 45.46, he has cemented his place as a dependable opener, capable of withstanding the toughest bowling attacks.Rohit's leadership prowess has been on full display, particularly in the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he has led the Mumbai Indians to a record-breaking five titles. His astute captaincy and ability to inspire his teammates have made him a revered figure in the world of T20 cricket.The 2023 ODI World Cup served as another chapter in Rohit's storied career, where he finished as the tournament's second-highest run-scorer, showcasing his mettle on the grandest stage of them all.As Rohit continues to mesmerize cricketing aficionados with his elegant strokeplay and calm demeanor, his legacy as one of the game's true icons only continues to grow.

NEW DELHI: The national selection committee, headed by Ajit Agarkar, will convene in Ahmedabad on Tuesday to meet with BCCI secretary Jay Shah. The purpose of this meeting is to finalize the 15-member squad for the ICC T20 World Cup in the Americas, although the official announcement may be delayed by a day.Shah, who also serves as the convenor of the senior selection committee (men), has prior political commitments that are keeping him occupied.Therefore, the selection meeting will be held in Ahmedabad to accommodate his schedule.Key discussion points during the meeting will include deciding on the second wicketkeeper's slot and assessing the inclusion of all-rounder Hardik Pandya in the squad.It's understood that KL Rahul , with an IPL strike rate of 144 and 378 runs in the tournament so far, and Sanju Samson , who has scored 385 runs at a striking rate of 161, are vying for the second wicketkeeper's position.Despite Samson's impressive performances for Rajasthan Royals as their captain this season, marking the first time in over a decade he's shown such consistent form for his IPL team, his batting at No. 3 isn't likely to secure him a spot on the Indian team.Another school of thought is that someone like Samson, who has 25 T20Is under his belt but an average of just 20 and a strike rate of around 135, should not be considered based on just one good IPL season.In case of Rahul, it can be said that one senior member of the coaching staff will certainly go all out to push for his inclusion but many believe that the stylish right-handed batter's approach in T20 cricket remains archaic.However, he is still considered a better bet than Samson at No. 5 or 6 on slowish Caribbean tracks.The other option, Jitesh Sharma, is in very poor form, while Dhruv Jurel hasn't got a chance to keep wickets. During the last game in Lucknow, he did get an opportunity to bat long and scored a fifty.Left-handed batter Tilak Varma, who is also a handy off-spinner, remains an option along with pacer Sandeep Sharma, the Punjab veteran whose slower variations at the death have played a big role in Rajasthan Royals' surge to the top of the IPL table.","The national selection committee, headed by Ajit Agarkar, will convene in Ahmedabad on Tuesday to meet with BCCI secretary Jay Shah.

Hardik Pandya 's elevation to the Mumbai Indians captaincy has not gone down too well with the loyal fans of the five-time champions as he replaced the highly successful Rohit Sharma , a bonafide India legend and also the all-format national team captain.While some of the booing and hooting at the Wankhede has been toxic and unnecessary, the skipper has not done too much on the field to change the perceptions about him off it.Not bowling Jasprit Bumrah straight up, changing the playing XI repeatedly, changing his own batting slot constantly, he has shown all signs of a confused and a stressed leader. What's worse, it doesn't seem as if he has the dressing room pulling in one direction.What many felt was needless after the team's 10-run loss to Delhi Capitals was his criticism of Tilak Varma , the team's top run scorer with 63 off 32 balls, saying his lack of intent against Axar Patel cost MI the game.""Axar bowling to a left-hander (read Tilak), the better option could have been to go after him,"" Hardik told the official broadcasters after the game. ""I think it was just a little game awareness that we missed out. At the end of the day, that cost us the game.""Really? Let's analyse. Axar Patel bowled six balls to the promising left-hander off which he scored 14 runs. He had bowled to Tilak when MI had scored 72 for 3. Hardik was batting with Axar in the middle as MI had lost the wicket ofSuryakumar Yadav with the team score at 65.Tilak scored four off four balls off Axar in an attempt to momentarily consolidate till Hardik got his eye in. Once the partnership was set, he hit Axar for a six and a four prompting DC skipper Rishabh Pant to take him out of the attack.Moreover, if Hardik wanted Tilak to attack, wasn't he the best man to tell him as he was in the middle?If the skipper really wants to look at the reasons for MI's loss on Saturday, may be a closer look at his bowling figures 2-0-41-0 and the decision in sending an in-form Tim David out to bat at No. 7 on a small ground, may provide those.Picking on a youngster scouted and groomed by the franchise and an ex-skipper's favourite, won't help.",Hardik Pandya's elevation to the Mumbai Indians captaincy has not gone down too well with the loyal fans of the five-time champions.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) head coach Justin Langer expressed his belief that the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) carries a World Cup-like intensity due to the competitiveness of the tournament.This sentiment arose following LSG's hard-fought four-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.LSG secured their sixth win of the season, propelled by Marcus Stoinis 's explosive 62-run innings, which played a pivotal role in their success on home turf.With this crucial victory, LSG climbed to the third spot in the IPL standings, accumulating 12 points.

It's a bit like a World Cup . There's no easy games, every point is crucial. We see how tight it is on the table. For us to take those points tonight, really valuable.

He amassed 474 runs in 14 matches, showcasing an impressive strike rate of 149.53 and a remarkable batting average of 59.25.However, in the current season, Rinku has encountered difficulties in replicating his success with the bat. Despite maintaining a high strike rate, he has struggled to accumulate runs consistently. In nine matches played so far, the left-handed batter has scored 123 runs at an average of 20.50.In India's quest for World Cup glory, Rohit Sharma has been appointed as the captain of the team for the upcoming showpiece tournament, withHardik Pandya serving as his deputy.The squad features two wicket-keepers, Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson, both of whom bring their own strengths to the team. Additionally, star batter Virat Kohli , who has been in formidable form during the ongoing IPL 2024, has also been included in the squad.Pant is set to make a comeback to the Indian team after a hiatus of around 16 months, following a car crash on the Delhi-Dehradun highway in Uttarakhand in 2022. India has opted to include four spinners in their squad, comprising Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, and Yuzvendra Chahal.The team will rely on a potent pace attack spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah , with Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj providing additional firepower.India will kick off their World Cup campaign against Ireland on June 5, 2024, at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. This will be followed by a highly anticipated clash against arch-rivals Pakistan on June 9, 2024, at the same venue.Subsequently, India will face off against USA and Canada on June 12 and 15, respectively. Placed in Group A of the tournament alongside Pakistan, Ireland, Canada, and co-hosts USA, India is gearing up for an intense and competitive series of matches.Their inaugural match against Ireland promises to set the tone for what is sure to be an exhilarating tournament, culminating in the much-awaited showdown against Pakistan.","Harbhajan Singh believes Rinku Singh should have been included in India's T20 World Cup squad.

NEW DELHI: The United States and Mexico have withdrawn their joint bid to host the 2027 Women's World Cup , just weeks before FIFA is set to vote on the tournament's host at a meeting in Bangkok.The two countries' football federations announced in a joint statement that they will now focus on submitting a successful bid for the 2031 tournament.This unexpected decision comes as FIFA officials prepare to hold an open vote at the FIFA Congress in Bangkok on May 17 to determine the 2027 hosts.With the US-Mexico bid withdrawn, two contenders remain: a joint bid from Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and a solo bid from Brazil.The United States had been aiming to host the women's football flagship event for the third time, having successfully hosted the tournament on its own in 1999 and 2003.However, the withdrawal of the US-Mexico bid for 2027 comes amidst a crowded calendar of large-scale sporting events in North America. The region is already preparing to host the men's 2026 World Cup , the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in 2024, and this year's 16-team Copa America.According to US Soccer, postponing their bid until 2031 will provide tournament organizers with more time to plan and incorporate lessons learned from the region's hosting of the 2026 men's World Cup. ""Hosting a World Cup tournament is a huge undertaking -- and having additional time to prepare allows us to maximize its impact across the globe,"" said US Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone .""I'm proud of our commitment to provide equitable experiences for the players, fans and all our stakeholders. Shifting our bid will enable us to host a record-breaking Women's World Cup in 2031 that will help to grow and raise the level of the women's game both here at home as well as across the globe.""Mexico Football Federation chief Ivar Sisniega echoed Parlow Cone's sentiments, stating, ""After careful analysis, we feel that moving our bid back to 2031 will allow us to promote and build up to the most successful Women's World Cup ever. The strength and universality of our professional women's leagues, coupled with our experience from organizing the 2026 World Cup, means that we will be able to provide the best infrastructure as well as an enthusiastic fan base that will make all the participating teams feel at home and to put together a World Cup that will contribute to the continued growth of women's football.""The most recent women's World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand in 2022, while the last time the tournament was hosted in North America was in 2015 when Canada served as the host nation.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football legend Ronaldo has reached an agreement to sell his majority stake in Cruzeiro , the club where he began his senior career, as announced by the Brazilian Serie A team on Monday.The 47-year-old, who acquired a 90% stake in the club for $70 million through his company Tara Sports Brasil in 2021, has agreed to sell the shares to BPW Sports company.The financial details of the transaction have not been disclosed.During his tenure, Ronaldo successfully cleared the club's $195 million debt and played a crucial role in their return to the top flight in 2022 after spending three seasons in Serie B. Despite this achievement, recent poor performances led to criticism and calls for his departure from some fans.In a statement, the club said, ""Ronaldo and BPW Sports signed an agreement to acquire all the shares of Tara Sports Brasil, the company that owns 90% of Cruzeiro SAF.""The statement also praised Ronaldo's administration for bringing a new perspective to the club, implementing professional management, and establishing a governance structure aligned with international best practices. The club's credibility was restored, attracting significant partners and sponsors, with record-breaking contracts.Ronaldo, who won the World Cup with Brazil in 1994 and 2002, will remain a member of Cruzeiro's board of directors, pending approval of the deal by Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense. The former striker made his professional debut with Cruzeiro at the age of 16 in 1993 before going on to become one of the world's best strikers.At a news conference, Ronaldo expressed mixed feelings about the decision, stating, ""A mix of feelings hit me today, but above all, the feeling of fulfilment. It's impossible not to remember when I took on the great challenge of buying Cruzeiro.""He acknowledged the challenges faced during his tenure and expressed satisfaction in handing over the club in a better situation than when he took over.""We've faced many challenges, the majority of which we've overcome. We've stumbled along the way, but today I can say that I'm handing Cruzeiro over with a sense of having done my duty, given that the club's situation was very precarious,"" said the former striker.In addition to selling his stake in Cruzeiro, Ronaldo is also expected to sell his 51% stake in Spanish second-tier side Real Valladolid , as he told reporters, ""Valladolid is next.""","Brazilian football legend Ronaldo has reached an agreement to sell his majority stake in Cruzeiro.

NEW DELHI: Renowned Inter Miami star and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi took a break from his football duties to attend the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics on Monday night.Accompanied by his teammates Jordi Alba , Sergio Busquets , and Luis Suarez , who also played with him at Barcelona, Messi arrived at the arena just before tip-off.The group, with some wearing Heat attire and Busquets donning a Heat hoodie, entered through the players' parking garage and were escorted via a VIP entrance to their suite seats above the lower level.Although Messi had previously visited the arena for at least one other event, this marked his first arranged attendance at a Heat game since relocating to Miami last year.Inter Miami have been performing exceptionally well in the Major League Soccer (MLS) this season, boasting a 6-2-3 record and currently leading the Eastern Conference with the highest points tally in the league.Messi's contributions have been instrumental, with two goals and an assist in Inter Miami's recent 4-1 victory over New England on Saturday. He has achieved the remarkable feat of having multiple goal contributions in five consecutive matches, a first for any MLS player.Throughout his illustrious career, Messi has amassed over 800 goals for both club and country, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in soccer history.His crowning achievement came in 2022 when he led Argentina to the World Cup title, scoring twice in the final against France. The match ended in a thrilling 3-3 draw, with Argentina ultimately triumphing 4-2 on penalty kicks.","Lionel Messi attended the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics.

ISL: Mumbai see off Goa to set up final showdown with Bagan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mumbai-see-off-goa-to-set-up-final-showdown-with-bagan/articleshow/109703553.cms,"MUMBAI: Jorge Pereyra Diaz wanted to lap up every second of it. The Argentinian striker had just given Mumbai the lead in the second leg of their Indian Super League semifinal against FC Goa , putting the Islanders 4-2 ahead on aggregate, and he was in the mood to celebrate.Joining him were thousands of Mumbai City fans who made sure their delight was heard around the 7000-capacity Mumbai Football Arena.They had to wait until the 69th minute for that joyous moment, and it was to get even better seven minutes from the end of regulation time.This time it was Lallianzuala Chhangte who timed his run perfectly from inside his half to latch on to a sublime assist from Vikram Partap Singh, neatly take it past Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, and tap the ball into the net to make it 2-0. For the second time in five days, Goa were left crestfallen.They had been looking good to arrive here with a 2-0 lead from their first leg at Fatorda last Wednesday. But in a matter of six crazy minutes in the closing stages of that game, the Gaurs watched in agony as Chhangte and Vikram turned that lead into a 3-2 win in favour of the Islanders.Despite that slap in the face, Manolo Marquez's side, backed by around 250 travelling fans, would have come to Mumbai encouraged by their form on the road, having scored in their last nine away games. It's another matter that they were up against the league's meanest defence, and the latter eventually won.Mumbai's 2-0 victory on Monday and a 5-2 win on aggregate has earned them the right to take on Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Saturday's final. Petr Kratky's side will look at it as a chance to avenge their narrow defeat to the Kolkata giants a fortnight ago on the last day of the league stage which saw Bagan thwart Mumbai's hopes of becoming the first team to defend the League Winners Shield.For now though, the Islanders will cherish a win they had to work extremely hard for, against an opponent who has challenged them each time they have met this season.They may have endured a nightmare finish to the first leg of this semifinal but Goa managed to make a positive start here, looking clearly to their American winger Noah Sadaoui to launch attacks down the left channel.After his tremendous impact as a second half substitute in Fatorda, where he produced two sublime assists for the goals that contributed to Mumbai's jaw-dropping comeback, Jayesh Rane was duly rewarded with a starting spot on this occasion. But the midfielder struggled to get his teeth into the game for most of the first half.The home side soon settled and would come the closest to scoring in the opening 45 minutes when they struck the post twice, first through a Tiri header off a corner, and later when Chhangte wasn't able to curl his left-footed effort enough.In his pre-match press conference, Marquez had admitted that the Gaurs could well find themselves in a situation where they would have to take increased risks. That moment arrived in the second half when Mumbai captain Rahul Bheke saw his header off Yoel van Nieff's corner cleared off the goal line by Goa defender Nim Dorjee Tamang. But Pereyra Diaz was there, as he usually is, perfectly placed, to poke the ball home.Vikram has scored eight times for the Islanders in the league this season, including a hat-trick against NorthEast United in March, but the forward showed how well he can create opportunities too, releasing Chhangte with a delightful pass around Goa's defence, as Mumbai's number 7 got the home support going again with a fine finish.There are likely to be questions raised about the relevance of the ISL playoffs going forward, with the format now really holding no significance apart from the prize money on offer. What there can be little doubt about though, is the two best teams over the course of the 2023-24 campaign will clash for the trophy at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday!","Mumbai City beat FC Goa 4-2 on aggregate to reach Indian Super League final.

Premier League clubs take step towards spending cap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-clubs-take-step-towards-spending-cap/articleshow/109702643.cms,"(With Reuters inputs)

Premier League clubs have taken a significant stride towards introducing a spending cap, with a vote on Monday endorsing the completion of economic and legal assessments necessary for such a model.Reports from British media indicate that the proposed model will be presented to clubs ahead of a final vote at the league's Annual General Meeting, potentially in June.If approved, it would supplant the existing Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR) starting from the 2025-26 season.The introduction of a spending cap aims to curb excessive spending by clubs, thus mitigating the risk of super-rich teams monopolizing the league. Concerns over the widening gap between financially endowed clubs and their counterparts have underscored the necessity for such measures.Discussed at a Premier League shareholders' meeting, the proposed cap would be tied to the revenue of the lowest-earning club in the league, primarily derived from television rights.Implementation could be as early as the 2025-26 season, marking a proactive step by the league to promote financial fairness and competitive balance among its member clubs.""We will obviously wait to see further details of these specific proposals but we have always been clear that we would oppose any measure that would place a 'hard' cap on player wages,"" the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said.""There is an established process in place to ensure that proposals like this, which would directly impact our members, have to be properly consulted on,"" the statement added.Media reports indicate that 16 Premier League clubs have voted in favor of the league exploring the implementation of a salary cap. However, notable clubs such as Chelsea abstained from the vote, while Manchester City , Manchester United, and Aston Villa dissented.Manchester City's dissent is particularly noteworthy as the club faces over 100 charges of allegedly breaching the league's financial regulations. Despite the allegations, the club has maintained its innocence.The urgency for financial reform in the league has been highlighted by recent penalties imposed on clubs like Everton and Nottingham Forest for breaching the Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Everton faced a deduction of points, while Forest appealed a similar penalty.In April, Premier League clubs had initially agreed to introduce new financial regulations for the upcoming season, opting for squad cost ratio rules to replace the PSR. If adopted at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in June, the new rules could limit clubs to spending 85% of their revenue on transfers, wages, and agents' fees.Although the PSR will remain in place for the next season with a transition period in 2024-25, points deductions will continue to be a part of the league's disciplinary measures even under the new regulations.","Premier League clubs have taken a significant stride towards introducing a spending cap.

Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel emphasised on Monday that his team is fully prepared to confront the formidable threat posed by the ""extraordinary"" Real Madrid midfielder, Jude Bellingham , in their upcoming home Champions League semi-final, first leg clash.The highly anticipated match, scheduled for Tuesday, pits the 14-time Champions League winners, Real Madrid, against Bayern Munich, who boast six titles in the competition.This encounter stands as the most frequently played semi-final fixture in the history of the tournament.Bellingham, the 20-year-old English midfielder, made a significant move to Real Madrid from Bundesliga outfit Borussia Dortmund at the beginning of the season.Since his arrival, Bellingham has rapidly established himself as a linchpin in Real's midfield, earning accolades as one of the world's premier talents. Impressively, despite primarily operating in midfield, he leads Real Madrid's league goal-scoring charts this season with 17 goals to his name.Tuchel's acknowledgment of Bellingham's prowess underlines the recognition within Bayern Munich's camp of the threat posed by the young midfielder. As the two European giants lock horns, the spotlight will undoubtedly be on Bellingham as he seeks to maintain his influential presence and impact on the semi-final stage.Tuchel said Bellingham was ""a key player in a very offensive position"" for the Spanish giants.""Jude is extraordinary. He was fantastic here in the Bundesliga, how he progressed shows the level of personality he has, it's only possible with a huge personality.""Everyone who plays for Madrid plays with the pressure of the shirt.

Mohun Bagan stay in hunt of doing a rare double in ISL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/mohun-bagan-stay-in-hunt-of-doing-a-rare-double-in-isl/articleshow/109679829.cms,"KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan SG stayed on course for a rare 'double' in Indian Super League , beating Odisha FC 2-0 in the second leg of semifinals and 3-2 on aggregate to reach the final on Sunday.Trailing 1-2 in the first leg of semifinals, Antonio Lopez Habas 's team turned it around in front of 62,007 spectators at the Salt Lake Stadium , with goals from Jason Cummings (22 nd minute) and Sahal Abdul Samad (90+3) sealing the deal here and confirming their passage to the title round for the second successive season.Two weeks after clinching their maiden Winners' Shield, the defending ISL champions are now waiting to welcome either Mumbai City FC or FC Goa in the final, which will be held at the Salt Lake Stadium on May 4.Habas's team is also staring at the prospect of emulating Mumbai City's feat in winning both the Shield and the league in the same season.With much at stake, both teams kept challenging each other throughout 90 minutes. It was an entertaining contest spiced with hits and misses.The onus was more on Mohun Bagan to take the bull by the horns, but they also ran the risk of being sliced open on every slip by Roy Krishna and Co.Habas employed a high defensive high line in a virtual 3-2-4-1 formation to embrace Odisha's challenge with both discipline and boldness.However, such a system comes with its own risks and rewards. Krishna's pace and potency down the right always left Bagan full-back Subhasish Bose and others searching for answers. At least on three such occasions in the first 45 minutes, Bagan survived scares born of the Fijian's feet. Anwar Ali first cleared the danger with a nick-of-the-time intervention, Diego Mauricio then failed to keep Krishna's cutback on target and Hector Yuste --- who failed to prevent Krishna from scoring Odisha's winner in the first leg --- rose to the occasion, denying Isak Ralte with a goalline save.Thus reprieved, Bagan ended the first half with the reward. Petratos, receiving the ball from Liston Colaco, tested Amrinder Singh with a snap shot. Although the Odisha goalkeeper managed to block it, Cummings reacted quickest to tap in the rebound. Odisha protested for an offside but as the assistant referee's flag stayed down, Cummings was already in the embrace of his teammates, celebrating and sending the loud and boisterous stands into rapture.The second half was more open. Bagan --- who were showing more intention of winning the contest within regulation time --- should have swelled the lead in the 58th minute. Liston Colaco's delivery across the face of goal found no taker to make the most of it. Manvir retrieved it at the other end and sent it back into the Odisha FC box. Anirudh Thapa met it with a deft header only to see the ball roll down through the legs of Amrinder and miss the far post by a whisker.Odisha kept soaking up the pressure, perhaps trying to turn it into a battle of attrition as extra-times loomed. But when Manvir raided their box in the third minute of stoppage time, it became the decisive moment. His pacey run left Odisha defence in tatters and as he sent it towards the goal, Sahal --- who replaced Thapa in the 71st minute --- ghosted in from behind. Just like the first goal, Amrinder managed to block the first attempt by Sahal, but the ball bounced up to hit the Bagan substitute and went in.Odisha threw the kitchen sink in search of a goal which could have taken the contest into extra times, but Bagan held their nerves, fighting on the back of their pluck and luck in crossing the finishing line.","Mohun Bagan SG beat Odisha FC 2-0 in the second leg of semifinals and 3-2 on aggregate to reach the final on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Amelie Mauresmo , the tournament director of Roland Garros , indicated on Thursday that former world number one Rafael Nadal is unlikely to receive a seed at the upcoming French Open next month.Nadal himself expressed uncertainty on Wednesday regarding his participation in this year's tournament, despite his remarkable record of winning the French Open a record 14 times.At 37 years old, Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, has seen a significant drop in his ranking, currently standing at 512, following an extended absence due to a hip flexor injury that kept him sidelined for almost a year.Although he has secured a place in the main draw of the French Open via his protected ranking, this ranking does not guarantee seeding, as seeding is determined by the top 32 ranked players.Without a seed, Nadal could potentially face formidable opponents in the early stages of the tournament.Traditionally, Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam event that did not strictly adhere to the ATP and WTA rankings, instead considering a player's past performances on grass courts when determining seeding. However, this approach faced criticism from players, including Nadal, leading to its abandonment in 2020.Asked about Nadal being seeded at this year's French Open, Mauresmo told reporters: ""Right now it's not a topic...""Wimbledon did it for a very, very, very long time, and it certainly brought some advantages but we also saw all the disadvantages it could bring. For the moment, it's not on the table.""We're keeping our fingers crossed for him above all, for us too obviously. We're keeping a close eye on what's happening for him on court.

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal declared on Wednesday that he'll only participate in the upcoming French Open if he feels ""capable enough to compete well.""The 14-time Roland Garros champion acknowledged that if the event commenced today, he wouldn't be ready to take part. However, he pledged to persevere in his efforts to secure the opportunity to play at his most triumphant tournament for one final time.""I don't know what's going to happen in the next three weeks.I will keep fighting and doing the things I believe I have to do so I can try to play in Paris, and if I can play, I play, if I can't, I can't,"" the former world number one told reporters at the Madrid Open on Wednesday.""I will not play in Paris if I am the way I am now. If Paris were today, I wouldn't take to the court. That's the reality. I will only play in Paris if I feel capable enough to compete well.""Nadal made his tennis comeback in Brisbane in January after nearly a year of sidelined recovery from a psoas injury. However, his return was cut short due to a muscle issue sustained in Australia, limiting him to just five matches this season.Last week, he began his clay campaign in Barcelona, exiting in the second round. Now, he is poised to take on 16-year-old American Darwin Blanch in his Madrid opener on Thursday.""I don't think I'm ready to play at my 100 percent but I'm prepared to go out and play tomorrow. It's important for me to play one last time here in Madrid, for me it means a lot,"" said the 37-year-old Nadal.As he attempts to resume his 'Last Dance' in Madrid and say goodbye to one of his favourite tournaments on court, rather than on the sidelines, the 22-time major champion admits his farewell tour hasn't been as enjoyable as he would have hoped.""A few weeks ago, I didn't know if I will be able to play again on the professional tour, so today I am playing,"" he added.""It's not perfect, of course not perfect, but at least I am playing and I can enjoy again, especially in the few tournaments that are so emotional for me. I'm able to enjoy the fact that I can say probably good-bye on court.""Nadal says he's hitting the ball well when he is able to be on court but ""it's about more body limitations. I went through a lot of things last year and a half, two years"".""So body feelings are not enough good to feel myself playing with freedom enough in terms of body issues. That's not allowing me to compete the way that I would like to compete.""","Rafael Nadal says he'll only participate in the upcoming French Open if he feels ""capable enough to compete well"" The 14-time Roland Garros champion acknowledged that if the event commenced today, he wouldn't be ready to take part.

BENGALURU: Sumit Nagal 's latest hairdo is short fade. It's as sharp as his tennis game.The India No.1, who climbed to a career-high 80 in the world on Monday last, took care of the style element on his arrival in Delhi. Nagal, who spent a few days with family and friends while getting his visa sorted, heads back to Europe this week to kick-off a three-week training block at the Nensel academy in Peine, Germany, before returning to his beloved clay courts.The timing of Nagal's training block - when the clay court swing is in full blast in Europe - raised injury worries.The 26-year-old brushed aside concerns with an insouciant shrug, insisting it's a good time for a training block. Nagal explained that he has played from March to March, including in the off-season in December. Ranked 138 at the time, Nagal played the Tennis Premier League , hoping the money would give him the financial freedom to schedule his 2024 season.Nagal will look at his net game and serve, which he noted has been on and off in the last weeks, besides build on his fitness in his time away from the Tour.The Indian is aiming to get a tournament in, perhaps in Lyon, before arriving at Roland Garros.Nagal has enjoyed an inspirational run in the first four months of the year, climbing almost 60 rungs in the ranking, especially coming into his own on clay.Nagal describes his relationship with clay in one word 'smooth', like a sharp cup of espresso. It awakens the competitor in him.""The more time I have, the better I am at chasing down the ball,"" he told TOI.Nagal learnt his tennis on the clay courts of Paschim Vihar in West Delhi as an eight-year-old.""It was probably fast,"" he said of those courts. ""I don't think we have slow clay courts in India. Clay courts are different everywhere, the clay courts in France are very different to Germany, Germany and Austria are similar, they are heavy, wet. France is a little bit hard and fast. Italy has a mix of both, but more on the faster side.""While the tennis world has played on the Nadal, Nagal surname, the Indian gave the legendary Spaniard a verbal salute.""What Rafa has done on clay is just insane,"" he said. ""His game is ridiculous, he moves incredibly, you just cannot hit past him and with that forehand jumping over your head for three or four hours… It's crazy.""The career he has followed with great personal interest, however, is that of the 25-year-old world No.6 Casper Ruud .""I've learnt a lot from watching Ruud,"" Nagal said. ""I have seen him from his junior days, playing under-14, under-16. The way he has developed his game, is very good.''""I feel like I can play a similar game to him. Serve smart, use a big forehand and have a solid backhand. And use the backhand smartly to get the ball to your forehand side. He has been playing at that level for a long time and I think that's the next step for me, to keep playing at this level, keep playing the ATP Tour level .""Nagal isn't surprised with his form of the first four months of the year, where he scored two top-50 wins and took a set off the world No.7 Holger Rune in Monte Carlo.""I know I can play top-50 tennis and keep improving,"" he said. ""When you lose there are a lot of things you feel you could've done better, but I don't think I lost a match (in the last few months) because of energy or focus. I have matured as a competitor.""The Indian is in a whole different headspace these days. ""I am enjoying being on the tennis court ,"" he said. ""I'm enjoying playing matches, enjoying fighting.""","India No.1 Sumit Nagal heads back to Europe this week for a three-week training block. The 26-year-old will train at the Nensel academy in Peine, Germany, before returning to his beloved clay courts.
