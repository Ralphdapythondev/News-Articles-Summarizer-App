"Worried over dip in voting, Election Commission plans to boost turnout",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worried-over-dip-in-voting-election-commission-plans-to-boost-turnout/articleshow/109482222.cms,"NEW DELHI: Concerned over the drop of nearly three percentage points in overall voter turnout in the first phase of Lok Sabha elections this year as compared to 2019, with the decline recorded in 19 of the 21 states and Union territories that voted on Friday, the Election Commission will be making a mid-poll correction in its strategy to boost turnout .Though the polling percentage has inched up since Friday as more reports from remote polling stations came in - with the latest figure now 66% and expected to rise further by at least 0.1-0.2 percentage points - it is still way short of the 69.2% turnout recorded in 2019 for the same 102 constituencies where polling has been completed.Conceding that the EC ""is very concerned about the dip in turnout"", one of its senior functionaries said that voter enthusiasm, though apparent, was not enough to bring them to the polling stations. ""EC had made tremendous efforts to push up turnout. There were targeted interventions like the turnout implementation plan (TIP) under the Systematic Voter Education and Electoral Participation Program (SVEEP), voting appeals by celebrities roped in as EC ambassadors, tie up with BCCI to use IPL as a platform to motivate voters and improving polling booth facilities to make voting a pleasant experience, but they seem to have fallen short,"" said the EC functionary.Sources told TOI that the EC is analysing the reasons for the lower turnout. ""The issue was discussed in meetings through the weekend and we will be coming out with more strategies by Monday under the turnout implementation programme,"" said the EC functionary.As per sources, the possible reasons for lower turnout may be the summer heat as polling this time started eight days later than in 2019; apathy caused by many voters perceiving the result to be a foregone conclusion; and a clash with the festival and wedding season.Among the states and UTs, only three states - Chhattisgarh, Meghalaya and Sikkim - saw higher turnouts as compared to 2019. Nagaland witnessed 57.7% turnout, over 25 percentage points less than in 2019. The decline in Manipur was 7.7 percentage points, in Madhya Pradesh over 7 percentage points and in Rajasthan and Mizoram over 6 percentage points.Bihar recorded the lowest turnout at 49.2%; even if this did not take the EC by surprise as the poll covered a Left-wing extremism-affected area, the corresponding turnout in 2019 was higher at 53.47%. UP too saw the turnout slip to 61.1% from 66.5%.The two states where polling has been completed - Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand - saw the turnouts going south as well. In Tamil Nadu, it fell to 69.7% to 72.1% despite the big-ticket campaign that saw DMK and BJP trading barbs over the controversial 'sanatan dharma' comment by Tamil Nadu minister Udhaynidhi Stalin. Uttarakhand too saw lesser voter enthusiasm, with the turnout there dipping to 57.2% from 61.5% in 2019.West Bengal, which has been a high-turnout state, saw an impressive turnout at 81.9% but even this was less than the 2019 figure of 84.7%.EC sources said it is difficult to identify the category of voters who may have contributed to the lower turnout. ""We do not profile the voters and count them as separate categories. The only solution is to encourage and mobilise all the categories with tailored inteventions to shun apathy and be counted,"" said an EC official.The commission is expected to come out with revised turnout-boosting strategies before the next round of polling gets under way on April 26.",The Election Commission will be making a mid-poll correction in its strategy to boost turnout. The polling percentage has inched up since Friday as more reports from remote polling stations came in. The commission is expected to come out with revised turnout-boosting strategies before the next round of polling gets under way on April 26.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109482249,imgsize-1298446,width-400,resizemode-4/109482249.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In the IPL 2024's 34th match, Lucknow Super Giants clinched a crucial victory against Chennai Super Kings, courtesy of KL Rahul's magnificent innings of 82 runs off 53 balls, propelling him to the fourth position in the Orange Cap standings with a total of 286 runs from 7 innings.Meanwhile, Virat Kohli maintains his dominance atop the Orange Cap leader board with an impressive tally of 361 runs in 7 innings.Riyan Parag from Rajasthan Royals holds the second spot with 318 runs, closely followed by Mumbai Indians' Rohit Sharma, securing the third position with 297 runs. Kolkata Knight Riders' Sunil Narine's explosive 109 off 56 balls earns him the fifth spot in the rankings.Notably, three out of the top five batters have scored centuries, highlighting their exceptional batting prowess.

Final standings:

(With PTI inputs)

India's D Gukesh has made history by becoming the youngest player ever to win Candidates tournament, which earns him the right to challenge chess world champion Ding Liren . This achievement surpasses a record set by the legendary Garry Kasparov four decades ago.The 17-year-old Indian Grandmaster Gukesh scored 9/14 points to clinch the first place. He is only the the second Indian player after Viswanathan Anand to win the FIDE Candidates Tournament.Gukesh's triumph surpassed Kasparov's record by a significant margin.Kasparov was 22 when he qualified in 1984 to challenge compatriot Anatoly Karpov.Reflecting on his victory, Gukesh said: ""So relieved and so happy. I was following this crazy game (between Fabio Caruana and Ian Nepomniachtchi), and then I went for a walk with my second (Gregorz Gazevsky), I think that helped,"" Gukesh said after winning.Additionally, Gukesh received a cash prize of 88,500 Euros (approximately Rs 78.5 lakh) out of the total prize fund of 500,000 Euros.""Congratulations to @DGukesh for becoming the youngest challenger. The @WacaChess family is so proud of what you have done . I'm personally very proud of how you played and handled tough situations. Enjoy the moment,"" Anand posted on 'X' to congratulate the youngster, who like him, also hails from Chennai.In the critical final round, Gukesh demonstrated his readiness for the elite level by holding Nakamura to a draw, showcasing his formidable skills on the global stage.With Gukesh securing 9 points, attention turned to the match between Fabio Caruana and Ian Nepomniachtchi. Caruana's initial advantage was nullified by a time pressure-induced error, ultimately leading to a drawn game.The final standings saw Caruana, Nepomniachtchi, and Nakamura tied for second place with 8.5 points each, while Indian Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa secured fifth place with seven points.The world championship dates and venue are yet to be confirmed, marking the next chapter in Gukesh's promising career after already making significant strides in the chess world, including becoming the third-youngest Grandmaster in history at the age of 12 and winning a silver medal at the Hangzhou Asian Games last year.Hikaru Nakamura (USA, 8.5) drew with D Gukesh (9); Fabiano Caruana (USA, 8.5) drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi (FIDE, 8.5); Nijat Abasov (Aze, 3.5) lost to R Praggnanandhaa (7); Firouza Alireza (Fra, 5) drew with Vidit Gujrathi (6).1.D Gukesh2-4.

Rajat Patidar is enjoying his IPL 2024 stint with Royal Challenges Bengaluru (RCB), highlighted by his two half-centuries, one of which almost took RCB to victory before they lost by just one run to Kolkata Knight Riders in a last-ball thriller at the Eden Gardens on Sunday.Chasing KKR's 222 for 6, Patidar creamed 52 runs off just 23 balls and added 102 runs with Will Jacks (55 off 32) at a brisk pace to put RCB on course before both the set batsmen fell in the 12th over.A late blitz by veteran Dinesh Karthik (25 off 18 balls) and Karn Sharma (20 off 7 balls) took RCB close, but Lockie Ferguson's run-out off the last ball of the match meant RCB were bowled out for 221 and lost by just one run.The day after the match, on Monday, RCB showcased Patidar in a video feature, where the 30-year-old batsman from Madhya Pradesh relived his journey with RCB and beyond.Patidar was first signed by RCB for the 2021 season but was released after featuring in just four matches that year. In 2022, he returned to RCB as a replacement player and scored 333 runs in that edition to be the third highest run-getter for his team.Patidar rose to prominence with a dazzling display in the eliminator match of IPL 2022, where he hammered an unbeaten 112 runs off just 54 balls against Lucknow Super Giants. However, a heel injury forced him to miss IPL 2023.Incidentally that eliminator in 2022 was also played at the Eden Gardens, which is why the RCB appropriately captioned the video - ""Rajat Patidar and Eden Gardens: A match made in heaven.""",Rajat Patidar is enjoying his IPL 2024 stint with Royal Challenges Bengaluru.

With Dhawan sidelined, all-rounder Sam Curran has assumed the captaincy role, but his performances with both bat and ball have failed to impress.India cricket legend Virender Sehwag minced no words in his criticism of Punjab Kings' approach, particularly questioning their decision-making regarding player roles and lineup adjustments.""If I was in the PBKS dugout, I would not even pick him in my team, neither as a batting all-rounder nor as a bowling all-rounder. I wouldn't pick him,"" Sehwag remarked on Cricbuzz, highlighting Curran's underwhelming contributions.Sehwag further emphasized his point, stating, ""A player is not of any use if he can bowl a bit and bat a bit. You either bat properly and win us the match, or you bowl and win us the game. This bits and pieces part I don't understand.""Statistically, Curran's performance this season has been lackluster, managing only 152 runs in eight innings at a strike rate of 116.03, with just one half-century to his name. Despite taking 11 wickets for Punjab Kings, his overall impact has been questioned amidst the team's struggles.As the IPL 2024 season progresses, Punjab Kings find themselves at a crossroads, facing mounting pressure to arrest their slide and salvage their campaign without the services of key player Shikhar Dhawan.",Virender Sehwag criticizes Punjab Kings' decision-making in IPL 2024.

Kohli's sarcastic response to Rinku's request for another bat hinted at some tension between the two players.In the video, Kohli sarcastically thanked Rinku for informing him about the broken bat and dismissed the idea of giving away a second bat.""You took a bat one match back, now you want me to give you two bats in two matches? I have to face the consequences at the end,"" Kohli told Rinku, seemingly frustrated.Rinku, however, persisted, expressing his regret and pleading with Kohli to lend him another bat, swearing that he would take better care of it.""I swear on you I won't break your bat ever again. I've kept the broken one, I can show it to you,"" Rinku said towards the end of the video.The interaction between Kohli and Rinku, both during the match and in the aftermath, has sparked speculation on social media, with some users suggesting that Rinku's presence during Kohli's discussion with the umpire was an attempt to further his request for another bat.While the true nature of their exchange remains uncertain, the incident has added an intriguing subplot.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru were playing Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens.

The controversial decision that led to the dismissal of Virat Kohli on Sunday in the IPL match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru , left the batting legend fuming as he not just let his anger and displeasure known to the umpires but also on his way back to the dressing room.Kohli, who made 18 off 7 balls, was given out to a waist-high full-toss, which he thought should have been ruled a no-ball after he took an evasive action that resulted in an edge lobbing back to the bowler Harshit Rana, who took the catch.The umpires gave him out, after which a surprised Kohli went for the review. But the ball-tracking software deemed that the slower delivery would have dipped below Virat's waist height by the time it reached the popping crease; and because Virat was standing outside his crease, it could not be ruled a no-ball.It infuriated the former RCB captain who kept shaking his head in disbelief while making his way out and vented some of that anger on the trash can just outside the RCB dressing room at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Chasing a stiff target of 223 to win, RCB still managed to make a match of it, thanks to half-centuries by Will Jacks (55 off 32 balls) and Rajat Patidar (52 off 23 balls). However, it followed a flurry of wickets, but Dinesh Karthik (25 off 18 balls) and Karn Sharma (20 off 7) ensured the game went to the last ball.RCB needed 3 runs off the final delivery. But Lockie Ferguson (1) was run out trying to steal a second run and force a 'Super Over', which resulted in a one-run win for KKR.","Kohli was given out to a waist-high full-toss, which he thought should have been ruled a no-ball.

Besides the last-ball thriller that the Kolkata Knight Riders vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru match produced on Sunday evening in IPL 2024 at the Eden Gardens , the dismissal of Virat Kohli on a controversial waist-high full-toss remains one of the talking points from the game.Chasing KKR's 222 for 6, RCB's star batsman and former captain Virat Kohli was adjudged out on the first ball of the third over when a full toss from Harshit Rana surprised Kohli, who ended up lobbing a simple return catch.The on-field umpires gave Kohli out while the batsman believed the full-toss was above the height of his waist and thus should be ruled a no-ball. Kohli went for a review, but because it was a slower ball and the batsman was standing out of his crease, ball-tracking deemed that the ball was dipping and thus would have been below Kohli's waist height by the time it reached the popping crease.It infuriated Kohli, who expressed his displeasure to the umpires before walking off, shaking his head in anger and disbelief and smashed the dustbin before entering the dressing room.Kohli made 18 off 7 balls.RCB, however, made a match of it, thanks to half-centuries by Will Jacks (55 off 32 balls) and Rajat Patidar (52 off 23 balls). It followed a flurry of wickets, but Dinesh Karthik (25 off 18 balls) and Karn Sharma (20 off 7) ensured the game went to the last ball, on which RCB needed 3 runs to to win. But Lockie Ferguson (1) was run out trying to steal a second run and force a 'Super Over'.It was RCB's seventh loss in eight matches, while KKR moved up to the second spot with their fifth win in seven games so far this season.Following the match, Kohli was again seen having a chat with the umpire, and also explaining to the KKR players what happened.Interestingly, the BCCI had measured the waist height of each player in IPL 2024 to minimize errors in decisions related to beamers that can be ruled as no-balls.Experts and former cricketers weighed in with their thoughts on the controversial decision.","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2024.

While some veterans criticised the decision, citing inconsistencies in the umpiring, others defended the call, highlighting the need to respect on-field decisions.Star RCB batter Kohli engaged in a heated exchange with the on-field umpires, venting his frustration over his dismissal.Visibly angered, he expressed his discontent before storming off the field. KKR fast bowler Harshit Rana's delivery, a slow full toss, rose to an awkward height as Kohli attempted to evade it before trying to defend. Unfortunately, he ended up getting a leading top edge towards the bowler. Kohli swiftly signaled for a review, but it was already under the umpire's scrutiny.Expressing evident displeasure, Kohli made his way back to the pavilion as the TV umpire adjudged him out. Notably, he was out of the batting crease when he made contact. Furthermore, Hawk-Eye's trajectory indicated that the delivery was below waist height.Taking cognisance of the situation, former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu couldn't stop himself on-air, during commentary, and spoke his heart out in his inimitable style stating, ""You want to get Virat Kohli out throwing a beamer and want me to welcome it, not at all. 'Chaati thok ke kehta hun' he was not out and this is not good for the spirit of the game. If a law is bad, it has to be changed with time.""Former South African cricketer AB de Villiers also came out in support of Kohli, with a post on social media platform X, saying that the grey areas in the game open up room for anger and can be easily fixed.""Grey areas in the game open up room for anger and confusion. It’s not a tough fix this. Get the batter’s stance, draw the lines and use ball tracking. No confusion whatsoever,"" De Villiers' post read.On the other hand, former Indian allrounder-turned commentator Irfan Pathan , known for his candid opinions, weighed in on Kohli's controversial dismissal with astute observation.Expressing his views succinctly through his social media post on 'X', Pathan put an end to all the speculations stating: ""It was a legal ball"".The diverse array of perspectives showcases the complexity of cricketing judgements and the subjectivity inherent in officiating. This controversy has sparked lively debates among fans and experts alike, underscoring the passion and scrutiny surrounding the sport at the highest level.","Former cricketers' reactions to Virat Kohli's controversial dismissal reflect a stark division of opinions within the fraternity.

"Abhishek Sharma: IPL: With Travis Head by his side & a clear mind, Abhishek Sharma is thriving",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-with-travis-head-by-his-side-a-clear-mind-abhishek-sharma-is-thriving/articleshow/109486601.cms,"NEW DELHI: One of the more endearing images from Sunrisers Hyderabad 's carnage at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Saturday was when Travis Head rushed to hug Abhishek Sharma when the duo brought up their 100-run opening partnership inside the powerplay. Head has dominated the headlines during this IPL , but Abhishek has added substance to their story.At 23 years of age, Abhishek's evolution as a T20 enforcer has gathered steam with his unabashed brand of batting which has already fetched him 257 runs this season.And that stems from watching Head wield his bat with aplomb in the last one year. He makes no effort to hide that he is smitten by Head's approach.IPL 2024: POINTS TABLE ""I've been telling him that I've been a really big fan of his from day one because I've been following him for the last year. All the Punjab boys (his teammates) know I admire Travis for the way he bats in all three formats. And he is in our team and we are the lucky ones,"" Abhishek said after SRH's resounding win over Delhi Capitals on Saturday night.The bromance between the two is obvious the way they interact at the centre square. But the relationship is beyond just batting together in a match.""We've been talking a lot off the field. It's joyful to watch him bat. Our chats are helping. He's someone I'm looking forward to batting with for the entire season. It's always great that there's no pressure at the other end. The team management and captain have been clear about us going out and expressing ourselves,"" Abhishek claimed.And just like that, Head has become Abhishek's go-to man. Abhishek's graduation to IPL-level cricket has been largely based on his allround skills which include steady left-arm spin. The ‘impact player' rule in the IPL hasn't allowed him to spread his wings entirely as a cricketer.""Because of this impact player, there's always an extra bowler or a batter. So, this is going to happen. This happened even last year,"" said Abhishek.This is where he has all the right to feel that he is being robbed of the opportunity to push his case for a spot in the Indian team with the T20 World Cup coming up soon after the IPL. This is where Head helped him clear his head.""I think I spoke to Travis about all these things. I shared a lot of things with him. I'm very much clear with my mindset and goal,"" Abhishek said.""Everybody knows that I can bowl. I should be ready whenever I'm called. I know somehow I will get the chance and I should be ready for that,"" he added.This clarity has helped Abhishek prepare well for this IPL. Like, he is particular about facing similar bowlers in the nets as his opponents. That's how he took down Kuldeep Yadav on Saturday. He claims he is clear that he would attack the spinners irrespective of the name at the top of the run-up and that helps ease the pressure off Head. On current form, it looks like Abhishek is in control of his game.","Abhishek Sharma has scored 257 runs for Sunrisers Hyderabad so far this season.

One of the highlights of their successful campaign so far is the impactful performance from the middle-order, something that was largely absent in the previous seasons.While a majority of the runs have come from the willows of Jos Buttler , Sanju Samson and Riyan Parag 's willows, cameos from the Caribbean duo of Shimron Hetmyer and Rovman Powell have proved game changing. IPL 2024: POINTS TABLE In a format where teams thrive on strike rates, Hetmyer has hit the top-gear this year and is striking the ball at 194.44, highest-ever since his debut in IPL in 2019. His next best is 168.05 in 2021.Similarly, the West Indies T20 skipper Powell boasts of 205.56 strike rate. Unlike his compatriot, who has played all the seven games so far, Powell got the opportunity in two games, and he made it count.Royals' in-form opener Jos Buttler conceded that having the two in the middle-order gives others a lot of space to play their natural game.""As a team everyone has been contributing really well. In different games, different guys have stood up. Particularly those two guys Hetmyer and Powell have so much power and experience. I feel having those guys in the middle-order and knowing they are still to come allows the others to play with a lot of freedom,"" the England T20 captain said during media interaction on the eve of Royals' home game against Mumbai Indians at the SMS Stadium here on Sunday.The battle on Monday gives skipper Samson's side a chance to strengthen their hold at the top of the points table while it is an opportunity for Hardik Pandya-led visitors to steady their ship as the second half of the league stage gets underway. Buttler feels that they cannot take Mumbai Indians lightly.At the Wankhede Stadium earlier this month, Royals trounced Mumbai by six wickets and so far, they failed to get on as a team.

Despite a wide throw by the fielder, wicketkeeper Salt managed to run out Lockie Ferguson , sealing RCB's fate at 221 all out.In a crucial moment of the match, Starc delivered a full-length ball just outside off stump from round the wicket. Ferguson managed to carve it towards deep extra cover, aiming for a double. However, the fielder's throw wasn't accurate, veering wide of Salt, the wicketkeeper.Seizing the opportunity, Ferguson attempted a quick second run, but Salt exhibited remarkable agility. He swiftly gathered the ball and leapt towards the stumps, removing the bails before Ferguson could safely return to his crease.Earlier, RCB's chase faced an early setback when Virat Kohli, who contributed a brisk 18 off seven balls, fell caught and bowled by Harshit Rana. Kohli's dismissal sparked controversy as he vehemently protested that the high full-toss exceeded waist height, engaging in a heated exchange with on-field officials.However, the TV umpire upheld the decision after technology indicated the trajectory of the ball dipped below the batsman's waist, leaving Kohli visibly furious as he departed the field.""It was crazy. Rules are rules, Virat and myself in that space thought the ball was higher than his waist,"" skipper Faf du Plessis, who was with Kohli at the other end when the drama unfolded, said after the match.""You always find one team happy and the other not so with such decisions.""","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) by one run in IPL.

And, as it has been proven of late, even that may not be enough. KKR almost learnt it the hard way twice in a row. Having failed to defend 223 a few days ago against Rajasthan Royals, they all but did a repeat act after scoring 222 for six on Sunday.The only thing that Starc did right in the entire match was to hold a low return catch off Karn in that dramatic over, which proved the decisive moment.Virat Kohli ’s wry smile in the dugout told another so-near-yet-so-far story for RCB. And the relief, rather than the joy, in the KKR camp was quite evident on sweat-filled faces.KKR opener Phil Salt hammered a 14-ball 48 and Shreyas Iyer scored a sensible half-century on the hot afternoon to lead KKR past the 200-run mark for the second time in a row.However, a little-known Englishman and an Indian talent produced RCB’s resistance that would have given KKR the jitters. Will Jacks and Rajat Patidar threatened to take the game away with rocking half-centuries in their 102-run third-wicket stand, which came in just 48 balls.The partnership happened after Virat Kohli flattered to deceive, succumbing to almost a beamer from Harshit Rana. Replays showed the delivery would have passed at the waist level.Jacks started the mayhem, treating veteran Starc with scant respect, taking 22 runs off the Aussie pacer in one over, which included three smashing sixes. In fact, that over, sixth of the innings, was when RCB would have started believing that they could do it. Their ""yes, we can,"" moment.However, KKR had their own tryst with self-belief in the 12th over when Andre Russell removed both Jacks and Patidar with his slow-medium stuff.

Karn, however, came tantalizingly close.Earlier, Salt started with a miss-hit six off Mohammad Siraj, but played some confident shots thereafter, which included giving Lockie Ferguson a rough welcome. The Englishman hammered the New Zealand pacer for 28 runs in his first over, and the KKR innings’ fourth, which had only fours and sixes.

""We've had a very good season, we're on a very good path, now we just have to polish it off and we'll go for everything,"" he told Real Madrid TV.For Barcelona, the defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, especially after their impressive performance following their Champions League exit at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain. Head coach Xavi expressed his frustration with the lack of goal-line technology in La Liga, which denied them a potential goal when Lamine Yamal's flick appeared to have crossed the line.Despite the setback, Barcelona showcased their fighting spirit and determination, with youngsters like Yamal and Pau Cubarsi impressing against the seasoned Real Madrid side. The future looks promising for the Catalan club, but for now, they must focus on securing their position in the league and preparing for the next campaign.Real Madrid find themselves in a commanding position, thanks in no small part to the exploits of Jude Bellingham.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool reignited their Premier League title pursuit with a commanding 3-1 victory over Fulham on Sunday, drawing level on points with table-toppers Arsenal .While Manchester City still hold the fate of the title in their grasp, trailing the top two by just one point with a game in hand, both Liverpool and Arsenal have intensified the pressure on Pep Guardiola's side.This resurgence comes after both teams bounced back from unexpected defeats in the previous weekend.Jurgen Klopp expressed before the match at Craven Cottage that the comeback of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota from injury provided his team with ""a chance"" to reinvigorate their pursuit in the title race.Both were on target, either side of Ryan Gravenberch's first Premier League goal.Klopp took the brave decision to rest a series of first-team regulars among five changes to the side that won 1-0, but failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit against Atalanta in the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday.Mohamed Salah, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and Ibrahima Konate dropped the bench.Alexander-Arnold was one of the few shining lights in Bergamo and was restored for his first Premier League start in over two months.The England international showed the quality the Reds have been missing when he curled in a stunning free-kick to open the scoring on 32 minutes.Liverpool failed to hold onto the lead until half-time as the defensive lapses that have cost them in recent weeks reappeared.Timothy Castagne swept home a loose ball into the far corner after Rodrigo Muniz's header was blocked.Klopp had his stellar cast of substitutes warming up after a sluggish start to the second period.But one wayward pass from Alex Iwobi cost Fulham.Harvey Elliott intercepted on his return to Craven Cottage and teed up Gravenberch to curl in from the edge of the area.Jota then made the points safe with his 100th goal in English football when his low effort had too much power for Bernd Leno 18 minutes from time.Two more away trips at local rivals Everton and West Ham await Liverpool in the next six days.But with just five more games of the Klopp era to come, they remain at least in the hunt to give the German a glorious goodbye to his transformative time at Anfield.","Liverpool beat Fulham 3-1 to draw level on points with table-toppers Arsenal.

But the defenders, on both sides, looked to have brought a little more of it on the pitch as they denied attacks to be reflected on the scoreline.While Odisha ended up with better possession in the first half, the only shot on goal came from Blasters’ Hormipam Ruivah in the 22nd minute when he headed a superb cross from Freddy Lallawmawma straight into the hands of Amrinder Singh in Odisha goal.Odisha once again relied on their talisman Ahmed Jahouh to keep creating moves from deep but all those attacks were foiled by the Marko Leskovic and Milos Drincic-led Kerala defence inside the D. The story was being played in the same vein at the other end too, with both teams missing that final touch or shot in the final third in search of a breakthrough.The highlight of the opening 45 minutes was the drama that followed Mourtada Fall sending in the ball with a casual back heel on connecting with a Jahouh cross from the left of the box. While it was first given a goal by the referee, after consultation with the linesman and vehement protests from Blasters, the decision was overturned with Jahouh and Fall both found to be offside.Despite some desperate attempts from both teams to change the scoreline, they left the field for the break with the first knockout of the playoff stage goalless.Jahouh kept sending in measured crosses into the centre and the flank after the change of ends as Amey Ranawade and Jerry Mawihmingthanga kept attempting to make a goal out of them. But Blasters soon took charge of the game with a barrage of attacks near the Odisha goal.Mohammed Aimen and Saurav Mandal displayed the youthful vigour that Ivan Vukomanovic’s team rode this season but it was Fedor Cernych who broke the deadlock in the 67th minute.

NEW DELHI: Casper Ruud 's triumph at the Barcelona Open final against Stefanos Tsitsipas marked a significant milestone in his career. After suffering a defeat at the hands of the Greek player in the Monte Carlo Masters final just a week prior, Ruud exacted his revenge by claiming his biggest career title to date.The Norwegian secured a straight-sets victory, winning 7-5, 6-3, and converting three of the six break points he earned.This victory not only ended Tsitsipas' impressive 10-match winning streak on clay but also marked Ruud's first title of the season, following three previous final losses.Ruud's elation was palpable as he expressed his joy at winning on the ""Rafa Nadal Court,"" a court named after his childhood idol. The significance of this triumph was amplified by the fact that Ruud had visited the tournament as a 13-year-old spectator, admiring the likes of Nadal and others.With his sights set on the upcoming French Open , where he finished as the runner-up in 2022, Ruud's victory in Barcelona serves as a confidence booster. The 25-year-old Norwegian has now amassed 11 career titles, with 10 of them coming on clay courts, solidifying his prowess on the surface.For Tsitsipas, the loss marked his third consecutive Barcelona final defeat, having previously fallen short in 2018, 2021, and now in 2023. Despite his impressive 10-0 record on clay this season and his pursuit of a 12th career title, the Greek player was unable to overcome Ruud's determination.Ruud's triumph in Barcelona not only provided him with his biggest career title to date but also served as a testament to his resilience and ability to bounce back from setbacks.","Casper Ruud beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-3 in the Barcelona Open final.

Former world number one and two-time major winner Garbine Muguruza retires,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/former-world-number-one-and-two-time-major-winner-garbine-muguruza-retires/articleshow/109463567.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former world number one and two-time Grand Slam champion Garbine Muguruza announced her retirement from tennis on Saturday, following a hiatus of over a year without competing.Speaking at a press conference during the Laureus Awards, the 30-year-old reflected on her illustrious career, stating, ""The time has come to say goodbye. It has been a long and beautiful journey, but I feel that the moment to retire has arrived.""Muguruza's decision marks the end of a remarkable tenure in professional tennis, during which she achieved significant milestones and left an indelible mark on the sport.""It's a decision that I've been taking little by little.""Muguruza's last official match was at the Lyon Open in January 2023, marking her temporary departure from the sport. Following this event, she refrained from competing, leading to her eventual retirement announcement.""When I stopped competing, I returned home and I welcomed the break with open arms,"" said Muguruza who ends her career with 10 singles titles.""Every day that went by I felt better and I didn't miss the discipline and the difficulty of the life I had before, so it has been a progressive thing.""Muguruza's WTA main-draw debut occurred in 2012, marking the beginning of her professional journey. Her breakthrough on the Grand Slam stage came in 2015 when she reached her first final at Wimbledon , where she faced Serena Williams but was unable to clinch the title.However, she swiftly bounced back, securing her maiden Grand Slam victory at the French Open in 2016 by defeating Serena Williams. The following year, Muguruza continued her success by triumphing over Venus Williams to claim the Wimbledon title.These victories solidified her place in tennis history, as her French Open win made her the first Spanish woman to win a Grand Slam since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998, while her Wimbledon triumph made her the first Spanish female champion at the All England Club since Conchita Martinez in 1994.Martinez's influence played a significant role in Muguruza's success, as she coached her to the Wimbledon title. In a fitting turn of events, just two months after her Wimbledon triumph, Muguruza ascended to the number one ranking in the world, cementing her status as one of tennis's elite players.",Garbine Muguruza announces her retirement from tennis on Saturday. The 30-year- old had been out of action for over a year. The Spaniard won 10 singles titles during her professional career. She was the first Spanish woman to win a Grand Slam title since 1998.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109463554,imgsize-23266,width-400,resizemode-4/109463554.jpg"
Captain's role doesn't make much difference: AITA secretary Dhupar on India's BJK Cup performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/captains-role-doesnt-make-much-difference-aita-secretary-dhupar-on-indias-bjk-cup-performance/articleshow/109410678.cms,"PUNE: The Indian women's failure to qualify for the Billie Jean King Cup Playoffs has brought the focus on captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule but the All India Tennis Association believes the players have to step up.""The girls did well. I think after winning the first (singles) match against New Zealand, we should have won the tie,"" said AITA honorary secretary Anil Dhupar on Thursday.India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week.Winning the tie would have placed the team second in final standings, thereby securing them a spot in the Playoffs in November.""We are remaining in Group 1, but I was expecting to qualify,"" said Dhupar but then switched to highlighting the association's efforts in hosting tournaments through the season to help players gain ranking points.""The association has done everything. The girls have had the opportunity to get a lot of points, and we had organised a camp in China.""And they were all playing well. Ankita had just won a tournament (in doubles) in Japan just the week before.""Dhupar, however, brushed aside the questionable team combinations fielded by the captain and the coach.After entering Sahaja Yamalapalli in singles and pairing Rutuja Bhosale with Prarthana Thombare against the strong Chinese team, the team's think-tank opted to put Rutuja in singles and hand Ankita the additional duty of doubles for the remaining three ties.It proved to be disastrous as it left Ankita with little time to recover with only a 30-minute gap between second singles and the decisive doubles matches. Ankita ended up with a 1-4 win-loss record in singles for the week, the lone win coming against a weak Pacific Oceania in the opening round.Ankita could have been relieved of the burden a bit by way of giving a day's rest, especially when Sahaja and Shrivalli Rashmikaa had served notice of their potential by upsetting top-100 players in the WTA 125K Series event in Mumbai just two months ago.Nandan Bal, the chairman of selectors, provided some perspective. ""If I were the coach or the captain, and if I find my No. 1 player not performing, I would put my No. 3 or any other player in,"" Bal, a former Davis Cup player, said.""Try something different, think out of the box. It could have meant Rutuja being the No. 1 player, but since she is playing well, why not try?""The AITA secretary had a totally different outlook, though.""A captain's role does not make much difference,"" said Dhupar categorically, adding that the players were capable of taking the workload.Importantly, the AITA has rejected the players' request -- most recently during a meeting called by Dhupar himself on the sidelines of an ITF event in Indore -- for a minimum of two physio-therapists to handle the requirements of five players in the team through the week.""They (the women players) are just asking what the boys (Davis Cup team) are getting. I think one physio is enough, and there has been no official, written request from the captain or the players to the association so far,"" Dhupar said.""They are playing 40 tournaments a year without a physio, but when they play for the team, they want everything.""Bal refused to make a direct comment on the team management's performance.""The selection committee only picks the players. The captain, the coach and the support staff are appointed by the executive committee of the AITA,"" he said.Both captain Shalini Thakur and coach Radhika Tulpule did not respond to request for a comment.",India finished third after the 1-2 loss to New Zealand in the final round-robin clash of the Asia-Oceania zonal competition in China last week.

The last day was very stressful. Ankita was a little bit tired, and it rained, so matches were moved indoors,"" Rutuja said.""It was clay but not the best like the one we played outdoors. The clay was coming off and you could see the (hard) surface beneath. We had to stay focussed.""And New Zealand (doubles team of World No. 5 and US Open winner Erin Routliffe and Paige Hourigan) played their best match of the week.""We had seen them play in the previous matches, and we were wondering if they were really World No. 5.""But against Ankita and Prarthana, they took the first set 6-1 in no time and went up 5-1 in the second. We made it 5-5 but they didn't really allow us to get back into the game.""It was a tough week but everyone gave their best.""Rutuja praised Ankita for showing courage to play back to back matches each day, but felt resting her a day could have helped the player's as well as the team's fortunes.""It was stressful for her. But credit to her, she stepped up to play both singles and doubles. Against Chinese Taipei, she had a long singles match (nearly two and a half hours) and then played doubles (after a 30-minute gap),"" Rutuja said.""Shalini ma'am and Radhika ma'am asked her if she could play, and she said she was ready.""She could have been rested one day, maybe against Korea (the day after playing Chinese Taipei).
