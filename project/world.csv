Who was Freddie Owens? South Carolina inmate executed by first lethal injection in 13 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-was-freddie-owens-south-carolina-inmate-executed-by-first-lethal-injection-in-13-years/articleshow/113539526.cms,"South Carolina executed death row inmate Freddie Owens by lethal injection on Friday, marking the state’s first execution in 13 years. Owens, 46, was sentenced to death in 1999 for the murder of Irene Graves , a convenience store clerk, during a robbery in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1997.The execution began at 6:35 pm (ET), and at 6:53 pm, a doctor checked for Owens' pulse and pronounced him dead at 6:55 pm, according to state officials.Owens, dressed in a green jumpsuit, had an IV in his arm. He declined to make a final statement but mouthed words to his attorney and said ""bye"" in his final moment of consciousness, according to a Fox news report. Family members of the victim, Irene Graves, were present during the procedure.Owens was executed using a single drug, pentobarbital, which South Carolina obtained under a shield law passed in 2023 that protects the identities of those involved in execution planning and implementation.His final meal included cheeseburgers, a ribeye steak, wings, french fries, strawberry sodas, and apple pie.An official, as quoted by Fox News, said, ""The case of South Carolina against Freddie Owens is complete.""The Supreme Court denied Owens' emergency appeal for a stay of execution, and governor Henry McMaster refused mercy on Friday. Earlier on Thursday, the state Supreme Court rejected a new affidavit from Owens' co-defendant, Steven Golden , who claimed Owens was not present during the robbery and killing. This affidavit contradicted Golden’s previous testimonies and statements to law enforcement.Lawyers of Owens sought a stay of execution, citing due process violations, arguing that he was not provided information about the lethal injection drugs or the qualifications of the execution team.Owens' execution was the first lethal injection carried out by South Carolina since the state regained access to the necessary drugs after nearly a decade of supply shortages.Owens was 19 when he killed Graves during a robbery on Halloween night in 1997. He was convicted in 1999, and during the 24-hour period before sentencing, he killed his cellmate, Christopher Bryan Lee.Owens had confessed to the murder of Graves to several individuals, including law enforcement officers and his girlfriend. He was given the option of choosing between lethal injection, the electric chair, and a firing squad, but his attorney, Emily Paavola, selected lethal injection on his behalf.Attorney Gerald “Bo” King called Owens' death “a tragedy” and maintained that Owens did not kill Graves. King added, as quoted by CNN, “The legal errors, hidden deals, and false evidence that made tonight possible should shame us all.”Owens’ execution was initially scheduled for June 2021 but was delayed due to issues with South Carolina’s execution protocols. This year, 14 people in the US have been executed, all but one by lethal injection.","Freddie Owens, 46, was sentenced to death in 1999 for the murder of Irene Graves, a convenience store clerk, during a robbery in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1997.

Elon Musk's X names legal representative in Brazil amid ban woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-x-names-legal-representative-in-brazil-amid-ban-woes/articleshow/113539540.cms,"Elon Musk 's social media platform, X appointed a legal representative in Brazil, according to the company’s lawyers on Friday. This in response to address a requirement from Brazil 's Supreme Court for the platform to continue operating in the country.Lawyers Andre Zonaro and Sergio Rosenthal revealed that their colleague, Rachel de Oliveira Conceicao, was selected for the role and her name has been submitted to the court.Brazilian law mandates foreign companies to have a legal representative to manage their local legal responsibilities. X had a representative until mid-August, but following the closure of its offices in Brazil, it did not appoint a replacement. This led to a Supreme Court order in late August to block the platform, and access was cut off shortly after.X's lawyers also stated that the company has begun complying with the content removal orders, another condition set by the court.The conflict began when Justice Alexandre de Moraes took action against Elon Musk's social media platform, X, accusing it of failing to moderate content that allegedly promoted violence and spread misinformation, particularly following unrest involving supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro.In April 2024, de Moraes included Musk and X in the ""Digital Militias Inquiry,"" an ongoing investigation aimed at combating online misinformation. The judge accused Musk of reactivating accounts that had been blocked without court authorization and obstructing efforts to regulate online content.On August 30, 2024, Justice de Moraes ordered X's suspension in Brazil, citing the platform’s failure to comply with the requirement to appoint a legal representative. This led to a full shutdown of X in Brazil, with major tech companies like Apple, Google, and local internet service providers blocking access to the platform.Musk reacted sharply to the suspension, posting inflammatory messages on X targeting Justice de Moraes, including an image implying the judge would end up in prison. Musk called de Moraes a ""dictator"" and demanded his impeachment, accusing him of ""censorship"" and attacking free speech.( with inputs from news agency Reuters)","Elon Musk's social media platform, X appointed a legal representative in Brazil.

'Lessons learned...': Secret Service admits 'mission failures' after Trump assassination attempt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lessons-learned-secret-service-admits-mission-failures-after-trump-assassination-attempt/articleshow/113538504.cms,"The Secret Service admitted on Friday to communication errors and a lack of diligence when Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was shot at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.Addressing these failings at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC, acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe Jr said, as quoted by USA Today, “It is important that we hold ourselves accountable for the failures of July 13, and we take the lessons learned to ensure that we do not experience another mission failure like this again.”Rowe said that the agency's lapses in communication and operations contributed to the shooting incident.An internal interim report cited deficiencies in command, control, communication, and diligence in relation to the assassination attempt.The Secret Service is responsible for securing events for former presidents, but in this case, they relied on local law enforcement for building security, according to Rowe. “We cannot abdicate or defer our responsibilities to others,” he said.The federal agency plans to expand its security perimeter, which will require additional resources. Disciplinary measures for certain personnel are also under consideration. Rowe did not disclose the number of staff facing punishment or their roles but said, “These employees will be held accountable, and this agency has one of the most robust penalty systems in the entire federal government.”Rowe also commented on a second assassination attempt on the former president at a Trump golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, saying, “What occurred on Sunday demonstrates the tremendousthreat environment in which the Secret Service operates, with constant risks.” “We’ve been in this heightened, increasingly dynamic threat environment since July 13,” he added.In response to the shooting, the House voted in favor of a bill requiring the same number of agents to protect presidential nominees as those assigned to the president and vice president. Representative Mike Lawyer said, “In America, elections should be decided at the ballot box, not by an assassin’s bullet.”The Secret Service director confirmed the continued use of tactical assets for party nominees and assured that the agency would not lower its hiring standards despite the increased demands. This year, more than 400 special agents have been hired.Rowe did not comment on security arrangements for Trump’s attendance at the Alabama vs Georgia football game on Saturday but noted, “Each event is complex.”In a recent assassination attempt on the Republican presidential candidate, the suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, camped outside Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course for nearly 12 hours with food and a rifle. He was allegedly aiming the rifle at the green from a sniper’s nest before being caught by a secret service agent.On July 13, 2024, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, opened fire from a nearby roof, grazing Trump’s ear, wounding two others, and killing one attendee before being shot by a Secret Service sniper at a Pennsylvania rally.","The Secret Service admitted on Friday to communication errors and a lack of diligence when Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was shot at a campaign rally in July.

US Presidential Election: Election countdown: Early voting begins for the US presidential race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/election-countdown-early-voting-begins-for-the-us-presidential-race/articleshow/113535372.cms,"In-person voting for the presidential election began on Friday, marking the start of a crucial six-week period leading up to Election Day.Virginia became the first state to kick off in-person voting on Friday, with early polling sites open until November 2.At a polling site in Minneapolis, Jason Miller, a 37-year-old house painter, was first in line.“Why not try to be first? That’s kind of fun,” he said, explaining that he voted “against crazy,” without revealing his choice for president.This early voting period follows a politically turbulent summer. President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, and Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in as the Democratic nominee.Meanwhile, Republican candidate Donald Trump survived two assassination attempts in a span of nine weeks.Voters experienced long queues as they cast their ballots on national, state, and local levels.In Minnesota and South Dakota, voters are only able to submit absentee ballots in person, as mail-in voting is not an option at this stage.The political climate has led election officials nationwide to increase security to protect polling sites and workers, with federal authorities investigating suspicious packages sent to election offices in over 15 states, including Virginia.Minnesota’s Secretary of State Steve Simon, who also leads the National Association of Secretaries of State, emphasised his hopes for a smooth voting process. “If I could wave a magic wand, I’d wish for high turnout and low drama,” Simon said during a press conference.Some voters cited concerns about potential chaos on Election Day.Chris Burda, a 74-year-old Minneapolis resident, voted early for Harris, praising her for defending democracy. She encouraged others to vote early to avoid possible disruptions at polling sites.While Trump has historically criticised mail-in voting, this year he and the Republican National Committee have promoted early and mail-in voting as a way to secure GOP votes.Eugene Otteson, a 71-year-old Vietnam War veteran, cast his ballot for Trump, stating, “I don’t like him, but he’s a businessman, and I like someone who can run a business.”In contrast, Rocklyn Faher, a 70-year-old retired Navy aviation electrician from Norfolk, Virginia, voted for Harris.He became emotional as he spoke about the stakes of this election, calling it “the most important election in the last 100 years,” and emphasising the need to protect the Constitution for his grandchildren’s future.Meanwhile, in South Dakota, early voters turned out steadily, with local election officials noting a busier-than-usual first day. Voters in the state will also weigh in on contentious ballot initiatives, including abortion rights and marijuana legalisation.Amid concerns about postal service delays, officials are urging voters to cast ballots early to ensure they are counted on time.","Virginia became the first state to kick off in-person voting on Friday, with early polling sites open until November 2.

The vast wilderness of Yellowstone, larger than some US states, makes it an impossible place to find a lost pet.The story begins when the couple had been camping in the wilderness when Rayne Beau, startled by something unseen, darted into the trees and vanished.The Anguianos searched tirelessly for 60 days, setting out food and toys, hoping their beloved pet would return. “We had to leave without him,” Susanne Anguiano recalled. “That was the hardest day because I felt like I was abandoning him.”Just as they had started to lose hope, Rayne Beau’s microchip became their lifeline.In August, they received a call from Pet Watch, a pet-tracking service , notifying them that Rayne Beau had been found in Roseville, California.A kind stranger had found him wandering the streets and brought him to the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).Exhausted and weak, Rayne Beau had somehow traveled 800 miles from Yellowstone. ""He was really depleted,” Susanne said, describing how drained the cat looked upon his rescue.Susanne shared the emotional story on Facebook, explaining how she had initially hesitated to tell their tale because of how traumatic the experience had been.The mystery of how Rayne Beau travelled such a long distance remains unsolved, but the Anguianos hope that by sharing their story, someone might provide more details.This heartwarming reunion also highlights the importance of pet microchips. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, 10 million pets are lost or stolen in the US each year.For cats, the chances of being reunited with their owners without a microchip are slim, but those with one, like Rayne Beau, stand a much better chance of finding their way home.For the Anguianos, Rayne Beau’s return marked the end of a distressing chapter and serves as a reminder to all pet owners about the invaluable role microchips can play in ensuring their pets’ safety.","Rayne Beau disappeared during a camping trip in Yellowstone National Park.

"First pagers, now walkie-talkies: Lebanon on edge after new wave of explosions kill 20",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-hezbollah-war-mossad-pager-explosions-walkie-talkies-explosions/articleshow/113474697.cms,"Driving the news

Lebanon has been rocked by a series of devastating explosions over the past two days, leaving at least 26 people dead and thousands more injured.

The two main devices responsible for the carnage — pagers and walkie-talkies—were in widespread use by Hezbollah operatives.

These seemingly mundane objects detonated across the country in a coordinated wave of attacks, with security experts pointing fingers at Israel.

As per a report in Aljazeera, exploding devices include portable two-way radios, laptops, and even certain solar power setups. ""There are reports of several different devices blowing up.""

A number of vehicles have also reportedly burst into flames. However, it remains uncertain whether these explosions originated from the cars themselves or from objects within the vehicles.

The explosions have not only claimed lives but also unleashed panic and chaos as people fear more devices could still be rigged to explode.

Thousands of Lebanese residents have been directly affected by the blasts, which have targeted Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut and southern Lebanon.

At the same time, explosions have hit civilian areas, including shops, homes, and even hospitals. This attack represents the largest security breach in Hezbollah’s history, marking a new phase of violence between Hezbollah and Israel, who have been engaged in escalating hostilities for years.

Why it matters

The scale and sophistication of these attacks have exposed Hezbollah’s vulnerabilities in a way that few anticipated. With Israel being blamed for the operation, the explosions have dramatically heightened tensions in a region already on edge due to ongoing conflicts between Israel, Hamas , and Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks have struck fear into Lebanese civilians, many of whom are now terrified that everyday devices could explode at any moment.

, and Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks have struck fear into Lebanese civilians, many of whom are now terrified that everyday devices could explode at any moment. As per a news report from Reuters, Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad , was behind serial explosions in pagers.

, was behind serial explosions in pagers. The orchestration of the pager bombings seemed to be an intricate undertaking that required several months of preparation. Numerous specialists suspect that Mossad tampered with the supply chain, planting explosives in hundreds of pagers prior to their importation into Lebanon. However, concrete evidence supporting this theory remains scarce at present.

Gold Apollo , a company based in Taiwan, said that it granted permission to BAC Consulting KFT, a firm located in Hungary, to utilize its name on the pagers shipped to Hezbollah. However, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, announced on Wednesday that the pagers delivered to Hezbollah never entered Hungary and that BAC Consultants simply served as a mediator in the transaction.

However, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, announced on Wednesday that the pagers delivered to Hezbollah never entered Hungary and that BAC Consultants simply served as a mediator in the transaction. Kovács further disclosed on X that Hungary's national security services were actively collaborating with international partners in the investigation.

The chaos unleashed by these attacks threatens to destabilize Lebanon further, a country already grappling with economic collapse, political turmoil, and the lingering aftermath of the 2020 Beirut port explosion.

The big picture

The attacks began when thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah exploded almost simultaneously across Lebanon and parts of Syria, killing 12 people and injuring nearly 3,000.

The next day, a second wave of explosions from walkie-talkies and solar panels caused more devastation, killing 14 more and wounding hundreds. Lebanese media have reported that some of the dead include children and civilians who were nowhere near Hezbollah operations at the time of the explosions.

Hezbollah officials have publicly condemned Israel, accusing it of committing “mass murder.” Iran, Hezbollah’s chief backer, has also blamed Israel and vowed retribution. Meanwhile, Israel has remained tight-lipped but has declared the start of a ""new phase"" in its ongoing war with Hezbollah, raising fears of a broader conflict involving Iran and its allies.

In a Daily Mail report, journalist Hassan Harfoush shared chilling firsthand accounts of the devastation. ""The scenes here in Lebanon are from a horror film—fleshless faces, eyes hanging out. With dozens dead and thousands hurt, none of us feel safe,"" he wrote.

""Beirut has collapsed into panic. The WhatsApp groups are going non-stop. There are wild rumours doing the rounds that solar panels might explode, batteries, fridges – anything. There's fake news saying phones have exploded. I know it's stupid but I even told my parents to get a fire extinguisher, just in case ­something blows up in the house,"" Harfoush wrote in the Daily Mail, echoing the fear that has swept the country.

What they are saying

Lebanese residents, gripped by panic, have taken drastic steps to protect themselves. Some have begun tearing the batteries out of their walkie-talkies and throwing them into the streets, terrified that the devices could explode at any moment. In some areas, residents have turned off Wi-Fi routers and unplugged home appliances out of fear they could also be rigged to detonate.

At Beirut hospitals, doctors are struggling to keep up with the flood of patients. ""We are seeing horrific injuries,"" said Dr Elias Warrak, an ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon University Hospital. ""In the last 24 hours, we’ve had more than 60 to 70 percent of patients needing at least one eye removed."" Many of the injuries involve gruesome shrapnel wounds to the face, hands, and eyes, leaving many permanently disfigured.

At a funeral for victims of the first wave of explosions, panic struck again when walkie-talkies detonated during the ceremony. Attendees fled in terror as ambulances rushed to the scene. ""The Hezbollah officials present behaved as if nothing had happened, but all of us felt it, heard it,"" Harfoush recalled. This latest wave of violence has shattered any remaining sense of security in Beirut and beyond.

Zoom in

The Lebanese armed forces have been called in to conduct controlled explosions of any suspicious devices. In one instance, soldiers detonated a bag of rice at the American University of Beirut Medical Centre, fearing it had been rigged with explosives. The Lebanese army is also working to neutralize compromised solar panels and radios, but the sheer number of devices in circulation makes the task daunting.

Images of exploded walkie-talkies and pagers show them labeled with “ICOM” and “Made in Japan.” While the devices appear to be from the Japanese electronics firm ICOM, the company has denied any involvement, saying that the specific models used in the attacks were discontinued in 2014. Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo has also distanced itself, saying that its pagers had been licensed to a Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, which acted as an intermediary.

Between the lines

Experts believe the devices were likely tampered with before they were delivered to Hezbollah, indicating a long-term infiltration of the group’s supply chain. Some security sources have suggested that small explosives were hidden inside the devices and remotely triggered, possibly through radio frequencies. This level of sophistication suggests the involvement of a state actor, with Israel’s Mossad being the most likely culprit.

The psychological impact of the explosions has been devastating. ""People used to think that if they were affiliated with Hezbollah but not fighters, they were safe. But this changes everything,"" said a Hezbollah source. Civilians who once believed they were outside the conflict’s direct line of fire are now terrified that their homes, shops, or workplaces could become the next target.

What’s next

The situation remains highly volatile, with Hezbollah vowing to retaliate. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is expected to make a public address, possibly outlining the group’s plans for retaliation.

Meanwhile, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant has warned that Israel is just beginning its ""new phase"" of war, which could see more aggressive military actions in the coming days.

There is a growing fear that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into a full-scale regional war, drawing in other countries such as Iran and Syria. Meanwhile, residents in Lebanon are left wondering whether any electronic device could be the next to explode.

Lebanon is reeling from a second wave of deadly explosions targeting electronic devices used by Hezbollah , just a day after hundreds of the militant group's pagers detonated simultaneously. The latest attacks, which are widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, have heightened fears of an all-out war between the two sides. The explosions have also raised concerns about the extent of potentially compromised devices, especially given the high number of civilian casualties.(With inputs from agencies)","Lebanon has been rocked by a series of devastating explosions over the past two days, leaving at least 26 people dead and thousands more injured.

Trans model Kesaria Abramidze killed in Tbilisi after Georgia passes law imposing LGBTQ+ restrictions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/trans-model-killed-in-tbilisi-after-georgia-passes-law-imposing-lgbtq-restrictions/articleshow/113522846.cms,"Kesaria Abramidze , a prominent Georgian transgender model , was found murdered in her Tbilisi apartment on Wednesday, a day after the Georgian government passed a new law imposing strict limits on LGBTQ+ rights. The 37-year-old was believed to have been stabbed to death, and a man has been arrested in connection with the crime, as reported by Georgian media.Abramidze, 37, was one of Georgia 's first openly transgender public figures.The law includes bans on same-sex marriages and gender-affirming treatments, and it allows officials to ban Pride events and censor films and books.The new legislation, which passed its third and final reading in parliament on Tuesday, has been controversial. Critics say it mirrors anti-LGBTQ+ measures in Russia. Civil society groups in Georgia have linked Abramidze's death to a broader state campaign against minorities.""There is a direct correlation between the use of hate speech in politics and hate crimes,"" the Social Justice Center , a Tbilisi-based human rights group, said. The group added, ""It has been almost a year that the Georgian Dream government has been aggressively using homo/bi/transphobic language and cultivating it with mass propaganda means.""Under the Georgian Dream party, which has become more anti-liberal, violence against LGBTQ+ people has increased. Last year, opponents of gay rights disrupted an LGBTQ+ festival in Tbilisi, forcing it to be canceled. This year, a large march promoting ""traditional family values"" took place, attended by the ruling party and the Orthodox church. European Union officials and other critics have warned that the new law could harm Georgia's EU membership aspirations. Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, urged the Georgian government to withdraw the law. ""It would increase discrimination & stigmatisation,"" he said.Michael Roth, chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee in Germany, said, ""Those who sow hatred will reap violence. Kesaria Abramidze was killed just one day after the Georgian parliament passed the anti-LGBTI law.""The law's passage is seen by some as a potential shift in Georgia's stance toward Russia, especially with parliamentary elections coming up in five weeks. Georgia’s pro-western president, Salome Zourabichvili, is expected to veto the law, although parliament has enough votes to override her veto.Abramidze had a significant presence online and represented Georgia at Miss Trans Star International in 2018. Tributes have been pouring in for her. Maia Otarashvili, a Georgian political scientist, called her ""a trailblazer for Georgia’s trans rights.""President Zourabichvili said Abramidze's murder should be a ""wake-up call"" for society. ""A terrible murder! The death of this beautiful young woman … should not be in vain!"" she wrote on Facebook.",Kesaria Abramidze was one of Georgia's first openly transgender public figures.

Jenny Phenix: Florida woman who sold all her possessions for a 3-year luxury cruise banned for WhatsApp messages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/florida-woman-who-sold-all-her-possessions-for-a-3-year-luxury-cruise-banned-for-whatsapp-messages/articleshow/113464881.cms,"A 68-year-old woman who sold all her possessions for her dream luxurious, three-year cruise around the world, was reportedly banned from the cruise on the grounds of ‘impacting community morale’ after her private complaints about the cruise were leaked.Jenny Phenix , a divorced mother of two had sold her businesses and belongings and was eagerly waiting for the voyage on Villa Vie Odyssey .She was practically “living out of a suitcase” since December 2023, waiting for the ship’s departure, which was delayed for months.“During the past year and a half I have liquidated businesses and possessions, eagerly awaiting my new life cruising the world,” Phenix told the Telegraph last week.The issue began when the ship was expected to set sail on May 15 from Southampton, England, but was pushed back due to unforeseen circumstances during dry docking in Belfast, Ireland. The ship Villa Vie Odyssey had been sitting idle for four years due to the pandemic, causing its certifications to lapse, forcing the company to reapply for them.The delays left Phenix and other passengers in limbo for nearly four months. As time increased, Phenix grew increasingly frustrated, especially when it was announced that the ship would no longer dock in Miami, where she intended to pick up the rest of her belongings.To make matters worse, she was told that she would have to use a temporary cabin for part of the trip, as her reserved cabin was still being used by the crew.Venting her frustrations out in a WhatsApp group with other passengers, she discussed the delays and unexpected changes. These messages, however, were shared with the ship's management, leading to backlash.Villa Vie’s chief operating officer, Kathy Villalba , informed Phenix in a letter that her contract was being terminated due to “continuous complaints and negativity,” which had reportedly resulted in formal complaints from over a dozen passengers. “This behavior has significantly impacted the morale and well-being of other passengers,” the letter read.“These were private conversations — I posted nothing on social media platforms,” Phenix told the Telegraph.“The frustration among residents grew after each delay. I tended to be one of the more outspoken in asking important questions. Many of the residents thanked me privately for speaking up for the entire group.”Villa Vie Residences CEO Mikael Petterson told the Telegraph that Phenix “broke multiple terms and conditions and signed a non-disclosure agreement.”This is the second time Phenix’s dream to live on a cruise ship got shattered. She had previously booked a spot on the Life at Sea cruise , which was abruptly cancelled in November 2023 after the company failed to secure the ship, leaving her out $30,000 in deposits.“I cannot even begin to explain the emotional devastation and the physical toll this has taken on me,” she said. “It is still very hard for me to discuss, as I had the same dream everyone else on that ship does, and they took that from me seemingly without a thought.”“I will have to stay with my daughter until I figure out a whole new plan for my life.”","Jenny Phenix, a divorced mother of two, was eagerly waiting for the voyage on Villa Vie Odyssey.

After a bar fight and a brief jail stay, he was due to return to Texas for disciplinary proceedings. Instead, he left the airport and joined a DMZ tour, crossing into North Korea where he was detained.North Korean authorities later claimed King had defected to escape alleged mistreatment in the US Army.

The SEC noted that, as the company's chief technical officer, he was likely aware of the launch plans two days prior and argued that his actions breached a court order requiring his testimony.SEC attorney Robin Andrews criticized Musk's explanation, suggesting it demonstrated a lack of seriousness and called for the court to put an end to his alleged delay tactics.Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, argued that the proposed sanctions were excessive and claimed that Musk's absence was due to an unavoidable ""emergency"" that he did not cause. He stated that Musk's testimony has been rescheduled for October 3 and expressed confidence that no similar issues would arise again.The SEC's investigation focuses on whether Musk violated securities laws during his purchase of Twitter shares in early 2022. Critics, including Twitter shareholders, have accused him of delaying the required disclosure of his stock purchases.Musk disclosed a 9.2% ownership stake in Twitter after failing to report his holdings upon surpassing the 5% threshold. In July, he acknowledged a misunderstanding of SEC disclosure rules, suggesting that any delays were unintentional.The SEC previously filed a lawsuit against Musk last October after he missed a scheduled interview at its San Francisco office.

The move comes after the couple petitioned the Islamabad High Court to stay the proceedings and sought acquittal.The Al-Qadir Trust case centers on accusations that Khan and his wife caused a loss of over Rs 50 billion to the national exchequer.An anti-corruption court has been overseeing the trial, where so far, the statements of 35 witnesses have been recorded, leaving only the investigating officer to be cross-examined by the defense.A two-member bench headed by Chief Justice Amir Farooq heard the plea on Wednesday. Although the bench rejected the request to completely halt the legal proceedings, it granted relief by restraining the accountability court from issuing a final verdict.Khan and Bibi's lawyers argued that recent amendments in anti-corruption laws make the charges against the former prime minister and his wife invalid. They contended that the approval of the federal cabinet was involved in the matter, and the revised laws make it clear that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cannot investigate decisions made by the cabinet.""The case does not stand after the new amendments, and we seek acquittal for our clients,"" argued the defense.The court has issued notices to the involved parties, and the trial remains ongoing.

The amount had been part of a settlement with the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) and later adjusted against a Supreme Court fine imposed on Hussain.","Former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, seek acquittal.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

Pakistan stand-off over cops seeking army exit from restive province drags on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-stand-off-over-cops-seeking-army-exit-from-restive-province-drags-on/articleshow/113302897.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The stand-off in northwestern Pakistan involving police units that have gone on strike to demand the withdrawal of military and intelligence agencies from the restive region entered the fourth day Thursday with no sign of the crisis easing.On Sept 9, hundreds of policemen had blocked Indus Highway, which links Peshawar in the northwest with the southern port city of Karachi, in Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to protest alleged military interference in their regular duties.Police officers from the surrounding districts, including Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan and Tank, joined their protesting colleagues, while political parties, tribal leaders and civil society groups expressed solidarity with them.The protesters, who accuse the ISI and Military Intelligence of exacerbating the situation in the region, have seen many of their colleagues kidnapped or ambushed by Taliban fighters and supporters in Lakki Marwat, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan over the last few years. In some cases, their houses and families have been targeted.This is the first instance in Pakistan of uniformed personnel on a sit-in and blocking an inter-provincial highway for four consecutive days. The protesters have so far turned down requests by their bosses to hold talks and end the agitation.Officer Rashid Khan said the army should leave the district and let the police department work freely.“We promise to restore peace in the area within three months if military officers stop their interference,"" he said in Lakki Marwat.""Their game of playing good and bad Taliban is not over. We (police force) arrest militants and they (the military) call us to release them,"" another official at the sit-in told TOI.The army has a large presence in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, where it has been battling the Taliban and other outfits for nearly two decades.Police officials in Bajaur tribal district, bordering Afghanistan, have announced they wouldn't work even with anti-polio teams until the administration identified and arrested the killers of a colleague who was shot dead while escorting once such group in Bajaur this week.“There will be a complete boycott of polio duty,” a video circulating on social media showed a man standing among a group of uniformed personnel as saying. ""They (the government and security officials) will give us the killers of Luqman (the police constable killed in the latest attack while performing polio duty) first.""Pakistan has seen a rise in militant attacks in recent weeks, with many of them taking place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where groups like the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, have stepped up attacks, targeting security forces convoys and checkpoints, and carrying out targeted killings and kidnappings of security personnel and govt officials.At least 75 police personnel have been killed in ambushes and targeted killings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa this year, according to official data.","Hundreds of policemen had blocked Indus Highway, which links Peshawar in the northwest with the southern port city of Karachi.

Authorities on Monday launched a new, nationwide polio vaccination campaign amid stepped-up security to protect the polio workers.On Monday, a roadside bomb exploded near a vehicle carrying officers assigned to protect polio workers in the district of South Waziristan, also in the same province, wounding six officers and three civilians. The militant Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for Monday's attack.Anti-polio campaigns in Pakistan are regularly marred by violence. Militants target vaccination teams and police assigned to protect them, falsely claiming that the campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Since January, Pakistan has reported 17 new cases of polio, jeopardizing decades of efforts to eliminate polio in the country.The potentially fatal, paralyzing disease mostly strikes children under age 5 and typically spreads through contaminated water.

You are the youngest candidate in tomorrow’s presidential election and are pitched against Anura Kumara Dissanayake , a Marxist-Leninist, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and current interim president Ranil Wickremesinghe .What is it that you offer, that they do not?A new, modern approach to economic growth and state administration.But you are untried and untested by the Sri Lankan voter. Do you really believe you are going to win?Of course.Do you think even the troubled parts of the country, like the Tamil-dominated North and East will vote for you?An election is all about winning people over, wherever they may be. The outcome of an election depends on the needs of the people at a given time. So whatever policies we announce, we must take the responsibility of sticking to them. I am not concerned with what politicians in the North and East claim their people want. My deal is with the people themselves. There is unemployment, and much must be done in the fields of health and education in those provinces. Nobody is addressing those issues. It is my intention to do so.The Rajapaksas are not particularly popular in India. Many Indians are of the belief that if a Rajapaksa returns to power, it will not be good for relations with India.I don’t think so. We Rajapaksas have had a very amicable relationship with India for generations. We ended the terrorism that killed one of your Prime Ministers. So, a lot of Indians want to see Rajapaksas running Sri Lanka. And we believe in modernising, not westernising. I am in sync with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on that issue. I also believe our visions are similar. There is a close bond between our Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party (SLPP) and his Bharatiya Janata Party as well. I look forward to strengthening our already close ties.It’s all fine to be young and dynamic. But your country is in the throes of serious external debt. It will surely require enormous international experience, which you don’t have yet?What makes you think I don’t have that experience? I have been in parliament for 15 years. I have built a strong and trustworthy network of foreign leaders and industry leaders. We’ll work with experts, and we’ll hire the best within the country and overseas to negotiate and strike the best deal on behalf of Sri Lanka.If you are invited to work with any other political party, will you do so? What if a new elected president doesn’t dissolve parliament and asks you to be PM straightaway? After all, your party does have a majority in parliament.First, I want to ensure political stability in my country. Let’s allow the people to vote first. I can take on any role, but I would rather that the current parliament is first dissolved and that another parliamentary election is held. Then, if the people themselves elect me back with the intention of seeing me as PM, I’ll take on that, or any other role. Whichever it may be, I will lead my party and protect national interests.","Namal Rajapaksa, 38, is the youngest candidate in Sri Lanka’s crucial presidential election.

President Wickremesinghe, Colombo is abuzz with slogans about the three candidates leading in opinion polls ahead of tommorrow’s presidential election . Marxist-Leninist Anura Kumara Dissanayake (aka “AKD”), represents ‘revolution from the bottom,” you represent “continuity” and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa represents a mix and is therewith a ‘change with continuity’. What else makes you stand apart from your two main contenders, in an election with a total of 38 names on the ballot list?I represent those who are prepared to stay back and fight. Anura and Sajith represent those who are willing to shirk their responsibility. It is not a question of bottom to top, but about who was willing to take on responsibility in 2022. I was not the leader of an opposition. I was not the leader of a party. I was a single individual. I took over because the others were unwilling to. I became president when nobody else was willing to be president. So, what I represent is the ability to confront challenges and overcome them. What they represent is the wilingness to run away.The party founded by the Rajapaksas, the Sri Lanka People’s Party (SLPP)supported you at the time and later withdrew support to field their own candidate, 38-year old Namal Rajapaksa. The SLPP has a strong presence in parliament. If parliament is dissolved – as usually follows a presidential election in Sri Lanka – fresh elections held, and the SLPP is re-elected with a parliamentary majority, will you work with them again?A president has to decide whether to dissolve parliament or not, and it is a matter to be discussed after the presidential poll result is out. The SLPP is currently split into three groups: one crossed over to Sajith, the other has gone along with Namal Rajapaksa and the largest number supports my candidature. I am prepared to work with everyone, provided they are willing to follow the policies we initiate. But much will depend on the combinations and numbers after this presidential poll. Some candidates contesting tommorrow poll have said they are going to dissolve parliament immediately, others have said they are only going to change the Prime Minister and then dissolve parliament. It won’t happen in 24 hours, but in the coming 3-4 days, some decision has to be taken, because the mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will arrive in Sri Lanka in 2 weeks. By then, there has to be a clear decision on whether Sri Lanka will go for parliamentary elections or not.Those elections will then throw up a new PM.There are rumours of Namal as the next PM, that you may even work together with Sajith Premadasa, your bête noire, who broke away from your United National Party (UNP) to form his own party, which is the largest in the opposition today….I told you, I am willing to work with anyone, even Sajith, once a new parliament is elected. Will Sajith work with me?There are many development projects and investments by India in Sri Lanka. Analysts in India say that a land bridge between the two countries is in the offing and a ‘done deal’. Are all these really projects Sri Lanka badly needs? Or do they chiefly serve to indulge India’s need for strategic space in Sri Lanka, despite concerns raised by Sri Lankan activists and citizens against some of them?On the land bridge, yes, there are certainly ecological concerns. But India is doing a feasibility study. Until that is done, there won’t be much output from Sri Lanka. Still, Sri Lanka and India have to work together on economic issues. The Vision Statement put out by myself and PM Narendra Modi contains references to that. One of the areas we have identified is renewable energy. And since India is willing to buy Sri Lanka’s renewable energy, it is natural that some of India’s entrepreneurs will want to invest in Sri Lanka.But earlier this week, your opponent AKD said that a $442-million wind power project by Adani Green Energy in Mannar and Pooneryn in northern Sri Lanka is ‘corrupt’ and will be cancelled, if he is elected president. Are you also taking a second look at the project?There is an ongoing court case against that project. So we will have to study it at the time the audit is given. Other than that, I don’t see any need to be changing anything. We must get all ongoing projects off the ground as fast as possible, to create jobs.Sri Lanka is member of China’s Belt-and-Road-Initiative (BRI). In March 2024, Sri Lanka’s external debt totalled 55.4 billion USD. China is your largest creditor. There have been frequent visits by China’s navy in the guise of ‘research vessels’ to Sri Lankan waters, some years ago, even nuclear submarines ‘dropped’ into Sri Lanka. Indian analysts say there are only two reasons China is in Sri Lanka: to entrap your country in debt and, by establishing military presence in the Indian Ocean, to threaten India’s security. How are you going to address India’s concerns ?We don’t see the BRI as a threat to India as far as what we are doing is concerned. But we have always said even before, that there are security concerns, they should be addressed by us, and that we must discuss with India and decide how to tackle them.The BRI stands discredited in many other member countries. Is there new thinking on your BRI partnership in Sri Lanka too? In light of the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, can you pull out or cancel it? Or is that not possible anymore?We don’t see a problem with BRI and it won’t create a problem for India either.Sri Lanka wants to join BRICS. Are there any other global / Indo-Pacific groupings that interest Sri Lanka at the moment?We are in BIMSTEC and we have applied to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP ). Asia is now becoming an economic bloc. BRICS signifies the emergence of a non-western group and we should get involved in it. This is a reality of global politics today.All the groupings you mention include China. Are you not looking to join others that exclude that country?These are not military, but commercial and political organizations. In any case, what’s the problem? I mean are we to leave the UN because China is in it? Why, even India is there in BRICS along with China, in fact they started it, not us!The Tamils of North and East Sri Lanka are miffed with you because you promised them a committee, new statutes, etc. just last year, but have not delivered. A faction under former Jaffna CM Justice CV Wigneswaran has even floated its own independent Tamil candidate in the presidential poll, for the first time in the history of Sinhala-majority Sri Lanka. They say that now, nothing less than a referendum among Tamils of the North and East will do to decide their future. They don’t even want the 13th amendment co-authored by India 38 years ago, any more.Wigneswaran is a good friend of mine. They know what I am going to do there, but we could not get it enacted as law, before this election. Their floating a Tamil candidate has more to do with their Tamil parties and not with me. It’s not a problem. In my manifesto, I have already described how we are going to implement the 13th Amendment, and so far, all parties have agreed.There is a very large, influential Tamil diaspora in influential western countries. Many are your donor nations. Aren’t you worried that their Tamil citizens will now urge them to twist Sri Lanka’s arm over its debt, in exchange for certain demands in the North and East of Sri Lanka?So far, those issues have not come up. I don’t think the Tamil diaspora has that much influence in most places. In Canada perhaps, but not in Europe. I think even western countries have realized that there is a limit to diaspora politics. In Sri Lanka itself and other than some small, extreme groups, the bulk of the Tamil diaspora is interested in what’s happening here and contributing.The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva has given you some respite by rolling forward a repeated Resolution on ‘accountability’ for alleged genocide by the Sri Lankan armed forces at the end of the civil war in 2009 and on thousands of ‘disappearances’ in Sri Lanka. How are you addressing those concerns?We have a Truth and Reconciliation Commission law, which will be enacted. That will take care of accountability. We have implemented other mechanisms too. But all we have said is that accountability comes within the framework of Sri Lanka’s jurisdictions, and Sri Lankan judges. We have no problems if others want to come in as observers -we are open to that. But the final decision has to be made by our judges.Analysts in Western donor nations say that you may be the right person to ensure continuity, since you have put into place reforms at the risk of your own political position in Sri Lanka. But they fear you will be unable to control corruption,which has contributed substantially to Sri Lanka going broke.Corruption is an issue everywhere. There is no country that is free of corruption. What we need is a good system. So I have asked the IMF itself to put forth a proposal on how to tackle it. In my 2 years as president, my function was to get the economy going and to reduce the burden on the people. I have done that. These other issues will come next.From 2005 to 2024 and even at times when there was relative stability here, a frequent parole during every presidential election in Sri Lanka has been a “vote for change”. Is this a faultline in the Sri Lankan psyche?“Vote for change” is a new slogan here. It replaced the old one which used to be “abolish the executive presidency”. They have nothing else to say, so they make up slogans. It has been counterproductive each time. When we go by slogans to win our elections, we don’t really perform.That is the crisis that brought us here. So we have to change that. It’s a flaw in Sri Lankan politics, not in our psyche.","Ranil Wickremesinghe, 75, will contest tomorrow’s election to Sri Lanka's highest office.
