legislation

Concerns over inconsistent marijuana laws

Impact on voter mobilisation and Republican division

Former President Trump has suggested he might support a Florida ballot measure to legalise recreational marijuana for adults, known as Amendment 3 , reported the Hill.Trump, a Florida resident, emphasised the importance of this measure being appropriately managed by the state Legislature to avoid public consumption issues.“In Florida, like so many other States that have already given their approval, personal amounts of marijuana will be legalised for adults with Amendment 3,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social site.“Whether people like it or not, this will happen through the approval of the Voters , so it should be done correctly.”Trump avoided stating his voting intention or openly backing marijuana legalisation but stressed that responsible legislation is necessary to avoid public nuisances. He pointed to the need for laws that prevent marijuana use in public areas to keep public spaces free from the smell of marijuana, similar to the issues observed in other cities.“The state Legislature needs to responsibly create laws that prohibit marijuana consumption in public spaces so we do not smell marijuana everywhere we go, like we do in many of the Democrat-run Cities,” said Trump.He also highlighted the inconsistency of criminalising marijuana possession in Florida when it is legal in many other states. Trump emphasised that law enforcement resources and lives should not be wasted on arresting adults for possessing small amounts of marijuana.“We do not need to ruin lives & waste Taxpayer Dollars arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them, and no one should grieve a loved one because they died from fentanyl-laced marijuana,” he added.Trump’s comments follow recent efforts by Democrats to attract younger voters in Florida, focusing on issues like abortion and marijuana legalisation. These issues have mobilised younger voters in other regions, as seen in Ohio, and Democrats hope for a similar impact in Florida.Democrats are targeting the fall ballot measures, aiming to increase voter turnout and gain the support of younger voters, a group with which Trump has faced challenges.Earlier in the year, the Department of Justice made a significant move toward reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug. If this reclassification is approved, marijuana will be downgraded to a Schedule III drug.Despite the trend toward normalisation and Trump's comments, some Republicans remain opposed to legalising recreational marijuana. Sen Rick Scott has publicly stated his intention to vote against the measure. He cited personal family experience with addiction as a key reason for his opposition.""My brother, who died at 67 in April, began smoking marijuana as a teenager and led a life of addiction,"" Scott said.",Former President Trump has suggested he might support a Florida ballot measure to legalise recreational marijuana for adults.

"3 dead after small plane crashes into row of townhouses in Oregon, TV station reports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/3-dead-after-small-plane-crashes-into-row-of-townhouses-in-oregon-tv-station-reports/articleshow/112960901.cms,"PORTLAND: Three people were dead after a small plane crashed into a row of townhouses Saturday morning in a neighbourhood east of Portland, setting the homes ablaze, authorities told KATU-TV. Officials earlier in the day had said the plane was carrying two people and that at least one resident had been unaccounted for.Photos and videos published by KGW-TV in Portland showed one of the townhomes engulfed in flames while black smoke poured out of the adjoining houses.Gresham Fire Chief Scott Lewis said the fire had spread to at least four of the homes, displacing up to six families. He said two people were treated at the scene, but he didn't describe the type or severity of injuries.The Federal Aviation Administration identified the aircraft as a twin-engine Cessna 421C, which it says went down around 10:30 am near Troutdale Airport, about a 30-minute drive east of Portland.As the plane went down, it knocked over a pole and power lines, causing a separate brush fire in a nearby field, according to the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. The plane was split into multiple parts as it crashed in the residential area in the city of Fairview, which is home to about 10,000 people.Lewis said the first call about the fire came from staff at the Troutdale Airport's control tower, who saw a thick plume of smoke rising in the air. But Lewis said that initial reports indicated ""there was no mayday, no call for emergency"" from the aircraft itself before it crashed.The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation into the crash. The agency has sent two investigators to the site of the crash who will document the wreckage, spokesperson Peter Knudson said. He did not release further details about the crash.The website for the Port of Portland, which oversees general aviation and marine operations in the Portland area, describes Troutdale Airport as a ""flight training and recreational airport"".","Small plane crashes into a row of townhouses east of Portland, setting the homes ablaze.

Trump: ‘All for the sake of a political stunt’: Vice President Kamala slams Trump for his Arlington Cemetry visit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-for-the-sake-of-a-political-stunt-vice-president-kamala-slams-trump-for-his-arlington-cemetry-visit/articleshow/112960642.cms,"Violation of cemetery rules and Harris’s response

US Army confirms cemetery incident

Trump defends his actions at a rally

Ongoing controversy with the military

Vice president Kamala Harris hit out at former President Donald Trump and his campaign for disrespecting a ""sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt."" Taking a dig at the former president's visit to the Arlington National Cemetery , Kamala Harris took to X and said that was a ""place where we come together to honor American heroes"" and ""not for politics.""""If there is one thing on which we as Americans can all agree, it is that our veterans , military families, and service members should be honoured, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude,"" Harris wrote.The first comments from the vice president on this come after it was reported that an altercation erupted between a female cemetery official and a Trump staffer earlier this week. Trump took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to commemorate three years since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan . He was joined by Gold Star families whose family members died.Harris strongly criticised Trump for breaking cemetery rules barring photography for political purposes. Trump's campaign shared images showing him grinning and giving a thumbs-up among headstones, which Harris termed a disrespect to sacred ground.""Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt,"" Harris said.In a statement issued on Thursday, the US Army confirmed a staff member at the cemetery was ""abruptly pushed aside"" after asking Trump's team to stop filming in a restricted area. This section is reserved for those killed in recent wars, where photography for political purposes is banned.The Trump campaign described the employee as a ""despicable individual"" and claimed she was experiencing a mental health episode. However, the military stated that the staff member had acted with professionalism and condemned the incident as ""unfortunate.""Trump addressed the matter at a rally in Johnstown , Pennsylvania, arguing it was the families of fallen troops who asked for their photo with him.""I said 'Absolutely.' I wasn't doing it for -- I don't need publicity, I get a lot of publicity. I would like to get a lot less publicity,"" Trump said.He blamed the White House for the criticism, asserting it was due to the handling of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Joe Biden killed those young people because he was incompetent. And then they tell me that I used their graves for public relations purposes. And I didn't. And I'll tell you what, it was a disgrace,"" Trump said.Trump visited the cemetery with families of 13 service members who died in a 2021 bombing in Kabul during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. His campaign has emphasised that he would have managed the withdrawal better, making it a key point against the Biden-Harris administration.Trump's relations with the military have often been controversial. While he frequently praised the armed forces, he reportedly mocked war dead and avoided being seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff.Harris's response on Saturday underscored her readiness to confront Trump in what is expected to be a bruising election.Trump has mocked Harris's name, intelligence, appearance, and racial identity. In response, the Harris campaign has described Trump as ""weird,"" an aspiring dictator, and ""out of his mind.""Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance, had earlier criticised Harris, responding to a mistaken report that she had already commented on the cemetery visit.""She can go to hell,"" Vance said.""Don't focus on Donald Trump showing up to grieve with some people who lost their children. Focus on your own job. Don't do this fake outrage thing,"" Vance later told the Washington Post.At that time, Harris had not publicly mentioned the cemetery visit.Kevin Carroll, a former senior aide to Trump's homeland security chief John Kelly, sharply criticized Trump's actions in an opinion piece for The Guardian.""The photo of a grinning Trump giving a jaunty thumbs-up over these patriots' graves is an indelible image of narcissism risen to the point of sociopathy,"" Carroll wrote.","Kamala Harris hits out at former President Donald Trump and his campaign for disrespecting a ""sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt"" Trump took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to commemorate three years since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The incident occurred on Monday as Mes was defending Ukrainian airspace, one of the few pilots trained to operate the advanced jets recently supplied by NATO allies .Mes, a member of Ukraine’s elite group of combat pilots, was piloting one of the first F-16s delivered to Ukraine, a symbol of Western support in the ongoing conflict. The aircraft had successfully intercepted several Russian cruise missiles before disaster struck.According to Ukraine's military, communication with Mes's jet was suddenly lost amid the fierce battle. The wreckage was later discovered, confirming the worst: Mes had given his life in defense of his country.Ukraine's military has opened an investigation into the crash, with early reports suggesting that pilot error or mechanical failure may have been the cause, rather than enemy fire, according to the report by NYT.Mes had been part of Ukraine's air force since the early days of the conflict. His death has sent shockwaves through the country, with many seeing it as a significant blow to both the military and national morale.The F-16s, which arrived in Ukraine just weeks ago, were seen as a crucial component in the country’s defense strategy, and Mes was among the first to be trained to fly them.The crash occurred during what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as one of the largest Russian attacks since the invasion began.Over 200 missiles and drones were fired at Ukrainian targets, and Mes, along with his fellow pilots, was at the forefront of the defense effort. Despite the intense barrage, the F-16s had ""demonstrated their high efficiency,"" according to Ukraine’s general staff, shooting down multiple threats. But as the battle raged on, Mes’s jet went down.On Thursday, a large funeral was held in Lutsk, a city in northwestern Ukraine, where Mes was laid to rest with full military honors. The skies above the city were filled with the roar of Ukrainian air force jets performing a flyover in tribute to their fallen comrade. The funeral was attended by family, friends, fellow pilots, and citizens, all united in grief and admiration for a man who gave everything in defense of his homeland.""Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life,"" read a poignant post from the air force's western command on social media. The post captured the deep sorrow felt across the country, as well as the profound respect for Mes’s sacrifice.The pilot’s death comes at a critical time for Ukraine, as the country faces relentless pressure from Russian forces in the east. Mes’s passing is a stark reminder of the human cost of the war and the high stakes involved as Ukraine continues its fight for survival. While the F-16s represent hope for a stronger defense, the loss of a pilot like Oleksiy Mes underscores the ongoing peril and the sacrifices being made on the front lines.As the nation mourns, Mes’s legacy as a fearless pilot and a symbol of Ukraine's resilience will continue to inspire those who carry on the fight. His name now joins the ranks of those who have given their lives in the struggle for Ukraine's freedom, a reminder of the personal sacrifices behind the headlines of this devastating conflict.","Oleksiy Mes, a member of Ukraine's elite combat pilots, was killed when his F-16 fighter jet crashed during a massive Russian missile assault.

Who was LaPere?

Man who murdered Baltimore tech entrepreneur Pava LaPere in September 2023 was sentenced to three life terms on Friday, with the first two served concurrently.Jason Billingsley , 33, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder of the entrepreneur on Friday morning. He also pleaded on August 26 to two counts of attempted murder in connection with a separate arson and home invasion that took place just before LaPere’s body was found on the rooftop of her downtown Baltimore apartment.Baltimore state’s attorney Ivan Bates said after the hearing, as quoted by The Guardian, “Let me be clear – Mr Billingsley should never see the light of day again.”LaPere’s close friend, Shrenik Jaim, expressed his grief to the court, saying, “We’ll never know what she could have accomplished.”Billingsley, who appeared in a yellow jumpsuit in court, expressed his remorse, saying, “I hold myself fully accountable.”Prosecutors on Friday revealed that Billingsley admitted to using a brick to attack LaPere.He gained entry to the 26-year-old entrepreneur's apartment building by calling her over to the glass door, though police have found no evidence they knew each other. Surveillance footage showed Billingsley’s initial encounter with LaPere as she walked home from a local arts festival. He followed her, and later, while she was in the building lobby, he attacked her.LaPere's body was discovered six days after the home invasion during which Billingsley, posing as a maintenance worker, gained entry into an apartment building. The arrest warrant states that he threatened a woman with a gun and used duct tape to bind both her and her boyfriend. He then set the couple on fire, resulting in severe burns. The victims filed a lawsuit against the property owner and management company for negligent hiring practices.Billingsley had been released from prison in October 2022 after serving a reduced sentence for a 2013 rape due to good behavior credits. This year, Maryland lawmakers, influenced by testimony from LaPere’s parents, passed a bill to eliminate good behavior credits for those convicted of first-degree rape. The new law will take effect on October 1.LaPere founded a tech startup from her Johns Hopkins University dormitory room. She was also featured on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list for social impact. LaPere was killed by strangulation and blunt force trauma after being sexually assaulted. She was remembered for her dedication to community building and using entrepreneurship for meaningful social change.","Jason Billingsley, 33, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder of Pava LaPere, 26.

First green

dinosaur skeleton

to be exhibited globally

A rare green dinosaur fossil has been discovered in southeastern Utah and reassembled by a team from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (NHMLAC).The collected bones don't belong to a single dinosaur but are instead a mix of parts from two or more prehistoric reptiles of the same species found at the site, according to NetGeo.The species remains unidentified and may be new to science, but experts believe it likely belongs to the genus diplodocus due to its distinct long neck and four sturdy legs.The excavation team has temporarily named the dinosaur ""Gnatalie,"" inspired by the swarm of gnats that appeared during the first summer at the dig site.According to National Geographic , the 150-million-year-old dinosaur was initially discovered in 2007 amidst a ""logjam"" of various dinosaur bones, including those of diplodocus, stegosaurus, allosaurus, camarasaurus, and other species.The dinosaur is 75 feet long - almost double the length of an average city bus - and weighs approximately five tons.After preparation at the discovery site, the bones were sent to Research Casting International ( RCI ) in Canada—a leading provider of museum technical services—for casting and mounting. Gnatalie has since been displayed in Los Angeles and it is also the first green dinosaur skeleton to be exhibited globally.The unusual green hue resulted from volcanic activity between 80 to 50 million years ago, which altered the bones' color through the formation of a new green mineral, according to NetGeo.In November, the green dinosaur skeleton will become the main attraction of a new wing at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.","A rare green dinosaur fossil has been discovered in southeastern Utah and reassembled by a team from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.

Fake cows ready for milking at US state fairs as bird flu threat looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fake-cows-ready-for-milking-at-us-state-fairs-as-bird-flu-threat-looms/articleshow/112947963.cms,"Cows stay home

In Michigan this year, where dairy workers and herds have fallen ill from bird flu , a pair of unlikely prized cows are being prepped to take the state fair stage.State fair organizers are this year featuring Milkshake and Buttercup, two life-sized fibreglass cows complete with rubber teats and water-filled udders, for a popular milking demo.The head of the Minnesota State Fair's Moo Booth came up with a similar workaround for its hands-on milking event: a fake dairy cow named Olympia.""Normally, we'd have a real cow out there,"" said Jill Nathe, the fair's deputy general manager of agriculture and competition. ""We just can't do that right now.""As avian influenza continues to spread, infecting cattle herds for the first time this year as well as four dairy workers, U.S. state and county fair organizers have been forced to reimagine nostalgic summer traditions long celebrated by city and rural folk alike.For farmers and students eager for blue ribbons and bragging rights, the outbreak has forced them to navigate new testing rules and manage logistical headaches in order to obtain a clean bill of health for animals before entering the show ring.State and local officials say they are trying to protect people and animals from the H5N1 virus as some dairy farmers have declined to test their herds. Experts worry that further transmission of the virus could help it adapt to spread between humans.The risk of viral spread among herds prompted some county fairs in Michigan to cancel dairy shows, while the Iowa State Fair shuttered its milking barn.In Minnesota, state fair staff procured extra gloves and face shields from COVID-era stockpiles for the livestock crew, and kept pregnant dairy cows out of the fair's birthing center.Several farm states, including Wisconsin, required lactating cattle to test negative within seven days of arriving at the fairgrounds.Wisconsin dairy farmer Rick ""RT"" Thompson said he had to carefully time visits from his veterinarian, so the milk test results for H5N1 would fall within the required window for different fairs. His vet's wife personally drove samples to a state lab in Madison to ensure they arrived on time for testing.""It's not a convenient thing,"" said Thompson, 57, who has attended Wisconsin's state fair for 46 years.Michigan banned lactating cows from all public exhibitions until the state goes two months without finding an infected herd. With only one state fair per year, the chance has passed for 2024. Michigan last reported a case on Monday.""We were all waiting for that 60-day window,"" Michigan State Fair livestock director LC Scramlin said. ""But we kept having another case and another one happen.""At the Wisconsin State Fair, where visitors can buy everything from cream puffs to hot tubs, veterinarians inspected cattle before they stepped off their trailers to make sure the animals were healthy upon arrival - a departure from previous years, exhibitors said.The risk of bird flu was enough to convince Jennifer and Bethany Droessler to keep a lactating cow at home. The sisters from Cuba City, Wisconsin, instead hauled other cattle to show at the event's Dairy Lane, where fairgoers petted and took selfies with animals topping the scales at more than 1,000 pounds (454 kg).""We'll aim for next year and hopefully it won't be an issue,"" said Jennifer Droessler, 30.More than 190 dairy herds nationwide have been infected since March, and 13 farm workers tested positive following exposure to cows and poultry.The workers all recovered, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says H5N1 remains a low risk for the general public. Still, CDC is advising people not to eat, drink or touch anything in animal areas at fairs.Several fairgoers in Wisconsin, the No. 2 milk-producer and top cheese-making state, said they were not aware of, or concerned about, the guidelines. Visitors chomped on treats including taffy apples and cheese curds as they strolled between cows chewing their cud.""I don't think it's a big risk,"" said O.E. Glieber of Delafield, Wisconsin, 88, who came to the fair with grandchildren. ""The CDC overreacts with a lot of stuff.""",State and local officials say they are trying to protect people and animals from the H5N1 virus. Some dairy farmers have declined to test their herds.

As Pakistan grapples with a surge in terrorist strikes in the past couple of years, its restive Balochistan province was rocked this week by a wave of attacks that have left more than 70 dead. The coordinated strikes, perhaps more widespread than any such assault in the past, by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army ( BLA ), have again foregrounded Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources as the soft underbelly of Pakistan.The attacks, which saw BLA targeting police stations and taking control of major highways, coincided with the death anniversary of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who was killed 18 years ago in one of then president Pervez Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations.Bugti's killing only exposed the limitation of kinetic action, in the absence of any genuine attempt to address the aspirations of the tribal population, as it led to the emergence of more armed separatist groups that now target not just Pakistan security forces and Chinese interests but also Punjabi and Sindhi migrant workers.There's no doubt that the attacks were on a newer scale and showed increased audacity of the insurgents, their strong support base and increasing ability to operate freely.According to former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, Ajay Bisaria, targeting of Punjabi workers introduces a new ethnic dimension, signalling that the Baloch radicals are looking to provoke and challenge the primarily Punjabi army.Nearly half of those killed by the BLA in the latest escalation were Punjabi workers. The Baloch people resent the influx of Punjabis who are seen as having benefited from economic opportunities arising in Balochistan at the expense of the Baloch people. This has fed into the insurgency against the Pakistan state and the anti-Punjabi sentiment that sustains it. The sentiment has its genesis in the traditional domination of the Punjabi elite in the civil bureaucracy and the composition of the Punjabi-dominated army, which lords over the province in the absence of any genuine political leadership or effort to address the local grievances.To an average Baloch, who believes he has the first claim over the province's natural resources and sees himself as a victim of the federal government's discriminatory policies, Punjabi workers only symbolise State repression, as practiced by the essentially Punjabi establishment. Extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, human rights violations and the reluctance of the establishment to engage civil rights groups have added to the mistrust.According to Bisaria, the latest episode also represents a security meltdown and possibly a coalescing of the Afghan/ Pashtun and Baloch insurgencies. TTP (Pakistan Taliban) and BLA are coordinating, if not colluding. Unsurprisingly, India is being accused of being involved in the latest and previous attacks,'' he says.Islamabad has repeatedly blamed India for providing financial support to the secessionists and Iran of allowing them safe hideouts. India has officially maintained these allegations don't merit any serious consideration and that Pakistan must introspect its own support to terrorism.Pakistan remains under attack from the TTP in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the army has been worried for the past few years about a developing nexus between Baloch separatists and the TTP in Balochistan, which is home to a sizeable Pashtun population as well. TTP has cheered attacks by Baloch militants, accused Pakistan army of carrying out massacres in Balochistan and said groups like BLA and TTP have a common enemy. BLA has been designated as a terrorist group by both the US and UK.Not surprisingly, China was quick to condemn the attacks, saying it's prepared to enhance counterterrorism and security cooperation with Pakistan to jointly uphold regional peace and security. Pakistan's hopes of turning the resource-rich Balochistan, its largest and most backward province, into an economic and energy hub have hinged on the BRI's flagship $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The CPEC projects, however, have been marred by violent insurgency.CPEC facilities, along with Chinese engineers and workers, have been targeted by the BLA and other insurgent groups that accuse China of arming Pakistan against Baloch separatists and of working with Islamabad to exploit the natural resources of the province, while aiding the marginalisation of the local people. Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif accused the separatists of working to scuttle the CPEC in his remarks on the latest attacks. With the BLA displaying greater operational capacity in the form of multiple attacks across the province, the CPEC, including the centrepiece Gwadar port, will remain vulnerable to the threat of violence.Balochistan, which accounts for more than 40% of Pakistan's land mass but only 6% of the population, has a long history of political unrest, as insurgency seeking a separate Baloch state dates to the time of independence. Economic oppression, anti-Punjabi sentiment, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and the plain inacceptance of the idea of Baloch nationalism have all contributed to the insurgency that is now jostling with traditionally more high-profile issues like Pakistan's role in Afghanistan for international limelight.In the interest of regional, particularly its own, stability, Pakistan must find a way to politically address the Baloch discontent, instead of subjugating the local population with its militarist approach. To begin with, it must look into their grievances, particularly exploitation of resources which remains a sensitive issue. Insurgency has been boosted by the perception among the local people that they are being denied benefits of the exploration of Balochistan's considerable mineral resources.While the army for now remains formidable enough to prevent any potential Balkanisation of Pakistan, it must encourage the federal government to enter a meaningful dialogue with the Baloch nationalists to mitigate violence and look at ways to finding a long-term solution, despite the seemingly intractable nature of the conflict. The Baloch people, with their distinct identity, have traditionally been seen as secular and it's in Pakistan's interest to ensure they don't work with groups like the TTP which are driven by extremist religious ideology.Pakistan also has to find a way to engage civil rights groups like the Baloch Yakjehti Committee that want to peacefully raise issues like enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.Pakistan will continue to accuse India of funding the BLA. In the past, it has justified crackdown on the separatists by talking up their alleged links with the enemy''. India will of course closely follow how the Pakistan army reacts to the Baloch escalation, as it guards against any attempt to disrupt the assembly polls in J&K. There has been a series of recent terror attacks in Jammu, leading PM Narendra Modi to warn Pakistan against using terrorism or proxy war against India. India believes Pakistan must introspect why attacks have increased in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan since the return of Afghan Taliban to Kabul, a development that Pakistan thought portended the return of its strategic depth in Afghanistan.","Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources.

The 2027 maturity was up 0.7 cents to 85.9 cents in the dollar by 1007 GMT - not far off the one month high hit earlier in the day, according to Tradeweb data.Topline Securities CEO, Mohammed Sohail, said the credit upgrade was anticipated following the IMF agreement, and another upgrade within a year is plausible.The announcement comes a day after Pakistan's central bank chief told Reuters in an interview that the country would be looking for about USD4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks.Sohail said Fitch's upgrade in July and Moody's upgrade should ""boost bankers' confidence"".Historically, Pakistan has depended on friendly countries to ""rollover"" debt to avoid a repayment crisis.Although Moody's previous concerns about a potential balance of payments crisis have eased, it warned that risks remain high as Pakistan continues to rely on timely financing from official partners.There is also uncertainty over the government's ability to fully implement IMF-mandated reforms, Moody's said.The coalition government, formed after February elections, may struggle to implement revenue-raising measures without stoking social tensions.Moody's cautioned that any slippages in reform implementation could lead to delays in or withdrawal of financing support from official partners.","Moody's upgrades Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to'Caa2'from 'Caa3' The ratings upgrade reflects Pakistan's decreased default risk after a USD7 billion IMF bailout staff level agreement in July.

Overcoming Challenges

KARACHI: Pakistan aims to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year, the country's central bank chief told Reuters on Tuesday, as the country looks to plug its external financing gap .In a wide-ranging interview, his first with any media organisation since taking office in 2022, State Bank of Pakistan Governor Jameel Ahmad said Pakistan was also in the ""advanced stages"" of securing $2 billion in additional external financing required for International Monetary Fund approval of a $7 billion bailout program.Pakistan and the IMF reached an agreement on the loan program in July, subject to approval from the IMF's executive board and it obtaining ""timely confirmation of necessary financing assurances from Pakistan's development and bilateral partners"".Ahmad said he expected the country's gross financing needs would be smoothly met - both over the next fiscal year and in the medium term.In the past, Pakistan has relied on long-time allies such as China, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates to 'rollover' debt rather than force a repayment crunch. Ahmad said he expected similar assurances would be given for the next three years, giving the government more time to get its finances in order.In addition, Ahmad said the central bank reckoned Pakistan's gross financing needs for the coming years would be lower than the 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product projected by the IMF in its latest country report in May.""Pakistan's external gross financing needs have been declining in the past few years,"" he said.""Since (the IMF's) assessment was based on a higher current account deficit than realized in fiscal 2024 and now projected for the next few years, we assess the ratio of gross financing needs to GDP to be lower than the 5.5 per cent level.""Asked about monetary policy, Ahmad said recent interest rate cuts in Pakistan have had the desired effect, with inflation continuing to slow and the current account remaining under control, despite the cuts.Pakistan's annual consumer price index inflation was 11.1 per cent in July, having fallen from highs of over 30 per cent in 2023.""The Monetary Policy Committee will review all these developments,"" Ahmad said, adding that future rate decisions could not be pre-determined.Pakistan's central bank cut rates for two straight meetings from a historic high of 22 per cent to 19.5 per cent, and will meet again to review monetary policy on September 12.There have been some concerns in markets that the government might take advantage of lower interest rates to borrow more, but the central bank chief said this was not his expectation.""We understand that the government will continue on the path of fiscal consolidation, notwithstanding the reduction in interest rates,"" said Ahmad.Ahmad, who was appointed governor of Pakistan's central bank for a five-year term in August 2022, said his first year had been 'quite difficult'.In 2023, Pakistan faced an acute balance of payments crisis with only enough central bank reserves to cover a month of imports.After eight months of tough negotiations over fiscal discipline, the IMF threw Pakistan a lifeline in the form of a nine-month $3 billion bailout program.""Last year was much better,"" said Ahmad. ""Now everything is under control from an external account management perspective.""Ahmad said the central bank would now focus on growth, digitalisation and financial inclusion.""Those are also equally important for job creation and other socioeconomic issues,"" said Ahmad, noting the bank's mandate was to ensure price and financial stability before shifting its focus to growth.","Pakistan aims to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year.

The outlawed group insisted that it did not harm civilians while claiming that 800 of its well-trained fighters had participated in shootings and bombings that began late Sunday.However, addressing a cabinet meeting, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said that there would be no peace talks with the group.Interacting with reporters in Quetta, interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said that a large-scale operation was not needed and the insurgents could be eliminated by police.Provincial chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said that the attack killed 53 people, including security forces, drawing nationwide condemnation. He further said that operations against the insurgents continued on Monday and “those who killed our innocent civilians and security will be dealt with with full force.”The PM said the Balochistan attacks sought to harm Chinese-funded development projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which included roads and rail systems to link western China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s southwestern Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea.In recent years, BLA and other militants have also targeted Chinese nationals involved with CPEC projects.According to a witness, some killed in the latest attacks were ordered off local transport and shot.Sakina Nazir said that while traveling in a bus with her husband, gunmen signaled the driver to halt, following which, the men entered the bus and checked passengers' national identity cards. They called some people out, including her husband after which gunshots were heard by the survivors.Balochistan has long been the site of a prolonged insurgency, with various separatist groups launching attacks, targeting security forces. These separatists are seeking independence from the central government.On Tuesday, Pakistan's army reported that 25 militants were killed by its troops recently in the country's northwest.It stated that four soldiers were also killed in the shootout in Khyber, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province near the Afghan border.",Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the deadliest day in recent history for Pakistan's Balochistan on Tuesday.

What Bangladesh's interim govt minister said on Sheikh Hasina's extradition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/what-interim-govt-minister-said-on-sheikh-hasinas-extradition/articleshow/112947205.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's foreign affairs advisor, Touhid Hossain , on Saturday that if the home ministry or law ministry makes a request for Sheikh Hasina 's extradition in the future, India will be obligated to comply with their demand.Hossain said that while he is not the appropriate person to address this matter, if such a request is made, it could create an uncomfortable situation for the Indian government.""Her (Sheikh Hasina) is staying in Delhi, in India...I am not the right person to answer this. If there is a request from there (Ministry of Home and Ministry of Law) we have to ask for her return to Bangladesh,"" Touhid said.If there is a demand from there, and that creates an embarrassing situation for the Indian government, so I think the Indian government knows this and I am sure they will take care of it,"" he added.Currently, Sheikh Hasina is residing in India and has accused the United States of playing a role in her removal from power. Regarding Bangladesh's foreign policy, Hossain explained that their approach is to maintain positive relationships with all countries while prioritizing their national interests.""Our policy is to maintain good relations with all countries while protecting our national interests. We seek friendship with all and enmity with none, aiming to establish balanced relations. Our primary task is to safeguard our interests,"" Touhid said.Hossain also clarified that it would be inaccurate to assume that the interim government is solely focused on any particular direction, as they aim to maintain smooth and positive relations with all countries, including India and China. He hinted at the possibility of general elections in the country, asserting that their primary objective is to ensure a fair and impartial election process, and speculation at this point is unnecessary.According to The Daily Star newspaper, Hasina, who fled to India on August 5 following her forced resignation amid a student-led mass uprising, is eligible for visa-free entry and a stay of up to 45 days under Indian visa policy for Bangladeshi citizens holding diplomatic or official passports.The extradition of Hasina, who faces 51 cases, including 42 for murder, is governed by the extradition treaty signed between Bangladesh and India in 2013 and amended in 2016. The treaty states that ""extradition may be refused if the offence for which it is requested is an offence of a political character."" However, it also specifies that certain offences, such as murder, ""shall not be regarded as offences of a political character"" for the purposes of the treaty. One ground for refusal of extradition is if the charges being pressed have not been ""made in good faith, in the interest of justice,"" according to the BSS report.","Bangladesh's foreign affairs advisor, Touhid Hossain, said India will be obligated to comply with a request for Sheikh Hasina's extradition. He said that if such a request is made, it could create an uncomfortable situation for the Indian government. Hasina is currently residing in India and has accused the United States of playing a role in her removal from power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112947165,imgsize-1072778,width-400,resizemode-4/112947165.jpg"
