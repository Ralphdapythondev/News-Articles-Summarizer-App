Matchmaking Norms: Defying norms: Matrimonial app brings modern matchmaking to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/defying-norms-matrimonial-app-brings-modern-matchmaking-to-pakistan/articleshow/112774328.cms,"Dozens of young singles in Pakistan 's Lahore , gathered this week for an event hosted by Muzz , a UK-based matrimonial app , marking a major departure from the country's traditional norms.This in-person event, the first of its kind in the conservative Islamic nation, aimed to offer an alternative to parent-arranged marriages and challenge the stigma around dating apps.In Pakistan, parents usually arrange marriages for their children, seeking matches within their communities or extended families.The country of 240 million people often see dating apps stigmatised, with gender segregation prevalent both socially and in workplaces.Muzz's app is grounded on Islamic etiquette and restricted to Muslim users. It allows users to blur pictures except for specific matches and offers the option of having chaperones oversee meetings.Since its launch in 2015 in Britain, Muzz has attracted over 1.5 million users in Pakistan, making it the app's second-largest market after Morocco.The Lahore event provided a safe space for attendees like Aimen, 31, to step out of the confines of online interactions. “I used the app for two weeks, but when I saw an ad for this event, I thought, why not meet people in person?” she said.Moaz, 27, who has been using Muzz for a year, expressed hope that the event might help him find a life partner.However, he pointed out that many girls on the app expect parental involvement from the start, which he found challenging. ""That is not possible,"" he said, emphasising the importance of getting to know someone before involving families.In addition to Muzz, other events like Annie's matchmaking party in Lahore are also challenging traditional matchmaking norms .Noor ul Ain Choudhary, the 30-year-old organiser, faced criticism online for allegedly promoting a ""hookup culture."" She defended her event, explaining that it was intended to provide a safe space for singles to meet and connect.","Muzz, a UK-based matrimonial app, hosted an in-person event in Lahore.

You are in danger. We are attacking and eliminating Hezbollah threats,"" the military said, in an Arabic-language warning to residents of southern Lebanon, reported news agency AFP.Israel, which has been pounding Gaza since the October 7 attack, called the strikes ""self-defence"" act to remove threats.""In a self-defense act to remove these threats, the IDF is striking terror targets in Lebanon, from which Hezbollah was planning to launch their attacks on Israeli civilians,"" IDF Spokesperson, Daniel Hagari said regarding Hezbollah's plans to attack Israel.A few days ago, in a rare move, an Israeli strike targeted a Hezbollah arms depot in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, two security sources told Reuters.Targeted Hezbollah's weapons storage facilities in the Nabatieh area were situated approximately 12 kilometres (seven miles) from the closest point of the Israeli border. This information was shared on the military's Telegram channel.Hezbollah and other armed groups in Lebanon have been trading fire with Israel in parallel with the Gaza war.Last week, an Israeli air strike in southern Lebanon resulted in the deaths of nine people, including a woman and her two children, claimed Lebanon's health ministry. The strike, which occurred in the Nabatieh area, also left five people wounded, with two of them in critical condition.Since the outbreak of war in the Gaza Strip last October between Palestinian Hamas militants and Israeli forces, Hezbollah , an Iran-backed group, and Israeli forces have been engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire across their border.This recent incident occurs amidst concerns of a broader regional conflict, which international mediators have been attempting to prevent through negotiations aimed at establishing a truce in Gaza.","Israel said the strikes were carried out in the wake of detecting preparations for ""large-scale"" attacks by Hezbollah.

Worthy, symmetrical, long-ranged,"" he said.The president also confirmed that the new Ukrainian weapon had successfully struck a target within Russian territory but did not disclose the specific location.Zelenskyy further said that this new weapon surpasses the domestically produced drones currently used by Kyiv in terms of speed and power, effectively targeting Russian oil refineries and military airfields.""I want to stress once more that our new weapon decisions, including Palianytsia, is our realistic way to act while some of our partners are unfortunately delaying decisions,"" said Zelenskyy.The word ""Palianytsia,"" which refers to a type of Ukrainian bread, is considered difficult for Russians to pronounce and has been used throughout the war, sometimes humorously, to differentiate between Ukrainians and Russians.""It will be very difficult for Russia, difficult to even pronounce what exactly has hit it,"" said Zelenskyy.Despite Russia's relentless attacks on Ukraine with missiles and drones since the invasion began in February 2022, Moscow has condemned Ukraine's drone strikes as acts of terrorism. Russian troops continue to advance in eastern Ukraine, currently occupying 18% of the country.Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's allies to allow the use of Western weapons deeper within Russian territory, such as targeting airbases used by Russian warplanes that bombard Ukraine with missiles and glide bombs.Meanwhile, Zelenskyy promoted his top commander, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, to the rank of General, praising his leadership during Ukraine's recent cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk region, which began on August 6.Russia has denounced this incursion as an escalation and a major provocation, while Ukraine claims to have captured more than 90 settlements in the Kursk region, marking the most significant invasion of Russia since World War II.Zelenskyy announced during a joint press conference with the leaders of Poland and Lithuania that the recent military operation in the Kursk region of Russia was partly aimed at thwarting Russian plans to seize the city of Sumy in northern Ukraine.He mentioned that the operation had additional objectives, including the capture of prisoners of war and the establishment of a ""buffer zone,"" but he refrained from disclosing further details publicly.Additionally, Polish President Andrzej Duda confirmed that Polish PT-91 Twardy tanks, which were provided to Ukraine by Warsaw over a year ago, are currently engaged in combat operations in the Kursk region.""We are touched to see how the PT-91 Twardy tanks, given by Poland (to Ukraine) more than one year ago, are defending today Ukraine on the battlefields, fighting in the Kursk region,"" he said.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Russian President Putin a'sick old man' who threatens everyone of nuclear attack.

However, they have not been well received in North Korea, where leader Kim Jong Un’s regime strictly controls interactions with South Koreans and other foreign competitors.Since the team's return on August 15, they have been subjected to a month-long ""cleanse"" intended to remove any influence of ""non-socialist"" culture, according to the Daily NK. This process, managed by North Korea’s Ministry of Sport, includes a three-stage ideological assessment designed to ensure the athletes align with state-approved values.North Korean athletes were reportedly instructed to avoid interacting with South Korean or other foreign athletes during the Olympics. Violations of these directives could result in penalties, although the specific nature of the potential punishments remains unclear.Historical precedents suggest severe consequences for perceived disobedience. For instance, after the North Korean football team’s lackluster performance at the 2010 World Cup, players were subjected to a six-hour public criticism session, and their coach was sent to labor in construction.",North Korean table-tennis players Kim Kum-yong and Ri Jong-sik are under investigation for their behavior during the Paris Olympics.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has directed the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to enhance its strategic capabilities to defend China’s sovereignty and developmental interests in this new directive.Xi Jinping, while commemorating the 120th anniversary of Deng Xiaoping 's birth, emphasised Deng’s legacy in building a modern China and highlighted his contributions to the Communist Party of China (CPC), the nation, and the world.Xi highlighted Deng's focus on modernising the military by saying, ""The best way to honour Deng is to continue advancing the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics that he initiated."" Deng's vision for the PLA included developing it into a strong, modernised, and well-organised force, emphasising the importance of ""fewer but better troops.""Xi Jinping, acting in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the PLA, reiterated on Thursday the importance of the military improving its ""strategic ability to defend national sovereignty , security, and development interests,"" as reported by the South China Morning Post.Miao Hua, a member of the central military commission, China’s highest military decision-making body led by Xi, remarked on this strategic shift during a PLA commemoration event. He stated, ""In the new journey, we should ... focus on strengthening capabilities to defeat strong enemies and opponents.""The sentiment was echoed in an article from the official PLA Daily, published a day before Miao Hua’s statement. Referring to Deng’s 1980s strategic judgment that ""world wars can be postponed or avoided,"" the article noted that China now faces ""great changes unseen in a century."" It stressed the need for the military to remain vigilant, asserting, ""We must ... always maintain strategic clarity on the possible risks of war, make full preparations for military struggle, effectively deter war and resolutely win the war.""The recent direction for the PLA to prepare for wars against ""strong enemies and opponents"" marks a significant departure from its previous focus on winning local wars.This shift is in response to the growing geopolitical challenges China faces, including its long-standing border dispute with India and maritime disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Moreover, China’s relations with Taiwan have become increasingly strained, with Beijing asserting its claim over the island.China claims most of the South China Sea, a contention disputed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan. In his 2022 speech at the party congress, Xi had set the goal for ""victory in local wars"" and instructed the PLA to ""improve training and preparation for war in all aspects and improve the ability of the army to fight and win.""He further stated, ""We will strengthen the normal and diversified use of military forces, carry out military struggles with determination and flexibility, shape the security posture, contain crises and conflicts, and win local wars.""","China's military is shifting its focus to winning wars against "" strong enemies and opponents,"" according to a top defence official.

Kamala faces a Kennedy wrinkle on road to Kamalot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-faces-a-kennedy-wrinkle-on-road-to-kamalot/articleshow/112762598.cms,"WASHINGTON: The ardor of a rousing convention in Chicago that Democrats hoped would accelerate momentum for Kamala Harris was impeded to a degree on Friday when independent candidate Robert Kennedy Jr , scion of the famous political dynasty, suspended his campaign for the White House and threw his support behind Donald Trump .Regarded as a third party insurgent who attracted voters disgruntled with both Biden and Trump early in the race, the nearly 15 per cent support for Kennedy at his peak moment had dropped to 5 per cent and was plunging after Kamala Harris became the Democrat nominee.The jury and pollsters are still out on whether he can take his remaining supporters to Trump or whether they will filter into the Kamala bandwagon.There's not enough solid data yet but one poll shows Harris' lead against Trump dropped only marginally by 0.2 per cent (down from 3.3 to 3.1 when Kennedy was taken out of the equation). However the Trump camp believes even a marginal shift in closely-fought battleground state could win them the election.Seen as betraying his political legacy by Democrats and his own siblings, Kennedy literally walked over to the Trump camp, joining the former President at a rally in Arizona on Friday evening just hours after he bailed out of the race. Trump, who with his customary flourish had previously called him a ""radical left"" candidate, opportunistically reversed course and welcomed him, saying he was a well respected candidate who raised important issues during his campaign.Kennedy, 70, is the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of his brother, former attorney general and US senator Robert Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s. He caught the attention of voters with his anti-vaccine crusade in the covid years after years of work as an environmental activist and litigator. Almost all his siblings and cousins are aligned with the Democratic Party and some even spoke at the DNC in Chicago, endorsing Kamala Harris, earlier this week.Kennedy though had expressed various other frustrations with the Democratic Party after being thwarted in his bid for the party nomination, and gradually drifted towards Trump, even having secret conversations with him which were leaked. His campaign started falling apart after a series of bizarre statements he made, including admitting to leaving a dead bear in Central Park and claiming that a worm ate part of his brain.Shortly before walking over to the MAGA camp , he attempted to negotiate a cabinet position in a prospective Harris White House but was rebuffed. Trump on the other hand has indicated he is open to the idea.The Harris camp appears unconcerned by the development, seeing the new alliance as a sign of Trump's weakness and desperation after polls showed him sliding against Kamala after leading against Biden.","Kennedy, 70, is the nephew of President John F.

As Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, Trump accused her of 'lying' and shared his live reactions on X through his Truth Social account.In anticipation of her address, Trump clearly expressed his intent to denounce Harris by posting on Truth Social, ""I'm getting ready to be fair but critical of Comrade Kamala Harris.My Play by Play will be on TRUTH Social, starting SOON!""As Harris began her speech, Trump wasted no time taking to social media to share his thoughts. He blasted her opening remarks, posting, ""Too many 'Thank yous,' too rapidly said, what's going on with her?""Trump went on tweeting spree on the vice president, focusing on her early remarks about her childhood and career aspirations. He urged her to address other pressing issues, writing, ""A lot of talk about childhood, we've got to get to the Border, Inflation, and Crime!""As Harris made a forceful defence of Ukraine and Nato in her speech, she attacked Trump’s past comments on the war in Ukraine.“As President, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our Nato allies,” Harris declared, highlighting her commitment to international alliances.She also said that five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, she warned President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and helped lead the US diplomatic response, rallying “more than 50 countries” to support Ukraine.In response, Trump defended his record on Nato, tweeting, ""Nato wasn’t paying their Bills, almost every Country was delinquent. When I said, 'If you don’t pay, we’re out, the United States is tired of being a sucker,' the money came rolling in by the BILLIONS, and I saved Nato!""Trump also seized the moment to criticise Harris on domestic issues, particularly immigration. As Harris also addressed about reforming America's broken immigration system in her speech at DNC.He accused her of wanting to grant citizenship to all undocumented immigrants. ""She just called to give all Illegals CITIZENSHIP, SAY GOODBYE TO THE USA! SHE IS A RADICAL MARXIST!"" Trump tweeted.Continuing his social media onslaught, Republican nominee posted, ""She talked about the Rule of Law but, as Border Czar, she allowed 20 Million people into our Country, many of them Criminals, who are MAIMING and KILLING our people!""Trump, with other top Republicans, has frequently labelled Harris a failed ""border czar"" in attacks on social media and during rally speeches, despite the fact that she never officially held this title. In March 2021, President Biden tasked Harris with addressing the ""root causes"" of migration to the US, a role distinct from direct oversight of border enforcement.Kamala Harris also highlighted Trump's past praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her speech, asserting, “I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators.”In reaction, Trump tweeted, ""The Tyrants are laughing at her; she’s weak and ineffective. For three and a half years, she has done nothing but enable them to become STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!""He further criticised Harris, stating, ""There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris because she will lead us into Nuclear World War III! She will never earn the respect of the Tyrants of the World!""Harris on the final night of DNC said that she would “always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself,” while also pressing for the release of hostages and a cease-fire deal.She also acknowledged the dire situation in Gaza, saying, “At the same time, what has happened in Gaza in the last 10 months is devastating, so many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing to safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.”On her statement, Trump criticised Harris's statements on Israel, posting, ""SHE HATES ISRAEL - Wouldn’t even show up to Congress for Netanyahu’s session!"" He also made inflammatory claims, asserting, ""She caused the Attack of October 7th.

In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts that have devastated their populations and infrastructure.To explore and understand which countries face the highest levels of danger, we turn to the Global Peace Index (GPI) compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations, highlighting those most impacted by war, violence, and unrest.This non-profit organization annually evaluates 163 countries across 23 indicators, including internal conflicts, societal safety, and levels of militarization, providing a comprehensive assessment of global peace and security. Here’s the list of the most dangerous countries in the world.With a 2024 GPI score of 3.397, Yemen continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. Since the onset of civil conflict in 2015, the nation has been plunged into chaos, with widespread famine, disease, and infrastructure collapse exacerbating the situation.The conflict, which started as an internal struggle, has been prolonged and intensified by the involvement of neighbouring countries, each backing different factions. This has only deepened the suffering of the Yemeni people, who face unimaginable hardships daily.Sudan remains one of the most dangerous countries globally, primarily due to ongoing conflicts in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In 2024, these conflicts resulted in over 3,000 deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people.The humanitarian crisis is severe, with frequent attacks on civilians by government forces, opposition groups, and militias. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 14 million people in Sudan are in dire need of humanitarian aid.South Sudan, with a GPI score of 3.324, remains one of the world's most perilous countries due to ongoing civil conflict, ethnic violence, and political instability. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has struggled to maintain peace and stability, with its citizens facing continuous threats from internal strife and external pressures.Afghanistan, with a 2024 GPI score of 3.294, continues to be one of the most dangerous countries worldwide. Decades of conflict, compounded by the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, have left the nation in a state of constant instability.The risks of terrorism, kidnappings, and widespread violence remain high, making Afghanistan a focal point of international concern.Ukraine has witnessed a significant decline in safety and stability, particularly since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. By 2024, the conflict has claimed over 150,000 lives, with millions more displaced both internally and externally.The destruction of cities and critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals, has created a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer from one of the deadliest conflicts in African history. The ongoing violence, which has spanned more than four and a half years, has resulted in more lives lost than any other conflict since World War II, according to the International Rescue Committee. The DRC remains a highly dangerous place, with widespread violence and instability threatening the lives of millions.In 2024, Russia's GPI score of 3.249 reflects the nation's increasing danger, exacerbated by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Internally, Russia faces significant challenges, including organized crime and corruption, which undermine law and order.Additionally, environmental concerns, such as industrial accidents and pollution, pose substantial health risks to the population.Since the onset of its civil war in 2011, Syria has been one of the world's most dangerous countries. The conflict has devastated infrastructure, leaving buildings, roads, hospitals, and schools in ruins.The humanitarian situation is dire, with over 13 million Syrians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced. Food insecurity is rampant, and the healthcare system is in disarray, with many hospitals destroyed or operating at minimal capacity.Mali has been embroiled in armed conflict since January 2012, when Tuareg rebels seized control of the northern territory, declaring the independent nation of Azawad by April of that year. The situation escalated further with a military coup in March 2012, deepening the turmoil in the region. Today, Mali remains one of the most dangerous countries, with ongoing violence and instability threatening the safety of its citizens","The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations. In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112702024,imgsize-29000,width-400,resizemode-4/112702024.jpg"

Post-Democratic Convention: What's next for Donald Trump in US elections?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/post-democratic-convention-whats-next-for-donald-trump-in-us-elections/articleshow/112774651.cms,"Trump’s strategy: A mixed approach

Personal vs policy focus

Reconciliation efforts

Defensive stance and abortion concerns

Election integrity

With the Democratic National Convention now behind us, the focus shifts to how former President Donald Trump will navigate the post-convention landscape. Trump's counter-convention tour has wrapped up, but his campaign 's struggle to keep pace with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is far from over.Trump's week-long tour across key battleground states highlighted the ongoing challenges he faces.The former president has been trying to define Harris, defend himself against Democratic jabs, and manage the reality of Harris pulling higher poll numbers than President Joe Biden before Biden exited the 2024 race last month.According to reports by US Today, on Friday, Trump made another push, aiming to address the abortion issue by asserting that his administration would be ""great for women and their reproductive rights."" This statement drew immediate criticism from Democrats, who pointed out Trump's role in appointing Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade. They also highlighted that many in his political base support abortion bans.While Trump held events in Nevada and Arizona, he also received an endorsement from Robert F Kennedy, Jr, who had recently suspended his own presidential campaign.As the campaign shifts gears, Trump will need to address the challenges presented by Harris' rising popularity. His campaign is expected to focus on Harris' ""radical"" record, though internal disagreements on strategy persist.In recent speeches, Trump has struggled with balancing personal attacks and policy discussions. During an event in Asheboro, North Carolina, Trump asked supporters whether he should ""get personal"" or ""talk about policy,"" with the crowd favoring a more personal approach. Despite this, Trump acknowledged the difficulty of sticking solely to policy when faced with attacks.Trump is also working to mend fences with some Republicans he has clashed with, including Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Following a recent attack on Kemp for his refusal to support Trump’s 2020 election protests, Trump reached out to the governor via Truth Social, expressing gratitude for his support in Georgia.Throughout the Democratic convention, Trump faced strong criticism from Harris and other Democrats over various issues, including his past attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, his hush money trial conviction, and his conservative policies. Harris highlighted the seriousness of a potential Trump return to the White House, with Trump responding on social media with reactions to her speech, US Today reported.Trump also addressed concerns about abortion rights, expressing a commitment to women’s reproductive rights while defending his administration’s record. Democrats have been quick to remind voters of his previous support for anti-abortion measures.Looking ahead to the November election, concerns persist about Trump's potential reaction to a loss. Despite his statement to CBS News that he would accept a ""free and fair"" result, his past behavior raises questions about whether he might challenge the outcome, echoing his actions following the 2020 election.As the campaign continues, Trump faces the task of managing his image, addressing policy issues, and preparing for the upcoming debates, including the first Trump-Harris debate scheduled for September 10 in Philadelphia.","Trump's week-long tour across key battleground states highlighted the ongoing challenges he faces.

Two veteran Nasa astronauts , Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita ""Suni"" Williams, who together have more than 500 days of spaceflight experience , became the first crew to launch aboard Boeing's Starliner space capsule on a test flight from Florida on June 5.Initially scheduled to return to Earth after about eight days, their mission has now been extended until early next year.Nasa decided to delay their return after deeming the Starliner's propulsion system issues, including leaks and thruster failures, too risky. The astronauts will instead return on a SpaceX vehicle.Due to leaks and thruster failures on the Starliner capsule, the mission of the two astronauts at the International Space Station (ISS) has been extended by several months.Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore, 61, is a retired US navy captain who served as a fighter pilot, completing four operational deployments, including 21 combat missions during the first Gulf War in the 1990s.Before joining Nasa's astronaut corps in 2000, Wilmore worked as a Navy test pilot and flight instructor.His space career began in 2009 when he first flew to the International Space Station (ISS) as a pilot on a Nasa space shuttle mission. He returned to the ISS in 2014 on a long-duration mission aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, spending several months as the station commander.Prior to his current mission on the Starliner, Wilmore had accumulated 178 days in space and completed four spacewalks.A native of Tennessee, Wilmore played college football at Tennessee Tech University and holds advanced degrees in electrical engineering and aviation systems. He is married and has two daughters.Sunita ""Suni"" Williams, 58, is a former US navy helicopter pilot with extensive experience flying over 30 different rotary aircraft.In the first Gulf War, she was part of a helicopter combat support squadron and later supported disaster relief operations in Florida following Hurricane Andrew. She returned to the naval test pilot school as a rotary aircraft instructor before joining Nasa's astronaut program in 1998.Williams first travelled to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a space shuttle and returned for a long-duration mission as a Soyuz passenger with two cosmonauts. Her two ISS tours, in 2006-2007 and 2012, were focused on science expeditions.During her time aboard the ISS, Williams set a world record for the most time spent by a woman in orbit outside a spacecraft, totalling 50 hours and 40 minutes across seven spacewalks.However, her record has since been surpassed by Peggy Whitson, Williams remains notable for her achievements. In 2012, she became the second woman to serve as ISS commander.An enthusiastic athlete, Williams became the first person to complete a marathon in space in 2007, virtually participating in the Boston Marathon and finishing in four hours and 24 minutes using the space station's treadmill.In 2012, Sunita Williams completed the first triathlon in space, using the space station's treadmill, stationary bicycle, and a resistance machine.Before her Starliner mission, she had spent 322 days in space and was the first woman on the inaugural crewed flight of a new spacecraft. Originally from Massachusetts, Williams now resides in Houston with her husband, a former helicopter pilot and current federal police officer.","Two veteran Nasa astronauts Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita ""Suni"" Williams have more than 500 days of spaceflight experience.

I said, 'I didn't know that; he told me he voted for me.

According to the Canton Police Department, Ferrell first stomped on the cat’s head, killing it before proceeding to publicly eat the deceased animal.The shocking incident led to Ferrell’s arrest later that night.Court records reveal she has been charged with injuring animals, disorderly conduct, and violations related to the treatment of companion animals. During her arraignment on Monday, Ferrell was given an initial bond set at $100,000, the Daily mail reported.The act of eating domestic pets has long been considered inhumane in the United States. This sentiment was recently highlighted when former presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr faced backlash over a photograph that some claimed showed him eating barbecued dog. Kennedy defended himself, asserting that the meat in question was from a goat.In 2018, the US House of Representatives passed legislation to ban the slaughter of dogs and cats for food. The bipartisan bill aimed to amend the federal Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the consumption of these animals, reflecting a growing consensus against such practices.","Allexis Telia Ferrell, 27, allegedly killed and consumed a cat in front of her neighbors.

The modern female fantasy is embodied by the man who might soon become our first First Gentleman. Emhoff appears to be a genuine mensch with an impressive career.

Even if women remain more likely to become primary caregivers and stay-at-home parents than men are, the ideal beau is one who treats this arrangement as a real choice, not a default predetermined by gender. Women at least want a mate who won’t resent their career success — a tangible concern, given that divorce has been statistically more likely when women received job promotions or outearn their husbands. Hence, the Emhoffian “wife guy” fantasy.
