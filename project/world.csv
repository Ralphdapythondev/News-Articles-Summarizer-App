However, what seemed like a cosmic spectacle was actually an optical illusion .The phenomenon was caused by light refracting through the layered glass of the hospital window, producing what are known as ""virtual images."" Each pane of glass contributed to the appearance of a separate sun.Despite the scientific explanation , social media users had fun speculating about the cause of the ""seven suns."" On Weibo, one user joked, ""We’ve finally uncovered the truth about global warming,"" while another humorously suggested a ""magnetic field glitch"" had caused parallel universes to overlap, but reassured viewers that ""the Cosmic Bureau has fixed the issue.""The optical illusion also garnered attention on Reddit, where users drew comparisons to the Chinese myth of Hou Yi, a cosmic archer who shot down nine of Earth’s 10 suns to prevent the planet from burning up. One Redditor quipped, ""When Earth has astigmatism,"" while another humorously questioned if the sight was a ""system apocalypse"" or a consequence of China's well-known air pollution issues.Ultimately, the ""seven suns"" were a reminder of how easily our senses can be deceived by natural phenomena, sparking a mix of awe, humor, and curiosity among those who witnessed or heard about the event.","A woman in Chengdu, China, captured a video showing seven suns in the sky.

""She's staying away from policy because the more she talks about it, the less popular she becomes,"" Ramaswamy was quoted as saying by PTI. He argued that this strategy is designed to shield her from criticism and preserve her public image.Ramaswamy, who was flown into Chicago by the Trump Campaign, did not hold back in his criticism of Harris's economic policies and her record on border issues.

Obama’s call for a new chapter

A swipe at Trump’s ‘Stale act’

Praise for

Joe Biden

and Tim Walz

A convention highlight

Barack Obama energized the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday with a powerful endorsement of Kamala Harris and a sharp critique of former President Donald Trump . Addressing a cheering crowd, Obama asserted that America is ready for a new chapter under President Harris, dismissing Trump's approach as stale and ineffective.Barack Obama, America’s first Black president, urged delegates to back Harris as she seeks to make history on November 5 as the first woman and the first Black and South Asian US president.“I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling fired up!” Obama said, rallying the crowd with his characteristic enthusiasm.He praised Kamala Harris, declaring, “America is ready for a new chapter. America’s ready for a better story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.” Obama highlighted Harris’s dedication and hard-fought journey to success, contrasting her with Trump’s divisive rhetoric.Obama took a moment to reflect on the international stakes of the election. “By the way, that doesn’t just matter to people in this country. The rest of the world is watching to see if we can actually pull it off,” he said. “We shouldn’t be the world’s policeman, and we can’t eradicate every cruelty and injustice in the world. But America can be, must be, a force for good – discouraging conflict, fighting disease, promoting human rights, protecting the planet from climate change, defending freedom. That’s what Kamala Harris believes – and so do most Americans.”As the crowd erupted into chants of “Yes, she can!” Obama championed Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, as leaders dedicated to the working class. “In this new economy, we need a president who actually cares about the millions of people all across this country who wake up every day to do the essential, often thankless work to care for our sick and clean our streets and deliver our packages,” he said. “Kamala will be that president.”Obama did not hold back in his critique of Trump. “It’s one of the oldest tricks in politics – from a guy whose act has gotten pretty stale. We don’t need four more years of bluster and chaos. We’ve seen that movie – and we all know that the sequel’s usually worse,” Obama said.He dismissed Trump’s tenure as a series of grievances and conspiracies, referencing Trump’s fixation on crowd sizes and nicknames. “Here’s a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator,” Obama quipped.Turning to Joe Biden, Obama expressed pride in his former vice president’s tenure and character. “This country will remember him as an outstanding president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger,” Obama said, adding that he was “even prouder to call him my friend.”Obama also extolled Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Biden’s running mate, for his genuine character and commitment to service. “Tim’s the kind of person who should be in politics – somebody who was born in a small town, served his country, taught kids, coached football, and took care of his neighbors,” Obama said, noting Walz’s authentic style.At 63, Barack Obama played a significant role in persuading Biden to step aside and endorse Harris. Harris, 59, has gained momentum with record-breaking fundraising and enthusiastic support.Speaking virtually from a rally in Milwaukee, Harris criticized Trump for his lack of remorse over the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. ""I do believe, you know, bad behavior should result in a consequence. Well, we will make sure he does face a consequence and that will be at the ballot box in November,"" Harris asserted.The former president’s speech, following Michelle Obama’s heartfelt introduction, was a highlight of the convention. As the jumbotron displayed images of Tim Walz and his supportive wife Gwen, the crowd responded with enthusiasm.Michelle Obama, introduced by her husband, echoed the call for change. ""America, hope is making a comeback,"" she said, referencing her husband’s first campaign in 2008. She warned that Trump would attempt to distort Harris' truth, likening his attempts to previous efforts to discredit the Obamas. ""His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,"" Michelle Obama said, prompting a strong response from the crowd.The convention also saw Republicans who have distanced themselves from Trump address the delegates. Former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and former Trump supporter Kyle Sweetser shared their experiences, with Grisham recounting her resignation after the January 6 Capitol attack. Republican Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona, called for a return to the principles of the late Senator John McCain, emphasizing the need to move beyond Trump’s influence.Outside the convention, a protest near Chicago's Israeli consulate turned briefly violent, with a smaller group clashing with police. Most convention speakers avoided the topic of US support for Israel in the Gaza conflict, although Senator Bernie Sanders called for an end to the war and an immediate ceasefire.",Barack Obama urged delegates to back Kamala Harris as she seeks to make history on November 5 as the first woman and the first Black and South Asian US president. Obama highlighted Harris’s dedication and hard-fought journey to success. Obama did not hold back in his critique of Trump.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112668824,imgsize-443307,width-400,resizemode-4/112668824.jpg"

After undergoing quadruple-bypass surgery, he transitioned to a mostly vegan diet, giving up his beloved McDonald’s for health reasons.Former President Donald Trump has also been known for his affinity for McDonald’s, continuing the fast-food legacy among recent presidents.","Former President Bill Clinton joked that Vice President Kamala Harris will break his record for spending the most time at McDonald's.

In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts that have devastated their populations and infrastructure.To explore and understand which countries face the highest levels of danger, we turn to the Global Peace Index (GPI) compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations, highlighting those most impacted by war, violence, and unrest.This non-profit organization annually evaluates 163 countries across 23 indicators, including internal conflicts, societal safety, and levels of militarization, providing a comprehensive assessment of global peace and security. Here’s the list of the most dangerous countries in the world.With a 2024 GPI score of 3.397, Yemen continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. Since the onset of civil conflict in 2015, the nation has been plunged into chaos, with widespread famine, disease, and infrastructure collapse exacerbating the situation.The conflict, which started as an internal struggle, has been prolonged and intensified by the involvement of neighbouring countries, each backing different factions. This has only deepened the suffering of the Yemeni people, who face unimaginable hardships daily.Sudan remains one of the most dangerous countries globally, primarily due to ongoing conflicts in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In 2024, these conflicts resulted in over 3,000 deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people.The humanitarian crisis is severe, with frequent attacks on civilians by government forces, opposition groups, and militias. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 14 million people in Sudan are in dire need of humanitarian aid.South Sudan, with a GPI score of 3.324, remains one of the world's most perilous countries due to ongoing civil conflict, ethnic violence, and political instability. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has struggled to maintain peace and stability, with its citizens facing continuous threats from internal strife and external pressures.Afghanistan, with a 2024 GPI score of 3.294, continues to be one of the most dangerous countries worldwide. Decades of conflict, compounded by the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, have left the nation in a state of constant instability.The risks of terrorism, kidnappings, and widespread violence remain high, making Afghanistan a focal point of international concern.Ukraine has witnessed a significant decline in safety and stability, particularly since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. By 2024, the conflict has claimed over 150,000 lives, with millions more displaced both internally and externally.The destruction of cities and critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals, has created a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer from one of the deadliest conflicts in African history. The ongoing violence, which has spanned more than four and a half years, has resulted in more lives lost than any other conflict since World War II, according to the International Rescue Committee. The DRC remains a highly dangerous place, with widespread violence and instability threatening the lives of millions.In 2024, Russia's GPI score of 3.249 reflects the nation's increasing danger, exacerbated by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Internally, Russia faces significant challenges, including organized crime and corruption, which undermine law and order.Additionally, environmental concerns, such as industrial accidents and pollution, pose substantial health risks to the population.Since the onset of its civil war in 2011, Syria has been one of the world's most dangerous countries. The conflict has devastated infrastructure, leaving buildings, roads, hospitals, and schools in ruins.The humanitarian situation is dire, with over 13 million Syrians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced. Food insecurity is rampant, and the healthcare system is in disarray, with many hospitals destroyed or operating at minimal capacity.Mali has been embroiled in armed conflict since January 2012, when Tuareg rebels seized control of the northern territory, declaring the independent nation of Azawad by April of that year. The situation escalated further with a military coup in March 2012, deepening the turmoil in the region. Today, Mali remains one of the most dangerous countries, with ongoing violence and instability threatening the safety of its citizens","The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations.

Advisers’ concerns over personal attacks

Controversy

overshadows policy

Donald Trump , though not present in Chicago, has a noticeable influence on the Democratic National Convention (DNC) events taking place there. Despite his aides' claims that he isn't interested in watching the DNC , a senior campaign official confirmed that the former president is indeed following the events and is irritated by the attacks against him, the BBC reported.While Trump’s campaign strategy initially aimed to focus on the economy, the border, and crime through a series of rallies , nightly anti-Trump speeches at the DNC have made it challenging for him to stay on message, with his campaign now seemingly directed by crowd reactions and his own impulses.Trump has scheduled rallies in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, and Arizona, each aiming to highlight political and economic topics. However, consistent personal attacks against him during the DNC have led him to ask his supporters whether he should remain policy-focused or respond to the attacks. At a rally in North Carolina, Trump addressed the issue directly with his audience.""They always say, 'Sir, please stick to policy, don't get personal'... and yet [the Democrats are] getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick to policy?"" Trump asked. His supporters responded enthusiastically for him to go personal, to which he joked, ""My advisers are fired!"" He then indicated his intent to focus on policy but also not overlook the attacks.This approach is causing concern for his campaign advisers who wish for Trump to focus on policy issues rather than engaging in controversial personal attacks. One adviser, speaking anonymously, mentioned that their primary challenge is keeping Trump concentrated on policy issues and away from personal controversies.""It doesn't matter what he talks about for 45 minutes,"" the adviser said. ""One comment or answer to a question gives the left all they need to change the subject.""Trump’s tendencies to deviate into personal attacks were visible when he criticised Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro on social media late Wednesday night after Shapiro's speech at the DNC.""The highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, made a really bad and poorly delivered speech,"" Trump wrote. ""I have done more for Israel than any President…Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will.""The inclusion of Shapiro's religious background drew attention and was highlighted by US morning shows as a racial dog whistle. Similar sentiments emerged after the Obamas criticised Trump at the DNC. At his North Carolina rally, Trump made a pointed response.""Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night?"" Trump said. ""He was taking shots at your president. And so was Michelle.""The usage of Obama's middle name, ""Hussein,"" is often interpreted as an attempt to provoke racial animosity. Such instances of racial innuendo complicate the efforts of Trump’s campaign advisers, who find that controversy tends to overshadow substantive policy discussions.With Trump’s campaign strategy appearing to fluctuate based on crowd responses and the personal attacks flying at the DNC, his advisers are left grappling with a candidate who thrives on controversy. This presents an ongoing challenge to maintain a consistent focus on policy and attacking his opponent's weaknesses rather than personal back-and-forths.","Donald Trump has a noticeable influence on the Democratic National Convention (DNC) events taking place in Chicago.

CHICAGO: Vice President Kamala Harris will try to redefine herself for America and draw a sharp contrast with Republican Donald Trump on Thursday when she accepts the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nomination.""In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious,"" Harris will say, according to advance excerpts of the speech.The four-day Democratic National Convention has drawn some of the biggest names in politics and music, including megastar Beyonce who will perform on Thursday, entertainment website TMZ reported, citing multiple sources.Harris emerged as the Democratic candidate little more than a month ago when allies of President Joe Biden , 81, forced him to quit the race. If successful, she stands to make history as the first woman elected U.S. president.Harris, 59, will talk about her life as the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother and lay out her plans to tackle rising costs and advance personal freedoms, including abortion rights, aides said.Alluding to the divisive rhetoric Trump has used on the campaign trail, Harris promised to ""be a president for all Americans.""A former California attorney general, Harris' presidential ambitions were apparent for years, but they had been undermined by her own shaky 2020 campaign and bumps along the way of her nearly four years as vice president.""With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past. A chance to chart a New Way Forward.

Victims of gun violence, including former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, will also appear.Former U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Trump, is one of several Republicans to speak at the convention for Harris and against Trump.Over the last three days, Democrats have sought to define themselves as the voice of American values from small towns to overseas.Her forceful stump speeches have been met by a surge in enthusiasm from voters ahead of the Nov. 5 election. Harris has raised a record-breaking $500 million in a month and has narrowed the gap or taken the lead against Trump in many opinion polls of battleground states that will decide the election.Outside the convention center, thousands of Palestinian supporters gathered to protest U.S. support for Israel as it wages war in Gaza. The issue is one of the most divisive among Democrats and got little attention at the convention, which could hurt them at the polls.Harris has yet to articulate much of her vision for the country, and Republicans say Democrats have spent more time attacking Trump than elaborating on how they would govern.Harris has spent weeks on the speech, making changes to drafts from lead speechwriter Adam Frankel, including during campaign trips on Air Force Two.Aides say she will discuss her plans to cut taxes for most Americans, boost the housing supply and ban what she calls ""price gouging"" by grocers. Her campaign has also proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.The speech will include elements of foreign policy along with stories of women affected by abortion bans and other curbs on reproductive rights, aides and advisers said.Trump, campaigning this week in a handful of battleground states, accused Harris at an Arizona stop along the U.S.-Mexico border of not doing enough to prevent illegal immigration.","Vice President Kamala Harris will accept the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nomination.

Kennedy's appeal among independents falters

Family legacy fails to propel Kennedy forward

Legal challenges add to Kennedy’s troubles

Recent polls indicate that Republicans have a more favourable opinion of independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr compared to Democrats . Allies of former President Donald Trump are urging Kennedy to drop out and endorse Trump, as Kennedy's support wanes amid recent political shifts, including President Joe Biden’s withdrawal and Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination.According to the Associated Press, polls show that Kennedy's presence doesn't significantly impact support for either major-party candidate, as his approval now hovers in the mid-single digits.Kennedy, the 70-year-old son of former US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, is struggling to solidify his stance in a complex race. He plans to speak in Phoenix on Friday about ""the present historical moment and his path forward,"" following his running mate's discussions about potentially endorsing Trump instead.In a July AP-NORC poll conducted before Biden exited the race, Americans were evenly divided in their views of Kennedy, reflecting a decline from February when more people viewed him favourably. About 2 in 10 US adults lacked enough information about Kennedy to form an opinion in the most recent poll.Republicans are more inclined than Democrats and independents to view Kennedy favourably. Among those who have a positive impression of Kennedy, 52 per cent also have a favourable view of Trump, compared to 37 per cent for Harris.However, Kennedy has not been successful in winning over political independents. Despite running as an independent, about 4 in 10 independents remain uninformed about him, and those who do have an opinion are equally divided between favourable and unfavourable views.Kennedy’s initial appeal stemmed from being an alternative to Biden and Trump, a matchup many voters hoped to avoid. A Pew Research Center poll in July found that half of Kennedy supporters backed him mainly because he wasn't Biden or Trump, while about 30 per cent were drawn by his characteristics or policies.Harris’ elevation to the Democratic nomination seems to have further hurt Kennedy’s campaign. An August Pew poll suggests that Harris gained support from some women and non-white voters who might have otherwise supported Kennedy.Kennedy's family name has been a significant factor in his appeal. Many Democrats considered supporting him due to his connections to the Kennedy family, including his father and uncle, former President John F. Kennedy. Despite this, numerous Kennedy family members endorsed Biden before his withdrawal from the race.John F Kennedy remains highly regarded across party lines, with a Gallup retrospective approval rating revealing that 9 in 10 Americans approve of his presidency. This admiration spans Democrats, independents, and Republicans alike.Adding to his political difficulties, a New York judge ruled last week that Kennedy should not appear on the ballot in the state due to a ""sham"" address listed on nominating petitions. Kennedy has appealed this decision and faces several similar challenges across the country.With diminishing support and increasing complications, Kennedy's political future appears uncertain as his campaign contemplates the next steps.","Republicans are more inclined than Democrats and independents to view Kennedy favourably.

Conservative figures such as Ann Coulter and podcaster Mike Crispi mocked Gus, with Crispi derogatorily labeling him a ""puffy beta male."" The backlash from these comments has ignited a broader discussion on the bullying that children with disabilities frequently endure.Advocates have condemned the online vitriol directed at Gus, highlighting that children with disabilities are significantly more likely to be bullied than their peers. Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, called the attacks ""a painful reminder"" of the daily challenges these children face, emphasizing the long-term impact bullying can have on their academic and social development.Kristen Eccleston, a former special education teacher, noted that children with learning disabilities are often targeted because they may struggle with communication or social skills. She stressed the importance of surrounding children like Gus with support and fostering open discussions about emotions to help them develop resilience.The bullying incident has also drawn attention to the role of social media in enabling such behavior. Anne Strober, a parent of a child with autism, expressed her dismay at the cruelty displayed online, pointing out the anonymity that emboldens bullies. Strober emphasized that children, particularly those with disabilities, should be off-limits to such attacks.While the Walz campaign has declined to comment on the incident, the impact of this bullying has resonated beyond the political arena, serving as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by children with disabilities in an increasingly digital world.","Tim Walz's 17-year-old son, Gus, has a nonverbal learning disorder, anxiety, and ADHD.

'I want to study'

DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan , 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.""I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,"" Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.""But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.""Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity .The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.""This has led to a new trend of ' monsoon brides ',"" said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.""Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.""Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.""Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,"" said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.""They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done"".Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.""My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,"" she said.""I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,"" she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.""Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.""Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.""We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,"" said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.""They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,"" she added.""The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.""Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.Unicef has reported ""significant strides"" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.""We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,"" it said in a report after the 2022 floods.Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.""When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities',"" the daily wage labourer told AFP.Mehtab was just 10 years old.""The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep,"" said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.""I have told my father I want to study,"" she said. ""I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself.""","Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years. But after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise. The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112579857,imgsize-1225816,width-400,resizemode-4/112579857.jpg"

Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka top court finds president Wickremesinghe guilty of 'unlawful conduct' over election delay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-top-court-finds-president-wickremesinghe-guilty-of-unlawful-conduct-over-election-delay/articleshow/112716801.cms,"Sri Lanka 's top court has found President Ranil Wickremesinghe guilty of "" unlawful conduct "" for delaying local elections , which were seen as an unofficial referendum on his economic policies . According to AFP news agency, the verdict was delivered by a five-judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya. It does not carry immediate legal consequences due to Wickremesinghe's immunity while in office.However, it places a spotlight on the state of the economy ahead of next month's presidential election.The March 2023 local polls were postponed, making the September 21 presidential election the first opportunity for voters to weigh in on Wickremesinghe’s administration since he assumed office. Wickremesinghe, who took over after the resignation of Gotabaya Rajapaksa amid widespread protests over a severe economic crisis, is seeking re-election for a five-year term.The Supreme Court ruled that Wickremesinghe failed to allocate funds for the local elections, which was previously mandated by court order. His administration argued that the funds were necessary for public servants and pensions. The court criticised Wickremesinghe’s ""arbitrary and unlawful conduct,"" which it said violated constitutional rights.In response, Wickremesinghe defended the postponement of the local elections, saying he was ""not sorry"" for the delay, as it was necessary to address the economic challenges and ensure the right to life. He promised to protect both the right to vote and live.The court has ordered the independent election commission to conduct the local polls as soon as possible, ensuring they do not interfere with the upcoming presidential vote. The state has also been directed to cover the legal fees of the petitioners who challenged the postponement.Wickremesinghe, who was elected interim president by lawmakers in July 2022 following Rajapaksa’s resignation, secured a $2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in March 2023. This followed significant measures, including tax hikes and energy price increases. The postponed local election was widely regarded as a referendum on these severe measures.","Sri Lanka's top court has found President Ranil Wickremesinghe guilty of "" unlawful conduct"" for delaying local elections.
