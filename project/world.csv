SYDNEY: Australia faces the risk of power shortages because of delays in installing transmission lines tied to wind and solar farms, the energy market operator said on Tuesday, posing a challenge to the country's energy transition plans.In an updated outlook for the electricity market, the Australian Energy Market Operator ( AEMO ) said the delay in commissioning dates for EnergyConnect , a 900 km (559 miles) transmission line to connect grids across three states, as well as the mothballing and retirement of gas and diesel power generators in South Australia could impact the power grid.Australia's power industry is struggling to meet the government's target for 82% renewable power by 2030 from around 40% now due to challenges in expanding transmission networks to handle new renewable projects located far from demand centres.Compared to last year's outlook, the AEMO report said reliability risks have increased in New South Wales and Victoria, the two biggest power-consuming states, from 2024-25 to 2027-28, and in South Australia in 2026-27.AEMO CEO Daniel Westerman said, ""While new generation and storage capacity continues to increase, project development and commissioning delays are impacting reliability throughout the horizon.""Westerman said AEMO would bid for backup supplies to support Victoria and New South Wales to avoid supply gaps next summer, which usually begins in December in the southern hemisphere.Several Australian farmers are refusing to let high-voltage overhead power lines cross their land, which threatens plans to boost renewable generation and cut emissions.To avoid supply shortages, about 10,000 km (6,200 miles) of new and upgraded transmission line is required, the operator said in a report in December.","Australia's power industry is struggling to meet the government's target for 82% renewable power by 2030 from around 40% now.

"Trump trial turns chaotic as judge clears court, warns witness",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels/articleshow/110286253.cms,"‘Staring me down’

Admitted theft

‘It upset him’

The Donald Trump hush-money trial briefly devolved into chaos after the judge cleared the courtroom and warned a defense witness not to give him “side eye.”Trump had called his second defense witness, attorney Robert Costello, to testify Monday about his interactions in 2018 with the prosecution’s star witness, Michael Cohen , when the conflict erupted in the New York courtroom.Costello repeatedly gave answers that went beyond the questions, prompting Judge Juan Merchan to sustain objections from prosecutors and strike the testimony. After one such ruling, Costello said, “Jeez.” The judge looked at him and said, “I’m sorry?” And then Costello said, “stricken,” referring to his own remark.After more questions, Merchan finally stopped the proceedings and asked the jury to leave.“Mr. Costello, I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” a visibly angry Merchan said. “If you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez’ and then you don’t say ‘Strike it’ because I’m the only one who can strike testimony in my courtroom.”After that admonition, Merchan appeared ready to proceed. But then he said: “You don’t give me side eye and you don’t roll your eyes.” The judge asked: “Are you staring me down right now?”With that, the judge said: “Clear the courtroom.” Dozens of people in the gallery, most of whom were media members, were ordered by guards to leave. Most people didn’t understand why they were being escorted out. The former president and his lawyers had remained in the courtroom, along with prosecutors.After several minutes, the judge allowed the public and the press to return. The judge recalled the jury, and Costello resumed his testimony, appearing chastened.Costello had earlier testified that Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, insisted to him in an April 2018 meeting that Trump knew nothing about a $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Cohen testified that he didn’t tell Costello about the Daniels payment because he didn’t trust him.Earlier Monday, prosecutors rested their case after Cohen finished his fourth day on the witness stand. The government alleges Trump falsified business records to cover up the payment, which Cohen testified was meant to bury the Daniels story of having a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.Costello said he first met Cohen days after the FBI raided his home, office and hotel suite. Cohen had testified that Costello wanted to set up a back channel to Trump and make sure he didn’t cooperate with prosecutors.But Costello disputed that, saying he only wanted to protect Cohen’s interests.“He was absolutely manic at the beginning and throughout the two hours of that meeting,” Costello said. “He said ‘My life is shattered, my family’s life is shattered. What’s my escape route?”’During earlier testimony Monday, Cohen admitted he stole $30,000 from Trump by adding phony expenses to his hush-money reimbursement. During his fourth day on the witness stand, Cohen was grilled on cross examination about a key element of a larger repayment he received for the $130,000 he paid to Daniels.That repayment included another $50,000 that Cohen said he paid to Red Finch, a technology company that did work to help Trump boost his standing in a pre-election CNBC poll. Trump had refused to pay the firm, so Cohen said he stepped in with his own money. But he testified he’d only paid Red Finch $20,000, passing the cash to the company’s chief executive officer in a paper bag.“You stole from the Trump Organization?” Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked.“Yes, sir,” Cohen said.Cohen said he felt entitled to take the money. He said he’d sought to protect Trump “the best that I could” and assisted his campaign, but was “very upset” when the billionaire cut his annual bonus in December 2016 by two-thirds — even after Cohen had used his own funds on Trump’s behalf for the payments to Daniels and Red Finch.“I was angered because of the reduction of funds,” Cohen said. “I felt it was almost like self-help. I wasn’t going to let him benefit in this way.”While Cohen initially testified to the Red Finch payment last week, he was asked about details of the theft Monday. He said he felt “pressured” to pay Red Finch for its work, so he got cash from his own account to give $20,000 to the company CEO.“It was in a small brown paper bag,” Cohen said. “He came to the office and I gave him the cash.”Blanche continued attempts to depict him as a liar and thief who’s made millions of dollars rooting for Trump’s demise through his books, podcasts and interviews.He pleaded guilty twice in 2018 to various crimes, but was never charged for the Red Finch theft, he said. The defense lawyers are trying to undermine Cohen’s credibility to suggest he was lying in testifying that Trump authorized the payments to influence the election.Cohen said Red Finch was hired by the Trump Organization to improve Trump’s standing in a CNBC poll. Trump ranked near the bottom, “and it upset him,” because he is one of the most famous business executives of the past century, Cohen said.A Red Finch executive told Cohen that he could acquire IP addresses “to create an algorithm to ensure that Mr. Trump would rise and rise significantly in this poll.”The firm managed to boost his standing to ninth, fearing that going to the top spot would raise red flags.Trump didn’t want to pay though, because “CNBC ended up not continuing and moving forward with this poll, and so he didn’t feel that he had gotten the benefit of what the services were supposed to ultimately provide,” Cohen said.Cohen then decided to pay Red Finch on his own, he testified.After the government rested its case, Merchan said that he now expects closing arguments in the trial to take place on May 28.","Defense witness Robert Costello repeatedly gave answers that went beyond the questions.

Who is Ebrahim Raisi?

Won presidential poll in 2021

What Ebrahim Raisi’s rule mean for Iran and the world?

(With AP inputs)

NEW DELHI: A helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi crashed in east Azerbaijan on Sunday.Iran has confirmed that the president was onboard the helicopter along with foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian as well as two senior east Azerbaijan leaders.Rescuers are trying to reach the site of the ""incident"", state television reported. There was no immediate details on what happened to the chopper.Iran's hard-line President has long been seen as a protégé to Iran's supreme leader and a potential successor for his position within the country's Shiite theocracy.Reports of the ""hard landing"" of the chopper carrying Raisi have brought new attention to the leader, who already faces sanctions from the US and other nations over his involvement in the mass execution of prisoners in 1988.Ebrahim Raisi has served as a prosecutor for the majority of his career. In 2019, Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei named Raisi as chief justice. This appointment raised human rights concerns on account of his links to the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988 post the Iran-Iraq war.Amnesty International pointed out that the then-deputy prosecutor of Tehran served as a member of the “death commission”. Raisi has been identified as one of the four appointed judges responsible for the death sentences of 5,000 prisoners.On the contrary, the 60-year-old introduce himself as the best individual to battle corruption and tackle Iran’s financial issues.Raisi is viewed as a protégé of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and some analysts suggested that he could have replaced the 85-year-old leader after his death or resignation from the role.Raisi ran unsuccessfully for president in 2017 against Hassan Rouhani, the relatively moderate cleric who as president reached Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.In 2021, Raisi ran again in an election that saw all of his potentially prominent opponents barred for running under Iran's vetting system. He swept nearly 62% of the 28.9 million votes, the lowest turnout by percentage in the Islamic Republic's history. Millions stayed home and others voided ballots.Raisi has vowed to ease unemployment and work after lifting sanctions, especially on oil and shipping, imposed by America back in 2018. These sanctions are believed to have added to monetary hardship for Iranians.The 2015 nuclear deal with the P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) offered Iran some relief from western sanctions on condition that the country will limit its nuclear production and activities. But in 2018, former US president Donald Trump stepped off the deal, which led to the re-imposition of sanctions on Iran’s trade business.The Middle Eastern country retaliated by resuming nuclear operations. Talks of restoring the nuclear deal are ongoing, with US president Joe Biden reluctant to lift sanctions.Raisi also supported attacking Israel in a massive assault in April that saw over 300 drones and missiles fired at the country in response for a suspected Israeli attack that killed Iranian generals at the country's embassy compound in Damascus, Syria - itself a widening of a yearslong shadow war between the two countries.The Iranian president also backed the country's security services as they cracked down on all dissent, including in the aftermath of the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the nationwide protests that followed.The months-long security crackdown killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. In March, a United Nations investigative panel found that Iran was responsible for the ""physical violence"" that led to Amini's death after her arrest for not wearing a hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.","Ebrahim Raisi was on board the helicopter when it crashed in east Azerbaijan.

'It wasn't us': Israel on Iran President Raisi's chopper crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/could-israel-be-behind-the-crash-of-iranian-president-ebrahim-raisis-helicopter/articleshow/110261625.cms,"Israel's possible involvement?

NEW DELHI: Israel on Monday denied involvement in the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash that also killed several official of his entourage.""It wasn't us,"" news agency Reuters quoted an official, who requested anonymity.Ebrahim Raisi, the Iranian President known for his hard-line stance and close ties to the country's supreme leader, passed away at the age of 63.Raisi played a significant role in the mass executions of thousands in 1988 and later presided over Iran as it pursued uranium enrichment to near weapons-grade levels and carried out a substantial drone-and-missile attack on Israel.The unexpected demise of Raisi, along with Iran's foreign minister and other officials, occurred in a helicopter crash on Sunday in the northwestern region of Iran.The crash of Raisi's helicopter has sparked speculation and raised questions about the circumstances surrounding the incident. As Iran grapples with the loss of its president, a cloud of uncertainty looms over the nation, with implications that could reverberate across the Middle East.The death of President Raisi is likely to not only trigger a high-stakes power struggle within Iran but also have significant implications for the region. Amid a backdrop of escalating tensions and conflicts, the sudden absence of a key political figure like Raisi could disrupt the delicate balance of power within Iran and beyond.While the official explanation for the crash points to bad weather conditions, including rain and fog that hampered visibility during the flight, speculation has emerged regarding the possibility of foul play. Given Raisi's controversial tenure and the internal and external challenges facing Iran, questions have been raised about the potential involvement of domestic foes or even external actors like Israel.Given the historical animosity between Iran and Israel, some Iranians have speculated that Israel could be behind the crash, a report in the Economist said. This theory gains traction considering recent escalations, including Israel's assassination of an Iranian general in Damascus and Iran's subsequent missile barrage. The Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, is known for its operations against Iranian interests, though it has never targeted a head of state.Experts, however, find the theory of Israeli involvement unlikely. Assassinating a sitting president would be a direct act of war, likely provoking a severe response from Iran. Israel's strategic focus has traditionally been on military and nuclear targets rather than high-profile political assassinations. ""There are strong reasons to doubt Israel’s involvement. It has never gone so far as to assassinate a head of state, an unequivocal act of war that would invite a fierce Iranian response,"" the Economist report said.However, the helicopter crash's timing exacerbates regional tensions. Iran's network of proxies across Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen complicates the geopolitical landscape, particularly with the ongoing conflict involving Israel and Hamas. Any instability within Iran's leadership could embolden these groups, potentially leading to broader conflict.(With inputs from agencies)","Ebrahim Raisi, the Iranian President known for his hard-line stance and close ties to the country's supreme leader, passed away at the age of 63.

NEW DELHI: Mohammad Mokhber who was Iran's first vice president, has been appointed as the interim president following Mohammad Raisi's death in a chopper crash on May 19. Born on September 1, 1955, in Dezful, Khuzestan Province, he has a background in business administration and management. Known for his close ties to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , Mokhber assumed the role of first vice president in 2021 following Ebrahim Raisi 's election as president.In his capacity as interim president, Mokhber is part of a three-person council, along with the Speaker of Parliament and the head of the judiciary, responsible for organizing a new presidential election within 50 days if the president dies.Mokhber held several significant positions in Iran's economic and industrial sectors, notably serving as the head of Setad, an investment fund linked to the Supreme Leader. Setad, officially the Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam, was established by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to manage and sell properties abandoned after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, with proceeds primarily directed to charity.Mokhber was also involved in international dealings and was part of a delegation that visited Moscow in October, agreeing to supply surface-to-surface missiles and drones to Russia's military. This delegation included senior officials from Iran's Revolutionary Guards and an official from the Supreme National Security Council.His activities have led to international scrutiny. In 2010, the European Union sanctioned Mokhber for alleged involvement in nuclear or ballistic missile activities, though he was removed from the list two years later.

NEW DELHI: Twenty-one sailors aboard the Dali ship are enduring severe hardships as they remain stranded at sea. The vessel, which has been immobilized for an extended period due to mechanical issues , has left the crew in a precarious situation without access to essential resources.One of the sailors, speaking on the condition of anonymity, shed light on the dire conditions they are facing: “Life is tough.We don’t have access to proper food, water, or medical supplies. The situation is getting worse every day.” The sailor’s account highlights the urgent need for relief and assistance, as the crew’s basic needs are not being met, a New York Post report said.The ordeal began when the Dali ship encountered mechanical problems that halted its journey, leaving it adrift and unable to reach a safe harbor. Despite efforts to secure assistance, the response has been sluggish, compounding the crew's struggles. The lack of immediate aid has left the sailors feeling isolated and abandoned.Another sailor shared the emotional toll of their situation: “We are trying to stay hopeful, but it’s hard. We need help soon.” The prolonged uncertainty and harsh living conditions have taken a significant toll on the crew's morale and well-being. The sailors are confined to the ship with limited communication with the outside world, adding to their sense of isolation.The update came following reports that the 20 Indian crew stuck in Baltimore can not pay bills for their families in India as their phones have been confiscated by the probe agencies.Authorities are reportedly working on a solution to rescue the stranded sailors, but the timeline for such efforts remains unclear. The delay in providing assistance has raised concerns about the welfare of the crew, as their situation grows increasingly desperate with each passing day.Family members of the stranded sailors have also expressed their anxiety and frustration. One relative, who wished to remain unnamed, said, “We are worried sick. It’s been too long, and we need answers. Our loved ones are out there suffering, and it feels like nothing is being done.”Maritime experts have pointed out the importance of swift action in such situations. Prolonged delays not only jeopardize the physical health of the crew but also pose psychological risks. “In cases like this, immediate intervention is crucial to prevent a humanitarian crisis,” said a maritime safety expert.As the world watches and waits, the stranded sailors aboard the Dali ship continue to hope for a timely rescue. Their story is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities faced by those who work at sea and the critical need for efficient emergency response mechanisms in maritime operations.Meanwhile, recovery teams refloated Dali in the Port of Baltimore early on Monday and pulled it free of the main channel, two months after the boat crashed into the Francis Scott Key bridge and caused the span to collapse.Tugboats led the Dali to a local marine terminal after a successful effort to make the container ship buoyant at about 6:40am EDT (1040 GMT), the US Army Corps of Engineers said on social media platform X.The removal of the Dali marked a significant step in the Port of Baltimore's recovery from the boat's March 26 collision with one of the bridge's support pillars. The bridge's collapse killed six road workers and hindered traffic through the busiest port for car shipments in the US.President Joe Biden praised the team that freed the ship from its weeks-long imprisonment under the bridge's wreckage in a post on X on Monday.""It took the grit of workers and officials coming together to get this done,"" Biden said. ""That's Baltimore Strong.""",Twenty-one sailors aboard the Dali ship are enduring severe hardships as they remain stranded at sea. The vessel has been immobilized for an extended period due to mechanical issues. The prolonged uncertainty and harsh living conditions have taken a significant toll on the crew's morale and well-being.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110287312,imgsize-1128176,width-400,resizemode-4/110287312.jpg"

The report also claimed that Muslim families in India grapple with anguish and isolation as they try to raise their children in a country that increasingly questions their very identity.A recent report by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) stated that the share of the Muslim population in India increased from 9.84 per cent to 14.09 per cent between 1950 and 2015.""The share of Muslim population in 1950 was 9.84 per cent and increased to 14.09 per cent in 2015 - a 43.15 per cent increase in their share,"" the report said.In the same period, the share of Hindu population in India decreased from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent.""The share of the majority Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent between 1950 and 2015 (from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent),"" the report said.The report noted increases in the Christian, Sikh, and Buddhist populations, while the Jain and Parsi populations decreased.The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) is an independent body constituted to advise on economic and related issues to the Government of India, specifically to the Prime Minister.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also highlighted the report by the EAC-PM and claimed that the narrative that ""minority is in danger"" is false and has been exposed.

After Monday's hearing, two senior judges said Assange's argument that he might not be able to rely on the US First Amendment right to free speech deserved a full appeal, which is unlikely to be held for months.The news prompted cheering from supporters, holding placards ""Free, free Julian Assange!"".

And let me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security,"" Biden said in a statement.US state secretary Antony Blinken also criticized the move, raising questions over the court's jurisdiction as well as its process in making this application. He added that it could jeopardize negotiations to achieve a hostage deal and a ceasefire.""Fundamentally, this decision does nothing to help, and could jeopardize, ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement that would get hostages out and surge humanitarian assistance in,"" Blinken said.The charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh, and al-Masri include ""extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention"", while the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include ""causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,"" said Khan in his statement.The ICC's decision to target Netanyahu marks the first time the court has sought an arrest warrant for the top leader of a close US ally, placing him in the same category as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is also facing an ICC arrest warrant over the war in Ukraine.A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants.Israel's top leaders slammed the development as a ""historical disgrace"".A furious Netanyahu lashed out at the ICC and the prosecutor, stating that the ""absurd"" move was ""exactly what new anti-Semitism looks like"".Vowing to bring down Hamas and achieve total victory, Netanyahu said Israel was fighting a ""just war"".Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz also hit out at the ICC chief prosecutor, stating: ""The Attorney General in the same breath mentions the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel alongside the abominable Nazi monsters of Hamas -- a historical disgrace that will be remembered forever.""Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz slammed the move which he said draws ""parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation (Hamas)"". ""It is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,"" he added.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri also panned the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that the decision ""equates the victim with the executioner"" and encourages Israel to continue its ""war of extermination"" in Gaza.Wasel Abu Youssef, member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, said: ""The Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves ... The ICC is required to issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials who are pursuing crimes of genocide in the Gaza Strip.""When reports of the potential ICC action surfaced last month, Netanyahu called it ""an outrage of historic proportions"" and asserted that Israel has an independent legal system that thoroughly investigates all violations of the law. In response to Netanyahu's comments, Khan stated, ""Nobody is above the law,"" and advised Israel to raise a challenge before the court's judges if they disagree with the ICC's jurisdiction.Although Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court's founding principles in 2015.","ICC prosecutor requested arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant.

The decision, made by High Court judges Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson, means that Assange's legal battle is likely to continue for some time.Assange's lawyers argued that the US had not provided adequate assurances that he would be protected under the First Amendment if extradited.They claimed that the US prosecutors had failed to guarantee that Assange, an Australian citizen who claims protections as a journalist for publishing classified US information, could rely on the press protections provided by the US Constitution.""The real issue is whether an adequate assurance has been provided to remove the real risk identified by the court,"" Fitzgerald said.

US pediatricians group reverses decades-old ban on breastfeeding for those with HIV,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-pediatricians-group-reverses-decades-old-ban-on-breastfeeding-for-those-with-hiv/articleshow/110265924.cms,"People with HIV can breastfeed their babies, as long as they are taking medications that effectively suppress the virus that causes AIDS, a top US pediatricians ' group said Monday in a sharp policy change .The new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics reverses recommendations it had in place since the start of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s.It recognizes that routinely prescribed drugs can reduce the risk of transmitting HIV via breast milk to less than 1%, said Dr Lisa Abuogi, a pediatric HIV expert at the University of Colorado and lead author of the report.""The medications are so good now and the benefits for mom and baby are so important that we are at a point where it is important to engage in shared decision-making,"" Abuogi said.The drugs, known as antiretroviral therapy, don't eliminate all risk of transmitting HIV through breast milk. Avoiding breastfeeding is the only certain way to prevent spreading the virus, Abuogi said.In addition, parents must breastfeed exclusively for the babies' first six months because research shows that switching between breast milk and formula can disrupt an infant's gut in ways that increase the risk of HIV infection.About 5,000 people who have HIV give birth in the US each year. Nearly all take drugs to suppress the virus to very low levels, Abuogi said, though viral levels can rebound if they don't stay on them.Before the medications became widely available starting a decade ago, about 30% of HIV infections transmitted from moms to babies occurred during breastfeeding, said Dr Lynne Mofenson, an adviser to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. In the early 1990s, about 2,000 infections occurred in US infants each year. Today, it's fewer than 30.The Apolicy comes more than a year after the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed longstanding recommendations against breastfeeding by people with HIV. That guidance said people who have consistent viral suppression should be counseled on their options. It also emphasizes that health care providers shouldn't alert child protective services agencies if a parent with HIV seeks to breastfeed.The goal is listening to patients ""and not blaming or shaming them,"" said Dr Lynn Yee, a Northwestern University professor of obstetrics and gynecology who helped draft the NIH guidance.Breastfeeding provides ideal nutrition for babies and protects them against illnesses and conditions such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes, research shows. Nursing also reduces the mother's risk of breast and ovarian cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure.The World Health Organization has recommended since 2010 that women with HIV in developing countries breastfeed their infants and have access to antiretroviral therapy. The guidance weighed the risk of infants acquiring HIV through breastfeeding and the risk of babies dying from malnutrition, diarrhea and pneumonia in places where safe replacements for breast milk aren't available.In developed nations, however, experts had recommended against breastfeeding because the wide availability of safe water, formula and human donor milk could eliminate the risk of HIV transmission, Yee said.That frustrated people with HIV who were flatly refused the option of nursing.Ci Ci Covin, 36, of Philadelphia, said she was diagnosed with HIV at age 20 and not permitted to breastfeed her first child, Zion, now 13.""I couldn't understand how come my sister that lives in a place like Kenya, who looks just like me with the same color brown skin, was given the option to breastfeed and how my option was starkly no,"" she said.Not being able to nurse her son sent Covin into a spiral of postpartum depression, she said. When she became pregnant with her now 2-year-old daughter, Zuri, her health care team helped her successfully breastfeed for seven months. Covin took her prescriptions as directed and also gave the baby drugs to prevent infection.""Breast milk has everything in it that my baby would need,"" Covin said. ""That's a beautiful thing.""Abuogi said the AAP report provides crucial guidance for pediatricians, nurses and lactation specialists who work directly with children and families.Some providers were already helping people treated for HIV to nurse their babies, despite the earlier recommendations. The new guidance should expand the practice, hopefully quickly, Abuogi said.""This is a unique situation because it's not just doctors and providers who are changing,"" Abuogi said. ""Our patients are pushing this as well.""","The American Academy of Pediatrics reverses recommendations it had in place since the 1980s.

'Suicidal attitude': Pope slams US conservatives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/suicidal-attitude-pope-slams-us-conservatives/articleshow/110273977.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a rare and candid television interview on CBS News' ""60 Minutes,"" Pope Francis made a significant foray into the US election season, addressing various pressing issues, including harsh anti-migrant attitudes and criticisms from right-wing US Catholic figures.Speaking in his native Spanish through a translator for more than an hour, Pope Francis did not hold back in his criticism of anti-migrant policies, particularly highlighting the state of Texas' decision to close a Catholic charity offering humanitarian assistance.""That is madness. Sheer madness. To close the border and leave them there, that is madness. The migrant has to be received,"" the Pope said emphatically. He added, ""Thereafter you see how you are going to deal with him. Maybe you have to send him back, I don't know, but each case ought to be considered humanely.""Record numbers of migrants , largely from Central America and Venezuela, have been seeking to enter the United States, fleeing poverty, violence, and climate change-related disasters. The issue has become a pivotal topic in the upcoming November US election, with President Joe Biden's Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, bringing it to the forefront of his campaign. Pope Francis lamented the ""globalization of indifference"" towards migrants, describing it as ""a very ugly disease.""The Pope also addressed the criticisms leveled at him by conservative US bishops who oppose his efforts to revisit certain teachings and traditions. ""A conservative is one who clings to something and does not want to see beyond that,"" he remarked, adding, ""It is a suicidal attitude."" Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has emphasized the importance of a church open to all, including members of the LGBT community . However, he has faced strong resistance from conservative Catholics, especially following his decision to allow the blessing of gay couples last year, which met with particularly strong reactions in African countries. Calling gay people ""a human fact,"" Francis said, ""To bless each person, why not? The blessing is for all.""The pontiff also touched on the controversial issue of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, reaffirming his commitment to a ""zero tolerance"" policy. ""Unfortunately, the tragedy of the abuses is enormous,"" he told CBS, emphasizing that abuse ""cannot be tolerated."" He added, ""When there is a case of a religious man or woman who abuses, the full force of the law falls upon them,"" but noted that ""there has been a great deal of progress.""Pope Francis' interview provided profound insights into his vision for a more just and compassionate world, emphasizing global unity, compassion towards migrants, and openness within the church.

Additionally, the IMF demanded an end to GST exemptions and an increase to 18 percent on both commodities and services.During the fourth round of talks, the IMF mission also called for reforms in the insurance sector and the establishment of a separate regulatory body.

Fresh corruption allegations levelled against ex-Pak PM Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fresh-corruption-allegations-levelled-against-ex-pak-pm-imran-khan/articleshow/110249925.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's accountability watchdog has levelled fresh corruption allegations against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accusing him of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts linked to the state gift repository when he was in power, media reports said on Sunday. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) launched an inquiry against the 71-year-old Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi over the alleged misuse of the Toshakhana -- the state gift repository, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.The beleaguered former first couple has been convicted in earlier Toshakhana corruption cases as well.In January, Khan and Bushra were sentenced to 14 years in jail each by an accountability court for alleged corruption in state gifts they got from the state repository. The sentence was later suspended by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The previous Toshakhana graft case was filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the charges of hiring the sale of state gifts.The NAB investigation centres on the illegal possession and sale of seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts, including diamond and gold jewellery, the report said.According to the inquiry, items such as Graff and Rolex watches and diamond jewellery were allegedly sold without being legally owned or deposited in the Toshakhana, as required by law.The Toshakhana is a department under the Cabinet Division that stores gifts given to rulers and government officials by heads of other governments and foreign dignitaries.Under the rules governing Toshakhana - a Persian word meaning ""treasure house"" - government officials can keep gifts by paying a price, but first, the gift should be deposited.The gifts were purchased/retained at ""considerably lower rates"" and were ""routinely sold"" without properly declaring them. The expensive Graff watch set was also allegedly sold without ""retention"", according to the report.The NAB's findings suggest collusion between the buyers of the Graff watches and a private appraiser, who allegedly undervalued the watches by Rs 30 million.The undervaluation, confirmed via an email from Toshakhana, meant that only Rs 20.1 million, or 20 per cent of the watches' actual value of Rs 100.9 million, was deposited into the government treasury, the report said.""During the course of the inquiry, it was revealed that the value of luxury gift items was assessed in an unscrupulous and slipshod manner by a private appraiser [...] was not even an industry expert and did not possess the required experience or expertise to make these assessments,"" Geo News said, citing the report.After the report findings, the accountability watchdog was authorised to conduct further probes against Khan and Bushra. Separate call-up notices had also been served to them, which they have challenged in the IHC.The court will hear Bushra's appeal on June 4 and Khan's appeal on June 24, the report said.The former-cricketer-turned-politician has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August last year. Since his removal from power in a no-confidence motion in April 2022, Khan has been convicted in at least four cases, including the cipher (secret diplomatic communication) case.","Pakistan's accountability watchdog accuses Imran Khan of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts.

Pakistan government forecasts USD 72 bn investment needed to meet 50 pc surge in power demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forecasts-usd-72-bn-investment-needed-to-meet-50-pc-surge-in-power-demand/articleshow/110249530.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a comprehensive overview of Pakistan's energy landscape, the government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade. This forecast, outlined in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP 2024-34) submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), aims to bolster the country's power infrastructure to meet escalating demand, Dawn reported.Under the proposed plan, renewable energy sources are slated to account for a significant portion, with an expected surge to 46 per cent of the total energy mix within the next decade.This surge in capacity, estimated to rise from 42,000MW to 57,000MW, underscores the government's commitment to embracing sustainable energy solutions .The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has provided insights into the anticipated growth in electricity demand, projecting increases ranging from 46 per cent under a low-growth scenario to 74 per cent in a high-growth scenario over the next ten years. To accommodate this surge, an estimated investment of USD 62-64 billion would be required, reflecting the scale of the challenge at hand, as reported by Dawn.The Transmission System Expansion Plan (TSEP 2024-34) outlines an additional USD 8.7 billion investment imperative for enhancing the transmission network. This allocation includes funds for both ongoing projects, requiring USD 3.2 billion for completion, and new projects necessitating USD 5.5 billion in funding.Employing state-of-the-art generation planning software, PLEXOS, the least-cost, long-term generation expansion plan has been meticulously developed. This plan factors in existing and future generation projects, policy frameworks, contractual obligations, natural resource allocations, and prevailing Grid Code provisions. It adheres closely to the National Electricity Policy 2021 and incorporates a series of assumptions to guide strategic decision-making.In crafting the base case scenario, NTDC has meticulously accounted for existing contractual obligations and projected retirements of power projects as stipulated in their respective Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), with the exception of KAPCO. The plan also factors in the retirement of 8,330MW of existing power generation capacity over the planning horizon.The forecasted demand is calibrated to accommodate the intermittency of variable renewable energy resources such as wind and solar PV, critical elements in achieving the government's ambitious renewable energy targets. With an estimated 87,600 hours of energy and peak demand forecasted from FY24 to 34, the plan aims to balance the evolving energy landscape with a diversified and resilient energy mix.By 2034, the envisioned energy mix will reflect a notable shift towards indigenous fuel sources, with local coal and renewables playing a prominent role. Hydropower is expected to contribute 46 per cent of the energy mix, accompanied by 10 per cent from variable renewable energy sources. The plan minimizes reliance on imported fuels, with RFO making no contribution and imported coal and RLNG accounting for a modest share of total energy requirements, Dawn reported.","The government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade.

They condemned this as a fascist tactic designed to silence opposition and restrict media freedom , according to several media reports.A joint statement was released on Friday by PFUJ President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari.They criticized the authorities for implementing authoritarian measures that hinder journalists from carrying out their duties and holding those in power accountable.The PFUJ expressed alarm over the Punjab government 's decision to revise the defamation law, while also highlighting Defence Minister Khawaja Asif's disclosure of plans to penalise individuals involved in the dissemination of classified documents, as reported by Dawn.The union stated that Asif detailed punitive measures. These measures include a two-year imprisonment term for individuals who are found responsible for such actions.The PFUJ's statement follows the unveiling of a proposed amendment called the Punjab Defamation Bill 2024. The union considers it more draconian than the Defamation Ordinance of 2002, which was introduced during the tenure of military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf.The bill is described as having a very broad definition of defamation. It also imposes severe financial penalties and extensive restrictions on commentary regarding ongoing legal proceedings. The PFUJ stated that the main goal of the bill is to create fear among individuals who are thinking about criticizing or expressing grievances against those in positions of authority.The union of journalists raised concerns about amending defamation laws. They suggested that the process lacked transparency and asserted that current laws already address defamation concerns.The PFUJ leaders accused Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz of using dictatorial tactics. They criticized the attempts to suppress journalists by threatening them with legal action, fines, and arrests. The leaders also urged the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) to support press freedom and oppose the proposed legislation.The PFUJ asserted that any legislative changes should involve consultation with all stakeholders. They accused Nawaz's administration of mirroring the repressive tactics employed by past military regimes. The PFUJ particularly highlighted concerns raised by Defence Minister Asif's statements, which they interpreted as echoing anti-democratic sentiments.Warning of widespread opposition from the journalist community, the union vowed to launch a nationwide campaign against what they perceive as fascist measures by the government.(with input from agency)",The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly criticized the federal and Punjab governments for their recent efforts to change the defamation law.
