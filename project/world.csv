Donald Trump quickly surpasses Joe Biden on TikTok with just one video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-quickly-surpasses-joe-biden-on-tiktok-with-just-one-video/articleshow/110752526.cms,"Former President Donald Trump posted his first video to TikTok on Saturday, and has already amassed more followers and likes than President Joe Biden ’s campaign account as the two men vie for attention before November’s general election.Trump’s first post, which showed him standing next to Ultimate Fighting Championship Chief Executive Officer Dana White before attending this past weekend’s slate of fights in Newark, has garnered 5.9 million likes, and his account has 5.6 million followers after just four days. Biden’s campaign account, which has posted hundreds of videos since its debut in February, has just 361,000 followers and 4.7 million likes.Trump’s campaign trumpeted the contrast in a press release on Wednesday, highlighting his popularity on an app that he tried to ban four years ago while he was in office.He has since come out in support of TikTok, which faces a possible ban in the US if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd., does not divest its ownership stake in the platform by Jan. 19.

Israel ‘targets’ US lawmakers with covert influence drive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-targets-us-lawmakers-with-covert-influence-drive/articleshow/110751699.cms,"Gaza offensive won’t stop for talks: Israel

(With Reuters inputs)

TEL AVIV: Israel organised and paid for an influence campaign last year targeting US lawmakers and the American public with pro-Israel messaging , as it aimed to foster support for its actions in the war in the Gaza Strip , according to officials involved in the effort and documents related to the operation.The covert campaign was commissioned by Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs , a govt body that connects Jews around the world with the state of Israel, four Israeli officials said. The ministry allocated about $2 million to the operation and hired Stoic , a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv, to carry it out, according to the officials and the documents.The campaign began in Oct and remains active on the social platform X. At its peak, it used hundreds of fake accounts that posed as real Americans on X, Facebook and Instagram to post pro-Israel comments. The accounts focused on US lawmakers, particularly ones who are black and Democrats, with posts urging them to continue funding Israel’s military.ChatGPT, the AI-powered chatbot, was used to generate many of the posts. The campaign also created three fake English-language news sites featuring pro-Israel articles.The Israeli govt’s connection to the influence operation, which NYT verified with four current and ex-members of ministry of diaspora affairs and documents about the campaign, has not previously been reported. FakeReporter, an Israeli misinformation watchdog, identified the effort in March.Last week, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, said they had also found and disrupted the operation. The campaign didn’t have a widespread impact, the two companies had said. The fake accounts accumulated more than 40,000 followers across X, Facebook and Instagram, FakeReporter found. But many of those followers may have been bots and didn’t generate a large audience, Meta said.The secretive drive signals the lengths Israel was willing to go to sway American opinion on the war in Gaza. The US has long been one of Israel’s staunchest allies, with Prez Biden recently signing a $15 billion military aid package for the country. But the conflict has been unpopular with many Americans, who have called for Biden to withdraw support for Israel in the face of mounting civilian deaths in Gaza. Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs denied involvement. Stoic didn’t respond for comment.Israel reiterated on Wednesday its refusal to halt the Gaza offensive for a resumption of hostage-release talks with Hamas, after mediator Qatar said it had given the Palestinian militants a US-backed truce proposal. “Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,” defence minister Yoav Gallant, said in remarks after he flew abroad a warplane to inspect the Gaza front. On the other hand, Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh said the group will deal “seriously and positively” with any agreement that is based on the total halt of war, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.","The covert campaign was commissioned by Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs.

WASHINGTON: Ukraine has used US weapons to strike inside Russia in recent days, according to a Western official familiar with the matter. The weapons were used under recently approved guidance from President Joe Biden allowing American arms to be used to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv , Ukraine’s second-largest city. The official was not authorised to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Biden’s directive allows for US-supplied weapons to be used to strike Russian forces that are attacking or preparing to attack. It does not change US policy that directs Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia, US officials have said.

Ukrainian officials had stepped up calls on the US to allow Kyiv’s forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv sits just 20km from the Russian border and has come under intensified Russian attack.

On Tuesday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that he could not confirm that Ukraine had used US weapons at targets in Russia. “We’re just not in a position on a day-to-day basis of knowing exactly what the Ukrainians are firing at what. It’s certainly at a tactical level.”

WHO confirms first fatal human case of H5N2 bird flu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/who-confirms-first-fatal-human-case-of-h5n2-bird-flu/articleshow/110751897.cms,"A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant , the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday. The patient passed away on April 24 after experiencing fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and nausea. Despite having no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, the individual had multiple underlying medical conditions, including chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, according to a statement from Mexico's health ministry.The WHO reported that the patient, who had been bedridden for three weeks prior to developing acute symptoms, was hospitalized in Mexico City and succumbed to the illness the same day. This case marks the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus globally and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico.""Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,"" the WHO said. Mexican health authorities conducted laboratory tests and reported the confirmed case to the UN health body on May 23.In March, H5N2 cases were detected in a backyard poultry farm in Michoacan state, with other outbreaks identified in the State of Mexico. However, establishing a link between the human case and the poultry infections has been challenging. The WHO estimates the risk to the general population as ""low.""The Mexican health ministry emphasized that there is no risk of contagion for the population, noting that all samples from identified contacts of the patient have tested negative. Authorities are closely monitoring farms near the victim's home and have set up a permanent monitoring system to detect other cases in wildlife in the area.Andrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University, highlighted the complexity of the situation, saying, ""How this individual got infected is a big question mark that at least this initial report doesn't really address thoroughly.""The WHO and Mexican health officials continue to investigate the source of the infection. Bird flu has been known to infect various mammals, including seals, raccoons, bears, and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds. Scientists remain vigilant for changes in the virus that could signal its adaptation to spread more easily among humans.In the United States, a different variant of bird flu, H5N1, has been spreading among dairy cow herds, with a small number of human cases reported. However, none of these cases involved human-to-human transmission.Australia also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, with no signs of transmission, while noting more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.Pekosz added, ""Since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus. So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans.""(With inputs from agencies)","A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant.

Police officers arrested 13 pro-Palestinian protesters Wednesday who had barricaded themselves in the office of the prez of Stanford University and demanded that administrators meet several demands, including a vote by the university trustees on whether to divest from companies that are said to support Israel’s military.

The administration offices, located in Building 10, were cleared within about three hours, according to a campus spokesperson, who said that there was “extensive damage.” Several walls and pillars on the exterior were covered in graffiti that criticised the police, Stanford and Israel. One officer was injured during the arrests, the spokesperson said, adding that any students who were arrested will be suspended and those who are seniors will not be allowed to graduate.Wednesday is the final day of classes for spring.

BERLIN: A municipal candidate for the far-right Alternative for Germany party was slashed with a box cutter in the German city of Mannheim , authorities said Wednesday. While police said the incident on Tuesday night did not appear to be politically motivated, it came four days after a knife attack on members of an anti-Islam party in the same city, which raised concerns about more violence in the prelude to Sunday’s vote in Germany for the European Parliament .

Tuesday’s attack occurred after Heinrich Koch , running for municipal office in Mannheim, noticed a man “taking down and slashing” AfD posters. After Koch confronted him, the man attacked Koch with a box cutter.

Koch was taken to a hospital for stitches but is expected to make a full recovery.

Biden: ‘Every reason’ to believe Bibi prolonging war for political survival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/biden-every-reason-to-believe-bibi-prolonging-war-for-political-survival/articleshow/110717963.cms,"Hamas says can’t agree to any deal unless Israel commits to permanent ceasefire, full withdrawal

‘Israeli air strikes in Syria have killed Iran general’

(With Reuters inputs)

US Prez Joe Biden , asked whether PM Benjamin Netanyahu was prolonging the war in Gaza in an effort to hold on to office, said that he believes “there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion”, lending his voice to something many in his administration have been saying privately for months.His statement came in an interview with Time magazine that was conducted May 28, three days before Biden gave a speech revealing details of what he called an “Israeli plan” to bring about an exchange of hostages and a permanent ceasefire . His decision to describe the Israeli plan in public appeared to be a clear effort to lock in Netanyahu, who didn’t publicly reveal the details and seemed to back away from some of them after Biden’s statement last Friday.Both in Jerusalem and Washington, Netanyahu is widely seen as highly aware that an end to the conflict could easily result in his being swept from office — especially once investigations began into how Israel ignored evidence of the Oct 7 attack that killed 1,200 Israelis, and how slowly Israel’s defence forces responded. Street protests against him have begun to gather momentum again, seven months after the attack. Netan yahu has made clear, both before and after the attacks, that he is against a two-state solution .Tensions between Biden and Netanyahu have been obvious for months, as the Israeli PM has refused American calls for Israel to allow far larger amounts of aid to reach Palestinians, and to come up with a plan to evacuate displaced refugees from Rafah, the current centre of military action. But Biden was careful not to criticise Netanyahu other than to agree that he was clinging to office by prolonging the war.Israeli govt spokesman David Mencer, asked about the interview, said it was “outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country” for Biden to make such comments.Meanwhile, the White Hou se said Biden believes the ceasefire deal on the table is the best chance to get hostages out of Gaza and end hostilities. The US will continue to work with Netanyahu to try to get the proposal over finish line, spokesman John Kirby said.Hamas cannot agree to any deal unless Israel makes a “clear” commitment to a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from Gaza, a senior official from the Palestinian militant group said on Tuesday. “Israel only wants one phase where it takes all its hostages, then it resumes its aggression and war on our people,” Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, told a televised press conference.Qatar, which alongside the US and Egypt has been mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, has also urged Israel to provide a clear position that has the backing of its entire govt to reach a deal.Israeli air strikes near Aleppo, Syria, in the early hours of Monday killed a general in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps who had been deployed to the country as an adviser, according to Iranian media reports. The Iranian was identified as General Saeed Abyar by Tasnim News agency, a media outlet affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards.He was believed to be the first Iranian killed by Israel since the two countries nearly went to war in April, after Israel bombed Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus, killing several commanders. Iran retaliated, attacking Israel with a barrage of 300 drones and ballistic missiles, after which Israel attacked an Iranian military base with a missile. Since then, however, the two countries stepped back from direct confrontations, facing intense global pressure to not ignite a new, wider regional war. And Iran is now enmeshed in a domestic leadership crisis, making a new wave of attacks on Israel seem unlikely. Iran has been reeling from the sudden death of Prez Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash two weeks ago.Abyar was a member of Iran’s Quds Force, a branch of the Revolutionary Guards that operates largely in other nations. He had been in Syria since 2012, when he was deployed to help the govt in Damascus fight a civil war with opposition forces and IS terrorists. The Quds Force now uses Syria as a regional headquarters for coordinating and arming militia groups known as the “axis of resistance”, including in Lebanon, Iraq and West Bank.","Hamas says can’t agree to any deal unless Israel commits to permanent ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza.

"After crackdown on Hong Kong, overseas communities carry the torch to keep Tiananmen memories alive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/after-crackdown-on-hong-kong-overseas-communities-carry-the-torch-to-keep-tiananmen-memories-alive/articleshow/110724811.cms,"HONG KONG: As the 35th anniversary of Beijing's Tiananmen Square crackdown neared, Rowena He, a prominent scholar of that bloody chapter of modern China's history, was busy flying between the United States, Britain and Canada to give a series of talks. Each was aimed at speaking out for those who cannot. The 1989 crackdown, in which government troops opened fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters , resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, dead, remains a taboo subject in mainland China . In Hong Kong , once a beacon of commemorative freedom, the massive June 4 annual vigil that mourned the victims for decades has vanished, a casualty of the city's clampdown on dissidents following huge anti-government protests in 2019.He was still reeling from the loss of her academic position after Hong Kong authorities last year rejected her visa renewal, widely seen as a sign of the financial hub's decline in intellectual freedom. Despite the exhausting schedule of talks, the former protester in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in 1989 viewed this as her duty.""We cannot light the candles in Hong Kong anymore. So we would light it everywhere, globally,"" she said.As Beijing's toughened political stance effectively extinguished any large-scale commemorations within its borders, overseas commemorative events have grown increasingly crucial for preserving memories of the Tiananmen crackdown. Over the past few years, a growing number of talks, rallies, exhibitions and plays on the subject have emerged in the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.These activities foster hope and counteract the aggressive efforts to erase reminders of the crackdown, particularly those seen in Hong Kong. In 2021, the city's police charged three leaders of the group that organized the vigil with subversion under a 2020 sweeping national security law that has all but wiped out public dissent. Later, the group voted to disband. Tiananmen-related statues were also removed from universities.Last week, under a new, home-grown security law, Hong Kong police arrested seven people on suspicion of alleged sedition over their posting of social media content about commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown. A Christian newspaper, which typically publishes content related to the event ahead of its anniversary, left its front page mostly blank. It said it could only turn words into blank squares and white space to respond to the current situation.On Tuesday, the park that used to hold the vigil will be occupied by a carnival held by pro-Beijing groups.However, attempts to silence commemorative efforts have failed to erase the harrowing memories from the minds of a generation of liberal-minded Chinese in the years after tanks rolled into the heart of Beijing to break up weeks of student-led protests that had spread to other cities and were seen as a threat to Communist Party rule.He, who was 17 years old at the time, recalls that protesters like her took to the streets out of love for their country. When the crackdown happened, she spent the entire night in front of her TV, unable to sleep. After she returned to school, she was required to recite the official narrative - that the government had successfully quelled a riot - in order to pass her exams.""I never killed anyone. But I lived with that survivor's guilt all those years,"" she said.To preserve memories of the event, a museum dedicated to the Tiananmen crackdown opened in New York last June. It features exhibits such as a blood-stained shirt and a tent used by student protesters.A similar museum operated by vigil organizers was shuttered in Hong Kong in 2021.As of early May, its board chair Wang Dan, also a leading former student leader of the Tiananmen protests, estimated the New York museum attracted about 1,000 people, including Chinese immigrants, U.S. citizens and Hong Kongers. To expand its audience, Wang said he plans to organize temporary exhibitions on university campuses in the U.S., and possibly in other countries over the longer term.He said overseas memorial events are crucial because mainland Chinese and Hong Kongers can see overseas memorial activities online.""It can have an effect in mainland China because young people there all know how to use VPNs to circumvent internet censorship,"" he said.Aline Sierp, a professor of European history and memory studies at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, said overseas commemorative activities allow the memories to travel and endure, providing access for other people and future generations.But she said it can be ""a double-edged sword"" because adapting the memories to new places might risk fragmenting or de-contextualizing them in the future.Alison Landsberg, a memory studies scholar at George Mason University in Virginia, said that overseas efforts carry the potential to inspire people from other places who are facing their own challenges in the pursuit of democracy.To carry the memories forward, film and television dramas can be powerful tools for people to take on memories of events through which they didn't live, she said.She said overseas theater productions about the crackdown, which began last year in Taiwan and continued in London this year, have a greater possibility of making those connections and potentially reaching a broader audience.""When you have a dramatic narrative, you have the capacity to bring the viewer into the story in a kind of intimate way,"" Landsberg said.Last week, members of an audience at a London theater were visibly moved, some to tears, after watching the play ""May 35th,"" a title that subtly references the June 4 crackdown.The play, produced by Lit Ming-wai, part of the Hong Kong diaspora who moved to the U.K. after the enactment of the 2020 security law, tells the story of an elderly couple who wish to properly mourn their son who died in 1989.Its director, Kim Pearce, who was born in the U.K. in the 1980s, said the tragedy had resonated with her from a young age and she was once moved to tears when she read the poem ""Tiananmen"" by James Fenton. Working on this project, she said, has further deepened her connection to the stories.British theater-goer Sue Thomas, 64, also found the play deeply moving. ""Particularly as a parent myself now, which I wasn't then, which sort of made me think of it in a much more sort of heartfelt way,"" she said.At the theater, He, the scholar, served as one of the post-show speakers, sharing her struggles and the motivations behind her work with the audience. She said the play was so powerful that it made her relive the trauma of the past 35 years, leaving her in tears and causing her to lose her contact lenses.""It shows how much suffering people had to endure all these years,"" she said. ""If there's anything we can do, I hope that we would bring the younger generation to understand this.""","The 1989 crackdown, in which government troops opened fire on student-led pro- democracy protesters, remains a taboo subject in mainland China.

Russia bots target Paris Olympics with deepfake Tom Cruise video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russia-bots-target-paris-olympics-with-deepfake-tom-cruise-video/articleshow/110718318.cms,"With its athletes barred from competing in the Summer Olympics under the country’s flag, Russia has turned its fury on the Games and this year’s host, Paris.

Russian propagandists have created an hour-long documentary, spoofed news reports and even mimicked French and US intelligence agencies to issue fake warnings urging people to avoid the Games, according to a report released on Sunday by Microsoft. The report details the disinformation campaign created by a group the company calls Storm-1679. The campaign appears to have accelerated since March, flooding social media with short videos raising alarms about pos sible terrorist attacks and stoking fears about safety. The operation, while aimed at the Games, is using various techniques to spread disinformation that could also be employed in European and US elections.

The work began in earnest last summer with the release of a fake documentary about the International Olympic Committee, expropriating Netflix’s logo and using an artificial-intelligence-powered voice impersonating Tom Cruise . The committee succeeded in having the video titled “Olympics Has Fallen” — a spoof of the 2013 film “Olympus Has Fallen” — removed from YouTube. The attacks have continued, though, with persistent efforts to discredit its leadership, the committee said in March, citing a campaign that used fake recordings of what purported to be telephone calls by officials of the African Union on behalf of Russia.

Storm-1679 now appears to be making shorter videos that are easier to create. It used to focus on disparaging Ukrainian refugees in the West, but after French Prez Macron began to publicly consider sending French troops to Ukraine, it shifted to the Olympics. Microsoft estimates that Storm-1679 produces three to eight faked videos a week, in English and French, with many impersonating the BBC, Al Jazeera and other broadcasters. The group appears to respond quickly to news events, su ch as protests in New Caledonia, a French territory in the Pacific. Others focus on the prospect of a terror attack in Paris.

Most of the videos pretending to be from CIA and French intelligence are relatively simple. They are unlike anything CIA has actually produced, but to unsuspecting readers online, they could appear legitimate, using the agency’s logo and stark white-on-black typography. “They are trying to cultivate an anticipation of violence,” Clint Watts of Microsoft, said of the group Storm-1679. “They want people to be fearful of going to the Olympics.” French officials and Microsoft say one of the group’s tactics appears to be trying to get the attention of factcheckers. “The content doesn’t normally travel from one platform to another, but when their false content is fact-checked by accounts with a large following, the content gets far more views and in front of new and different audiences,” Watts said","Russian propagandists have created an hour-long documentary, spoofed news reports and even mimicked French and US intelligence agencies. The operation is using various techniques to spread disinformation that could also be employed in European and US elections. The campaign appears to have accelerated since March, flooding social media with short videos raising alarms about terrorist attacks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110718309,imgsize-15562,width-400,resizemode-4/110718309.jpg"

New Yorkers who dreaded $15 congestion fee cheer Kathy Hochul’s shock decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-yorkers-who-dreaded-15-congestion-fee-cheer-kathy-hochuls-shock-decision/articleshow/110752541.cms,"Brooklynites and Manhattanites. Democrats and Republicans. Drivers and subway riders. Especially Staten Islanders. New Yorkers of all stripes are cheering over the halt of a $15 fee.They’re celebrating Governor Kathy Hochul ’s stunning decision to suspend a plan to charge people driving into Manhattan beginning June 30. The toll was aimed at reducing traffic, improving air quality and raising $1 billion a year to repair public transportation.It was a measure 17 years in the making, and would have been the first of its type in the US. But with inflation supercharging the cost of living in New York over the past couple of years, the prospect of having to pay the fee irked too many of the city’s residents.“I’m thrilled it’s stalled,” said Susan Switzer, a business consultant who lives in Midtown. “We can’t afford to take our car out a few days a week.” She drives to Queens a few times a week and said the toll shouldn’t have applied for Manhattan residents, because she believes they already pay high taxes and parking fees.The timing of Hochul’s shock suspension is raising speculation about its reasons. She said Wednesday her decision was driven by the goal of shielding the working class from inflation. But price increases in everything from groceries to housing and insurance have been squeezing New Yorkers — and Americans across the nation — for well over a year.Hochul was concerned that implementation of the unpopular plan risked affecting Democrats’ chances in upcoming House races across the state this November, according to a person with knowledge of her thinking. The contests are expected to be competitive, with power over Congress hanging in the balance.Hochul also faced pointed criticism in 2022 for New York Democrats’ losses in swing districts, which effectively handed control of the House to the GOP.But the pricing plan had also raised concerns among outer borough Democrats, who feared the impact on less-wealthy residents who live in New York’s farthest reaches, often long distances from mass transit. Some of those officials supported Hochul’s decision to delay.“I want to express my appreciation to Governor Kathy Hochul for listening to the concerns of New Yorkers and pausing the launch of congestion pricing,” said Queens City Council Member Nantasha Williams, a Democrat whose district in southeastern Queens has fewer mass transit options than other parts of the city.The fee was predicted to generate resources to help revamp a more than 100-year old transit system that has been ravaged by heavy rain and severe flooding. Subway-signal upgrades to curb train delays, new electric buses and the extension of the Second Avenue subway to Harlem were all meant to be funded with the money.But Withlin Ward, a stylist who lives in Brooklyn, is skeptical of these goals. “They always say that and nothing happens,” he said, noting that subway fares were raised only recently.Xavier Walker, who fixes fire alarms for MTA contractor High Rise Fire and Security, said the $15 toll was too high, and would only have gone up, hurting people’s already stretched budgets. “It would be good to help make MTA accessibility easier,” he said. “But these guys have already generated money” by raising subway fares, he said.Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, also a Democrat, said he has long supported congestion pricing but had previously spoken with Hochul and testified before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority about his concerns over the program’s details — specifically the amount of the toll, which posed a potential hardship to middle class Queens residents who live far from mass transit and who drive to and through Manhattan for work.“I have spoken to the governor about the price scheme,” Richards said. “We relayed $15 certainly being a very steep price.”Richards also faulted the MTA’s messaging, particularly to outer borough residents who would feel the impact of congestion pricing most acutely.The MTA “never told the public what they’re gonna get out of it,” Richards said, pointing out that officials couldn’t pinpoint mass transit improvements the program would fund that specifically benefited eastern and southeastern Queens residents.“There really wasn’t a strategic vision laid out for residents in the outer reaches of the city on what does this mean, how does this benefit them?” Richards said.Still, not everyone was supportive of Hochul’s decision. Some lawmakers and good government groups criticized the governor, questioning how the state would now fund the MTA’s capital needs.“The Governor’s reckless decision to effectively kill congestion pricing in New York City — and every other city in America that is considering following New York’s example — is a staggering error,” said State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat who represents parts of Midtown and Manhattan’s Upper East Side.“On top of the financial crisis she is creating, this is simply a terrible policy decision, full stop,” Krueger said.Democratic Queens State Senator Jessica Ramos called the delay “a slap in the face to our neighbors who rely on a functioning public transportation system.”In Albany, a group of lawmakers questioned Hochul’s reasoning.Transportation activists like Elizabeth Adams, executive director for public affairs at Transportation Alternatives, were particularly incensed.“The next time your train is late, your bus is trapped in traffic, your subway station is still missing an elevator, you know who to blame: Governor Kathy Hochul,” Adams said.Nonetheless, Hochul drew support from a broad range of political interests, whose concerns rarely align: the United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew, who had joined a lawsuit in an effort to stop the program’s implementation, the New York Taxi Workers’ Alliance President Bhairavi Desai, and Harry Nespoli, chair of the Municipal Labor Committee, which represents hundreds of thousands of municipal employees.“We need to address congestion in the central business district, but another surcharge on struggling yellow taxi drivers was never the right solution,” Desai said.Republican Congress member Nicole Malliotakis, whose district covers Staten Island and some parts of Brooklyn, was also pleased.","New Yorkers of all stripes are cheering over the halt of a $15 fee.

"On hiking trip during summer vacay, 3 US kids discover rare T. rex fossils",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/on-hiking-trip-during-summer-vacay-3-us-kids-discover-rare-t-rex-fossils/articleshow/110751996.cms,"WASHINGTON: What did you do for summer vacation? Three pre-teen dinosaur aficionados have the answer of a lifetime: they discovered the remains of a rare juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex in the North Dakota dirt.Scientists and filmmakers announced Tuesday that brothers Liam and Jessin Fisher, age seven and 10 at the time of the find, and their nine-year-old cousin Kaiden Madsen, were walking in the Hell Creek formation of the Badlands in July 2022 when they found a large fossilised leg bone. “Dad asked ‘What is this?’ and Jessin said, ‘That’s a dinosaur!’” exclaimed young Liam on a video call with his brother, cousin, father Sam Fisher, dinosaur experts and reporters. They snapped a pic and sent it to a family friend, vertebrate paleontologist Tyler Lyson, as per a statement.When Lyson eventually arrived at the site, he brushed off a tooth and quickly realised the enormity of what the fossil hunters uncovered: an “extremely rare” juvenile T. rex specimen that lived 67 million years ago — and could offer critical clues about how the king of dinosaurs grew up. “It still gives me goosebumps,” Lyson recalled on the call. Kaiden’s reaction to learning it was a T. rex? “This is pretty cool.”The fossilised bones were excavated , placed in giant plaster jackets and lifted by Black Hawk helicopter onto a truck. They were taken to the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, where the public can soon follow progress on the fossil’s preparation in a new discovery lab. Rather remarkably, the saga is only emerging now, after a documentary crew and renowned scientists coordinated in secret over nearly two years with top natural history museums to present the kids’ discovery.Paleontologists estimate the “Teen Rex” weighed about 1,630kg, measured 25 feet from nose to tail, and stood about 10 feet tall — some two-thirds the size of a full grown adult. It was believed to be 13-15 years old when it died. “It’s remarkable to consider how T. rex might have grown from a kitten-sized hatchling into the 40-foot, 8,000-pound adult predator we are familiar with,” Thomas Holtz,a renowned T. rex authority, said.As for the kids, Liam and cousin Kaiden said they’ll remain amateur dinosaur sleuths, combing the Badlands for new discoveries. But Jessin is looking to become a full-time paleontologist. “It’s been a lifelong dream of mine — probably because I’ve seen Jurassic Park film, and finding this” T. rex fossil, he said. Meanwhile, Jessin offered sage advice for fellow kids: “Put down their electronics and just go out hiking.”","Brothers Liam and Jessin Fisher, age seven and 10 at the time of the find, and their nine-year-old cousin Kaiden Madsen, were walking in the Hell Creek formation of the Badlands.

Transplanted pig kidney is removed from patient,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/transplanted-pig-kidney-is-removed-from-patient/articleshow/110751947.cms,"AP photo

NEW YORK: Surgeons removed the kidney of a genetically engineered pig from a critically ill patient last week after the organ was damaged by inadequate blood flow related to a heart pump that the woman had also received, according to officials at NYU Langone Transplant Institute.

The patient, Lisa Pisano , 54, who is still hospitalised, went back on kidney dialysis after the pig’s organ was removed. She lived with the transplanted organ for 47 days, Dr Robert Montgomery, director of the institute, said. The kidney showed no signs of organ rejection . “Lisa is in stable condition, and her left ventricular assist device is still functioning,” Montgomery said, referring to the heart pump.

In April, Pisano became the second person to receive a kidney transplanted from a genetically modified pig. Hers was an especially complicated case: She has heart failure and kidney failure, and received the organ just eight days after receiving a mechanical heart pump . She is the first patient with a heart pump known to have received an organ transplant of any kind, NYU Langone Health officials said.

The first patient to receive a kidney from a genetically engineered pig was Richard Slayman, 62, who underwent the procedure in March in Boston. He suffered from complex medical problems and died within two months.

WASHINGTON: Boeing ’s new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew, a milestone in the aerospace giant’s ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk ’s SpaceX . The CST-100 Starliner, with Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Indian-origin Sunita Williams aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance.The gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), following years of technical problems, delays and a 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.Last-minute issues had nixed the Starliner’s first two crewed launch attempts. But on Wednesday, the Atlas V’s engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapour as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into sunny skies from Florida’s Atlantic Coast.The rocket’s upper stage separated from its lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner’s separation from the second stage. Now on its own, the spacecraft fired its onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that will kick off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, the orbiting research outpost some 400 km above Earth. Starliner will need to execute precise maneouvers to dock with ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for eight days, then safely return the two astronauts.Boeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been Nasa’s only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.The inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran astronauts: Wilmore, 61, a retired US navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft. They have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each.Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. Williams made history as the first woman to embark on such a mission. And it won’t be her first entry in the history books. In 2012, during a prior trip to the ISS, Williams became the first person to finish a triathlon in space, during which she simulated swimming using a weight-lifting machine and ran on a treadmill while strapped in by a harness so she wouldn’t float away. That came after she ran the Boston Marathon from the space station in 2007.","Boeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew.

During the hearing, Knox tearfully apologised for falsely accusing an innocent man, Patrick Lumumba , of the crime, attributing her initial false statement to pressure from Italian police .Knox, who was 20 years old at the time of the murder, described the night of her interrogation as ""the worst night of my life,"" claiming that she was questioned for hours in a language she barely understood, without an official translator or lawyer. She alleged that the police refused to believe her when she said she didn't know who the killer was and that she was yelled at and slapped during the investigation.""I'm very sorry I was not strong enough to have resisted the police pressure,"" Knox told the judges.""I was scared, tricked and mistreated. I gave the testimony in a moment of existential crisis.""The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2019 that Knox had not been provided with adequate legal representation or a professional interpreter during her interrogation, compromising the fairness of the proceedings. This ruling was cited by Italy's top court last year when it ordered a retrial for the slander case.Lumumba's lawyer, Carlo Pacelli, described how Knox's accusation changed his client's life, turning him into ""the monster of Perugia"" in the public eye. The verdict in the slander case can be appealed by both parties.The murder trial attracted significant global attention, with much of it focusing on prosecutors' claims that Kercher died as part of a sex game gone wrong. However, Italy's highest court, when it ultimately acquitted Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, stated that there had been ""major flaws"" in the police investigation. Ivorian Rudy Guede remains the only person convicted of Kercher's murder, having been sentenced in 2008 and released early in November 2021.Now 36 years old with two young children, Knox works as a journalist, author, and advocate for criminal justice reform.

If that does happen, Trump will the first major Presidential candidate to campaign from prison since socialist Eugene Debs. While there has been a lot of debate on whether a Presidential candidate who has been indicted ought to be President, Donald Trump should perhaps listen to his own views on the matter.In 2016, speaking about his rival Hillary Clinton , Trump had argued that she shouldn’t be allowed to run. He had said: “If Clinton were charged criminally and became president it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis and grind the government to a halt. Folks, folks, folks, she shouldn't be allowed to run. Okay?”Trump made similar statements at several rallies when Clinton was being probed for handling classified emails on a private email server. He had also claimed: “We need a government that can work and work well from day one for the American people. That will be impossible with Hillary Clinton, the prime suspect in a massive far-reaching criminal investigation.”He had said: “Her current scandals and controversies will continue throughout her presidency and will make it virtually impossible for her to govern or lead our country.”Donald Trump faced Republican voters for the first time as a convicted felon on Tuesday during the final state primaries for the 2024 presidential nomination , where he continued to sweep up votes.The ex-president has already locked up the Republican nomination to run against PresidentJoe Biden , making the votes in Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota formalities. However, some political observers had wondered if Republican voters might sour on Trump's divisive candidacy after he was found guilty last week of falsifying business records in a conspiracy to unlawfully influence the 2016 election.Though Trump steamrolled over other Republican presidential hopefuls, he faced a hiccup at a guaranteed-win primary earlier this year. In May, two months after the last Republican rival standing, Nikki Haley, abandoned her campaign, she still won nearly 22 percent of the votes in the Indiana primary. Trump on Tuesday picked up 85 percent of the vote in New Mexico, with Haley picking up nine percent after more than 95 percent of ballots were in. In Montana, where Haley was not on the ballot, Trump picked up nearly 91 percent, while nine percent selected no preference, with 83 percent of the votes in.","Donald Trump will be the first major presidential candidate who has been indicted to run for President and might even do so from prison.

"A Song of Ice and Fire: How Phoenix, America's hottest city, is treating heatstroke victims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-song-of-ice-and-fire-how-phoenix-americas-hottest-city-is-treating-heatstroke-victims/articleshow/110734146.cms,"PHOENIX - The season's first heat wave is already baking the Southwest with triple-digit temperatures as firefighters in Phoenix - America's hottest big city - employ new tactics in hopes of saving more lives in a county that saw 645 heat-related deaths last year.Starting this season, the Phoenix Fire Department is immersing heatstroke victims in ice on the way to area hospitals. The medical technique, known as cold water immersion, is familiar to marathon runners and military service members and has also recently been adopted by Phoenix hospitals as a go-to protocol, said Fire Capt. John Prato.Prato demonstrated the method earlier this week outside the emergency department of Valleywise Health Medical Center in Phoenix, packing ice cubes inside an impermeable blue bag around a medical dummy representing a patient. He said the technique could dramatically lower body temperature in minutes.""Just last week we had a critical patient that we were able to bring back before we walked through the emergency room doors,"" Prato said. ""That's our goal - to improve patient survivability.""The heatstroke treatment has made ice and human-sized immersion bags standard equipment on all Phoenix fire department emergency vehicles. It is among measures the city adopted this year as temperatures and their human toll soar ever higher. Phoenix for the first time is also keeping two cooling stations open overnight this season.Emergency responders in much of an area stretching from southeast California to central Arizona are preparing for what the National Weather Service said would be ""easily their hottest"" weather since last September.Excessive heat warnings were issued for Wednesday morning through Friday evening for parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, with highs expected to top 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius) in Las Vegas and Phoenix. The unseasonably hot weather was expected to spread northward and make its way into parts of the Pacific Northwest by the weekend.Officials in Maricopa County were stunned earlier this year when final numbers showed 645 heat-related deaths in Arizona's largest county, a majority of them in Phoenix. The most brutal period was a heat wave with 31 subsequent days of temperatures of 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.4 Celsius) or higher, which claimed more than 400 lives.""We've been seeing a severe uptick in the past three years in cases of severe heat illness,"" said Dr. Paul Pugsley, medical director of emergency medicine with Valleywise Health. Of those, about 40% do not survive.Cooling down patients long before they get to the emergency department could change the equation, he said.The technique ""is not very widely spread in non-military hospitals in the U.S., nor in the prehospital setting among fire departments or first responders,"" Pugsley said. He said part of that may be a longstanding perception that the technique's use for all cases of heatstroke by first responders or even hospitals was impractical or impossible.Pugsley said he was aware of limited use of the technique in some places in California, including Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto and Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno, and by the San Antonio Fire Department in Texas.Banner University Medical Center in Phoenix embraced the protocol last summer, said Dr. Aneesh Narang, assistant medical director of emergency medicine there.""This cold water immersion therapy is really the standard of care to treat heatstroke patients,"" he said.","The Phoenix Fire Department is immersing heatstroke victims in ice on the way to area hospitals.

The US president's comments came just before he outlined a proposal for a ceasefire in the region, as Netanyahu grapples with deep political divisions within his country.When asked if he believed Netanyahu was extending the war for his own political gain, Biden responded, ""There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion."" He also expressed uncertainty about whether Israeli forces had committed war crimes in Gaza, rejecting claims that Israel was using starvation as a warfare tactic, but stating, ""I think they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate.""The Israeli government spokesperson, David Mencer, criticized Biden's remarks about Netanyahu, calling them ""outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country."" Last month, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor in The Hague requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his defense chief, and three Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes.Israel launched an offensive in Gaza last October, vowing to destroy the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas after it attacked inside Israel, resulting in the deaths of around 1,200 people and the capture of more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. The Israeli assault has claimed the lives of over 36,000 people in Gaza, as reported by local health authorities, who also state that thousands more bodies remain buried under rubble.Despite most Israelis supporting the war, opinion polls indicate that they hold Netanyahu responsible for the security failures during the Hamas attack on Israeli communities near Gaza on October 7. The polls also suggest that if an election were held, Netanyahu would be voted out of office. Weekly mass street protests, attended by tens of thousands, have become commonplace, with demonstrators demanding that the government do more to bring home the hostages seized by Hamas and calling for Netanyahu's resignation.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Joe Biden suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might be prolonging the war in Gaza for political reasons.

Given how close the 2024 Lok Sabha General Elections Results turned ou t, the BJP will hope that Nitish Kumar doesn’t have another change of heart. Most pollsters suggested that the NDA would be in the 370-400 mark, but it will probably turn out close to 295. That will make the seats held by allies like JD(U) and TDP become extremely crucial. While the Bihar Chief Minister’s desire to switch teams is well-known, there he has a namesake who also exhibits a similar tendency.Born in Scarborough, Ontario in 1994, Nitish Kumar is an all-rounder who played almost all of Canada’s matches in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup qualifiers. He holds the record for being the youngest player to debut for Canada in a first-class match when he played in the ICC Intercontinental Cup Fixture against Kenya in August 2009. He is also the second-youngest ODI player (15 years and 273 days), only bettered by Pakistan’s Hasan Raza. Kumar later swapped colours and started representing the US national team. In this year’s T20 World Cup , he is representing the USA.Incidentally, Nitish Kumar’s middle name is Roenick, a tribute to National Hockey League star Jeremy Roenick. Incidentally, Kumar played for Canada in the 2011 World Cup when here became the tournament’s youngest player. Kumar even captained Canada and last played for the team 2019.

An Islamabad HC division bench, comprising justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, delivered a short verdict, accepting their appeals against the convictions.“The state had badly failed in proving its case and even its prosecutors had abandoned the case. Hats off to the honourable judges. It was a case of first impression. Imran and Qureshi did not do any anti-state activity,” remarked Imran’s counsel Salman Safdar following the verdict.Despite the acquittal, Khan will remain imprisoned to serve his sentence in the “iddat” case, related to his alleged unlawful marriage to Bushra Bibi, his third wife. Both are serving seven-year jail terms after a trial court ruled that their 2018 marriage broke the law by not completing the waiting period mandated by Islam, called “Iddat”, after Bibi divorced her previous husband.Qureshi remains on physical remand until June 5, accused of inciting violence on May 9 last year when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) supporters stormed military and civilian govt assets following Imran’s arrest.The 71-year-old former cricket star has faced a series of political and legal challenges since being ousted as PM in April 2022 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. A special court, constituted under Official Secrets Act, 1923, had convicted the two PTI politicians for sharing classified communication between Washington and Islamabad, which Khan claimed was part of a US conspiracy to overthrow his govt in 2022 after he visited Moscow just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Washington and Pakistan’s military dismissed the allegation.Khan’s conviction in the cipher case was one of three charges against him leading up to the Feb 8 elections this year, which he alleged were orchestrated to prevent his return to office. Last year, the same court overturned his conviction in a corruption case involving the unlawful sale of state gifts during his term from 2018 to 2022. The gifts included diamond jewellery and seven watches, six of them Rolexes — the most expensive being $304,000.","Former PM Imran Khan and ex-foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi were serving 10-year sentences after being convicted of leaking state secrets.

NEW DELHI: A Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country. His statements were made in the case of poet and journalist Ahmed Farhad Shah, who the lawyer said cannot be brought to the federal capital for court proceedings from PoJK, as he was in 'foreign territory' that does not come under the country's jurisdiction.During the session, additional attorney general Munawar Iqbal Duggal said that Farhad faced charges in PoK and was in custody until June 2. Duggal mentioned that Farhad's family had met him, suggesting that the habeas corpus petition should be dismissed.Presiding over the proceedings, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani considered the plea filed by Arooj Zainab, Farhad's spouse, as reported by Dunya News.Petitioner's counsel Imaan Mazari emphasised that her client sought not only her husband's return but also action against those responsible for his enforced disappearance.The HC emphasised that the case would only conclude upon Farhad's appearance in court.AAG Duggal argued that PoJK, with its own constitution and courts, was considered foreign territory.

"Improving energy resilience in Pakistan could avert 175,000 deaths by 2030, UNICEF says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/improving-energy-resilience-in-pakistan-could-avert-175000-deaths-by-2030-unicef-says/articleshow/110597885.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A new study by the United Nations children’s agency says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.UNICEF said improved energy resilience would also contribute $296 million to the country’s fragile economy over the next 20 years by reducing maternal, adult and infant mortality.The study, conducted by UNICEF’s Economist Impact Unit and released Friday, comes as Pakistan is experiencing an intense heatwave that has sickened thousands of people, further burdening the country's health care system.Temperatures in various parts of Pakistan soared as high as 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday. Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said. ""We need the private sector to play a bigger role as public sector resources will not be enough. This is everybody’s business.”","UNICEF says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.
