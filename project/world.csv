Putin: Trump ‘sincerely’ wants to end War in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-trump-sincerely-wants-to-end-war-in-ukraine/articleshow/111501049.cms,"President Vladimir Putin said Russia takes seriously statements by Donald Trump that he has proposals to end the war in Ukraine quickly.“I’m not familiar with his possible proposals on how he intends to do this, and that is, of course, the key question,” Putin told a news conference Thursday in Astana, Kazakhstan, where he attended a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.“But I have no doubt that he says this sincerely, and we will support it.”He spoke a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Bloomberg TV in an interview that Trump “should tell us today” what his plans for ending the war would be if he wins November’s US presidential election. Zelenskiy warned that any proposal must avoid violating Ukraine’s sovereignty.Putin told reporters that he saw some of last week’s election debate between Trump and Joe Biden but declined to comment on it. President Biden is facing growing pressure to drop his reelection bid following criticism of his poor performance in the debate.Trump hasn’t explained how he believes he’ll bring an end to the war that’s now in its third year. Politico reported this week that he’s considering a deal with Russia under which NATO would commit not to expand further east, including to Ukraine and Georgia, citing two national security experts aligned with the former president.Putin said last month that Ukraine had to pull out of four eastern regions partly occupied by Russian forces as a condition for peace talks. Under his terms, immediately rejected by Kyiv and its US and European allies, Ukraine would also have to rule out ever joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.Putin said in Astana that Russia won’t declare a halt to fighting before Ukraine agrees to take “irreversible” steps demanded by Moscow, without specifying what those would be.“A cease-fire without reaching such agreements is impossible,” he said.The Russian president also ruled out a resumption of talks with the US on strategic stability until after the election. Russia must first “understand the moods and preferences of the future administration,” Putin said.Separately, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it would be “very difficult to continue arming Ukraine” without US support.“Will Europeans be able to continue supporting Ukraine militarily even if the US doesn’t?” Borrell said at a meeting in Madrid of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s certainly difficult but not impossible. But is there the political will? I have my doubts.”","Vladimir Putin says he's not familiar with Donald Trump's proposals to end the Ukraine war.

UK left-wing maverick Galloway loses his parliamentary seat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-left-wing-maverick-galloway-loses-his-parliamentary-seat/articleshow/111500720.cms,"LONDON: Veteran left-wing political maverick George Galloway lost his parliamentary seat in Britain's election on Friday, defeated by the Labour candidate in the northern English town of Rochdale .Galloway had served for just four months after winning a by-election triggered by the death of the town's previous lawmaker.Back in March, Galloway's pro-Palestinian campaign helped him win votes from the town's Muslim community and he secured what was his seventh stint as a lawmaker, representing his left-wing Workers Party of Britain.That win came after Labour withdrew support from its candidate over a recording espousing conspiracy theories about Israel.Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have said they want the fighting in Gaza to stop, but they have also backed Israel's right to defend itself, angering some among the 3.9 million Muslims who make up 6.5% of Britain's population.Galloway criticised Labour for supporting Israel in its war against Hamas during his winning by-election campaign in March.But this time he lost to Labour candidate Paul Waugh, a former political journalist who has previously worked for Britain's Independent and Evening Standard newspapers, and who grew up in the town.Galloway, 69, was himself a former Labour parliamentarian before being expelled from the party in 2003 for criticising then-prime minister Tony Blair over the Iraq war.By that time, he already had a reputation for controversy.In 1994, he drew criticism for meeting Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and telling him: ""Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.""His fame reached its height in 2006 when he impersonated a cat on a reality television show.","Galloway had served for just four months after winning a by-election triggered by the death of the town's previous lawmaker.

The UK general election is set to bring about the first change in government in 14 years. According to the exit poll conducted on election night, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his Conservative Party are likely to experience a crushing loss.As the votes are being tallied, early indications suggest that Labour has taken a commanding lead, potentially setting the stage for a change in the nation's political landscape.Credit rating agencies that downgraded the UK's rating after Brexit and the market turmoil caused by Liz Truss in 2022 have raised several concerns that require attention from the new government .One major issue is the UK's high debt-to-GDP ratio, which is close to 100%. While all parties have pledged to improve public services and invest in infrastructure without increasing key taxes, the market reaction to Truss's spending plans serves as a cautionary tale against radical measures. S&P Global highlighted the importance of balancing revenue and expenditure adjustments to improve the underlying fiscal position.Another concern is the UK's sluggish economic growth, averaging just 1.6% annually over the past decade. Fitch Ratings, which raised its outlook on the UK's AA- rating to ""stable"" in March, notes that the country's debt-to-GDP ratio is more than double the median for 'AA' bracket countries. Boosting growth will be challenging due to factors such as net migration, labour market participation, and productivity growth issues.The new government will also need to consider whether to modify the UK's self-imposed fiscal rules, which mandate a reduction in public sector debt as a share of GDP over a five-year period. While some Labour officials have suggested that significant reforms are currently off the table, the government faces substantial debt issuance and interest payments in the coming years.Scope, a European-based rating firm, highlights the importance of maintaining the pound's status as a global reserve currency. ""A stable government managing credible budgetary policies"" and ""enhancing access to the (EU) Single Market"" are seen as key factors in preserving this status.Finally, the issue of raw sewage discharge by privatised water companies has become a prominent election topic. If these companies fail to invest in solving the problem, the government may need to intervene and run them, adding to the UK's debt burden. While this alone may not be enough to change the UK's rating, it could contribute to a confluence of factors that could impact the country's credit assessment.","The UK general election is set to bring about the first change in government in 14 years.

"2024 United Kingdom elections: Who is Keir Starmer, poised to become UK's next PM",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/2024-united-kingdom-elections-who-is-keir-starmer-poised-to-become-uks-next-pm/articleshow/111496432.cms,"All you need to know about Keir Starmer

Keir Starmer was born in London in 1962 and grew up in the town of Oxted, Surrey, where he was raised by his toolmaker father and NHS nurse mother.[3]

He was politically active from a young age, joining the Labour Party Young Socialists at 16.

Starmer has a strong academic background, holding a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Leeds and a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law degree from the University of Oxford.

Prior to entering politics, Starmer had a successful career as a human rights barrister, serving as a human rights adviser to the Northern Ireland Policing Board and being appointed Queen's Counsel in 2002.

Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions from 2008 to 2013, where he dealt with high-profile cases like the Stephen Lawrence murder.

He was elected to the House of Commons in 2015 as the MP for Holborn and St Pancras, a safe Labour seat.

Starmer supported the unsuccessful Britain Stronger in Europe campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum, but later advocated for a second referendum under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.

After Corbyn's resignation, Starmer won the 2020 Labour leadership election on a left-wing platform, positioning himself as a more centrist, pragmatic leader.[3]

As Labour leader, Starmer has sought to distance the party from the Corbyn era, emphasizing a more professional and electorally viable approach.[1][4]

Starmer is known for his vegetarianism, self-professed socialism, and a reputation that divides opinions, with some viewing him as moving towards the right in his pursuit of power.

Here are Keir Starmer's key policies as the likely next UK PM:

Economic stability: Starmer has pledged to ""deliver economic stability "" by sticking to ""tough spending rules"" and focusing on growing the economy. He has avoided making big-spending promises, instead emphasizing fiscal responsibility.

"" by sticking to ""tough spending rules"" and focusing on growing the economy. He has avoided making big-spending promises, instead emphasizing fiscal responsibility. NHS improvements : Starmer plans to ""cut NHS waiting times"" by providing 40,000 more evening and weekend appointments each week. This is aimed at addressing the NHS's staffing and backlog issues.

Border security: Starmer wants to ""launch a new Border Security Command"" to crack down on illegal migration and people-smuggling gangs. He has indicated a willingness to do a deal with the EU on migrant quotas.

Energy nationalisation: Starmer has promised to ""set up Great British Energy"", a new publicly owned clean power company, as part of Labour's plans for green energy transition.

Tackling anti-social behaviour: Starmer has pledged to ""crack down on anti-social behaviour"" as part of his law and order agenda.

Education funding: Starmer has committed to ""recruit 6,500 new teachers"" in key subjects to address staffing shortages in the education system.

Foreign policy: Starmer has promised a ""new strategic partnership"" with India, including pursuing a free trade agreement. He also plans to stop arms sales to Israel and progress towards recognizing a Palestinian state.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls for the 2024 UK general elections have predicted a resounding win for the opposition Labour party and an end to the nearly 15-year-long Conservative rule. The final results are expected to be announced by late Friday morning (IST).The first national ballot since Boris Johnson won the Conservative party a decisive victory in 2019 follows Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's surprise call to hold an election six months earlier than required.His gamble looks set to backfire spectacularly, with exit polls pointing to a heavy defeat for his right-wing party.The Centre-left Labour is projected to win its first general election since 2005 by historic proportions.With the exit polls out, 61-year-old Labour leader Keir Starmer seems set to be the next resident of 10 Downing Street, as leader of the largest party in parliament.Results from the UK's 650 constituencies trickle in overnight, with the winning party expected to hit 326 seats -- the threshold for a parliamentary majority -- as dawn breaks on Friday.Polls suggest voters will punish the Tories after 14 years of often chaotic rule and could oust a string of government ministers, with talk that even Sunak himself might not be safe. That would make him the first sitting prime minister not to retain his seat in a general election.","Keir Starmer was born in London in 1962 and grew up in the town of Oxted, Surrey.

The exit poll represents a significant turnaround for Labour, which faced an existential crisis just three years ago.Voters appear to have punished the Conservatives for the cost-of-living crisis, years of instability, and in-fighting that has seen five different prime ministers since 2016. Sunak's campaign was plagued by gaffes, including getting drenched by rain while announcing the election and leaving D-Day commemorations early for a TV interview.While polls suggest there is no great enthusiasm for Starmer, his message of change seems to have resonated with voters. The disenchanted British public has moved to the center-left, unlike in France where the far-right National Rally party made historic gains in a recent election.If the exit poll proves accurate, Starmer will become Britain's next prime minister, and Sunak will resign, meeting with King Charles to seek permission to form a new government.","Labour is projected to secure 410 seats in the 650-seat parliament.

Last year, she managed a winning 39-and-a-half hot dogs in 10 minutes.Sudo’s previous personal best came in 2020 when she chowed down on a whopping 48.5 dogs in the beef-eating competition.With the event's biggest star —- Joey “Jaws” Chestnut — out of the contest this year, Sudo’s result set up a possible scenario in which the women’s champ out-eats the men’s winner. Geoffrey Esper, who came second last year, also has a personal best of 51, but only ate 49 last year.Chestnut, who won 16 out of the previous 17 contests, isn't attending the competition over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, he'll compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. That leaves the traditional Brooklyn event wide open for a new winner in the men's division, with eaters from around the world competing on America's Independence Day to see how many hot dogs they can eat in 10 minutes.Thousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan’s location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture. ESPN is broadcasting the contest live. The men’s will begin at approximately 12:20 p.m.Competitors are coming from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.“There's going to be a new champion,” Australian James Webb, who holds a world record for eating 70 doughnuts in eight minutes, said at a preview event in New York on Wednesday.Last year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.“I'm going to be pushing myself,” Sudo said Wednesday. Her rival Mayoi Ebihara, from Japan, said through a translator that she would eat until she passes out, with a goal of downing 50 hot dogs.Chestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.Major League Eating, which organizes the Nathan’s Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.Chestnut said he wouldn’t return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.(With agency inputs)","Miki Sudo, a Florida native, beat her beef-eating competitors by a mile at the July 4 tradition.

Ra'Ad: Pakistan Arms JF-17 Jets with Ra'ad-I Nuclear Missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-arming-jf-17-jets-with-raad-nuke-missiles/articleshow/111454243.cms,"A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft. The photograph depicts a JF-17 carrying what appears to be a Ra'ad air-launched cruise missile (ALCM), marking the first public observation of this configuration.Analyzing images of a JF-17 Thunder Block II from the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade rehearsals, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) confirmed that the fighter jet was equipped with a Ra'ad-I nuclear missile.""Notably, this was the first time such a configuration had been observed in public,"" the FAS said in its report.To determine the specific type of Ra'ad missile in the image, comparisons were made with Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II missiles displayed in previous Pakistan Day Parades. While the Ra'ad-II, first unveiled in 2017, was presented as having nearly double the range capability of the Ra'ad-I, external features did not clearly distinguish the two versions until 2022. The latest Ra'ad-II, displayed in 2022 and 2024, features a distinct 'x-shaped' tail fin configuration, while the missile photographed on the JF-17 more closely resembles the 'twin-tail' configuration of the Ra'ad-I, the FAS report said.Using Photoshop's Vanishing Point feature and reference measurements from the vehicles carrying the missiles, the lengths of the Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II were estimated to be around 4.9 meters each. The missile on the JF-17 was also measured using the aircraft's length as a reference, resulting in a similar 4.9-meter estimate. These measurements, along with the tail fin configuration, suggest that the missile observed on the JF-17 is likely the Ra'ad-I ALCM rather than the newer Ra'ad-II or the conventional anti-ship variant, Taimoor, the FAS report by Eliana Johns said.The image provides evidence that Pakistan has made significant progress in equipping its JF-17s with the capability to supplement or replace the nuclear strike role of the ageing Mirage III/Vs. However, questions remain about the deployment status of the Ra'ad systems and whether Pakistan will continue to retain a nuclear gravity bomb capability or transition to stand-off cruise missiles exclusively.These developments occur amidst an ongoing nuclear arms competition in the region, with Pakistan, India, and China pursuing advanced technologies such as multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). The heightened tensions and the development of short-range, lower-yield nuclear-capable systems by Pakistan have raised concerns about accelerated arms racing and escalation risks in a potential conflict between India and Pakistan.",A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft.

Instead, the champ will live-stream his own July 4 hot dog event from a Texas military base.In his absence, a field of 15 lesser-knowns will battle for the vacated ""Mustard Belt"" that goes to the winner.Later in the day, the Macy's department store chain will stage its 48th annual Fourth of July fireworks show along the Hudson for the first time in a decade. In recent years, the spectacle was staged along the East River.Launched from barges moored in the river, some 60,000 shells will travel about 1,000 feet (300 meters) high before exploding into dozens of colours and special effects sure to delight tens of thousands of spectators who will line both sides of the Hudson, which separates Manhattan from New Jersey.Across the country, other cities are hosting fireworks shows, road races, baseball games and other events that will give people the chance to forget their troubles and relax.In Southern California, Huntington Beach will hold what it has branded as ""the largest Independence Day celebration west of the Mississippi.""

The fun continues on Friday with a block party and rodeo.In Alaska, where the sun barely sets in summertime, the holiday got off to an early start with a midnight fireworks show in the port city of Seward.

Liberal pundits and pollsters make the case for Kamala Harris to replace Biden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/liberal-pundits-and-pollsters-make-the-case-for-kamala-harris-to-replace-biden/articleshow/111491489.cms,"WASHINGTON: Pragmatic pundits, pollsters, and people of Democratic persuasion are starting to line up behind vice-president Kamala Harris as the putative party nominee for the White House even as President Joe Biden is tenaciously hanging on to his bid for second term.A decision on whether Biden will renounce his candidacy or continue his campaign is just hours or days away.But there is growing clamor for Harris to step up despite residual doubts about whether she is well-placed to defeat Donald Trump.Biden is expected to make a call on whether he will continue or withdraw from the race after a weekend interview and public events that could show if he is still fit for the job -- or not.Reasons being advanced to promote Harris to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee range from the practical and pragmatic to the logical and logistical. She has already been vetted and is on the Biden-Harris ticket that has all but sewn up the nomination which means she could easily inherit the campaign infrastructure and finances.Political strategists say picking anyone other than Harris would ""represents a legal, political and financial minefield,"" because it would ""raise questions about the status of the delegates whom Biden and Harris have won — and the nearly quarter-billion dollars in their campaign coffers, money that cannot easily or perhaps even legally be handed to someone else.""Anyone aiming to replace Biden would have to have a campaign up and running -- and line up new finances -- within weeks if not days, both considered almost impossible.Although Harris' performance as vice-president has not impressed many, she does have national name recognition. Others prominent Democrats spoken as potential nominees, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, are popular in their home state but lack national appeal.Party flacks do not seriously consider outliers such as Michelle Obama in the mix.Democrat insiders also cite optics, arguing that as the first Black and Asian-American woman to be elected to vice-presidency, denying Harris the top nomination in favor of a white male candidate could alienate minorities whose support is crucial to win the White House.Polls show that Harris performs much better against Trump than any other potential Democratic nominee, although a poll cited by Daily Mail -- which had a lead story headlined: President Kamala? Why Democrat insiders fear it's now INEVITABLE that Harris will replace Biden -- showed her losing to Trump by eleven points.Some of the governors being urged to run have already indicated they are not jumping into the fray at this late stage, even as party grandees are preparing to the ground for a Harris nomination.Among them is South Carolina lawmaker Jim Clyburn, whose endorsement of Biden turned around the race in 2020, and who has said he would support Kamala Harris this time around if she were the nominee.On the downside, pundits point out that Harris' fared disastrously in the 2020 race, dropping out of the Presidential contest after a campaign meltdown. Her performance as vice-president has also been unspectacular.Kamala skeptics also warn that inasmuch as she might win minority votes, her candidacy could alienate white suburban voters in swing states that Democrats need to clinch the White House.Harris herself has been circumspect so far about keeping the Oval Office in her sights as she continues to back Biden, saying voters should look at his successful 3½ years in office, not his 90 minutes of struggling in a debate.In a CBS News interview on Tuesday, she declined to answer a question about whether she is ready to lead the country if Biden is unable to, countering that she is “proud to be Joe Biden’s running mate.”“Look, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once, and we’re going to beat him again. Period.” she said.",Biden is expected to make a call on whether he will continue or withdraw from the race after a weekend interview and public events that could show if he is still fit for the job -- or not.

That compares with $1.29 in Amsterdam, $1.23 in Paris, and $1.08 in Melbourne, according to data collected by Bloomberg.An 18% tax was applied to packaged milk as part of taxation changes approved in the national budget last week.

"Pakistan slams UN body report calling Imran’s arrest 'arbitrary, politically motivated'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-slams-un-body-report-calling-imrans-arrest-arbitrary-politically-motivated/articleshow/111440399.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday denounced a UN report that termed the detention of former prime minister Imran Khan as “arbitrary and in violation of international law”, asserting that the arrest of the cricketer-turned-politician and the cases against him were an “internal matter” of the country.Imran, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.The Election Commission of Pakistan subsequently disqualified him for five years, ahead of the national elections in Feb. He is also facing prosecution in the cipher and Iddat cases.In an opinion released on Monday, the Geneva-based UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Imran’s detention had no legal basis, and appeared to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office. “…From the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose,” it stated, adding that Imran’s legal woes were part of a “much larger campaign of repression” against him and his party.In the run-up to the 2024 general election, the working group report stated, PTI members were arrested and tortured and their rallies were disrupted. It also alleged “widespread fraud on the election day”.The “appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law”, the UN working group said.Imran and his party have always maintained that the charges against him are politically motivated and aimed at thwarting his return to power.In recent months, courts have suspended Imran’s sentence in some cases and also overturned his conviction on charges of leaking state secrets. However, he has remained behind bars following his conviction in the Iddat case, with a trial court ruling that Imran’s 2018 marriage had violated Islamic law. Khan also faces a trial under anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence in May last year.Responding to the UN report, Pakistan’s law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said, “As a sovereign state, the constitution and prevailing laws are enforced by courts in Pakistan. PTI founder has all rights as per the national constitution and law and international norms. He is in jail as a convicted prisoner.”In his statement, Tarar said court relief to the PTI founder in some of the cases was “a reflection of a transparent and fair trial and judicial system”. “Any demand beyond the constitution, law and international norms will be called discriminatory, biased and unfair,” he added.Last Friday, Pakistan’s parliament had denounced a US congressional resolution that called for an independent investigation into allegations that the country’s elections were rigged.",Imran Khan has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.

UN panel declares former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's detention arbitrary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/un-panel-declares-former-pakistan-pm-imran-khans-detention-arbitrary/articleshow/111412979.cms,"A panel of UN experts has determined that the detention of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is arbitrary and violates international law . The United Nations Working Group on arbitrary detention has called for Khan's immediate release, stating that his detention lacks legal basis and appears politically motivated.The working group raised serious concerns about multiple cases brought against Khan since his ousting in April 2022.Their opinion, dated March 25 but made public on Monday, highlights that Khan's deprivation of liberty breaches several international laws and norms.""Khan's detention had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office,"" the working group concluded. ""Thus, from the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose.""The five independent experts called on Pakistan 's government to ""take the steps necessary to remedy the situation of Mr Khan without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms.""""The appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law,"" they added.Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022 and has faced over 200 legal cases since his removal, which he claims is a campaign to keep him from power. He has been detained since August and barred from standing for office.In April, Pakistan's high court suspended Khan and his wife's 14-year prison sentences for graft. This month, his 10-year sentence for treason was overturned, but he remains in Adiala jail, south of Islamabad, for an illegal marriage conviction.Khan was cleared for release before those convictions in the days leading up to Pakistan's February 8 general elections.Neither Pakistan's interior nor information ministry immediately responded to a request for comment.Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party hailed the ruling as ""a huge victory.""""It has shown without any one percent of doubt that Imran Khan is innocent and has been thrown into prison illegally,"" said PTI spokesman Syad Zulfiqar Bukhari in a statement.",UN Working Group on arbitrary detention calls for immediate release of Imran Khan.
