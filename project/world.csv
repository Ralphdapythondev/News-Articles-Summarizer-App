"Musk: 'Yell at me, if ...': Elon Musk responds to Zuckerberg’s regret over Covid-19 censorship",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yell-at-me-if-elon-musk-responds-to-zuckerbergs-regret-over-covid-19-censorship/articleshow/112851005.cms,"'I regret ...': Zuckerberg

Zuckerberg’s claims of government pressure

Trump seizes opportunity to fuel election narrative

Funding decisions and platform adjustments

Potential impact on the election

In the wake of Mark Zuckerberg ’s admission of regret over complying with Biden administration pressure to censor Covid-19 content, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has weighed in on the matter. Musk, in a post on X, emphasized the importance of supporting diverse viewpoints within the legal framework of countries.“This platform really is meant to support all viewpoints within the bounds of the laws of countries, even those of people with whom I vehemently disagree and personally dislike.If that doesn’t seem to be happening, please yell at me (ideally on X),” Musk wrote, reiterating his commitment to free speech despite disagreements.The discussion was sparked by Zuckerberg's recent letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan. In the letter, Zuckerberg detailed how the Biden administration had repeatedly pressured Meta to remove various types of coronavirus-related content, including satire. This pressure, according to Zuckerberg, led to significant internal frustration at Meta.Jordan, who shared screenshots of Zuckerberg’s letter, used the information to highlight alleged attempts by the White House to control content on social media platforms . The letter adds fuel to ongoing debates about the balance between content moderation and free speech.Mark Zuckerberg recently made statements that have stirred significant controversy, particularly in light of the approaching2024 presidential election . In remarks to the House Judiciary Committee, Zuckerberg alleged that the Biden administration exerted pressure on Meta to censor specific Covid-19 content, including satire and humour, CNN reported. This assertion comes amid ongoing Republican complaints about Meta’s policies and claims of government overreach during the pandemic.In a statement released on Monday, Zuckerberg detailed his experience with Biden administration officials. “In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain Covid-19 content,” Zuckerberg said. He expressed regret for not being more vocal against this pressure.Former President Donald Trump quickly seized on Zuckerberg’s statements to bolster his narrative of a rigged 2020 election. On Truth Social, Trump claimed, “Zuckerberg admits that the White House pushed to SUPPRESS HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY (& much more!) IN OTHER WORDS, THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS RIGGED.”The House Judiciary Committee, led by Republicans, used Zuckerberg’s letter to criticize President Biden and Vice President Harris, posting it on social media with a focus on claims that the Biden administration pressured Facebook to censor content and suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story. The committee’s statement on X emphasized three points as victories for free speech: “1. Biden-Harris Admin 'pressured' Facebook to censor Americans. 2. Facebook censored Americans. 3. Facebook throttled the Hunter Biden laptop story.”Zuckerberg’s statements are also notable in the context of his recent decisions regarding political funding. He announced he would cease supporting election-related efforts, following criticism that his $400 million donation, known as ""Zuckerbucks,"" was biased towards Biden. “I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other. My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another,” Zuckerberg said.In a further controversial move, Zuckerberg admitted that Meta’s decision to limit the sharing of the New York Post’s October 2020 story about Hunter Biden’s laptop was a mistake. He conceded that the reporting was not Russian disinformation and should not have been demoted.According to Bloomberg, Zuckerberg’s praise for Trump’s reaction to an assassination attempt as “badass” and his comments on reducing political content on Meta platforms suggest a possible attempt to offer Republicans political leverage while demonstrating neutrality. Zuckerberg also indicated that Meta’s involvement in the election would be reduced compared to previous cycles.As the 2024 election approaches, these developments continue to fuel the debate over social media’s role in political discourse and the influence of tech giants on public perception and policy.","Elon Musk has weighed in on Mark Zuckerberg's claims of government pressure.

'Duty to warn': Canadian police alert aide to slain Sikh separatist Nijjar of increased threats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/duty-to-warn-canadian-police-alert-aide-to-slain-sikh-separatist-nijjar-of-increased-threats/articleshow/112852400.cms,"Canadian police have issued a warning to an aide of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar , who was assassinated in British Columbia last year, due to increased threats against his life. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , a prominent Sikh separatist, revealed on Tuesday that authorities in Ontario, in collaboration with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), have provided Inderjeet Singh Gosal with a ""duty to warn"" notice.Gosal, who was an aide to Nijjar at the time of his killing in June 2023, received the warning this week. Nijjar’s assassination has sparked significant controversy, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September 2023 citing credible allegations of potential Indian government involvement. The Canadian police have since charged four individuals in connection with the murder. India, however, has denied any role in the incident.Adding to the tension, the FBI is currently investigating a drive-by shooting on August 11 that targeted a California activist closely associated with Nijjar. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining the case as part of a broader investigation into possible threats against Sikh separatists.India has accused Canada of providing refuge to Sikh separatists advocating for the creation of Khalistan, an independent state to be carved out of Punjab, India. In response to the threats, Gosal said, “I’ve been informed by Canadian officials about the threats to my life. However, my commitment to the liberation of Punjab from Indian occupation remains unwavering.”Neither the RCMP nor Ontario police were available for immediate comment. The office of Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who oversees law enforcement, declined to provide a statement.In a related development, in June 2023, the FBI thwarted an alleged assassination attempt on Pannun, with Indian national Nikhil Gupta charged for attempting to orchestrate the murder under the direction of an Indian intelligence official.","Inderjeet Singh Gosal was an aide to Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Is droplets a source of Mpox transmission? What we know so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/is-droplets-a-source-of-mpox-transmission-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/112851080.cms,"What are the different virus clades and how do they differ in impact?

If a person with the mpox virus talks to somebody and spats out droplets , it might not spread as it is a minor transmission source compared to physical contact , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) said on Tuesday.Addressing a briefing in Geneva, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said that mpox spreads between people mainly through close physical contact which includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), according to AFP news agency.She said that if a person with the virus had lesions, ""if you're talking closely to someone, breathing on them, physically close, face-to-face, there is a possibility"" of viral spread, ""but this is a minor source"".Instead, ""what we're seeing is the close, physical skin-to-skin"" contact as the chief route of transmission, she told a briefing in Geneva.""When you're talking to somebody, you're spitting out droplets,"" but ""it's not a very major form of transmission -- and it's not a... through-the-air, long-distance sort of transmission"".""More research is needed to fully understand the transmission dynamics,"" Harris added.According to the WHO, during the global outbreak that began in 2022, the virus mostly spread through sexual contact. More research is needed on how mpox spreads during outbreaks in different settings and under different conditions.The virus can also spread during pregnancy to the fetus, during or after birth through skin-to-skin contact, or from a parent with mpox to an infant or child during close contact.As Harris said that more research is needed, the team is studying on two subtypes of mpox: Clade 1, endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa; and Clade 2, endemic in West Africa.The Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a surge in mpox cases, driven by two distinct strains of Clade 1.In the northwest region, an outbreak of the previously identified Clade 1, now referred to as Clade 1a, is occurring.Simultaneously, a new variant of Clade 1, designated as Clade 1b, has emerged in the northeastern part of the country since September last year and is rapidly spreading.The WHO's decision to raise the highest level of emergency alert was primarily influenced by the rapid spread of Clade 1b and its detection in neighboring countries.As for whether Clade 1b is more dangerous than Clade 1a, Harris said: ""We don't have that data.""""Studies are under way to understand the properties of the new strain. But available epidemiological data doesn't really suggest that the clade 1b variant causes more severe cases and deaths.""","World Health Organisation says mpox spreads mainly through close physical contact.

Reflections and decisions

Unreleased footage from January 7, 2021, revealed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s intense condemnation of former President Donald Trump following the Capitol riot . The video obtained by Politico, was captured by her daughter, filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, and provided to the House Committee on Administration by HBO. The footage showed Pelosi grappling with the aftermath of the attack.In a candid moment, Pelosi is seen reflecting on the events of January 6 , saying, “I just feel sick about what he did to the Capitol and the country today,” and insisted, “He’s got to pay a price for that.” The footage highlighted Pelosi’s immediate outrage and her determination to hold Trump accountable for the riot, as reported by Politico.In the early hours of January 7, after being evacuated from the Capitol, Pelosi is seen in the back of her SUV, visibly exhausted and distressed. “I just feel sick about what he did to the Capitol and the country today,” Pelosi said. “He’s got to pay a price for that.” The footage showed Pelosi's immediate outrage and her determination to address the aftermath of the riot.The footage documented the chaotic moments following Pelosi’s evacuation from the Capitol. As she was whisked away by Capitol Police, Pelosi expressed frustration over the lack of preparedness and the failure to anticipate the attack. “How many times did the members ask, ‘Are we prepared? Are we prepared?’ We’re not prepared for the worst,” Pelosi criticized. Her frustration was further fueled by the realization that the pro-Trump mob had already breached the Capitol.As Pelosi and other congressional leaders huddled at Fort McNair, the footage revealed their discussions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and others expressed frustration over Trump’s video statement that praised the rioters and perpetuated false claims about the election. “We shouldn’t let him off the hook, Nancy. We issued a statement saying he’s got to make a statement. He comes up with this BS,” Schumer said. Pelosi responded with resolve, describing Trump’s actions as “insurrection” and demanding accountability.The footage also documented Pelosi’s strategic planning as she prepared a forceful statement condemning Trump as a threat to democracy. In a conversation with her aides, Pelosi debated whether to publicly call for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, ultimately deciding to focus her message on Trump. “I think our focus has to be on the president. Let’s not divert ourselves,” Pelosi instructed.The footage captured Pelosi’s critical approach to the Capitol security failures and her discussions about the fate of key security officials. The House Administration Oversight Subcommittee, which is leading the January 6 investigation, has criticized Pelosi for shifting focus to Trump rather than addressing security lapses.As the footage concluded, Pelosi is seen navigating the aftermath of the riot, including discussions about Capitol security and the potential resignation of officials. Despite internal debates and criticisms, Pelosi remained steadfast in her determination to address the riot’s causes and hold those responsible accountable.","Footage from January 7, 2021, revealed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s intense condemnation of former President Donald Trump.

This development comes as Pyongyang continues to enhance its military capabilities and amid allegations of supplying arms to Russia.About three months ago, North Korea stated its goal to outfit its military with this new 240mm multiple rocket launcher, which can target Seoul and surrounding areas.The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that the rocket launcher had been ""technically updated in its maneuverability and concentrated firing capability,"" proving its advantages in all indices.""Updates included newly applied guiding system, controllability and destructive power,"" KCNA stated.During the test-firing, Kim Jong Un also ""set forth an important policy to be pursued in producing new artillery pieces and equipping army units with them,"" though further details were not provided. This development follows North Korea's recent unveiling of a ""suicide drone,"" an unmanned aircraft designed to crash into enemy targets, acting effectively as guided missiles.In February, North Korea announced a new control system for its multiple rocket launcher, anticipating a ""qualitative change"" in its defense capabilities. By May, it was declared that the updated rocket launcher would be deployed to units of the Korean People's Army between 2024 to 2026 as replacement equipment.Inter-Korean relations are currently at a very low point, with Pyongyang designating South Korea as its ""principal enemy."" The North has closed agencies dedicated to reunification and has issued warnings over territorial infringements.The test-firing by North Korea coincided with major annual joint military drills by South Korea and the United States, which ran until Thursday. These drills included new exercises aimed at containing North Korea's nuclear capabilities.North Korea asserted that ""even 0.001 mm"" of territorial infringement could lead to war, highlighting the tense relationship between the neighbors.The United States and South Korea have accused North Korea of supplying ammunition and missiles to Russia for its ongoing conflict in Ukraine, a charge that Pyongyang dismisses as ""absurd."" Analysts suggest that North Korea might be testing and increasing the production of artillery and cruise missiles possibly for this purpose.North Korea, historically infuriated by joint US-South Korean military exercises, decries these drills as rehearsals for invasion. The ongoing military activities underscore the heightened tensions and continuous arms advancements by the isolated, nuclear-armed country.","Kim Jong Un oversaw the test-firing of a 240mm multiple rocket launcher equipped with a new guiding system.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) manages the construction and maintenance of India’s extensive road network. National Highways play a crucial role in the country's infrastructure development, connecting various regions from north to south and east to west. India is home to numerous national highways, which link different parts of the country and facilitate efficient transportation.National Highway 44 (NH 44), formerly known as National Highway 7, is the longest national highway in India.Spanning 3,745 kilometres, NH 44 traverses the North-South Corridor of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP). It stretches from Srinagar in the north to Kanyakumari in the south. NH 44 was created by consolidating several major highways, including NH 1A, NH 1, NH 2, NH 3, NH 75, NH 26, and NH 7.: Runs from Srinagar to Kanyakumari, covering 3,745 kilometres.Connects Porbandar in Gujarat to Silchar in Assam, with a length of 3,507 kilometres.: Stretches from Delhi to Chennai, totaling 2,807 kilometres.Links Sangrur in Punjab to Ankola in Karnataka, spanning 2,317 kilometres.Extends from Sitarganj in Uttarakhand to Ibrahimpatnam in Andhra Pradesh, measuring 2,040 kilometres.Connects Jorabat in Meghalaya to Selling in Mizoram, with a length of 1,873 kilometres.Links Hajira in Gujarat to Pradip Port in Odisha, covering 1,781 kilometres.Runs from the east coast of West Bengal to Chennai in Tamil Nadu, totaling 1,711 kilometres.Connects Panvel to Kanyakumari, spanning 1,622 kilometres.Stretches from Delhi to Kolkata, covering 1,435 kilometres.Links Gangotri Dham in Uttarakhand to Lakhnadon in Madhya Pradesh, with a length of 1,426 kilometres.The Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) is a major national highway network that connects four key metro cities in India: Delhi (north), Kolkata (east), Mumbai (west), and Chennai (south). It serves as a vital link between India's major industrial, agricultural, and cultural centres.India boasts the second-largest road network in the world.There are over 200 national highways with a cumulative length of 101,011 kilometres. State highways add up to 131,899 kilometres.National highways typically have two-digit numbers, while three-digit numbered highways are branches of the main highways (e.g., NH 144 is a branch of NH 44).Although national highways make up only 1.8% of all roads in India, they handle 40% of the country's road traffic.National Highways: State HighwaysCity Highways","India boasts the second-largest road network in the world.

Her point of disagreement with the Democrats was war as she denounced the party she served as an elitist cabal of warmongers.Tulsi Gabbard ran in the 2019 Democratic presidential primary against Kamala Harris.As Donald Trump welcomed Tulsi, he called her a true American patriot.

""We can't be prosperous unless we are at peace and we can't be free as long as we have a government that is retaliating against its political opponents and undermining our civil liberties weaponizing our very institutions against those they deem as threat. Kamala Harris has done this in the last three years. She won't hesitate to do this if she's elected,"" Tulsi said.Tulsi joined Trump earlier in the day in paying respect to the soldiers martyred in the Abbey Gate Attack in Kabul.In his presidency, Trump did not start any war and took steps to de-escalate and prevent wars, Tulsi Gabbard said adding that he exercised the courage expected from the commander-in-chief. The same can't be said about Kamala Harris as the incumbent administration has America facing multiple wars and closer to the brink of a nuclear war.Tulsi Gabbard is often mistaken as an Indian-origin woman because of her first name but she did not have any connection with India.

?

When Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France on Saturday evening, he was not alone. A 24-year-old woman, who identified herself as a crypto coach and a streamer from Dubai, was with him. Speculations are rife that Juli Vavilova, who could be Pavel's girlfriend, actually played a role in his arrest. The speculations started from an X post which had Juli's photo on a plane with a caption, ""The woman who accompanied Pavel Durov on his journey that led to his arrest in Juli Vavilova."" According to conspiracy theorists, the woman was posting everything of her and Pavel's journey which made it easier for the agencies to track Pavel's location but Pavel was on the radar of the agencies for a long time.Juli Vavilova is said to be a crypto coach and a stream based in Dubai. Juli has 22.3K followers on Instagram. Her bio claims that she knows four languages: English, Russian, Spanish and Arabic. Gaming, crypto, languages and mindset are her interests. She has many photos with Pavel at various locations such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan.A Mossad agent? Honey trap?French authorities had a warrant against Pavel over lack of moderation on Telegram, the social media platform that the 39-year-old owns. The platform has been accused of indulging in illegal activities including money laundering, drug trafficking and sharing of pedophilic content. After his arrest on Saturday, Pavel can be held for questioning for up to 96 hours after which he has to be charged.The Franco-Russian billionaire was travelling on his private jet from Azerbaijan and as he reached Le Bourget, he was arrested. Juli was also arrested with him. But speculations are that Juli might have led Pavel to the arrest as she was strategically disclosing Pavel's location. She is being called a Mossad agent as well by conspiracy theorists with no word of coming from the authorities over this.It is not surely known whether Juli is Pavel's girlfriend or from when the two have been dating.","Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France on Saturday evening.

Abandoned airports , once bustling hubs of activity, now stand as silent reminders of a bygone era in aviation history. These deserted airfields, scattered across the globe, offer a fascinating glimpse into the past, where the roar of jet engines has given way to eerie silence and nature's slow reclamation.From the iconic Tempelhof Airport in Berlin to the haunting remains of Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, each of these locations tells a unique story of changing times, economic shifts, and the evolution of air travel.Explore ten of the most intriguing abandoned airports around the world.Berlin Tempelhof Airport was one of Europe’s oldest airports and a symbol of Germany’s aviation history. It played a significant role during the Berlin Airlift in 1948-49. Despite its historical significance, Tempelhof was closed in 2008 due to financial losses and is now a public park and events venue.Once the main airport of Cyprus, Nicosia International was abandoned in 1974 after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. The airport is now located in a United Nations Buffer Zone and remains a time capsule of 1970s airport design, frozen in time and off-limits to the public.Ellinikon International Airport served as Athens' primary airport for six decades before it was closed in 2001 to make way for the new Athens International Airport. The site, which also hosted events during the 2004 Olympics, is now slated for redevelopment but remains largely abandoned.Johnston Atoll, a remote military base and chemical weapons disposal site in the Pacific, included an airport that was closed in 2005. The island, now part of a National Wildlife Refuge, is off-limits to the public, and the airstrip is slowly being reclaimed by nature.Built with the hope of boosting the Palestinian economy, Yasser Arafat International opened in 1998 but was severely damaged by Israeli forces in 2001 during the Second Intifada. The airport has been abandoned since, a stark reminder of the ongoing conflict in the region.Famous for its challenging approach over Hong Kong’s skyscrapers, Kai Tak Airport was one of the world’s most iconic airports until it was closed in 1998. The airport was replaced by the modern Hong Kong International Airport, and the site of Kai Tak is now being redeveloped into a new urban area.Once the primary airport serving Denver, Colorado, Stapleton International was replaced by Denver International Airport in 1995. The site of the former airport has been redeveloped into a residential area, but remnants of the old runways and control towers remain.Located in New York, Galeville Airport was originally built as a military airfield during World War II. It was later used by the New York Air National Guard but was closed in the 1990s. The site is now part of a wildlife refuge, with the runways serving as paths for birdwatchers.Ciudad Real Central Airport was one of Spain’s most ambitious projects, built in the hopes of becoming a major hub. However, the airport fell into bankruptcy shortly after opening in 2009 due to low demand and high debt. It remains abandoned, with only occasional flights landing for maintenance purposes.Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York, was the city’s first municipal airport, opening in 1931. It later became a naval air station and was decommissioned in 1971. The site is now part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, where visitors can explore the historic hangars and runways.","Explore ten of the most intriguing abandoned airports around the world.

Top Picks For You What is behind violent protests that have erupted in Bangladesh?

India has sought enhanced security from Bangladesh after a group of people held a demonstration inside the India visa centre in Dhaka on Monday raising anti-India slogans.The Indian high commission in Dhaka has taken up the matter with the ministry of foreign affairs in Dhaka with a diplomatic note, a diplomatic source told TOI. Though there was no vandalism or any physical assault, staff members at the visa centre panicked and felt threatened, making it difficult for them to continue even with limited services.Police said people were there to collect passports but suddenly staged a brief demonstration at Indian Visa Application Centre (IVAC) in Dhaka after being told that processing of their applications, with the high commission having to work with a skeletal staff, was going to take time.Police rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control, said an official.Many videos went viral on social media showing people seeking India visas raising anti-India slogans. “Indian collaborators, beware... One point, one demand — we want a visa,” the group could be heard chanting.The unruly scenes put pressure on high commission personnel, who have already been under stress since efforts by a group of students and political parties to stir anti-India feelings, to dial foreign ministry. On Aug 22, Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma expressed concerns regarding the safety and security of Indian establishments in Bangladesh, including its high commission in Dhaka.“You know, we are working with limited staff members. Some of the local staff members are yet to join. It’s not violent. But there was a crowd today as many rushed to collect their passports,” an official told TOI wishing to remain unnamed. Sources said there was no proposal to pull out more staff from the country as of now.IVAC Bangladesh earlier said due to limited operations, the visa process may take longer. “Hence, we are returning passports now and it will be re-processed once operations resume. The applicant will be notified via SMS to re-submit his/her passport,” the centre said.India has the largest visa operations in Bangladesh and 16 lakh people visited India last year. Of them, 60% visited for tourism purposes, 30% for medical purposes and 10% for other purposes.","The Indian high commission in Dhaka has taken up the matter with the ministry of foreign affairs with a diplomatic note.

Harris is expected to address several policy shifts that have emerged since her nomination, including her changing stances on fracking, border security, and private health insurance. Her previous progressive positions on these topics as a 2019 presidential candidate have been a point of contention.Additionally, Harris may face questions about her awareness of President Biden’s mental decline, despite her public defense of him following a contentious debate performance.Walz, who will share the spotlight with Harris, is anticipated to face inquiries about his military service record and the left-wing policies implemented during his tenure as Minnesota's governor.CNN's Dana Bash, who moderated the June presidential debate marking Biden's campaign’s decline, will conduct the interview. The debate was a turning point, leading to increased scrutiny of Biden’s performance and subsequent withdrawal.Former President Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, have criticized Harris and Walz for their media avoidance. Trump's senior adviser, Jason Miller, took to social media to express his skepticism, labeling the interview as a ""cooked-up"" attempt to avoid tough questions.Miller claimed that Harris’s reluctance to appear alone and the decision to tape the interview were strategies to manage potential damage.He said, ""39 days in hiding for this?

Prevention and treatment

A person in Hampstead, New Hampshire, has died after contracting the rare mosquito-borne Eastern Equine Encephalitis ( EEE ) virus , health officials reported on Tuesday, said an AP report. The patient , an adult, was hospitalised with severe central nervous system disease and later died, according to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).The recent death has raised new concerns about the growing risk of EEE in New England, which is believed to be worsened by climate change .The last recorded human case of EEE in New Hampshire was in 2014, when DHHS identified three cases, including two fatalities.Earlier this month, Massachusetts reported its first human case of EEE this year, involving an elderly man. In response, state officials have implemented voluntary outdoor curfews, closed public parks, and carried out aerial and ground mosquito spraying to control the population.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) notes that symptoms of EEE include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, behavioral changes, and drowsiness. The disease can lead to severe neurological conditions such as encephalitis and meningitis. About 30% of those infected die, and many survivors experience long-term physical or mental effects. Individuals under 15 and over 50 are at higher risk.There are currently no vaccines or treatments for EEE. Health officials recommend using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and eliminating standing water to reduce mosquito breeding sites. A 2023 Climate Central report indicates that the number of ""mosquito days""- warm, humid days ideal for mosquito activity- has increased in the US over the past four decades due to climate change.","A person in Hampstead, New Hampshire, has died after contracting the rare mosquito-borne Eastern Equine Encephalitis ( EEE ) virus.

Previous incidents

A pro-Palestinian campus group at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, has alleged that the medical school deleted photos of Arab students from multiple social media platforms . The images, taken at a school event earlier this year, included students wearing keffiyehs , which symbolise solidarity with Palestinians.

The updated charges follow a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision granting former presidents broad immunity from prosecution.The revised indictment no longer includes allegations that Trump pressured the Justice Department to support his unfounded claims of election fraud.This change comes after the Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling that Trump is immune from prosecution for his interactions with the Justice Department. As a result, the indictment also removes Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department official who supported Trump’s false claims, from the list of co-conspirators. While the co-conspirators were unnamed, they have been identified through public records.The special counsel's office noted that the new indictment, filed in federal court in Washington, was issued by a grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in the case. The indictment still includes allegations that Trump attempted to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject the certification of the electoral vote count. Chief Justice John Roberts highlighted that Trump’s interactions with Pence are considered official conduct, making him ""presumptively immune"" from prosecution.","The revised indictment no longer includes allegations that Trump pressured the Justice Department to support his unfounded claims of election fraud.

It allows users to blur pictures except for specific matches and offers the option of having chaperones oversee meetings.Since its launch in 2015 in Britain, Muzz has attracted over 1.5 million users in Pakistan, making it the app's second-largest market after Morocco.The Lahore event provided a safe space for attendees like Aimen, 31, to step out of the confines of online interactions. “I used the app for two weeks, but when I saw an ad for this event, I thought, why not meet people in person?” she said.Moaz, 27, who has been using Muzz for a year, expressed hope that the event might help him find a life partner.However, he pointed out that many girls on the app expect parental involvement from the start, which he found challenging.
