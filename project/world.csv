Political survival amidst scandal

In a dramatic twist in Spanish politics, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has hinted at the possibility of resigning after a judicial investigation targeted his wife, Begoña Gómez , over allegations of influence peddling and corruption. The probe, initiated by a right-wing legal platform, has stirred significant controversy and debate across the nation.Earlier this Wednesday, Madrid's court announced the commencement of a preliminary investigation into accusations against Gómez.These allegations suggest she might have leveraged her position to sway business dealings to her benefit. The legal complaint, brought forward by the conservative group Manos Limpias, or ""Clean Hands,"" claims that Gómez secured undue advantages from Air Europa and its parent company Globalia during her tenure at an African research centre.Despite these severe charges, the Socialists' leader, who began his second term in November, voiced strong support for his wife, maintaining her innocence. ""Begoña will defend her honor and cooperate fully with the justice system to prove these seemingly scandalous facts are, in fact, nonexistent,"" Sánchez stated in a letter published on his X account.Sánchez described the attacks as profoundly unjust and harmful, necessitating a temporary withdrawal from his public duties to deliberate his political future. ""I need to stop and reflect,"" he wrote. ""Is it worth continuing amid this mire created by the right and far right in our politics? Should I remain at the government's helm or renounce that highest of honors?""This introspection comes at a crucial time, as Spain approaches important regional elections in Catalonia and subsequent European elections in June.Known affectionately as "" El Guapo "" (Mr Handsome), the 52-year-old has consistently demonstrated a propensity for taking bold risks that have often shifted political odds in his favor.In the previous year, facing a disappointing outcome in regional elections for his Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), Sanchez initiated a snap election. Despite the Popular Party (PP) securing the most seats, they fell short of a majority, leading Sanchez to craft a contentious agreement with smaller regional factions. This deal, notably including an amnesty for those involved in Catalonia's 2017 bid for independence, has intensified the existing political divide and drawn sharp criticism toward Sanchez and his party from opposition figures and the judiciary alike.Sanchez, maintaining his characteristic secrecy, disclosed plans for the snap election to only a select few within his inner circle, taking many by surprise. Similarly, on Wednesday, he confided exclusively in his family and close friends about his contemplation of resignation, personally drafting the announcement without the aid of his staff, as sources revealed to Reuters.Should Sanchez decide to resign, the fragmented nature of parliament might complicate the selection of his successor, suggests Lluis Orriols, a political science professor at Carlos III University in Madrid. Orriols believes a general election would be a more probable outcome.In critique of Sanchez's potential resignation, Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party, commented, ""Sanchez should have benched himself long ago"" due to the controversy surrounding the Catalan amnesty. ""We don't know if this is another of his propaganda maneuvers to present himself as a poor victim,"" he added.Public opinion appears mixed, with some viewing Sanchez's possible resignation as a strategic move to garner media attention. Cristina, a 24-year-old consultant in Madrid, expressed skepticism: ""I think it's a way of attracting attention and getting the press to react, but the reality is that he's not going to resign,"" opting not to provide her surname.Sánchez, known for his resilience and political acumen, faces perhaps his most challenging period. The Socialist leader, once celebrated for his decisive actions and reforms, now contends with an atmosphere tainted by allegations and public skepticism.Spain has seen its share of political scandals, but the potential resignation of Sánchez, a figure who has weathered numerous political storms, marks a significant moment in its contemporary political history. As the nation waits for his decision on Monday, the coming days are crucial for both Sánchez's career and the broader Spanish political landscape.(With inputs from agencies)","Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has hinted at the possibility of resigning.

Arizona indicts senior Donald Trump aides over 2020 fake elector scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arizona-indicts-senior-donald-trump-aides-over-2020-fake-elector-scheme/articleshow/109577497.cms,"LOS ANGELES: Arizona has charged 18 people over a scheme to subvert the 2020 election in favor of Donald Trump, the state's attorney general said Wednesday, with US media identifying the ex-president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani among those indicted.The felony indictments, which allege a conspiracy to award Arizona's slate of electors to the defeated real estate magnate, are the latest effort by a state to hold accountable those who backed Trump's false claim that he won the presidential vote.Arizona's Attorney General Kris Mayes said a grand jury had returned indictments on 11 local Republicans, including the party's former state chair, and seven others from out of state, whose names were redacted until all have been served with papers.According to the Washington Post, the seven include former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, attorneys Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn, as well as Giuliani, who acted as Trump's personal lawyer.The former president himself was not charged, but was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, the Post said.Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona, a critical election battleground, by just over 10,000 votes, but many Republican Party officials insisted -- without evidence -- that there had been fraud and that Trump had been the real winner.Electors -- representatives of the winning candidate in each state -- sign official documents that are sent to Congress after presidential elections.Despite Trump's loss in Arizona, his representatives nonetheless signed documents saying he had won.The fake electors strategy was allegedly part of a plan to obstruct the certification of Biden's presidential victory by Congress on January 6, 2021.Arizona is the fourth state to seek charges against people who tried to form an alternative slate of electors, after Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.Meadows, Giuliani, Ellis and Eastman have all been charged in Georgia, alongside Trump in what is probably the most explosive of the four criminal trials he faces.Wednesday's charges come as Trump is once again running for the White House, and still baselessly insisting that he won in 2020.Opinion polls show he is in a close race with an unpopular Biden.As a swing state and something of a ground zero for election conspiracy theories peddled by rightwing Republicans, Arizona is once again expected to be closely contested this November when Americans head to the polls.",Arizona charges 18 people over scheme to subvert the 2020 election in favor of Donald Trump.

Russia vetoes UN resolution calling for prevention of nuclear arms race in space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russia-vetoes-un-resolution-calling-for-prevention-of-nuclear-arms-race-in-space/articleshow/109577364.cms,"UNITED NATIONS: Russia on Wednesday vetoed a UN resolution sponsored by the United States and Japan calling on all nations to prevent a dangerous nuclear arms race in outer space.The vote in the 15-member Security Council was 13 in favour, Russia opposed and China abstaining. Russia dismissed the measure as politicised and said it did not go far enough in banning all types of weapons in space.The resolution would have called on all countries not to develop or deploy nuclear arms or other weapons of mass destruction in space, as banned under a 1967 international treaty that included the US and Russia, and to agree to the need to verify compliance.US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said after the vote that Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space, but that the country's veto raises the question of what the government may be hiding.Thomas-Greenfield's announcement of the resolution on March 18 followed White House confirmation in February that Russia has obtained a ""troubling"" anti-satellite weapon capability, although such a weapon is not operational yet.Putin declared later that Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space, claiming that the country has only developed space capabilities similar to those of the United States.Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council before the vote that the resolution was ""absurd and politicised"".Nebenzia proposed an amendment to the US-Japan draft saying an arms race in outer space should refer to all kinds of weapons -- not just nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. It was defeated by a vote of seven countries in favour, seven against and one abstention because it failed to get the minimum nine ""yes"" votes required for adoption.The defeated draft resolution said ""the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a grave danger for international peace and security"". It would have urged all countries carrying out activities in exploring and using outer space to comply with international law and the UN Charter.The draft would have affirmed that countries that ratified the 1967 Outer Space Treaty must comply with their obligations not to put in orbit around the Earth ""any objects"" with weapons of mass destruction, or install them ""on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space"".The treaty, ratified by some 114 countries including the United States and Russia, prohibits the deployment of ""nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction"" in orbit or the stationing of ""weapons in outer space in any other manner"".The draft resolution emphasised ""the necessity of further measures, including political commitments and legally binding instruments, with appropriate and effective provisions for verification, to prevent an arms race in outer space in all its aspects"".It reiterated that the UN Conference on Disarmament, based in Geneva, has the primary responsibility to negotiate agreements on preventing an arms race in outer space.The 65-nation body has achieved few results and has largely devolved into a venue for countries to voice criticism of others' weapons programmes or defend their own. The draft resolution would have urged the conference ""to adopt and implement a balanced and comprehensive programme of work"".At the March council meeting where the US-Japan initiative was launched, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that ""geopolitical tensions and mistrust have escalated the risk of nuclear warfare to its highest point in decades"".He said the movie ""Oppenheimer"" about Robert Oppenheimer, who directed the US project during World War II that developed the atomic bomb, ""brought the harsh reality of nuclear doomsday to vivid life for millions around the world"".""Humanity cannot survive a sequel to Oppenheimer,"" the UN chief said.","The vote in the 15-member Security Council was 13 in favour, Russia opposed and China abstaining.

Spain PM says weighing resignation after wife's graft probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/spain-pm-says-weighing-resignation-after-wifes-graft-probe/articleshow/109572769.cms,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Wednesday he was weighing the possibility of resigning after a court opened an investigation into his wife Begona Gomez on suspicion of graft .""I need to stop and think"" in order to decide ""whether I should continue to head the government or whether I should give up this honour,"" he wrote in a letter posted on X, formerly Twitter.He added that he would announce his decision on Monday and suspend his schedule until then. Madrid court said earlier on Wednesday that it had ""opened an investigation into Begona Gomez for the alleged offence of influence peddling and corruption"" in response to a complaint by Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), an anti-corruption pressure group whose leader is linked to the far right.The court statement came several hours after online news site El Confidencial said investigators were probing Gomez's ties to several private companies that received government funding or won public contracts.The site said the probe was linked to the alleged ties which Gomez had with Spanish tourism group Globalia, which owns Air Europa.It said she had twice met with Javier Hidalgo, Globalia's CEO at the time, when the carrier was in talks with the government to secure a huge bailout after it was badly hit by the plunge in air traffic due to the Covid-19 crisis.At the time, Gomez was running IE Africa Center, a foundation linked to Madrid's Instituto de Empresa (IE) business school, a position she left in 2022.The announcement sparked an angry backlash from the right-wing opposition Popular Party (PP), which has harangued Sanchez for months about his wife's alleged business ties.But Socialist premier Sanchez, in office since 2018, said in his letter that the complaint was based on ""non-existent"" facts and was part of a campaign of ""harassment"" against his wife led by ""ultraconservative"" media and supported by the conservative and far-right opposition.""I am not naive. I am aware that they are bringing charges against Begona, not because she's done anything illegal, because they know full well that's not true, but because she's my wife,"" he added.- Talks during airline bailout -El Confidencial said IE Africa Center had ""signed a sponsorship agreement with Globalia in 2020"" and that Gomez had also held a private meeting with Hidalgo at the company's offices.""At the same time Globalia was negotiating a multi-million-euro bailout with the government,"" it noted.Last month, Globalia told El Confidencial that Hidalgo and Gomez had met at its Madrid offices on June 24 and July 16.Between those dates, Sanchez's government on July 3 announced the creation of a 10-billion-euro fund to bail out strategic firms worst hit by Covid.Four months later, his cabinet approved a 475-million-euro lifeline for Air Europa, the first Spanish company to tap the funds.Investigators are also looking into two letters of support Gomez allegedly provided for a joint venture bidding for a public contract, El Confidencial said.The joint venture's main shareholder was consultant Carlos Barrabes, who has ties to the department run by Gomez at Madrid's Complutense University.It won the contract, beating 20 rivals, and was awarded 10.2 million euros, it said.- 'Trumpesque practices' -Manos Limpias, which filed the complaint, is headed by lawyer Miguel Bernad.Bernad was initially sentenced to four years behind bars in 2021 over a scheme to extort major firms, but last month was acquitted by the Supreme Court for lack of evidence.Questioned in Wednesday's parliamentary session about the El Confidencial story, Sanchez told lawmakers: ""Despite everything, I still believe in Spain's justice system.""Senior PP official Ester Munoz said it was ""imperative"" he explain.""His family is being investigated by the court... it is important enough that the prime minister explains himself to the Spanish people.""In a parliamentary session last month, PP leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo had warned Sanchez there would be an investigation.""If you refuse to give explanations again... there will be a specific investigation into matters affecting those closest to you, a parliamentary probe for sure, and a judicial one if necessary.""But Sanchez's deputy, Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero, hit back.""They are using a spurious complaint by a far-right organisation to defame and slander the prime minister,"" she said.""We will not let these Trumpesque practices undermine Spain's democracy.""",Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez says he is weighing the possibility of resigning. A court has opened an investigation into his wife Begona Gomez on suspicion of graft. The probe is linked to the alleged ties which Gomez had with Spanish tourism group Globalia.

"Columbia University extends talks with Gaza war protesters, averting another confrontation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columbia-university-extends-talks-with-gaza-war-protesters-averting-another-confrontation/articleshow/109575336.cms,"NEW YORK: Columbia University averted another confrontation between students and police early Wednesday, but the situation remained tense with campus officials saying it would continue talks with pro-Palestinian protesters for another 48 hours.University President Minouche Shafik had set a midnight deadline to reach an agreement on clearing an encampment of protesters on campus but the school extended negotiations, saying it was making ""important progress."" Student protesters had committed to dismantling and removing a significant number of tents, the New York Ivy League university said in a statement.On Wednesday about 60 tents remained at the encampment, which appeared calm, with students going in and out - one girl holding a toothbrush. A woman spoke on a loudspeaker about the reasons for the protest. Security remained tight around campus, with identification required and police setting up metal barricades.Standoffs also persisted at other universities across the country, including California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where protesters this week used furniture, tents, chains and zip ties to block a building's entrance and barricade themselves inside. And new student encampments continued to pop up, including at Brown University in Rhode Island and Harvard University in Massachusetts.Police first tried to clear the encampment at Columbia last week, when they arrested more than 100 protesters. But the move backfired, acting as an inspiration for other students across the country to set up similar encampments and motivating protesters at Columbia to regroup.Students protesting Israel's war with Hamas are demanding schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies enabling its monthslong conflict. Dozens have been arrested on charges of trespassing or disorderly conduct. Some Jewish students say the protests have veered into antisemitism and made them afraid to set foot on campus.The reprieve at Columbia came hours before Republican US House Speaker Mike Johnson planned to visit and meet with Jewish students to address concerns about antisemitism on college campuses.Columbia said it had agreed with protest representatives that only students would remain at the encampment and they would make it welcoming, banning discriminatory or harassing language.Elsewhere, at the University of Minnesota, Democratic US Rep. Ilhan Omar attended a protest late Tuesday, hours after nine protesters were arrested on the campus when police took down an encampment in front of the library. Hundreds had rallied in the afternoon to demand their release.Omar's daughter was among the demonstrators arrested at Columbia last week.Also Tuesday night, police arrested more than 200 protesters blocking traffic in Brooklyn, near the home of Senator Chuck Schumer, during a non-college demonstration demanding a permanent cease-fire in Gaza. The protest was organized by Jewish Voice for Peace on the second night of Passover.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the pro-Palestinian demonstrations on US college campuses in a video statement released Wednesday, saying the response of several university presidents has been ""shameful"" and calling on state, local and federal officials to intervene.At Cal Poly Humboldt, protesters chanted, ""We are not afraid of you!"" before officers in riot gear pushed into them at the building's entrance, video shows. Student Peyton McKinzie said she was walking on campus Monday when she saw police grab one woman by the hair and another student with their head bandaged for an injury.""I think a lot of students are in shock about it,"" she said.Three students were arrested, according to a statement from the school, which shut down the campus through Wednesday. Students had occupied a second campus building Tuesday.Students at some protests were hiding their identities. At an encampment of about 40 tents at the heart of the University of Michigan's campus in Ann Arbor, almost every student wore a mask, which was handed to them when they entered.Student protesters declined to identify themselves to reporters, saying they feared retribution by the university. Organizers of the protest said some students who had participated in prior protests at Michigan had been doxxed and punished. But some students passing by shouted at the protesters to remove their masks and show their faces.The upwelling of demonstrations has left universities struggling to balance campus safety with free speech rights. Many long tolerated the protests, but are now doling out more heavy-handed discipline, citing safety concerns.At New York University this week, police said 133 protesters were taken into custody and all had been released with summonses to appear in court on disorderly conduct charges.More than 40 protesters were arrested Monday at an encampment at Yale University.Harvard this week limited access to its famous Harvard Yard to those with school identification. Protesters said they set up a camp in the yard with 14 tents and about 30 people Wednesday, after a rally against the university's suspension of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee.Literature doctoral student Christian Deleon said he understood why the Harvard administration may be trying to avoid protests but said there still has to be a place for students to express what they think.""We should all be able to use these kinds of spaces to protest, to make our voices heard,"" he said.Ben Wizner, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said college leaders face extremely tough decisions because they have a responsibility to ensure people can express their views, even when others find them offensive, while protecting students from threats and intimidation.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the pro-Palestinian demonstrations on US college campuses.

Doctors combine pig kidney transplant and heart device in bid to extend woman's life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doctors-combine-a-pig-kidney-transplant-and-a-heart-device-in-a-bid-to-extend-womans-life/articleshow/109576403.cms,"The pig organ quest

A complex case at NYU

Two surgeries in eight days

NEW YORK: Doctors have transplanted a pig kidney into a New Jersey woman who was near death , part of a dramatic pair of surgeries that also stabilized her failing heart .Lisa Pisano's combination of heart and kidney failure left her too sick to qualify for a traditional transplant, and out of options. Then doctors at NYU Langone Health devised a novel one-two punch: Implant a mechanical pump to keep her heart beating and days later transplant a kidney from a genetically modified pig.Pisano is recovering well, the NYU team announced Wednesday. She's only the second patient ever to receive a pig kidney -- following a landmark transplant last month at Massachusetts General Hospital - and the latest in a string of attempts to make animal-to-human transplantation a reality.This week, the 54-year-old grasped a walker and took her first few steps.""I was at the end of my rope,"" Pisano told The Associated Press. ""I just took a chance. And you know, worst case scenario, if it didn't work for me, it might have worked for someone else and it could have helped the next person.""Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of NYU Langone Transplant Institute, recounted cheers in the operating room as the organ immediately started making urine.""It's been transformative,"" Montgomery said of the experiment's early results.But ""we're not off the hook yet,"" cautioned Dr. Nader Moazami, the NYU cardiac surgeon who implanted the heart pump.""With this surgery I get to see my wife smile again,"" Pisano's husband Todd said Wednesday.Other transplant experts are closely watching how the patient fares.""I have to congratulate them,"" said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Mass General, who noted that his own pig kidney patient was healthier overall going into his operation than NYU's patient. ""When the heart function is bad, it's really difficult to do a kidney transplant.""More than 100,000 people are on the US transplant waiting list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting. In hopes of filling the shortage of donated organs, several biotech companies are genetically modifying pigs so their organs are more humanlike, less likely to be destroyed by people's immune system.NYU and other research teams have temporarily transplanted pig kidneys and hearts into brain-dead bodies, with promising results. Then the University of Maryland transplanted pig hearts into two men who were out of other options, and both died within months.Mass General's pig kidney transplant last month raised new hopes. Kawai said Richard ""Rick"" Slayman experienced an early rejection scare but bounced back enough to go home earlier this month and still is faring well five weeks post-transplant. A recent biopsy showed no further problems.Pisano is the first woman to receive a pig organ - and unlike with prior xenotransplant experiments, both her heart and kidneys had failed. She went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated before the experimental surgeries. She'd gotten too weak to even play with her grandchildren. ""I was miserable,"" the Cookstown, New Jersey, woman said.A failed heart made her ineligible for a traditional kidney transplant. But while on dialysis, she didn't qualify for a heart pump, called a left ventricular assist device or LVAD, either.""It's like being in a maze and you can't find a way out,"" Montgomery explained - until the surgeons decided to pair a heart pump with a pig kidney.With emergency permission from the Food and Drug Administration, Montgomery chose an organ from a pig genetically engineered by United Therapeutics Corp. so its cells don't produce a particular sugar that's foreign to the human body and triggers immediate organ rejection.Plus a tweak: The donor pig's thymus gland, which trains the immune system, was attached to the donated kidney in hopes that it would help Pisano's body tolerate the new organ.Surgeons implanted the LVAD to power Pisano's heart on April 4, and transplanted the pig kidney on April 12. There's no way to predict her long-term outcome but she's shown no sign of organ rejection so far, Montgomery said. And in adjusting the LVAD to work with her new kidney, Moazami said doctors already have learned lessons that could help future care of heart-and-kidney patients.Special ""compassionate use"" experiments teach doctors a lot but it will take rigorous studies to prove if xenotransplants really work. What happens with Pisano and Mass General's kidney recipient will undoubtedly influence FDA's decision to allow such trials. United Therapeutics said it hopes to begin one next year.","Lisa Pisano's combination of heart and kidney failure left her too sick to qualify for a traditional transplant.

The CFS announced its findings on April 5, revealing that the levels of ethylene oxide found in these spice products exceeded the permissible limits set by Hong Kong regulations.The sale of food containing pesticide residues beyond safe limits is strictly prohibited in Hong Kong under the Pesticide Residues in Food Regulation (Cap. 132CM).Centre For Food Safety of Hong Kong special administrative region announced on April 5 that routine surveillance programs had uncovered the presence of ethylene oxide in three spice mixes from MDH Group - Madras Curry Powder, Sambhar Masala Powder, and Curry Powder.""The CFS collected the above-mentioned samples from three retail outlets in Tsim Sha Tsui respectively for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test results showed that the samples contained a pesticide, ethylene oxide.

""We have a draft law, which we are ready to consider immediately, on retaliatory measures.""""And the Europeans will lose more than we do,"" Matviyenko, who is a member of Russia's powerful Security Council, said.Matviyenko did not give specifics on what the response would be to the seizing of Russian assets which is still under discussion in the West.One option being discussed by the West is to confiscate the income on the underlying assets without taking the actual asset itself.Putin says the West unleashed what he casts as an economic war against Russia but has touted both the resilience of the Russian economy, which grew 3.6% last year, and the failure of sanctions of stop Russian trade.The Kremlin has repeatedly said that any seizure of its assets would go against all the principles of free markets which the West proclaims and that it would undermine confidence in the US dollar and euro while deterring global investment and undermining confidence in Western central banks.Russia has said it will challenge any confiscation of its assets in the courts.Some Russian officials have suggested that if Russian assets are confiscated then foreign investors' assets stuck in special so-called type ""C"" accounts in Russia could face the same fate.It is not clear exactly how much money is in these accounts.The speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said on Monday that Russia had grounds to seize Western assets after the move by the US House of Representatives.Volodin said that of the $280 billion of Russian assets frozen abroad, only $5 to $6 billion was in the United States while about 210 billion euros ($224 billion) was in the European Union.",Russia has drafted legislation to retaliate if nearly $300 billion of Russian assets were seized by the West and used to help Ukraine.

UK passes Rishi Sunak's ambitious Rwanda migrant bill after facing two years of challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-passes-rishi-sunaks-ambitious-rwanda-migrant-bill-after-facing-two-years-of-challenges/articleshow/109516070.cms,"NEW DELHI: The UK Parliament has recently approved a controversial bill that allows the government to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda for their asylum claims to be assessed in the East African nation, as per a report by CNN.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faced opposition in Parliament and legal challenges in British courts while trying to push through this bill, with lawmakers and activists raising concerns about human rights implications.The government's attempts to implement this policy have led to significant embarrassment, as millions of pounds have been sent to Rwanda for a program that has not yielded any results so far, as reported by CNN.The aim of the bill is to deter irregular migration into the UK, particularly targeting individuals who travel in unsafe small boats from France, often facilitated by criminal organizations. Under the legislation, individuals who reach the UK may be sent to Rwanda for their asylum claims to be processed. If their claim is accepted, they will remain in Rwanda. However, if their claim is rejected, the bill states that they cannot be deported from Rwanda to any country other than the UK, although the exact outcome in such scenarios remains unclear.The concept of this scheme was introduced in 2022 when Prime Minister Sunak made it a priority to halt these arrivals, aligning with a Conservative promise to ""stop the boats."" However, two years later, the absence of any deportations has been viewed as a significant setback for Sunak, according to CNN. Last year, the UK Supreme Court deemed the policy unlawful due to the risk that asylum seekers could face ill-treatment if returned to Rwanda, violating international human rights standards. The court highlighted previous concerns regarding human rights abuses in Rwanda, such as extrajudicial killings and torture.In response to these challenges, the UK government introduced the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill earlier this year, asserting that Rwanda is a safe country and overriding the judiciary's concerns. Home Secretary James Cleverly confirmed that the bill has been passed in Parliament and will soon become law, aiming to prevent misuse of human rights claims to obstruct deportations and reaffirming UK sovereignty over European court rulings, as per CNN.Despite the bill's approval, potential legal hurdles may arise in the European Court of Human Rights, given the UK's commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights. The European court has previously prohibited the UK from transferring asylum seekers to Rwanda. The bill has faced delays due to ongoing amendments in a process known as ""ping pong"" between the House of Commons and the House of Lords.In 2022, the migration observatory at the University of Oxford reported 45,744 arrivals via small boats, contributing to a total net migration of 745,000 for the year. These figures pose a challenge for Prime Minister Sunak and the Conservative Party , especially with an upcoming general election. Opposition parties, such as Labour, have expressed intentions to scrap the Rwanda relocation plans if they come into power. The general election is expected to take place later this year, setting the stage for a contentious debate on immigration policies, according to Al Jazeera.(With inputs from agencies)","UK Parliament has approved a bill that allows the government to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda for their asylum claims to be assessed.

A day before engaging with Beijing's senior officials,

Blinken

ventured to the vibrant city of

.

There, he indulged in local cuisine, enjoyed a basketball match, and leisurely walked along the renowned Bund promenade, overlooking the bustling Huangpu River.

In a reception room with panoramic views of the Shanghai skyline, Blinken met with the local Communist Party leader. He conveyed US President

Joe Biden

's dedication to fostering ""direct and sustained"" dialogue between the world's two largest economies, following years of escalating tensions.

""I think it's important to underscore the value -- in fact, the necessity -- of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,"" Blinken said.

""We have an obligation for our people -- indeed an obligation to the world -- to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,"" he said.

Chen Jining, the Chinese Communist Party secretary for Shanghai, extended a warm welcome to Blinken, partially in English, emphasizing the significance of US businesses to the city.

""Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity,"" Chen told Blinken.

Shanghai, known as the country's financial capital, often serves as a launching pad for political careers in China, as evidenced by President

Xi Jinping

's prior service in the city.

Although China has not yet disclosed plans for Blinken to meet with Xi, it's worth noting that during Blinken's previous visit in June, they had an impromptu meeting, announced at the last minute.

Blinken, marking the first visit by a US Secretary of State to Shanghai in 14 years, commenced his trip on Wednesday evening at a restaurant famous for its steamed buns. Opting for a tieless suit, he dined with his senior staff outdoors, seated on wooden chairs in a bustling shopping arcade, while curious onlookers snapped pictures.

After dinner, Blinken attended a thrilling playoff game between the Shanghai Sharks and Zhejiang Golden Bulls, staying until the end.

US quietly shipped long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-quietly-shipped-long-range-atacms-missiles-to-ukraine/articleshow/109574273.cms,"WASHINGTON: The United States in recent weeks secretly shipped long-range missiles to Ukraine for use in its battle to fight off Russian invaders, and Ukraine has now used them twice, a US official said on Wednesday.The missiles were contained in a $300 million military aid package for Ukraine that US President Joe Biden approved on March 12, said the US official, speaking on condition of anonymity.The official would not say how many of the missiles were sent.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, at a briefing for reporters, confirmed that a ""significant number"" of the missiles had been sent to Ukraine and said ""we will send more.""He said Ukraine has committed to only use the weapons inside Ukraine, not in Russia.Some of the missiles were contained in a $1 billion weapons package for Ukraine that President Joe Biden approved on Wednesday, Sullivan said.The missiles were used for the first time in the early hours of April 17, launched against a Russian airfield in Crimea that was about 165 km (103 miles) from the Ukrainian front lines, the official said.The official said Ukraine used the weapon a second time overnight against Russian forces in southeastern Ukraine.Whether to send the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) with a range up to 300 km was a subject of debate within the Biden administration for months. Mid-range ATACMS were supplied last September.The Pentagon initially opposed the long-range missile deployment, fearing the loss of the missiles from the American stockpile would hurt US military readiness. There were also concerns that Ukraine would use them to attack targets deep inside Russia.Russia's use of North Korean-supplied long-range ballistic missiles against Ukraine in December and January, despite US public and private warnings not to do so, led to a change in heart, the US official said.Also a factor in US decision-making was Russia's targeting of Ukraine's critical infrastructure, the official said.""We warned Russia about those things,"" the official said. ""They renewed their targeting.""In late January the US military found a way to satisfy their concerns about military readiness, which enabled the administration to move forward. They began acquiring new missiles coming off the Lockheed-Martin production line.Biden met with his national security team in mid-February and agreed to accept the unanimous recommendation of his advisers to send the missiles to Ukraine. Involved in the discussion were national security adviser Jake Sullivan, defense secretary Lloyd Austin, secretary of state Antony Blinken and joint chiefs of staff chairman CQ Brown.The challenge at that point was to figure out how to pay for the missiles. The United States had exhausted all of its funding options and congressional gridlock stymied further aid.An opportunity arose in March, when several Pentagon contracts came in under bid. Biden was able to use the difference to send $300 million in assistance to Ukraine.Biden told his team to include the long-range ATACMS in this funding package, but to do so secretly in order to maintain operational security and the element of surprise for Ukraine, the official said.",The missiles were contained in a $300 million military aid package for Ukraine.

Biden signs bill to force TikTok's Chinese owner to sell app in 1 year or be banned in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-signs-bill-to-force-tiktoks-chinese-owner-to-sell-app-in-1-year-or-be-banned-in-us/articleshow/109573859.cms,"TikTok says will fight US ban law in court

WASHINGTON: Driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or surveil them with the help of TikTok, US Senate voted by a wide margin Tuesday in favour of a legislation that would ban the short-video app in the country if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest it in the next nine months to a year.President Joe Biden signed the bill into law on Wednesday.""For years we've allowed the Chinese Communist party to control one of the most popular apps in America... that was dangerously shortsighted,"" said Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on Intelligence Committee.Vowing that TikTok would fight the law in US courts, its CEO Shou Zi Chew told the app's 170million users in US, ""Make no mistake, this is a ban on you and your voice.""The four-year battle over TikTok is just one front in a war over the internet and technology between Washington and Beijing. Last week, Apple said Beijing had ordered it to remove Meta's WhatsApp and Threads from its app store in China over Chinese national security concerns.Asked about the Senate's vote, the Chinese foreign ministry referred on Wednesday to comments the ministry had made in March when the House of Representatives passed a similar bill. At the time, it criticised the legislation, arguing ""though the US has never found any evidence of TikTok posing a threat to the US's national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok.""TikTok is set to challenge the bill on First Amendment grounds and its users are also expected to again take legal action. A US judge in Montana in Nov blocked a state ban on TikTok, citing free speech grounds. The American Civil Liberties Union said banning or requiring divestiture of TikTok would ""set an alarming global precedent for excessive govt control over social media platforms"".TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Chinese govt, has told employees it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation. ""This is the beginning, not the end of this long process,"" it told staff Saturday in an email seen by Reuters.The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favour of the bill. The TikTok divestment directive won fast-track approval after being introduced just weeks ago.If ByteDance failed to divest TikTok, app stores operated by Apple, Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled apps or TikTok's website. The bill would also give the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats.It could also be an issue in the Nov prez election race. Biden's signing sets a Jan 19 deadline for a sale - one day before his term is set to expire - but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines ByteDance is making progress. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Monday that Biden was ""pushing"" for a ban on TikTok and would be the one responsible if a ban were imposed, urging voters to take notice. Biden's re-election campaign plans to continue using TikTok, a campaign official said Wednesday. Trump's campaign has not joined TikTok.In 2020, then-Prez Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok. However, the new law is likely to give the Biden administration a stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say.","President Joe Biden signed the bill into law on Wednesday.

The 79-18 vote provided Biden another legislative accomplishment to point to, even in the face of an obstructionist House.The Pentagon said Wednesday it would rush the first $1 billion in aid to Ukraine, including shoulder-fired Stinger surface-to-air missiles and other air defense munitions, 155 mm shells, Javelin anti-tank guided missiles, cluster munitions and battlefield vehicles.But even as he hailed the package Wednesday, Biden said the process should have ""been easier, and should have gotten there sooner.""""It was a difficult path,"" he added, saying that those on the ground in Ukraine had cheered the news. ""But in the end we did what America always does. We rose to the moment.""The measure comes as Biden faces backlash in the United States over his support for Israel in the war in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government's campaign in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of people and created a hunger crisis there.""My commitment to Israel,"" Biden said, ""is ironclad.""Biden's critics on the left are angry about his willingness to provide more weapons to Israel, though the legislation also includes $1 billion for humanitarian aid that the president said will be rushed to Gaza.""Israel must make sure this aid reaches all of the Palestinians in Gaza, without delay,"" Biden said.The president's signature capped a long road for the White House, one of careful political maneuvering with a new House speaker who faced vehement opposition from the far right of the Republican Party over helping Ukraine.""Imagine if instead we had failed,"" Biden said as he admonished ""MAGA Republicans"" for allowing Ukrainian officials to run low on artillery.The White House first sent a request for the security package in October, but Republicans -- many of them egged on by former President Donald Trump -- said the United States was bearing too much of the burden. Trump, who has long expressed admiration for President Vladimir Putin of Russia, has made clear that he would not back Ukraine if he wins in November.US officials have bluntly acknowledged that the six-month delay put Ukraine at a disadvantage in its fight against Russia.""The Russians have slowly but successfully taken more ground from the Ukrainians and pushed them back against their first, second and, in some places, their third line of defense,"" John Kirby, a spokesperson for Biden's National Security Council, said on Tuesday on Air Force One. ""The short answer is: Yes, there absolutely has been damage in the last several months.""The White House strategy in recent months involved impressing upon members of Congress - and the American people -- that Ukraine could lose the war without the desperately needed aid.Biden instructed his top aides to avoid publicly criticizing Speaker Mike Johnson but instead to provide him with regular security briefings on the risks of not sending aid, according to senior administration officials. The officials asked for anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, assured Johnson in one call that the United States would be sure to track all of the aid after the speaker called for more accountability over the security assistance.Biden's chief of staff, Jeff Zients, held daily strategy sessions with the president's top aides, including Sullivan; Steve Ricchetti, a senior counselor; and Shuwanza Goff, the director of legislative affairs.Last month, as the aid remained stuck in gridlock, Sullivan made a secret mission to Kyiv, Ukraine, keeping the issue in the headlines.Johnson has said that the security briefings, led by CIA director William Burns, were a crucial factor to winning over his support.The aid is broken up into four pieces: a measure for each of the three US allies and another meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives that includes a provision that could result in a nationwide ban on TikTok.The bill includes $60.8 billion for Ukraine; $26.4 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8.1 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. It also includes sanctions against Iranian and Russian officials.The House also added a provision that would require the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion. The idea to include some of the aid for Ukraine in the form of a loan was another example of the influence Trump has over Congress.Trump has called to make any future aid to Ukraine a loan.","President Joe Biden signs a $95.3 billion package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The package reaffirms US support for Ukraine in the fight against Russia's military assault.

In less than 48 hours, the Pakistani military had carried out retaliatory strikes in Iran on what it said were “hideouts used by terrorist organisations”.Raisi, the first Iranian president to visit Pakistan in eight years, met the country’s top leadership, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, President Asif Zardari and Army Chief General Asim Munir, during his trip. He also extended invitations to President Zardari and PM Sharif to make official visits to Iran.“They (Pakistan and Iran) reiterated the importance of cooperation in the energy domain, including trade in electricity, power transmission lines and Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project,” a joint Iranian-Pakistani statement said, recalling their aim to increase the volume of bilateral trade to $10 billion over the next five years from the current $2 billion.“There was consensus to fully operationalise barter trade mechanisms between the two sides to facilitate economic and commercial activity,” the handout read.The gas pipeline project has languished for more than a decade because of political turmoil and international sanctions.On Tuesday, the US state department had warned Islamabad of the risk of sanctions after it promised greater security and economic cooperation with Iran during President Raisi’s visit.“We advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions. But ultimately, govt of Pakistan can speak to their own foreign policy pursuits,” US state department spokesperson Vedant Patel said during a news briefing.The implied threat of sanctions, observers said, comes at a difficult time for Pakistan, which is struggling economically and is looking to its allies for financial support, especially important allies like the US, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates, three nations that are seen as Iran’s adversaries.",Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s three-day visit to Pakistan ended on Wednesday.

Columbia University makes progress in talks with Pro-Palestinian student protesters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columbia-university-makes-progress-in-talks-with-pro-palestinian-student-protesters/articleshow/109570381.cms,"NEW DELHI: Columbia University announced early Wednesday that it was making significant progress in negotiations with pro-Palestinian student protesters who had established a tent encampment on campus. The university extended the deadline for the protesters to clear out, despite ongoing tensions. The protesters agreed to dismantle and remove a substantial number of tents, leaving a smaller encampment on the upper Manhattan campus Wednesday morning.Meanwhile, at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, protesters began blocking building entrances Monday evening using furniture, tents, chains, and zip ties.The campus is located approximately 300 miles north of San Francisco. Both campuses are experiencing escalating demonstrations by university students demanding that schools sever financial ties with Israel and divest from companies supporting the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas . Numerous protesters have been arrested on charges of trespassing or disorderly conduct.Columbia President Minouche Shafik had initially set a midnight Tuesday deadline to reach an agreement to clear the encampment. However, by around 3 am, the university reported that there was ""constructive dialogue"" and that conversations would continue for an additional 48 hours. The university's statement also mentioned that student protesters would ensure the departure of non-Columbia affiliates and that only Columbia University students would participate in the protest. Additionally, the protesters agreed to comply with city fire department requirements and took measures to make the encampment welcoming to all, prohibiting discriminatory or harassing language.The university's statement was issued hours before US House Speaker Mike Johnson's visit to Columbia to meet with Jewish students and address antisemitism on college campuses. At the University of Minnesota, Democratic US Rep. Ilhan Omar attended a protest late Tuesday, shortly after nine protesters were arrested on campus when police dismantled an encampment in front of the library.Earlier in the afternoon, hundreds had rallied to demand their release. ""I am incredibly moved by your courage and bravery as a student body in putting your bodies on the line to stand in solidarity to end the genocide taking place in Gaza,"" Omar told those gathered, as reported by the Minneapolis Star Tribune.Omar's daughter was among more than 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators at Columbia who were arrested Thursday, inspiring protesters nationwide to establish encampments.Also on Tuesday night, police arrested more than 200 protesters blocking traffic during a non-college demonstration demanding a permanent cease-fire in Gaza at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, near the home of Sen. Chuck Schumer. The protest was organized by Jewish Voice for Peace on the second night of Passover, with protesters laying down a large circular banner depicting the food on a Seder plate.At Cal Poly Humboldt, protesters chanted, ""We are not afraid of you!"" before officers in riot gear pushed into them at the building's entrance, as shown in a video. Student Peyton McKinzie reported seeing police grabbing one woman by the hair and another student having their head bandaged for an injury. Three students have been arrested, according to a statement from the school, which shut down the campus until Wednesday. Students had occupied a second campus building Tuesday.Another encampment was set up Tuesday at the University of Rochester in upstate New York, where Omar Darwesh, a Palestinian senior, said he has lost relatives to the war. ""We're not calling for the destruction of Israel; we're never talking about threatening Jews. The focus is on us and what we need, and that's being treated like a human. We have to find a way to coexist,"" he told TV station WHEC. University of Rochester officials said in a statement that the protesters must follow ground rules, including presenting university identification if asked.The surge in demonstrations has left universities grappling with the challenge of balancing campus safety with free speech rights. Many have long tolerated the protests, which largely demanded that schools condemn Israel's assault on Gaza and divest from companies that sell weapons to Israel. However, universities are now imposing more stringent discipline, citing safety concerns as some Jewish students claim that criticism of Israel has crossed the line into antisemitism.Protests had been simmering for months but intensified after last week's arrests at Columbia. By late Monday at New York University, police reported that 133 protesters were taken into custody and all had been released with summonses to appear in court on disorderly conduct charges. In Connecticut, police arrested 60 protesters, including 47 students, at Yale after they refused to leave an encampment on a plaza at the center of campus.Yale President Peter Salovey stated that protesters had declined an offer to end the demonstration and meet with trustees.","Protesters agreed to dismantle and remove a substantial number of tents, leaving a smaller encampment on the upper Manhattan campus Wednesday morning.

Trump objected to the Ukraine aid , and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it.That ended when the Republican-controlled House of Representativesabruptly changed course and approved four bills that included funding for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other US partners in the Indo-Pacific on Saturday.Biden and House Speaker Mike Johnson held intense talks about Ukraine in February and the president has both pleaded with Republicans to back the package and scolded them for not doing so. Johnson, who faces calls by some right-leaning Republicans to oust him for his turnaround on aid, met with Trump in Florida earlier this month; the former president said Johnson was ""doing a really good job.""The US Senate followed the House on Tuesday evening, passing a sweeping bill that provides $61 billion in aid to the country, which has suffered setbacks in the war that supporters blame on the delay in getting the additional US funding.""Congress has passed my legislation to strengthen our national security and send a message to the world about the power of American leadership: We stand resolutely for democracy and freedom, and against tyranny and oppression,"" Biden said in a statement after the Senate vote on Tuesday.He said he would sign the bill on Wednesday.Heather Conley, an expert on European affairs, said the victory for US allies and for Biden was tempered by effects that the delay has had for Kiev on the battlefield.""This is a strong message of American leadership at a time of enormous instability, but the delay created cracks in that credibility,"" said Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ""As we start rolling into the election, that credibility will continue to be under close scrutiny.""Biden has argued that he helped restore US credibility on the world stage after Trump's tumultuous four-year tenure, in part by strengthening the NATO alliance and providing a united front against Russian President Vladimir Putin .Trump has argued for an ""America First"" policy and has threatened to let NATO allies fend for themselves if they do not increase their defense spending.Biden's administration is already preparing a $1 billion military aid package for Ukraine, the first to be sourced from the bill, two US officials told Reuters.Republicans who backed the aid package said it was not a vote for Biden but a reflection of their party's values.""Peace through strength. That's our tradition,"" Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, said in a Senate speech. ""To my Republican colleagues and friends in the Senate, our tradition is much more serious. It's prouder. And I will tell you this: It's much more supported by the American people. Peace through strength, not American retreat.""","President Joe Biden signs a bill that provides billions of dollars of new US aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia.

What US intel officials say about China’s new H-20 stealth bomber,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-us-intel-officials-say-about-chinas-new-h-20-stealth-bomber/articleshow/109565832.cms,"US officials appear unfazed by the development of China's new H-20 stealth bomber, which is expected to be Beijing’s response to American advanced stealth aircraft like the B-21 Raider . During a briefing at the Pentagon, a Department of Defense intelligence official confidently remarked that the Chinese stealth bomber does not measure up to the US low observable platforms.""The thing with the H-20 is when you actually look at the system design, it’s probably nowhere near as good as US LO platforms, particularly more advanced ones that we have coming down,"" the official said, emphasizing that China has encountered significant engineering challenges that hinder its operational capabilities comparable to US models such as the B-2 or B-21.As per a Breaking Defense report, despite China's plans to soon unveil the H-20, as indicated by a Chinese military official to the state-owned Hong Kong Commercial Daily, the US intelligence community sees it more as a display of military prowess than a practical augmentation in capability. ""You may choose to unveil it just because they want to show that they’re a great, you know, military power. That doesn’t necessarily mean it actually delivers them the kind of capability that they would need or at the quantity that they would need,"" added the DoD official.This sentiment aligns with previous US military assessments, such as when Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, former Pacific Air Forces Commander, downplayed the capabilities of China's J-20 stealth fighter in 2022, suggesting it was not a significant concern. The DoD intelligence official concurred that while the J-20 is a capable system, it did not meet all of China’s initial expectations.Moreover, the briefing underscored China's broader military modernization efforts, including the significant expansion of its nuclear arsenal, which US officials estimate could exceed 1,000 warheads by 2030. However, the efficacy of China's military might is questionable, highlighted by reports of corruption within its ranks leading to defective equipment and ineffective leadership. Despite these challenges, the US is preparing for a potential protracted conflict, emphasizing readiness over complacency.","US officials appear unfazed by the development of China's new H-20 stealth bomber.

FAQs: Remnants of bird flu virus found in retail milk in US: What you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/faqs-remnants-of-bird-flu-virus-found-in-retail-milk-in-us-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/109565835.cms,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced the detection of bird flu virus remnants in pasteurized milk samples. Despite the discovery, the FDA reassured the public that the commercial milk supply remains safe, emphasizing that the pasteurization process effectively inactivates the virus. This statement comes in the wake of an avian influenza outbreak that has affected dairy cattle across eight states, impacting millions of wild and commercial birds in recent years.As the situation evolves, the FDA continues to conduct extensive testing to ensure public safety and maintain confidence in the US milk supply.The detection of bird flu in dairy cows marks a concerning development, but it has not led to significant health issues in humans, with only two mild infections reported so far. The FDA's ongoing assessments and the robust pasteurization standards are critical in managing any potential risks associated with this outbreak. Experts like Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus microbiologist, affirm that there is no evidence of infectious virus in the milk, and further results from the FDA's comprehensive testing are expected soon.Here is all you need to know about it:Q: What did the FDA find in the pasteurized milk samples?A: The FDA discovered remnants of the bird flu virus in some pasteurized milk samples. These findings are considered non-infectious as the pasteurization process, which involves heating milk to a specific temperature, likely inactivates the virus. Although the virus itself is not active, the presence of viral genetic material was detected through sensitive PCR lab tests.Q: Is pasteurized milk safe to consume given the recent findings?A: Yes, pasteurized milk is safe to consume. The FDA and food safety experts emphasize that the pasteurization process effectively kills harmful bacteria and viruses, including the bird flu virus. The detection of viral particles does not represent a risk to consumers, and the commercial milk supply remains safe according to the FDA's ongoing assessments.Q: What steps are being taken to ensure the safety of the milk supply?A: The FDA is conducting a large, representative national sample testing of milk from affected animals, in processing systems, and on grocery shelves to understand the extent of the findings. They are also employing egg inoculation tests, considered the gold standard for determining viable viruses, to assess any positive findings further. These comprehensive efforts aim to maintain the integrity and safety of the U.S. milk supply.Q: Have there been any human infections linked to this outbreak?A: There have been two reported cases of human infection linked to the bird flu outbreak in dairy cows. Both cases were mild; one individual developed a mild eye infection, and the other experienced fatigue. These cases underline the limited impact of the virus on human health, especially when proper food safety protocols like pasteurization are followed.(With inputs from agencies)","The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced the detection of bird flu virus remnants in pasteurized milk samples.

'China developing marine toxins for biological warfare',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/china-developing-marine-toxins-for-biological-warfare/articleshow/109565397.cms,"NEW DELHI: The US state department has raised alarms in its latest arms control compliance report about China’s military conducting research on marine toxins , suggesting potential violations of the Biological Weapons Convention ( BWC ). The convention, which China ratified in 1984, aims to eliminate biological weapons, yet ongoing activities suggest a secretive development that could be geared toward military use.The state department report explicitly mentions that China's research involves ""biological activities with potential biological weapons applications,"" specifically pointing to the development of toxins for military purposes.This research is linked to sea-based neurotoxins, some of the most potent poisons known, which target the central nervous system and can be lethal in minimal quantities, a Washington Times report said.This concern is heightened by China’s past biological weapons programs which included agents like ricin and anthrax. The recent focus on marine toxins marks a new direction in strategic weapons research for Beijing. The US intelligence has suspicions that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is repurposing civilian research—ostensibly aimed at preventing marine toxin poisoning from seafood—for weapons development .The report draws on a 2014 government-sponsored Chinese research that discussed the potential of using anatoxins, saxitoxins, and tetrodotoxin as biological weapons. Despite these disclosures, China has reportedly not provided comprehensive details about its past or present biological weapons programs to other BWC signatories, breaching the convention’s requirements.Thomas DiNanno, a former arms control official, criticized the current administration for not pressing China on these issues, suggesting a reluctance to address what he perceives as a significant escalation in bioweapons development. Meanwhile, Ryan Clarke from the National University of Singapore views this revelation as an indicator of the Chinese Communist Party's focus on integrating bioweapons into their standard military capabilities.The issue is set to be a topic of discussion at an upcoming BWC working group meeting in Geneva. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to press China on these matters in various international forums, aiming to build diplomatic pressure for transparency and compliance.","The US state department has raised alarms in its latest arms control compliance report about China’s military conducting research on marine toxins.

Global impact

and consumer reaction

Varied reasons for price increases

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The recent outbreak of bird flu has led to a significant increase in egg prices worldwide, impacting consumers and industries alike. After a brief respite in 2023, avian influenza has resurfaced, affecting poultry facilities across the United States, Japan, and other countries, which in turn has pushed the cost of eggs higher, a CNBC report said.David Anderson, a professor and food economist at Texas A&M University, explained the direct cause of the soaring egg prices: ""The reason for the big surge in egg prices is HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) hitting egg farms and killing chickens and cutting egg production."" The impact in the US has been particularly harsh, with over 14 million egg-laying chickens dying in November and December 2023 alone. The last 30 days have seen more than 8 million birds among America's commercial flocks remain infected, exacerbating the situation.Countries worldwide, including the US, EU, Russia, South Africa, India, and Nigeria, are facing historically high egg prices, according to Nan-Dirk Mulder, a senior analyst at Rabobank. This has led some consumers to start stockpiling eggs in anticipation of further price increases. One user on the social media platform X shared, ""Stocking up on eggs since I'm assuming they'll be $7/dozen again in a few weeks."" Others have turned to alternative strategies, like freezing eggs, to manage costs and maintain supply, the CNBC report said.In addition to bird flu, other factors have contributed to rising egg prices globally. In Mexico, a severe heatwave has caused significant hen fatalities, pushing prices up by 30%. Japan, the second largest consumer of eggs per capita, has reported bird flu cases across several prefectures, leading to price hikes of over 20%. Similarly, in Indonesia, prices for purebred chicken eggs have risen more than 10% since the start of the year.As meat prices reach record highs, eggs have become a cost-effective alternative for many households. ""We have had record high beef, pork, and chicken retail prices so eggs can be a substitute, meaning that egg prices would increase,"" Anderson noted. For those looking to extend the shelf life of their eggs, the US Department of Agriculture advises that ""frozen egg products will remain safe indefinitely,"" though they are best used within one year for optimal quality.","Bird flu has led to a significant increase in egg prices worldwide, impacting consumers and industries alike.

Terrorism threats

NEW DELHI: FBI director Christopher Wray has issued a stark warning about the unprecedented level of threats facing the United States, including from China, border security issues, and terrorism . Addressing a House Appropriations Subcommittee, Wray expressed concern over the ""heightened threat environment"" and the need for adequate funding to combat these risks.Wray emphasized that the threat from China is the most significant, noting that the People's Republic of China has developed an extensive cyberespionage operation targeting American intellectual property across various industries, from biotechnology to agriculture.""You could close your eyes and pull an industry or sector out of a hat and, chances are, Beijing has targeted it,"" Wray stated, underscoring the breadth of China's cyber activities.On the issue of border security, Wray highlighted the ongoing challenges posed by drug cartels and the influx of fentanyl, which poses a severe risk to public health. The FBI Director also noted the terrorist threat at border entry points, mentioning that ""it didn’t take a big number of people on 9/11 to kill 3,000 people,"" to illustrate the potential dangers.The threat level from terrorism has escalated, particularly following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Wray reported a rise in calls for attacks against the U.S. from various terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah and Al Qaeda. The convergence of these threats highlights the complex security landscape that the U.S. must navigate.Wray's warnings come as the US government debates funding levels, with the FBI's budget reportedly $500 million short of what is necessary to maintain its current operations against these diverse threats.","FBI Director Christopher Wray issues stark warning about the unprecedented level of threats facing the U.S. Wray emphasized that the threat from China is the most significant, noting that the People's Republic of China has developed an extensive cyberespionage operation.

The visit is closely watched amid ongoing tensions with Israel, and US sanctions.“We are committed to strengthening relations at high levels. We have decided to increase economic, commercial, and cultural relations between Pakistan and Iran,” Raisi said.Sharif echoed the sentiment. “We have to keep this relationship strong despite the challenges we face,” he said, commending Iran for its firm stand on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and urging for an immediate cessation of hostilities.Pakistan and Iran share a 900km border, which is susceptible to unlawful crossings, smuggling, and militant infiltration. Both nations accuse each other of failing to prevent terrorist organisations from seeking refuge on their territory and conducting cross-border assaults.Last Jan, Iran launched missile strikes against anti-Iranian militant hideouts in Pakistan’s southwestern Baluchistan province, prompting Islamabad to retaliate with strikes on bases of anti-Pakistan militants operating from Iranian soil. The exchange of strikes raised concerns about larger conflicts and regional instability.The Iranian President is accompanied by his spouse, the foreign minister, cabinet members, and business representatives.Analysts said Raisi’s visit will also address financial and legal issues related to the construction of a gas pipeline between the two countries. Despite signing an agreement in June 2009 for the pipeline to export Iranian natural gas to Pakistan, construction on the Pakistani side has not started, possibly due to US pressure as Iran’s energy sector faces sanctions for its nuclear programme.

Russia warns Pakistan of banning rice imports over phytosanitary concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/russia-warns-pakistan-of-banning-rice-imports-over-phytosanitary-concerns/articleshow/109477207.cms,"KARACHI : Russia has warned Pakistan that it would ban rice imports again if Moscow's phytosanitary concerns are not addressed in future consignments after a quarantine organism was detected in the rice consignment. The warning came after Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (FSVPS) issued a notification regarding violations of international and Russian phytosanitary requirements over a shipment of rice imported from Pakistan.Dated April 2, the notification highlights the presence of a quarantine organism, ""Megaselia scalaris (Loew),"" in the rice consignment.Pakistan's trade representative at its embassy in Russia was asked to carry out an immediate investigation into the matter.The Russian authorities have written to the Pakistan embassy to prevent such violations and ensure all Pakistani rice exporters follow phytosanitary standards to ensure the safety of agricultural products traded between the two countries.The trade wing of the Pakistani embassy in Moscow, while forwarding the Russian authority's letter to the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) in the Ministry of Food Security and other relevant government offices, has warned of a possible ban on rice exports in future if more complaints were received from Russian authorities.Russia had previously imposed a ban on rice imports from Pakistan in 2019 because of health safety reasons.Similarly, in December 2006, Russia stopped the import of rice from Pakistan for not meeting food safety standards.Chairman of the Pakistan Rice Exporters Association, Chela Ram Kewlani, said that Pakistani rice exporters needed to be very careful in choosing and packaging all rice for export.He said that Pakistan had benefited from India banning exports of non-Basmati rice last year, given that India has a nearly 40 per cent share in the globally traded rice.Last year, India banned the export of white non-Basmati and parboiled rice.According to a leading Pakistani rice dealer, about 700,000 tonnes of rice were exported in December 2023 alone, the highest in a month for the fiscal year.He said Pakistan exported rice with an increase in higher production and demand and elevated global prices last year.The Rice Export Corporation is projecting a 60 per cent jump in exports of Basmati rice to over a million tonnes and a 36 per cent jump for non-Basmati rice to 4.25 million tonnes from Pakistan.It is eyeing exports of above five million metric tonnes of all rice in the fiscal year of 2023/2024, which would be much higher than last fiscal year's exports of 3.7 million tonnes.",Russia has warned Pakistan that it would ban rice imports again if Moscow's phytosanitary concerns are not addressed in future consignments.
