China's June factory activity contracts for second month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-june-factory-activity-contracts-for-second-month/articleshow/111374511.cms,"BEIJING: China's manufacturing contracted for a second month in June, an official factory survey showed on Sunday, keeping alive calls for further stimulus after a string of recent indicators showed the economy struggling to get back on its feet.The official purchasing managers' index (PMI), at 49.5 in June, was unchanged in May, below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and in line with a median forecast of 49.5 in a Reuters poll.The PMI, a sentiment-based indicator, tends to paint a gloomier picture of the world's second-biggest economy than hard data. However, disappointing May industrial output numbers suggest factory owners have some reasons to be worried.While China's exports exceeded forecasts in May, experts say the jury is still out on whether export sales are sustainable given growing trade tensions between Beijing and Western economies. Meanwhile, a protracted property crisis continues to drag on domestic demand.As consumers remained wary and the May holiday boost faded, the non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction, fell to 50.5 from 51.1 in May, the lowest since December.Analysts expect China to roll out more policy support measures in the short term, while a government pledge to boost fiscal stimulus is seen helping kick domestic consumption into a higher gear.But high local-government debt and deflationary pressures cast a long shadow over recovery prospects, despite a slew of measures officials have rolled out since last October, tempering investors' and factory owners' expectations.Private sector investment grew 0.1% in January to May, down from 0.3% in the first four months alone, while the property investment slump worsened.China's central bank last month announced a relending programme for affordable housing to accelerate sales of unsold housing stock so supply better matches demand.Officials are under pressure to fire up new growth engines to reduce the economy's reliance on property.Premier Li Qiang told a World Economic Forum meeting on Tuesday that growth of new industries was supporting healthy economic development.""Since the beginning of this year, China's economy has maintained an upward trend... and is expected to continue to improve steadily over the second quarter,"" Li said.","The official purchasing managers' index (PMI), at 49.5 in June, was unchanged in May.

A private call of top Democrats fuels more insider anger about Biden's debate performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-private-call-of-top-democrats-fuels-more-insider-anger-about-bidens-debate-performance/articleshow/111373892.cms,"NEW YORK: A sense of concern is growing inside the top ranks of the Democratic Party that leaders of Joe Biden 's campaign and the Democratic National Committee are not taking seriously enough the impact of the president's troubling debate performance earlier in the week. DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country, a group of some of the most influential members of the party.He did not acknowledge Biden's weak showing Thursday night or the avalanche of criticism that followed.Multiple committee members on the call, granted anonymity to talk about the private discussion, described feeling like they were being gaslighted - that they were being asked to ignore the dire nature of the party's predicament. The call, they said, may have worsened a widespread sense of panic among elected officials, donors and other stakeholders.Instead, the people said, Harrison offered what they described as a rosy assessment of Biden's path forward. The chat function was disabled and there were no questions allowed.Many donors, party strategists and rank-and-file DNC members are publicly and privately saying they want the 81-year-old Biden to step aside to allow the party to select a younger replacement at the Democratic National Convention in August. As of now, though, Biden's closest allies insist he remains well-positioned to compete against Republican Donald Trump and have given no indication they will push him to end his campaign.Those best positioned to replace him - Vice President Kamala Harris, California governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer among them - reiterated their support for Biden after the debate.Many are anxiously awaiting the first major round of post-debate public polling to determine their next steps.Polls from CNN and 538/Ipsos conducted soon after the debate found that most debate-watchers thought Trump outperformed Biden. But the two men's favourability ratings remained largely unchanged, just as they did in the aftermath of Trump's conviction on charges in New York that he illegally participated in a hush money scheme to influence the 2016 election.In a subsequent appearance on MSNBC, Harrison downplayed the significance of the conference call, which he said was part of a regularly scheduled communication ""to talk about the state of the race"" and the upcoming national convention with the DNC's many elected members across the country.Biden and his campaign have sought to project confidence in the days since Thursday's debate in which the president, who already faced serious concerns about his physical and mental stamina, offered a performance punctuated by repeated stumbles, uncomfortable pauses, and a quiet speaking style that was often difficult to understand.Just after Saturday's DNC call, the Biden campaign released a memo from senior adviser Jen O'Malley Dillon insisting that the debate had no tangible impact on the election.""On every metric that matters, data shows it did nothing to change the American people's perception, our supporters are more fired up than ever, and Donald Trump only reminded voters of why they fired him four years ago and failed to expand his appeal beyond his MAGA base,"" O'Malley Dillon wrote.She added, ""If we do see changes in polling in the coming weeks, it will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls.""Meanwhile, Biden spent much of Saturday courting wealthy donors in New York's famed wealthy enclave of the Hamptons.""I didn't have a great night, but neither did Trump,"" Biden said of the debate at one gathering in East Hampton.Of Trump, Biden said, ""The big takeaway was his lies.""Trump, meanwhile, gloated about Biden's performance at a rally Friday and suggested on his social media platform Saturday that Biden had faded ""under tremendous pressure."""," DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country. Harrison did not acknowledge Biden's weak showing Thursday night or the avalanche of criticism that followed.

These imports show Russia's ongoing dependence on Western technology as it tries to navigate the Western efforts to isolate it from global supply chains as a consequence of its invasion of Ukraine.As per the Reuters report, between 2018 and 2023, Russia imported equipment and components worth at least $34 million for assembling Aurus cars and motorcycles. This included car body parts, sensors, programmable controllers, switches, welding equipment, and other components worth nearly $15.5 million from South Korea, as well as parts from China, India, Turkey, Italy, and other EU countries.

However, the former journalist, who made history in the 2000s with a scoop on the expenses of British MPs when he was editor of the Daily Telegraph, is finding his position increasingly vulnerable.For weeks now, revelations have multiplied about his role, when he was working for the Murdoch family's conservative media group about 12 years ago, in a scandal of illegal phone tapping by the tabloid The News of the World. On Friday, Lewis was at the centre of an investigation by his own journalists. According to the Washington Post, he gave the go-ahead in 2011 for the destruction of thousands of emails, fuelling suspicions that he was destroying evidence, which he denies.As the US presidential election approaches, the affair is poisoning the atmosphere at a long-vaunted newspaper that is ""not doing well economically,"" says Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy.The Post was among trusted news outlets that benefited from the upheaval that marked Trump's four years in the White House that ended with his loss to President Joe Biden.

She has significant experience in the Senate and has been a visible member of the Biden administration. However, her own presidential campaign in 2020 struggled to gain traction, raising questions about her viability as the top candidate. Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg: Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has maintained a high profile since his own 2020 presidential bid. His articulate communication style and experience as a cabinet member make him a strong contender. California governor Gavin Newsom: Newsom has been a vocal and high-profile governor, particularly noted for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in California. His progressive policies and strong state leadership position him as a potential candidate should Biden withdraw. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer: Whitmer has gained national attention for her leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and her strong stance on various social issues. Her popularity in a key swing state adds to her potential candidacy. Senator Elizabeth Warren: Warren, known for her progressive stance on economic issues and her strong advocacy for consumer protection, remains a popular figure within the Democratic Party.

North Korea executes man for listening to 70 K-pop songs: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-executes-man-for-listening-to-70-k-pop-songs-report/articleshow/111331129.cms,"A recent report by South Korea's unification ministry has revealed the extreme measures taken by North Korean authorities to control the influx of foreign culture and information, particularly from South Korea. The 2024 Report on North Korean Human Rights, which compiles testimonies from 649 North Korean defectors , highlights a disturbing case of a 22-year-old man from South Hwanghae province who was publicly executed in 2022 for ""listening to 70 South Korean songs , watching three films, and distributing them,"" violating a 2020 North Korean law that prohibits ""reactionary ideology and culture"".The Guardian said that the report also details other instances of crackdowns on practices deemed ""reactionary,"" such as brides wearing white dresses, grooms carrying the bride, wearing sunglasses, or drinking alcohol from wine glasses, all of which are perceived as South Korean customs.Additionally, mobile phones are frequently inspected for contact name spellings, expressions, and slang terms that are considered to be influenced by South Korea, despite the fact that both Koreas share the same language with subtle differences that have emerged since the division after the Korean War of 1950-1953.The ban on K-pop is part of a larger campaign initiated by former leader Kim Jong-il and intensified under his son Kim Jong-un to protect North Koreans from the perceived negative influence of Western culture .In 2022, the US government-funded Radio Free Asia reported that the regime was cracking down on ""capitalist"" fashion and hairstyles, targeting skinny jeans, T-shirts with foreign words, and dyed or long hair. Experts believe that allowing South Korean popular culture to infiltrate North Korean society could threaten the ideology that demands absolute loyalty to the Kim dynasty, which has ruled the country since its founding in 1948.Despite the harsh measures implemented by the North Korean government, the influence of South Korean culture appears to be unstoppable, according to a recent North Korean defector.The woman in her early 20s, who defected from North Korea, said, ""The speed of South Korean culture influencing North Korea is seriously fast. Young people follow and copy South Korean culture, and they really love anything South Korean.""Information continues to seep through and be distributed via informal networks, even with the border to China largely sealed off due to the Covid-19 outbreak.In recent weeks, North Korea has retaliated against the launch of balloons from the South containing anti-Pyongyang leaflets, dollar bills, and USB sticks loaded with K-pop and K-dramas by sending thousands of balloons over the border containing waste.The defector also shed light on the hidden resentment against the regime, saying, ""Of course we cannot say anything bad against Kim Jong-un publicly, but among close friends, lovers or family members, we do say those words.""She added, ""After watching Korean dramas, many young people wonder, 'Why do we have to live like this?' ...

Panicked Democrats call for Joe Biden to stand down after debate debacle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/panicked-democrats-call-for-joe-biden-to-stand-down-after-debate-debacle/articleshow/111347303.cms,"WASHINGTON: US Democrats are in panic mode after a disastrous Presidential debate on Thursday night in which their presumptive nominee Joe Biden had what can charitably described as several senior moments, including a brain freeze that became a gif (repeat gif) that will keep on giving.The sitting President's performance was so sketchy and shaky that some Democrats are suggesting he should step down and allow the party convention to nominate a new younger candidate to take on Donald Trump , 78, whose performance at the debate was shallow and superficial, but who at least projected confidence along with his familiar bluster.In contrast, Biden, 81, came across as frail and feeble. Speaking in a thin, raspy voice -- ostensibly because he is recovering from a cold -- he was often incomprehensible and disjointed, his voice trailing off into mumbles. He failed to corner a rival who is a recently convicted felon, and who was winging it with vague generalities and dissembling when asked specific policy questions.Despite calls from some quarters to quit the race, Biden associates said he will be preparing to participate in the second presidential debate on September 10. He will have nearly ten weeks to shape up if he is not shipped out by them.Even Biden partisans were shocked by the evening's debacle.“I love Joe Biden. I know he’s a good man. I know his heart is good. I know he’s dedicated to our country and is surrounded by good people.Tonight was heartbreaking in many ways. This is a big political moment. There’s panic in the Democratic party . It’s going to be a long night,"" Maria Shriver, the former first lady of California and a member of the Kennedy family wrote on the social media platform X.Former Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill offered a more blunt take, saying while the debate showcased that Trump is “a liar, a flawed character, mean, a jerk, very unlikable,” Biden ""had one thing he had to accomplish and that was reassure America that he was up to the job at his age, and he failed at that tonight,”“I’m not the only one whose heart is breaking right now. There’s a lot of people who watched this tonight and felt terribly for Joe Biden,” she added.Party veterans tried to stem the panic, suggesting that voters should look at the larger picture. ""It's a choice between someone who cares about you -- your rights, your prospects, your future -- versus someone who's only in it for himself,"" former First Lady, Senator, and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said.But with polls showing Biden's age is going against him, there is pressure in the Democratic establishment from activists and donors to act quickly. “Joe had a horrible night, cementing concerns about his age, his greatest electoral weakness. Our odds of Trumpocalypse II just materially increased. It’s tragic, since we could have chosen to let Trump and the nation marinate over him being a convicted felon,” Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and a Democratic donor was quoted as saying in an email to party insiders.","Biden, 81, came across as frail and feeble.

Family dynamics: How Melania-Ivanka relationship changed after Trump conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/family-dynamics-how-melania-ivanka-relationship-changed-after-trump-conviction/articleshow/111292947.cms,"In recent discussions, the dynamics between Melania Trump , her husband Donald Trump, and his daughter Ivanka Trump have come under renewed scrutiny, the relationship between Melania and Ivanka has seen some changes following Donald Trump's legal troubles, according to reports.A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York."" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years, a Newsweek report said.Melania Trump's former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff , weighed in on the evolving dynamics within the Trump family. Wolkoff, who has previously published a tell-all book about her time with the former first lady, described some of the recent claims about Melania and Ivanka's relationship as ""ridiculous."" Wolkoff's comments suggest that the public may not have the full picture of the intricate relationships within the Trump family.This development comes as Donald Trump faces various legal challenges, which have undoubtedly impacted the family's interactions. The former president's conviction in New York has led to increased media attention on his personal life, including his relationships with Melania and Ivanka.Historically, there have been reports of tension between Melania and Ivanka. Ivanka, who served as a senior advisor during Donald Trump's presidency, often took on a prominent role, leading to speculation about her influence and relationship with her stepmother. However, the current situation appears to show a thawing of relations between the two women, perhaps brought on by the pressures of their shared circumstances.Melania Trump has largely remained out of the public eye since leaving the White House, making few public statements and maintaining a low profile. Ivanka, on the other hand, has also stepped back from the political spotlight but continues to be a figure of interest due to her high-profile role during her father's administration.As the Trump family navigates these legal and personal challenges, the evolving relationships within the family continue to be a topic of public fascination. The reported improvement in Melania and Ivanka's relationship adds a new layer to the complex narrative of the Trump family's public and private lives.","A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York"" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111292941,imgsize-10050,width-400,resizemode-4/111292941.jpg"
Here's what it would take Democrats to replace Joe Biden as party nominee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/heres-what-it-would-take-democrats-to-replace-joe-biden-as-party-nominee/articleshow/111370001.cms,"Democrats have ways to replace Joe Biden at the top of their presidential ticket after a harrowing debate against Republican Donald Trump - but doing so without their standard-bearer's acquiescence would be a daunting task. Party members once united behind Biden are now scouring candidate resumes and researching rules for a contingency plan to present voters with a different nominee after a universally panned performance Thursday cemented worries about the President's ability to serve a second term.""The easiest one is, Biden takes himself out of the race,"" said Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic National Committee member and author of a book about the presidential nominating process. ""Then yes, there's rules and procedures and the party would replace him."" While pushing Biden off the ticket is possible, the lack of an obvious candidate to replace him makes such a gambit unlikely, Kamarck said.The debate saw months of Democratic anxiety over Biden, already the oldest US president in history at 81, and his prospects for defeating Trump, boil over.The president Friday acknowledged the limitations of his debate showing but dismissed calls to exit the race.If Biden doesn't step aside, forcing him out would be a Herculean undertaking for Democrats. Any rival would first have to collect 600 delegate signatures on a petition to place his or her name in nomination at the Democratic convention - with no more than 50 signatures from any one state. That's about 13% of the delegates. But with Biden controlling 99% of the pledged delegates, that would require challengers convincing Biden loyalists to flip their support.""The odds are not insurmountable, but they're very high for any scenario that involves a delegate revolt,"" said Josh Putnam of FHQ Strategies, a non-partisan consulting firm specializing in delegate selection rules.The Biden campaign has vetted his delegates for their loyalty, but they do have room to change their minds. Unlike Republican delegates, who are often legally bound to cast their vote for a particular candidate, Democratic rules say only that pledged delegates ""shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.""A move to change the ticket - whether Biden agrees to go willingly or is pushed out - would bring a convention free-for-all not seen for decades.In an ""open"" or ""brokered"" convention, no candidate comes into the roll-call vote with enough delegates to be guaranteed the nomination. Voting could last any number of rounds until a candidate wins.Such a convention would also put so-called ""super-delegates"" in the spotlight. Those delegates - leaders and elected officials who get to the convention by virtue of their position - have been stripped of some powers in recent years as the party worried their influence in the process was undemocratic. But if a nomination goes into a second ballot, those automatic delegates, who number more than 700, could sway the convention.Another wild card is that the party is free to change its rules at any time before the nomination, potentially lowering or raising the bar for a Biden challenger.The most obvious heir apparent is vice-president Kamala Harris - but Democrats don't have to pick Biden's running mate. Some of the most discussed alternatives include Governors Gavin Newsom of California, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, all of whom say they still support Biden.The nomination vote was scheduled for Aug 21, but the DNC has raised the possibility of a virtual roll call before Aug 7 to accommodate early ballot deadlines. If Biden steps aside after the convention, the decision on how to replace him would be up to the 400 plus members of the DNC -- the chairman would consult with Democratic congressional lead- ers and governors and make a recommendation.",Democrats have ways to replace Joe Biden at the top of their presidential ticket. But doing so without their standard-bearer's acquiescence would be a daunting task.

Tropical Storm Beryl , the second named storm of the active hurricane season , emerged on Friday in the Atlantic Ocean. According to Google Trends, Beryl is capturing significant attention as it has the potential to intensify into the first hurricane of the year before reaching the Caribbean Sea early next week.The mational hurricane center in Miami reported that Beryl was moving westward on Friday, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph).A tropical storm is characterized by sustained winds ranging from 39 mph to 73 mph (62 kph to 117 kph). Winds exceeding this threshold classify the storm as a hurricane.The 2024 hurricane season, predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to be significantly above average, is projected to see 17 to 25 named storms. In comparison, a typical Atlantic hurricane season produces an average of 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes, three of which are major.Earlier in June, an unnamed storm brought over 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain to parts of South Florida, stranding motorists on flooded roads and causing water intrusion in low-lying homes.

This figure is approximately 30 per cent lower than the 73 million people who tuned in to watch the candidates' initial debate in 2020, making it one of the three lowest-rated first presidential debates since 1976.The comparatively low viewership could suggest a lack of voter enthusiasm for both candidates, although it does not fully account for the growing popularity of online viewing as traditional TV audiences continue to decline.Media experts were interested in observing how CNN 's new format would unfold and whether it could serve as a model for future debates.Three media experts agreed that the format's restrictions, including the ability to mute the candidates' microphones, should be adopted by other networks as they helped maintain a level of discipline.CNN, which held exclusive rights to host the debate, provided candidates with two minutes for each answer and one minute for rebuttals, muting their microphones if they exceeded the allotted time.The studio had no audience, and moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper did not fact-check the candidates in real-time.Despite criticism from some media commentators about the lack of real-time fact-checking, which allowed both candidates to make false claims, CNN defended its approach. ""The role of the moderators is to present the candidates with questions that are important to American voters and to facilitate a debate, enabling candidates to make their case and challenge their opponent,"" a CNN spokesperson said.During the debate, Biden's performance was shaky and hesitant, while Trump made numerous exaggerated or false claims that largely went unchallenged by his opponent.Frank Sesno, a professor at the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University and a former CNN journalist, remarked, ""Without having an audience, you got a sense of who these guys are and what they are."" He added, ""You got the sense of Trump the attack dog and Biden as something of the policy wonk and the hesitant old man that you saw standing behind that mic.""",Nielsen data reveals that over 51 million TV viewers watched the US presidential debate.

The cinematographer died Oct. 21, 2021, after a gun Baldwin was holding discharged on the ""Rust"" film set.During a two-day hearing, Sommer listened to arguments from Baldwin's legal team claiming that his charges should be dismissed because evidence, including the Pietta 45 Colt revolver replica used in the shooting, was destroyed.The FBI conducted tests on the gun at the prosecution's request, which the court documents describe as ""intentional"" destruction. This, according to the documents, deprives Baldwin of a fair trial, reported Fox News Digital.Earlier, Baldwin's lawyers argue in a motion seeking to dismiss the charge that the firearm in the shooting was heavily damaged by FBI forensic testing before it could be examined for possible modifications that might exonerate the actor.During the fatal rehearsal on October 21, 2021, Baldwin was pointing the gun at Halyna Hutchins on a movie-set ranch when it went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza, who survived. Baldwin says he pulled back the gun's hammer but did not pull the trigger.Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer, was convicted in March of involuntary manslaughter and received an 18-month prison sentence for her involvement in the shooting incident. During the trial, an FBI expert testified that the gun was fully functional with safety features intact when it arrived at their laboratory. The expert demonstrated that he had to strike the fully cocked gun with a mallet and break it for it to discharge without the trigger being depressed.","Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection to the death of Halyna Hutchins.

CENTCOM stated that the strike on Friday was carried out ""to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure.""They added: "" This continued malign and reckless behaviour by the Iranian-backed Huthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.""The attacks have caused insurance costs to increase significantly for vessels transiting the Red Sea, leading many shipping firms to take the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead.","US forces destroyed seven drones and a control station vehicle in areas of Yemen controlled by the Huthis.

Gusty winds and extremely hot, dry conditions continue to fuel the flames. The wildfire produced 20-40 foot flame lengths in several areas.“The southeast side of the fire remained active throughout the night producing 20-40 foot flame lengths in areas. Additional resources were redirected to that side of the fire last night to begin structure protection and help crews start firing operations to tie the fire into nearby roads,” said Tiffany Davila, spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management, as quoted by AP.Evacuation efforts have been coordinated with the Red Cross setting up a center at a high school in Scottsdale. Shelters for horses and other large animals have been arranged at locations such as the rodeo grounds at Cave Creek. Scottsdale officials have closed part of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve as a precaution, though they noted there was no immediate threat.Air tankers equipped with red retardant and helicopters with giant buckets of water have supported ground crews in their efforts to keep the flames away from power lines.The National Weather Service forecasts above-normal temperatures to persist into next week, with many desert locations expected to see highs around or above 110 degrees Fahrenheit each afternoon.Meanwhile, conditions have improved south of Bend, Oregon, where the threat from a wildfire near La Pine has decreased, allowing officials to release some of the firefighting crews.

However, Fonseca passed away in a Panamanian hospital in May.Judge Marquinez determined that the evidence obtained from the law firm's servers had not been collected in accordance with due process, casting doubts on its ""authenticity and integrity"". The judge also concluded that ""the rest of the evidence was not sufficient and conclusive to determine the criminal responsibility of the defendants,"" as stated in the court's statement.The ""Panama Papers"" scandal erupted in 2016 when leaked documents from Mossack Fonseca exposed how many wealthy individuals around the world had hidden assets in offshore companies.

Former President Barack Obama on early Saturday shared his thoughts on the recent debate performance , acknowledging that ""Bad debate nights happen."" Drawing from his own experiences, Obama said that the remains a choice between two distinct candidates: one who has consistently fought for the common people and another who prioritises self-interest. He highlighted the importance of honesty and the ability to distinguish right from wrong, contrasting it with someone who ""lies through his teeth for his own benefit."" Obama stressed that the debate's outcome did not alter the high stakes of the November election.""Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight — and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit.Last night didn’t change that, and it’s why so much is at stake in November,"" the former US president said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).The debate's impact on voters' perceptions of Biden 's fitness for another term in office raised concerns among some Democrats, who questioned whether he should remain their candidate for the upcoming election. Biden's occasional verbal missteps and sometimes meandering responses during the debate amplified these apprehensions.In a spirited campaign rally in North Carolina, a crucial swing state, Biden came out fighting on Friday, attempting to recover from a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump and asserting his suitability to win the presidential election in November. The rally took place amidst whispers within his concerned Democratic party about replacing the 81-year-old as their candidate.Biden candidly admitted to his supporters, ""I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to."" However, he emphatically declared, ""But I know how to tell the truth. I know how to do this job,"" receiving thunderous applause and pledging, ""when you get knocked down, you get back up.""Following Thursday's debate, Biden's team was in damage-control mode as he frequently hesitated, stumbled over words, and lost his train of thought, heightening concerns about his ability to serve another term. He had intended to address doubts about his advanced age and expose Trump as a habitual liar. However, the president failed to counter his bombastic rival, who delivered an unchallenged reel of false or misleading statements about everything from the economy to immigration.During the rally, Biden delivered the lines that Democrats wished they had heard in the televised debate. He questioned, ""Did you see Trump last night? My guess is he set a new record for the most lies told in the single debate."" He then strongly asserted, ""Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this nation. He's a threat to our freedom. He's a threat to our democracy. He's literally a threat for everything America stands for.""",Former President Barack Obama on early Saturday shared his thoughts on the recent debate performance.

After the incident the plane continued safely to Baltimore, Southwest said.Several other incidents involving Southwest flights in recent months have raised concerns.Last week, the FAA said it was investigating a Southwest flight that descended to a low altitude of around 500 feet (152.4 m) about 9 miles (14.5 km) from the Oklahoma City airport.After the automated Minimum Safe Altitude Warning sounded, an air traffic controller alerted the flight crew of Southwest Airlines Flight 4069, which had departed from Las Vegas.Earlier this month, the FAA and NTSB said they were investigating a May 25 Southwest flight of a Boeing 737 MAX. The NTSB said the plane experienced a ""Dutch roll"" at 34,000 feet while en route from Phoenix, to Oakland, California. Such lateral asymmetric movements are named after a Dutch ice-skating technique and can pose serious safety risks.The FAA said this month it was also investigating a Southwest 737 MAX 8 flight in April that came within about 400 feet of the ocean off the coast of Hawaii after bad weather conditions prompted pilots to bypass a landing attempt at Lihue airport.During the go-around, the first officer ""inadvertently pushed forward on the control column while following thrust lever movement commanded by the autothrottle,"" according to a June 7 airline memo, and the plane began to descend rapidly, hitting a maximum descent rate of about 4,400 feet per minute.The pilots in a post-debrief said seeing the severity of the flight ""through the animations was a significant, emotional event,"" Southwest said, adding the incident prompted the airline to review data and trends related to its procedures, training, standards, and performance.","Southwest Flight 4805 departed from a temporarily closed runway in Maine earlier this week.

Kabul harbouring TTP leaders, claims Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Amid heightened tensions with the Taliban rulers in Kabul and under increasing pressure from China, the Pakistan government has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"", to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan .Speaking about the new initiative, defence minister Khawaja Asif recently told the Voice of America that Pakistan was even willing to go as far as carrying out cross-border strikes to eliminate militant hideouts in Afghanistan -- a move that could potentially trigger a retaliatory move from the Taliban regime.There has been a spike in terror-related incidents in Pakistan ever since the Taliban stormed back to power in Kabul in August 2021 after the US suddenly withdrew from the war-torn country.Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023.Many of the incidents have centered around Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan areas.Terror incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been of particular concern to the Pakistan government as they have resulted in the deaths of many Chinese citizens working on projects related to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have highlighted the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).China has come out strongly against the attacks and has sternly warned Islamabad that it must take strict and effective action or it would re-evaluate its investments and projects in the country.Pakistan has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for majority of the attacks and has repeatedly asserted that the terrorist organisation's leaders are being given a safe haven in the border areas of Afghanistan.The defence minister's strong statement came on the day JUI-F Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned about the critical security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Rehman has claimed that things have reached a point where even the police could not go out at night due to the presence of armed men. The TTP ended its ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022.In an interview with Voice of America, Asif said Islamabad could strike terror havens in Afghanistan and it would not be against international law since Kabul had been ""exporting"" terrorism to Pakistan and the ""exporters"" were being harboured there.He said though the TTP was operating from the neighbouring country, its cadre, about a few thousand in number, ""are operating from within the country"" and blamed the previous Imran Khan-led PTI government for bringing militancy back.The minister also ruled out any chances of dialogue with the banned outfit, saying that there was no common ground.Speaking about 'Azm-i-Istehkam', Asif said parliament would be taken on board in this regard and the concerns of political parties would also be addressed.Dawn reported that in separate remarks to local news channels, the minister said Islamabad would ""stringently enforce international laws at its borders with Afghanistan"" to restrict the movement of smuggled goods.The media outlet reported him as saying that the decision would also ""thwart the infiltration of terrorists"".","Pakistan has approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability"" The move is to root out domestic terror threats and stem the activities of fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.

The National Assembly of Pakistan approved the government's finance bill for the upcoming fiscal year on Friday, which includes significant tax increases, the bill was passed ahead of further negotiations with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) regarding a new bailout package, as the country seeks to prevent a debt default amidst the slowest economic growth in South Asia.Despite facing strong opposition from rival political parties, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the tax-heavy budget in parliament, which was subsequently endorsed by the ruling alliance under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq announced the bill's passage during a live television broadcast.The government has set an ambitious tax revenue target of 13 trillion rupees ($46.66 billion) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, representing a nearly 40% increase from the current year. This target was outlined in the national budget presented on July 12, which aimed to bolster Pakistan's case for a new IMF rescue package, with the country currently in discussions for a loan ranging from $6 billion to $8 billion.The tax increases include a 48% rise in direct taxes and a 35% increase in indirect taxes compared to the revised estimates for the current year. Non-tax revenue, such as petroleum levies, is expected to surge by an astonishing 64%. Textile and leather products, as well as mobile phones, will face an 18% tax, and there will be an increase in the tax on capital gains from real estate transactions. Workers will also be subject to higher direct taxes on their income.Pakistan has forecasted a significant reduction in its fiscal deficit for the new financial year, aiming for 5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), down from an upwardly revised estimate of 7.4% for the current year. However, the central bank has cautioned about the potential inflationary impact of the budget, noting that limited progress in structural reforms to expand the tax base means that increased revenue must come from tax hikes. The country has set a growth target of 3.6% for the upcoming year, with inflation projected at 12%.",The National Assembly of Pakistan approved the government's finance bill for the upcoming fiscal year on Friday.

However, he has secured relief in other cases, including £190 million reference and Toshakhana, and acquittal in the cypher case, according to Geo News report.Earlier in February, the district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi each to seven years in prison after the trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Bushra Bibi's former husband, Khawar Maneka, approached the court against the couple's marriage.The district court had sentenced the PTI founder and Bushra each, to seven years in prison in February earlier this year after a trial court found their nikah to be fraudulent after Khawar Maneka, Bushra's ex-husband, moved the court against the couple's marriage.Khawar Maneka said that the marriage was solemnized during Bushra Bibi's iddat period, the time a woman goes into isolation after a divorce or her husband's death. Imran Khan and his wife then filed appeals, including the ones against their conviction and those seeking suspension of their sentences.Considering Khawar Maneka's repeated expression of no-confidence, the Islamabad high court (IHC), on Judge Arujmand's request, transferred the case to the court of additional district and sessions judge Muhammad Afzal Majuka.On June 25, the district and sessions court reserved its verdict on pleas against Khan and Bushra Bibi's conviction, after directions given by IHC to decide the matter of suspension of the sentences within 10 days, Geo News reported.The court had also given one month for the decision on the petition filed by the couple against their conviction.

He said security forces had arrested two key militant commanders— TTP’s Nasrullah, alias Maulvi Mansoor, and Idrees, aka Irshad— and then showed a recorded statement of the former.In the video statement Nasrullah claimshe belongs to South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil and that he had worked from slain Baitullah Mehsud’s platform before joining TTP in 2007.He recalled that he had settled in Afghanistan’s Paktika province during the2014 military offensive in North Waziristan and had been working as an “emir” in TTP’s defence commission since 2023.He thenexplainedaplanhe had been briefed about in Jan 2024 according to which a BLA guide would take him to southern Balochistan by helping him cross the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan through Spin Boldak town. According to the militant, Bashir Zeb, commander of BLA Majeed Brigade, was complicit in the plan’s creation.Nasrullah alleged India’s intelligence agency R&AW was behind all this, that it wanted a BLA-TTP nexus, and that TTP bases be established in Khuzdar, Balochistan.“TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsudand the outfit’s defence minister, Mufti Muzahim, said we(TTP)and our friends(R&AW)have three objectives in establishing a foothold in Balochistan,” he claimed, adding: “Sabotaging CPEC projects, including targeting Chinese citizens; carrying out kidnappings for ransom to play up the matter of enforced disappearances so that intelligence agencies can be defamed; and spreading anarchy and frustration among the people by fomenting terrorist activities in Balochistan.”He claimed that Mehsud held meetings with R&AW agents at the Indian embassy in Kabul and that this was fully supported by the Afghan government.After showing Nasrullah’s video statement, Langau said, “The global community should have no doubt left that there is India behind all this.”He said that while TTP vowed to “introduce an Islamic system”, the BLA on the other hand was their “ideological opposite”. “Their nexus only means that their investor is the same who is using them from two angles,” he alleged. “If you look at the financial support or the intelligence of BLA and TTP, or their members sitting abroad, there is no doubt that RAW is funding them,” Langau alleged.","Minister Ziaullah Langau’s allegations came during a press conference in Quetta.

What they're saying

“A soft state can never gain the trust of investors,” PM Shehbaz remarked. “The responsibility of the fight against terrorism is the collective duty and the primary obligation of all state institutions. It’s not about you and me, it’s about us, we have to trample it together.”

""The campaign will be complemented by socioeconomic measures aimed at addressing genuine concerns of the people and creating an environment that discourages extremist tendencies,"" said a statement from Sharif's office.

Ihsanullah Tipu, a security analyst, noted, ""Pakistan views the use of active military force as the most effective approach to counter armed violence.""

Some analysts suggest that the operation's timing may also be influenced by domestic political and economic considerations. Asfandyar Mir of the US Institute of Peace said, ""With the election done and a government in place, and the economic situation stabilizing, Pakistani leadership probably feels confident to pursue a vigorous campaign.""

What is the main objective of

Operation Azm-e-Istehkam

?

The primary objective of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam is to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan. This includes addressing domestic security threats and dealing with armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan. The operation also aims to implement socioeconomic measures to create an environment that discourages extremist tendencies.

Why now?

The timing of the operation is linked to a dramatic increase in violent incidents over the last 18 months. Most of these attacks have been claimed by the TTP , which ended a ceasefire in November 2022.

, which ended a ceasefire in November 2022. Additionally, recent attacks targeting Chinese interests in Pakistan have further underscored the urgency of a robust military response.

Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023. Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have increased, highlighting the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ).

). Senior Chinese officials have also emphasized the need for improved security for Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan.

How will the operation be different from previous military campaigns?

Unlike previous large-scale military operations that required mass displacement of local populations, Azm-e-Istehkam is not intended to be a kinetic large-scale military campaign. The focus will be on augmenting the efforts of armed forces with intelligence-based operations and legal measures to address terrorism-related cases. The operation is described as a “multi-domain, multi-agency, whole of the system national vision” for enduring stability.

What are the potential challenges to the success of this operation?

Security analysts highlight several challenges, including the transient nature of TTP bases in Pakistan and the risk of escalating tensions with Afghanistan if cross-border operations are conducted. Additionally, the lack of public support for security forces in provinces heavily affected by violence could hinder the operation’s effectiveness. There is also the issue of diverging approaches between Pakistan and China regarding the Taliban in Afghanistan, a report in AlJazeera said.

What has been the reaction of opposition parties to this operation?

Opposition parties, including the PTI, JUI-F, and ANP, have expressed significant criticism of the operation. They argue that it could worsen the volatile situation in border regions and have questioned the government's decision-making process, claiming it lacked sufficient consultation with parliament and local stakeholders.

How has China reacted to recent attacks targeting its nationals and investments in Pakistan?

China has expressed strong concerns over the security of its nationals and investments in Pakistan, urging the Pakistani government to take effective measures to protect them. Following attacks on Chinese engineers and installations, Chinese officials have reiterated the importance of security and the need to protect Chinese interests in the country.

Will the operation affect Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan?

The operation could strain already tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly if cross-border military actions are taken. The Taliban government in Kabul has consistently denied harboring TTP militants, and any escalation of military activities could complicate diplomatic relations further.

Since 2001, Pakistan's military has conducted many high-profile operations like ""Zarb-e-Azb"", ""Rah-e-Nijat"", ""Rah-e-Rast"" and many more against homegrown militants in border areas. It seems it's time for another military operation against militants in Pakistan. But the Pakistan military has failed to root out these militant groups time and again.However, under pressure from China, the Pakistan government has again approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability.""

Pak government's borrowings exceed two previous fiscal years combined,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-governments-borrowings-exceed-two-previous-fiscal-years-combined/articleshow/111251833.cms,"KARACHI: In a fiscal year marred by unprecedented borrowing and soaring debt servicing costs, the Pakistani government faces substantial financial challenges as it navigates through economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, Dawn reported.""The government's borrowings in the first 11 months of the outgoing fiscal year have exceeded the combined figure of the two preceding fiscal years,"" revealed economic data, emphasising the magnitude of financial commitments.This hefty borrowing, amounting to PKR 7.39 trillion from July 2023 to June 7, 2024, surpasses the government's collective borrowings of PKR 7.16 trillion in the previous two fiscal years (FY23 and FY22).Bankers speculate that total borrowings for FY24 could reach PKR 8 trillion by June 30, driven by high spending necessitated by slashed development budgets in favour of meeting other expenses.The impact of this extensive borrowing is profound, constraining the government's ability to allocate funds towards critical development projects. Instead, a significant portion of tax revenues is earmarked for debt servicing, a trend expected to escalate in the upcoming fiscal year, as reported by Dawn.""The government would spend PKR 7.21 trillion on domestic debt servicing and an additional PKR 1.04 trillion on foreign debt servicing, taking the total to PKR 8.25 trillion,"" according to the budget document for FY2023-24. This figure is set to rise further in FY25, with allocations totalling PKR 9.77 trillion for debt servicing alone.Amid projections of increased revenue generation, economic experts remain skeptical about achieving ambitious tax collection targets. ""Economy experts believe that the government will not achieve the PKR 12.97 trillion tax collection target set for FY25,"" citing concerns over past targets being missed, including the PKR 9.41 trillion target for FY24.Critically, the high interest rates, recently reduced but still hovering around 20.5 per cent, have polarized opinions within the business community. ""The business community also finds this rate high and is demanding that it be brought down close to the inflation rate,"" as inflation levels stood at 11.8 per cent in May, prompting calls for interest rates to be lowered to 13-14 per cent.""This excessive borrowing practically makes it impossible for the government to spend money on development projects,"" lamented a banker, highlighting the imbalance between public sector investments and private sector participation, Dawn reported.","Pakistani government faces substantial financial challenges as it navigates through economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures.
