"If elected, JD Vance to be first vice president with beard in nearly 100 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/if-elected-jd-vance-to-be-first-vice-president-with-beard-in-nearly-100-years/articleshow/111769523.cms,"JD Vance , the Republican senator from Ohio, has been chosen by former President Donald Trump as his running mate for the upcoming presidential election . If elected, Vance would become the first vice president in nearly a century to sport facial hair , the New York Post reported.The last vice president with a mustache was Charles Curtis in 1933, while the last one with a beard as substantial as Vance's was Charles Fairbanks, who served under Teddy Roosevelt from 1905 to 1909.Vance, 39, is the first millennial to be part of a major-party ticket and has become one of Trump's most fervent supporters, particularly in the areas of trade, foreign policy, and immigration. He gained national attention with the publication of his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" in 2016 and was elected to the Senate in 2022.Despite rumors that Vance's beard could have cost him the vice presidential nomination, Trump dismissed the speculation, telling Fox News Radio host Brian Kilmeade that the beard was fashionable on his running mate.""He looks good,"" Trump said. ""Looks like a young Abraham Lincoln.""Research suggests that voters associate facial hair with personality traits that politicians typically want to avoid, such as aggressiveness, traditionalism, and anti-feminism.A 2015 survey by Oklahoma State University found that voters perceive men with beards and mustaches as being opposed to reproductive choice and ""more supportive of gun rights, military spending, and the deployment of force"" – characteristics that align with Vance's political stance.","JD Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio, has been chosen by former President Donald Trump as his running mate.

"Protesters rally peacefully at GOP convention for abortion and immigrant rights, end to war in Gaza",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/protesters-rally-peacefully-at-gop-convention-for-abortion-and-immigrant-rights-end-to-war-in-gaza/articleshow/111768699.cms,"MILWAUKEE: Hundreds of demonstrators converged Monday on downtown Milwaukee to protest around the Republican National Convention , following through on their long-standing plans to rally outside the site despite the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.The protests were peaceful, as organizers had promised they would be.A wide range of organizations and activists gathered in a downtown park outside the Fiserv Forum's security perimeter to listen to speakers ahead of a street march coordinated by The Coalition to March on the RNC .The coalition, comprised largely of local groups, supports abortion and immigrant rights and is pressing to end the war in Gaza .The atmosphere was festive, with music playing over loud speakers, a man strumming a guitar and vendors selling T-shirts and buttons supporting both Republicans and Democrats. One protester wore an orange prison jumpsuit with a giant Trump cutout for a face. Activists carried signs that read, ""Stand with Palestine,"" ""We Can No Longer Afford the Rich,"" and ""Defend and Expand Immigrant Rights.""At one point a group of demonstrators got in an argument with counter-protesters who denounced LGBTQ+ rights, Muslims, Black Lives Matter and women.Counter-protester Rich Penkoski of Stillwater, Oklahoma, bellowed through a bullhorn that women should go home and make sandwiches for their husbands. The demonstrators eventually walked away from the counter-protesters as police looked on.At noon, the demonstrators set off on the march around the arena's security perimeter in temperatures approaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), chanting ""Hey-hey, ho-ho, Republicans have got to go"" and ""This is what democracy looks like."" Many carried Palestinian flags.Marchers passed within a block of Fiserv Forum on the edge of the arena's security zone before returning to the downtown park where they began. The Milwaukee Police Department estimated the crowd at between 700 and 800 people and said no one was arrested. However, an Associated Press reporter saw a man in handcuffs being held by police outside the park after the march ended. An officer told him he was being arrested for disorderly conduct, though it wasn't immediately clear what led to the arrest or if the man was part of the protest.Milwaukee police did not respond to messages Monday night asking for arrest totals.The Philadelphia-based group Poor People's Army, which advocates for economic justice, marched later Monday.Perennial Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein addressed the group, calling for less military spending and larger investments in public education, social housing and health care. She didn't mention the assassination attempt.Cheri Honkala, 60, said she traveled to Milwaukee from one of the poorest districts in Pennsylvania to ""send a strong message to all politicians"" that people living below the poverty line ""are not surviving.""Honkala said she was nervous after the attempted assassination of Trump about potential encounters with law enforcement officers and counter protesters while she marches with the Poor People's Army. But she said she wasn't deterred.""The climate is definitely a scary one,"" she said, ""but you know what's scarier? Not saying anything.""Honkala was at the front of the march near the arena when officers asked her to move to the sidewalk. She refused and stayed in the road as more officers arrived and again asked her to move.At one point she turned to the group and said, ""I'm just a little woman. I'm just a little woman. I'm not going to hurt anyone."" Officers handcuffed her and led her away.By Monday night, the streets of downtown Milwaukee were largely quiet.At one of the convention's main entrances, a sole anti-Trump protester stood holding a sign, telling those entering the arena to ""enjoy the clown show.""Anthony Marlow, a retired sanitation worker, said he had spent the day protesting the convention, arguing at times with Trump supporters.""I want them to know they are not welcome in this great city,"" he said. Referencing Trump's reported denigration of Milwaukee weeks earlier, Marlow said Trump doesn't appreciate Milwaukee.The attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday night in Pennsylvania prompted widespread calls to improve security and raised questions about Trump's safety in Milwaukee - he arrived in the city on Sunday - as well as that of other convention-goers.US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said Monday that the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies have ""reviewed and strengthened"" the convention security plan and they will continuously adapt their operations as needed. She added that the Secret Service also has made changes to Trump's security detail. She didn't elaborate.A heavy police presence in the city was assured, with officers from multiple jurisdictions providing security. Pentagon officials said 1,700 National Guard troops, mostly from Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota, were on active duty at the convention as well. Milwaukee officials and federal authorities have repeatedly said their priority is safety and insist they've made free speech accommodations.Many activists are using the experience in Milwaukee to prepare for the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. That event is expected to draw even more people, and Chicago police have been undergoing training on constitutional policing and preparing for the possibility of mass arrests.","The protests were peaceful, as organizers had promised they would be.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she is ""taking measures"" after a slew of corruption scandals -- including one involving her former household servant who now travels by helicopter after amassing a staggering $34 million fortune.Recent accusations dominating Bangladesh's normally pliant media have involved a former army chief, an ex-police chief, senior tax officers and state recruitment officials.""Corruption is a longstanding problem,"" Hasina told reporters late Sunday. ""These messes must be cleaned up... we have been taking measures.""She said that included action against her household assistant -- a ""peon"" or low-level orderly -- who Bangladeshi media reported had previously been a water-bearer, in case she needed a drink at events.""The man who worked as a peon in my house -- he now owns 400,00,00,000 Taka ($34 million),"" Hasina said.""He can't move without a helicopter.

I took action immediately after knowing this.""It would take an average Bangladeshi more than 13,000 years to earn that amount.The average GDP per capita in the nation of around 170 million people is $2,529, according to the World Bank .Hasina did not identify the servant, but several newspapers named him as Jahangir Alam, nicknamed ""Pani"" or ""water"" , due to his old job.The Dhaka Tribune daily reported the orderly had used his position in Hasina's office to engage in ""lobbying, tender manipulation and bribery"".The fat-cat servant report spread rapidly on social media -- with opposition parties seizing on it to accuse Hasina's administration of endemic corruption.""If Sheikh Hasina's peon could make such an astronomical amount of money, you can guess how much his boss has made,"" said A.K.M. Wahiduzzaman, a spokesman for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main opposition party.""The most shocking thing is he has not been prosecuted for his crime,"" he added.""He was just removed from his post"".Hasina, 76, won her fourth consecutive general election in January, in a vote without genuine opposition parties, with a widespread boycott and a major crackdown against her political opponents.But since May, a series of high-profile corruption scandals have put the spotlight on her more than 15-year-long rule.The anti-corruption commission launched a probe into former national police chief Benazir Ahmed -- once viewed as a close Hasina ally -- accused of stashing an illegal multi-million dollar fortune. He rejects the allegations.Washington imposed sanctions against Ahmed in 2021, for his alleged role in hundreds of disappearances and extrajudicial killings when he led the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.Top local newspapers have also laid out graft allegations against the former army chief of the capital Dhaka, Aziz Ahmed. He denies the claims.The anti-corruption commission has ordered the seizure of properties and frozen the bank accounts of several top tax officials for allegedly syphoning off tens of millions of dollars.Last week, police busted a gang of civil servants selling recruitment papers before job tests, reportedly illegally generating millions of dollars.","Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she is ""taking measures"" after a slew of corruption scandals.

Online commentators labelled the video as ""cringe"". Whereas, the ""corporate"" used it to satirise the forced ""fun activities"" that often occur at work events.As the video gained popularity, some commentators suggested that it represented the decline of Gen Z, implying that they had succumbed to the same cringe-worthy behaviour they had previously mocked millennials for. Millennials have often been the target of Gen Z's ridicule, portrayed as overly sincere and obsessed with pop culture phenomena like Harry Potter, Taylor Swift, and The Office.Moreover, the negative reaction to the video took a misogynistic turn as it spread to the ""manosphere,"" an online space where toxic masculinity and the categorisation of men into ""alphas,"" ""betas,"" and ""sigmas"" are prevalent.

Second Amendment

Biden to the rescue?

A deeply polarising figure in US politics, Donald Trump came close to being killed on Sunday when a bullet fired from a semi-automatic rifle grazed his right ear at a rally in Pennsylvania. The world is perhaps focused more on what impact it will have on the outcome of the impending presidential polls, but the shooting has again foregrounded the vexed issue of gun violence in America , where more than 32% of the people apparently own a firearm.In the same Pennsylvania state where the assassination attempt took place, the Republican presidential candidate earlier this year vowed to roll back — on the first day of assuming office — all restrictions imposed by the Biden administration on gun rights.“Every single Biden attack on gun owners and manufacturers will be terminated my very first week back in office, perhaps my first day,’’ said Trump. Not surprisingly, he was addressing an event organised by the National Rifle Association (NRA), the most ardent backer of an individual’s right to keep and bear firearms . In his previous term, Trump appointed conservative judges in Supreme Court, at the behest of the NRA, to bolster this right.Despite acknowledging the need to check mass shootings — there were over 600 such cases in 2023 alone — the US has not been able to seriously consider passing legislation to ban assault weapons. The political polarisation over the issue precludes the US from reaching a national gun policy that could restrict misuse of firearms.According to a Pew Research Centre report last year, Republicans and Democrats remain sharply divided over the impact of gun ownership on public safety. While 79% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said gun ownership increases safety, a nearly identical share of Democrats (78%) said it decreases safety.US gun policy, or the lack of it, dates back to the US Constitution Second Amendment which was ratified in 1791 and owes its origin, apparently, among other things, to the English practice of raising a militia to fight foreign invasion. The amendment simply states, “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed”, and leaves the rest to interpretation. More than 200 years later, in a landmark ruling in 2008, US Supreme Court sought to settle the debate as it held that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and to bear arms, including for self-defence at home, even when there is no relationship to a local militia.After America got its independence and its Constitution was taking shape, there were fears of a tyrannical federal govt riding roughshod over ordinary citizens. One of the Founding Fathers, James Madison, sought to allay those apprehensions as he said such a government “would be opposed by a militia amounting to nearly half a million of citizens with arms in their hands”.The amendment does not specifically mention self-defence. With powerful backers like the Republicans and NRA, the argument that the Second Amendment might be outdated at a time the US has the most powerful national defence system in the world — and public safety and crime prevention must outweigh an individual’s right to self-defence — has found little traction. While some states like California do have stricter regulations, according to NRA, if a person can legally purchase and own a gun, the Second Amendment guarantees his or her right to keep and bear arms regardless of city or state.The US President’s son was himself convicted last month for illegally purchasing a gun but that hasn’t prevented Biden from touting his gun control measures during his election campaign. The Biden administration recently announced new rules to reduce the number of firearms sold without background checks as part of its strategy to stem the flow of illegally acquired firearms and hold to account those who supply firearms used in crime. The president has also called for banning assault weapons. The Republicans have mostly described it as misguided and unconstitutional.According to White House, the loopholes in America’s background check laws have enabled domestic abusers, school shooters, violent criminals, and gun traffickers to illegally acquire firearms. A growing number of unlicensed sellers continue to sell firearms for profit to complete strangers they meet at gun shows and online marketplaces, which has been a critical gap in the background check laws.In 2022, Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that broadens the category of gun sellers required to become licensed dealers and run background checks. While the US has about 80,000 licensed gun sellers, it also has over 20,000 unlicensed ones who sell mostly through online advertisements. The final rule announced this year makes it clear when a person needs to become a licensed dealer and run background checks. It also gives the Department of Justice additional tools to crack down on individuals illegally selling guns without such checks, says White House.With the new rules, according to Biden, the US is moving as close as possible to universal background checks without additional legislation. Given the opposition from the Republicans, and a deeply divided country on what is a worrisome but emotive issue, any effort for a Congress approval to a ban on assault weapons remains out of the question for now.","US gun policy, or the lack of it, dates back to the US Constitution Second Amendment which was ratified in 1791. The amendment simply states, “A well- regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed” and leaves the rest to interpretation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111768458,imgsize-1109020,width-400,resizemode-4/111768458.jpg"

The book's success introduced Vance to the Trump family, leading to a friendship with Donald Trump Jr.In 2016, Vance was a ""never Trump"" Republican, calling Trump ""dangerous"" and ""unfit."" He also criticised Trump's racist rhetoric, calling Trump 'America's Hitler'. By 2021, Vance reversed his stance, praising Trump's accomplishments and downplaying his past criticism.Vance now echoes Trump's rhetoric about Jan. 6 and the 2020 election, saying he wouldn't have certified the results immediately and that Trump had “a very legitimate grievance.”In the Senate, Vance works with both parties. He co-sponsored a railway safety bill with Sen. Sherrod Brown and supported Great Lakes restoration and legislation for workers and families.In 2022, Vance was elected to the US Senate, filling the seat vacated by Republican Rob Portman. Trump's endorsement was pivotal in Vance’s victory.

In a discussion with NBC News anchor Lester Holt on Monday, Biden tackled the matter directly, saying that his mental acuity is ""pretty damn good.""During the interview, Biden acknowledged his age, saying, ""I'm old.But I'm only three years older than Trump, number one. And number two, my mental acuity has been pretty damn good.""He highlighted his accomplishments during his presidency, expressing his willingness to be evaluated based on his record.Biden's resolve to remain in the race persists, even as some Democratic lawmakers question his ability to effectively challenge Trump following his performance in the June 27 debate. He stressed that Democratic voters had chosen him during the primary season and that he listens to them.When asked about who he consults on campaign decisions , Biden's answer was simple: ""Me. I've been doing this a long time.""The current state of the race, according to Biden, was always anticipated to be close. A recent NBC news poll supports this, showing Trump with a narrow lead over Biden, although the poll also revealed that a majority of Democrats would prefer a different candidate, and a significant portion of all voters expressed concerns about Biden's mental and physical abilities.In his efforts to demonstrate his competence post-debate, Biden has occasionally stumbled, such as referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""President Putin"" and his vice president, Kamala Harris, as ""Vice President Trump."" However, he maintained that he is fully in command, saying, ""What I'm doing is going out and demonstrating to the American people that I'm in command of all my faculties. I don't need notes. I don't need teleprompters. I can go out and answer any questions at all.""Biden also criticized the media for not subjecting Trump to the same level of scrutiny, pointing out fact-checks that showed Trump making multiple incorrect statements during the debate. He challenged the press, asking, ""Why doesn't the press ever talk about this?"" and questioned why they weren't discussing the lies Trump told during the debate, even as Biden acknowledged having a bad night himself.","US President Joe Biden has stood by his choice to continue his presidential campaign.

The couple met at Yale University, married in 2014, and live in Cincinnati with three kids.“After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator JD Vance of the Great State of Ohio,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network.Trump’s shortlist included Florida senator Marco Rubio, North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, Arkansas senator Tom Cotton and South Carolina senator Tim Scott. Indian-Americans Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy were both considered long-shot outliers.Surviving the assassination bid and the halo of heroism that came with it appeared to have changed the dynamics involved in Trump’s selection. Rather than weigh race, gender, ethnicity and other factors, Trump seems to have sought someone in his own likeness in terms of policy and succession.Vance is the author of “Hillbilly Elegy”, a best-selling 2016 memoir about growing up in an unstable family in hollowed out middle America amid poverty, job loss, economic insecurity and social rot. His wife Usha is from a totally different social eco-system. Her father is a mechanical engineer and mother a biologist, who made it good in San Diego, California.Each candidate on Trump’s shortlist had detractors within the party. Vance himself is reported to have called Trump “America’s Hitler”, a “cynical a*****e”, “a total fraud,” and “a moral disaster” at one point. But like many Republicans who sought relevance in the Trump era, Vance eventually shifted his tone. He said he was proved wrong by Trump’s performance in office and evolved into one of his most steadfast defenders. “I didn’t think he was going to be a good prez,” Vance recently told Fox News Channel. “He was a great president.”Also such things are easily forgotten and forgiven in US politics, and anyone chosen by Trump will have the party’s backing — particularly after the weekend tumult that has enhanced the cult of personality in the Grand Old Party.Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 and has become one of the staunchest champions of “Make America Great Again” agenda. But he is largely untested in national politics and himself faced criticism in the wake of the shooting for an X post that suggested President Biden was to blame for the violence.Trump’s pick also means that two white men will now lead the Republican ticket at a time when Trump has sought to make inroads with Black and Latino voters.","Vance is the author of ‘Hillbilly Elegy’, a best-selling 2016 memoir about growing up in an unstable family in hollowed out middle America.

Although Kennedy's chances of winning the presidency or even Electoral College votes are slim, his campaign events have attracted significant crowds interested in his message.In a statement, Kennedy expressed his gratitude to President Biden for providing him with Secret Service protection and also thanked his private security firm, Gavin de Becker & Associates, ""for keeping me safe for the past 15 months of my presidential campaign,"" according to a report from AP.Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security Secretary, confirmed that Biden had ordered protection for Kennedy both before and after the recent events.While the Secret Service is obligated to protect major party presidential and vice presidential candidates and their families 120 days before a general election, third-party candidates are considered on a case-by-case basis. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged in its 2024 budget overview that requests for candidate protection are being made earlier than in previous years.Political candidates often face threats, but law enforcement officials have noted an increase in violent rhetoric following the attack at the Trump rally over the weekend.

He was not seriously injured in the shooting in Pennsylvania over the weekend, which is currently under independent review.Mayorkas said that Trump's protection has been enhanced based on the ""evolving nature of the threats to the former president"" and his transition from presumptive nominee to nominee.","US President Joe Biden has instructed the US Secret Service to safeguard independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr. Kennedy's chances of winning the presidency are slim, but his campaign events have attracted significant crowds.

Vance's path to the senate

From never-Trumper to fierce ally

Prominent figure in the conservative movement

Vance seen as key asset for Trump campaign

Former US President Donald Trump selected senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, opting for a former critic who has since become a dedicated supporter. Vance, the first millennial to be part of a major-party ticket, joins at a time when there are significant worries about the advanced age of America's political leaders.Trump announced his decision on his Truth Social network, saying, ""After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator JD Vance of the Great State of Ohio,"" as the Republican National Convention commenced in Milwaukee.Vance, 39, gained national recognition with the release of his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" in 2016. He was elected to the Senate in 2022 and has emerged as one of the most ardent supporters of the former president's ""Make America Great Again"" agenda, especially in the areas of trade, foreign policy, and immigration.JD Vance, a native of Middletown, Ohio, has had a diverse career path. After serving in the Marines and completing a tour of duty in Iraq, he pursued higher education, obtaining degrees from Ohio State University and Yale Law School. Vance also gained experience in the business world, working as a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.Vance rose to prominence with the publication of his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" in 2016, coinciding with Donald Trump's initial presidential campaign. The book's success established Vance as an insightful commentator on the factors contributing to Trump's appeal among working-class, rural white voters in middle America, a demographic that played a significant role in Trump's electoral victory.""Hillbilly Elegy"" not only brought Vance into the public eye but also connected him with the Trump family. Donald Trump Jr, an admirer of the book, was already familiar with Vance when he embarked on his political career. The two developed a friendship that has endured over time.Following Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election, JD Vance returned to Ohio, his home state, and established an anti-opioid charity. Vance also began delivering speeches at various events, including Republican Lincoln Day dinners, where his personal narrative resonated with audiences.These speaking engagements provided Vance with a platform to share his ideas for improving the nation, and they helped pave the way for his entry into the political arena in 2021, according to a report from Reuters. When Republican senator Rob Portman announced his retirement, Vance seized the opportunity to run for the vacant Senate seat.With the endorsement of former President Trump, Vance emerged victorious from a highly competitive Republican primary. He then went on to win the general election, securing his position as a US senator from Ohio.Vance, a Republican who initially opposed Donald Trump's candidacy in 2016, had a change of heart by 2021. Despite previously labeling Trump as ""dangerous"" and ""unfit"" for office, Vance later praised the former president's achievements during his tenure.Vance, married to Indian-American lawyer Usha Chilukuri Vance, with whom he shares three children, had also denounced Trump's racist language, even suggesting he could be ""America's Hitler."" However, when the two met in 2021, they both minimised Vance's earlier critical remarks.Upon his election to office, Vance emerged as a staunch supporter of Trump on Capitol Hill, consistently defending the former president's actions and policies without hesitation.Kevin Roberts, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, praised JD Vance as a prominent figure in the conservative movement, particularly regarding his stances on non-interventionist foreign policy, free market principles, and ""American culture writ large.""However, Democrats label Vance as an extremist due to his controversial positions, which he has occasionally modified. For example, during his Senate campaign, Vance expressed support for a nationwide 15-week abortion ban but later softened his stance after Ohio voters decisively supported a 2023 abortion rights amendment.Regarding the 2020 election, Vance said that if he had been vice president, he would not have immediately certified the results and that Trump had ""a very legitimate grievance.""He has set conditions for accepting the results of the 2024 election that are similar to Trump's, despite numerous government and independent investigations finding no evidence of election fraud that could have altered the outcome of Trump's 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.In the Senate, Vance occasionally embraces bipartisanship. He co-sponsored a railway safety bill with Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown following a fiery train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Additionally, he has sponsored legislation to extend and increase funding for Great Lakes restoration and supported bipartisan initiatives to support workers and families.JD Vance, a potential vice presidential candidate, possesses qualities that could significantly benefit the Republican ticket, according to individuals knowledgeable about the selection process. His strengths include exceptional debating abilities, a talent for raising campaign funds, and the capacity to effectively communicate Trump's agenda.In the opinion of Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, a prominent conservative activist organisation, Vance has the capability to persuasively express the America First perspective. Kirk suggests that Vance's presence on the ticket could aid Trump in securing victory in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, which narrowly eluded him in the 2020 election. These states share similar values, demographics, and economic characteristics with Ohio, making Vance a potentially valuable asset in these crucial battlegrounds.","JD Vance, 39, gained national recognition with the release of his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" in 2016.

He will face Biden again in November.Trump's nomination became official with the vote of Republican National Committee delegates in Milwaukee. He hit the threshold with votes from Florida, announced by his son Eric, according to AP report. The convention hall erupted in cheers as state after state voiced support for Trump.Trump's campaign, aiming to expand his appeal among moderates and people of color, designed an optimistic convention. However, the shooting incident targeted at Trump disrupted American politics, redirecting focus from the GOP's agenda and Trump's legal issues to concerns about political violence and national stability.Vivek Ramaswamy , a former GOP primary candidate, shifted his aggressive rhetoric, urging the country to unite. Speaking at an event hosted by the conservative Heritage Institute, Ramaswamy said, “The enemy is not the Democrats, it is an ideology.”Hours before the first convention session, Trump received favorable news when a federal judge dismissed the prosecution in his classified documents case. Trump celebrated the dismissal on his Truth Social platform, calling for the dismissal of his other legal cases as well.“As we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts,” Trump wrote.Republican Party chairman Michael Whatley said that the convention’s programming would not change following the shooting. The agenda will feature over 100 speakers focusing on everyday issues and Trump’s plans to help working Americans.“We have to be able to lay out a vision for where we want to take this country,” Whatley said. He emphasized that the central message would focus on future plans rather than past grievances or promises of retribution.“We are going to have the convention that we have been planning for the last 18 months. We are a combination of relieved and grateful that the president is going to be here and is going to accept the nomination,” he added.Delegates will update the GOP’s policy platform, which has not been revised since 2016. The proposed platform, just 16 pages long, avoids giving Democrats ammunition on key issues, including abortion. It doesn’t call for a national abortion ban, despite the Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.“More divisiveness would not be healthy,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.The convention’s speaking program will include Republicans charged with crimes related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, jailed for contempt of Congress, is expected to speak after his release. Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald , also facing criminal charges related to the 2020 election, will present Trump with the party nomination.Democrats have scaled back counterprogramming during the Republican convention. The Biden campaign pulled down its ads, and Vice President Kamala Harris postponed a Florida appearance focused on Trump’s opposition to abortion rights. The pro-Democratic group American Bridge delayed releasing trading cards highlighting controversial Republican positions.The convention is taking place in Democratic-leaning Milwaukee, a key swing state where Trump lost narrowly four years ago. Security is heightened, with the Secret Service allowing open or concealed carry of guns per state law outside the secure perimeter.",Former US President and Republican Donald Trump became the official nominee for the presidential race.

The announcement was made on Trump's Truth Social media platform at the beginning of the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the party's presidential ticket will be nominated.In his statement on Truth Social, Trump said, ""After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator JD Vance of the Great State of Ohio.""James David Vance, the author of the bestselling memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" is deeply popular among Trump's base, and his selection could increase the likelihood of Trump supporters turning out to vote on November 5.However, as a staunch conservative from a Republican state, Vance may not attract many new voters to Trump's camp and could even alienate some moderates. Some Trump supporters had advocated for the selection of a woman or person of colour as his running mate to expand a coalition that is predominantly composed of white men, according to a report from Reuters.Vance, 39, will bring a younger perspective to the election, which features Trump, 78, and President Joe Biden, 81. This choice provides a counterbalance to the Democratic ticket, which includes Vice President Kamala Harris, 59. In choosing Vance, Trump passed over other potential candidates, such as US Senators Marco Rubio and Tim Scott, as well as North Dakota governor Doug Burgum.Vance's rise to prominence has been unconventional in American politics. Following a difficult and impoverished upbringing in southern Ohio, he served in the Marine Corps, earned a scholarship to Yale Law School, and later worked as a venture capitalist in San Francisco.His book ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" published in 2016, explored the socioeconomic challenges faced by his hometown and the cycle of poverty that had trapped Americans in the Appalachian Mountains, where his mother and her family originated. The book criticised what Vance perceived as a self-destructive culture in rural America and aimed to explain Trump's popularity among impoverished white Americans, according to a report from Reuters.Despite his initial harsh criticism of Trump before and after the 2016 election, Vance transformed into one of the former president's most consistent defenders as he prepared to run for the US Senate in Ohio in 2022. He has downplayed the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and echoed Trump's criticisms of the Justice Department's prosecution of January 6 rioters.Vance has also been a vocal opponent of continued aid to Ukraine in the Senate, a position that differs from many Republican legislative leaders.As a former venture capitalist, Vance has served as a link between Trump associates and wealthy Silicon Valley donors, many of whom have contributed to Trump's campaign this election. However, some Trump associates have privately questioned the wisdom of removing Vance from the Senate, given the close contest between Democrats and Republicans for control of the upper chamber.","Former US President Donald Trump on Monday announced his selection of JD Vance as his running mate for the upcoming presidential election.

""We believe Article 17 of the Constitution gives the govt the right to ban political parties.""Tarar said that besides Imran and Alvi, the govt had decided to slap a treason case on ex-deputy speaker Qasim Suri under Article 6 for dissolving the assemblies in April 2022 despite a no-confidence motion moved against the then government in parliament.“The reference, under Article 6, will be sent to the apex court after being approved by the cabinet,"" he said.Article 6 states, ""Any person who abrogates or subverts or suspends, or holds in abeyance or attempts or conspires to abrogate or subvert or suspend the Constitution by use of force, or show force or by any other unconstitutional means shall be guilty of high treason.""The minister said the Sharif govt would also submit a review petition in the apex court, challenging its verdict on reserved seats.Lawyer-politician Moiz Jaferii said a political party couldn't be banned other than through a reference to the apex court.

The former first couple was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) soon after a district and sessions court on Saturday quashed their conviction in their un-Islamic marriage case.The court's short order also stated to release Khan and Bibi immediately unless they were wanted in other cases.The NAB, which filed a new Toshakhana case against the couple, on Sunday presented them before Judge Muhammad Ali Warraich of the accountability court.The judge conducted the hearing inside the Adiala Jail due to security reasons.NAB Deputy Director Mohsin Haroon, who led the team to arrest them, requested their physical remand and the court, after hearing the lawyers, agreed to grant an eight-day remand.The court then ordered to present the two on July 22.The remand period can be extended to a maximum of 40 days at the request of NAB if it is needed to probe the suspects.Khan, objecting to the absence of media, said at the beginning of the hearing: ""If the media is not allowed, I will walk out of the court.""The court subsequently ordered media representatives to be brought inside the jail, and the hearing commenced once they arrived.Khan, 71, then addressed the judge directly, asserting that his wife had no involvement in the Toshakhana case, The Express Tribune reported.""I have read the Quran four times in jail, and it places a great responsibility on judges,"" he stated. ""Bushra Bibi is only imprisoned to cause me distress.""Bibi, 49, was also re-arrested on Saturday in the new NAB reference as she was to be released from Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail.He accused higher authorities of targeting his wife due to his decisions and said: ""My wife is being targeted by the King because I removed him from the ISI position, and my wife did not support him.""He referred to the army chief Gen. Asim Munir without naming him.""Jail me, but leave my wife alone. Judge, you are answerable to Allah, not the ISI. Judge Bashir said a decision was made at gunpoint,"" Khan pleaded.""A former prime minister being told in the middle of the night that he has to appear for a brand new case in the morning,"" he remarked wryly.He harshly criticised the accountability watchdog and alleged that it was operating like robots, doing whatever they are paid to do.He added, ""In the previous case, the jewellery set, which was valued at Rs 18 million, was claimed to be worth Rs 3.25 billion.""""I am only speaking about my wife. Re-arresting her [Bushra Bibi] was a grave mistake,"" the cricketer-turned-politician said.The new Toshakhana case is based on the accusation that the couple during Khan's government purchased gifts from the state depository in violation of rules.This is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.Last week, the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the National Assembly and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.",Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi handed over to anti-corruption officials.

Tough road ahead for Imran Khan despite back-to-back judicial relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tough-road-ahead-for-imran-khan-despite-back-to-back-judicial-relief/articleshow/111729030.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Despite back-to-back judicial relief to beleaguered Imran Khan , his woes are far from over and Pakistan 's former prime minister remains in jail with his wife Bushra Bibi. A district and session court on Saturday overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case related to the violation of the mandatory waiting period for a Muslim woman between two marriages.The relief came a day after the Supreme Court in a key judgment declared that his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) party was eligible for the seats reserved for women and minorities in the national and four provincial assemblies.The PTI will become the largest party in the National Assembly with 109 seats after the Supreme Court ruling.Two successive victories for Khan were being interpreted as some kind of change of heart on the part of the powerful establishment towards the PTI and its founder, but the subsequent developments belie any such possibility.The court in the Iddat case verdict stated that Khan and his wife should be released ""if not required to be detained in any other case"" and anticipating his release a large number of PTI supporters accompanied by key leaders reached the Adiala Jail Rawalpindi, where they have been kept, to welcome them.But the PTI feared counter-measures by the government and announced that Khan would be arrested in three cases related to May 9 violence. However, it emerged that he and his wife were taken into custody by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB ) in a fresh Toshakhana corruption case .Khan and his wife during his government allegedly obtained gifts from the gift repository at low prices and sold them at higher rates.It is the third Toshakhana case and Khan's sentence in the two previous Toshakhana cases had been suspended by the Islamabad High Court.The new case alleged that the couple got some precious watches and other gifts from the state depository by violating rules.Khan faces a slew of cases launched against him since his ouster from power in April 2022 after he fell out with the establishment which was believed to be instrumental in bringing him to power.Despite dozens of cases against him and several party leaders, he has kept up his rhetoric by attacking the senior Army leadership , and his supporters churning out half-baked stories against the establishment on social media.The Army this month after a key meeting termed the attack on social media as ""digital terrorism"", calling it ""unwarranted criticism by some quarters"".Army commanders stated that the onslaught of politically motivated digital terrorism, unleashed by conspirators, duly abetted by their foreign cohorts against state institutions is meant to induce despondency in the nation and sow discord through the peddling of blatant lies, fake news and propaganda.The forum affirmed that military leadership is cognizant of the full spectrum of the challenges and resolved to shoulder its constitutionally mandated responsibilities with the support of the resilient people of Pakistan.Khan on his side uses the presence of media on the occasion of hearing cases against him in the Adiala Jail to fire salvos at rivals, showing unflinching resolve to fight. He also reiterates not to spare his tormentors.His own X handle is active, apparently operated by someone on his behalf, charging his opponents from the Army and civilians with an unwavering commitment. The same attitude has been displayed by his party leaders who often compete with each other to breathe more fire than others.All this had added to his hardships despite getting relief from the courts regularly.In the latest arrest, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) is expected to produce Khan and his wife before an accountability judge to seek their physical remand. Under the law, NAB can detain a person for 40 days on remand for investigation.As courts operate within rules, it is not easy for his legal team to secure his release.The circuitous legal battle is getting more entangled due to the official opposition to his release from jail.Recently, political advisor to Prime Minister, Rana Sanaullah, reportedly stated that new cases would be lodged against Khan in the coming days. Talking to the reporters in Lahore on June 15, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stated that Khan's detention for the next five years was necessary to bring economic stability.""People come to us and tell us if Pakistan has to progress then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,"" he said.","A district and session court overturned the conviction of 71-year-old Khan and his wife Bushra, 49, in the un-Islamic marriage case.

This was the last case keeping Khan in prison but he will not walk free as the authorities immediately issued fresh orders for his arrest in three other cases.In a short order, additional sessions judge Afzal Majoka directed authorities to immediately release Khan and his wife if they are not wanted in any other case.After the decision Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said, “Mr Khan has been arrested in three more cases.” The three cases are linked to violence against the military and other state installations after his brief arrest in May 2023.“An anti-terrorism court in Lahore approved the request to arrest Imran Khan in the May 9 case,” the PTI statement read. The party warned that keeping Khan, 71, in jail after Saturday’s decision would lead to another political crisis.Just days before national polls on Feb 8 the couple were sentenced to seven years in jail in the “iddat” case after the court found them guilty of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the required interval between Bibi’s divorce from her previous husband and her marriage to Khan. The verdict had coincided with his convictions and sentences in the Toshakhana (state treasure store) and cipher cases. His sentences in two alleged graft cases, however, were suspended, while his sentence in the cipher case, linked to leaking of state secrets, was overturned. Various courts have also freed him in several other cases linked to the events of May 9, 2023 when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.Ahead of Khan’s acquittal in a fake marriage case , a pair of applications was filed by Khawar Fareed Maneka, Bushra’s previous husband. One application asked the court to carry out a medical checkup of his ex-wife to ascertain her menstrual cycle while the other called on religious scholars for consultation on further deliberation on the duration of “iddat”.Before ordering Khan and his wife’s release, judge Majoka dismissed both applications. “Both petitions seeking the formation of a medical board and consultations with religious scholars are hereby rejected,” the verdict stated.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023.

This case was the only one keeping the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party founder behind bars since August last year.On February 3, just days before the general elections on February 8, an Islamabad court had convicted the couple based on a complaint filed by Bushra Bibi's ex-husband, Khawar Fareed Maneka.Maneka alleged that they had contracted marriage during Bushra Bibi's Iddat period, a mandatory waiting period in Islam that lasts four months after a woman's divorce or the death of her husband.The couple challenged the sentence in a district and session court in Islamabad, where Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Afzal Majoka heard the case. Judge Majoka announced the judgment in the afternoon after reserving the verdict earlier in the day, acquitting Khan, 71, and Bushra, 49.""If they are not wanted in any other case, then PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi should be released [from jail] immediately,"" the judge said after accepting their appeals.

He sought to have the marriage declared null and void.Khan and Bibi married in 2018, the same year Khan won the general elections and became prime minister. Bibi, who was ostensibly Khan's spiritual guide, divorced her husband of 28 years, with whom she had five children, and developed a romantic relationship with Khan. She is Khan's third wife; during his cricketing career, Khan had a reputation as a playboy.PTI chief Gohar Khan welcomed the verdict, calling it a victory for the independent judiciary. ""All these cases were fake, and he will also get justice in all other cases,"" he said, demanding Imran Khan's immediate release as this was the last case in which he was convicted.This judgment follows a major legal victory for Khan's PTI party.

As a result, over 600,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan since the order was issued last year. Human rights organizations have cautioned that some of those sent back to Afghanistan may face persecution by the Taliban , who took power in 2021 and have implemented strict Islamic laws, denying girls access to higher education and excluding women and girls from many areas of public life.Malala, who grew up in Pakistan's Swat valley and had to relocate to the UK after being shot at the age of 15 for resisting the Pakistan Taliban's ban on girls' education, emphasized the importance of protecting girls and women, given the bleak future they face in Afghanistan. She expressed hope that Pakistan would reverse its policy, stating, ""I hope that Pakistan reverses its policy and that they protect girls and women especially because of the dark future that they would be witnessing in Afghanistan"".On her birthday, recognized by the UN as Malala Day, the activist addressed the challenges faced by Afghan girls, who have been banned from education for over three years. While finding the situation shocking, she admired the resilience of Afghan activists. The Malala Fund is advocating for the UN to formally expand its definition of crimes against humanity to include ""gender apartheid,"" a term used by the UN to describe the situation in Afghanistan.Malala criticised the recent talks between the UN and the Taliban in Doha, which took place without the presence of women. She called for a ""principled engagement"" with the Taliban and urged world leaders to realize that excluding women and girls from such discussions is doing the Taliban a favor.She specifically called out countries with feminist foreign policies, such as Canada and France, to condemn such conversations.Furthermore, Malala called for an urgent ceasefire in the ongoing war in Gaza, expressing concern over the bombing of schools in the region. She emphasized the importance of providing humanitarian support to innocent civilians and praised countries that have resumed funding for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, despite Israeli accusations of its workers being involved in Hamas's attack against Israel on October 7.","Malala Yousafzai has expressed deep concern over Pakistan's decision to deport undocumented Afghan refugees.

After the polls, they had joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party to claim a share of reserved seats as independents were not eligible for the extra seats. The electoral body, however, ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim the reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats.”The commission had decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) and the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) becoming major beneficiaries with 16 and five additional seats in the National Assembly.Friday’s verdict, however, nullified the Peshawar high court’s order wherein it had upheld the election regulator’s decision denying the reserved seats to the SIC. The top court also declared the ECP’s ruling to be ultra vires to the constitution, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.“It is declared that lack of denial of an election symbol does not in any way affect the right of a political party to participate in an election,” the court order said, adding that PTI was and is a political party.It further stated that the elected members of PTI could not be declared independents or candidates of the SIC and gave the PTI 15 days to submit its list of candidates entitled for reserved seats to the election commission.ECP, the order said, should then publish the list of reserved seats of the candidates on its website within seven days.“The seats allocated to the PTI after this stage will be considered as their seats. Once the PTI gets its seats in parliament, it will be eligible for the reserved seats,” said the ruling.PTI spokesman Raoof Hassan lauded the SC for “breaking the barriers of intimidation”. “This is only the beginning of a long haul till we reach the final destination when Imran Khan shall take over as the Pakistan PM,” he said.The governing coalition still has well over 200 members of the 336-member lower house of parliament but the judgment has effectively denied a two-third majority to them that they were hoping for. Khan’s party strength stood at 84 in the National Assembly before the decision and is expected to rise to over 100.Under Pakistan’s election rules, parties are allocated 70 reserved seats – 60 for women, 10 for non-Muslims – in proportion to the number of seats they win. This completes the National Assembly’s total strength of 336 seats.",The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday declared his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party eligible for allocation of seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.

However, the election commission had stated that independents were not eligible for the allocation of 70 reserved seats , which were intended solely for political parties.The SC placed the present petitions before the three-judge committee that determines the constitution of the bench for the reconstitution of a larger bench when attorney general Mansoor Usman Awan highlighted that under Section 4 of the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, the present case should be heard by a larger bench since the issue concerns the interpretation of constitutional provisions, Dawn reported.A day ago, the court had reserved its decision on the matter after closing the hearing on a set of appe­als moved by the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).The SIC had filed a petition demanding that 77 seats for women and minorities, which were originally allotted to PM Shehbaz’s ruling coalition after the February 8 general elections, be reallocated to the alliance. However, in March, the Peshawar high court (PHC) and the election commission rejected the council’s appeal in separate rulings, declaring it ineligible for the reserved seats, as per the Dawn.Although the allocation of 23 reserved seats does not impact PM Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government's parliamentary majority, it does strengthen the political position of Khan's supporters. They have been claiming that the election commission and a pro-military caretaker government that supervised the polls engaged in electoral fraud to prevent them from winning. Both the commission and the military refute these allegations, but concerns have been raised in the West regarding the transparency of the elections.",Pakistan's Supreme Court on Friday said that former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) is eligible for seats reserved for women and minorities.

He said the tax is expected to increase flour prices by PakistRupees (PKR) 8 per kg.Raza said that he would continue the strike until the demands are met and the strike would adversely affect the supply chain.""The tax measure is unacceptable and impracticable as flour dealers are refusing to lift their consignments instead of sharing their tax details for withholding tax purposes,"" he said.Raza said that the imposition of a PKR 600 tax on a bag of flour worth PKR 11,000 is inappropriate. He refuted the Punjab Food Minister Bilal Yasin's claim and said that the strike had not been postponed until Ashura (July 17).He added, ""Neither the government nor the FBR has contacted us for talks or to reconsider the strike.""Iftikhar Ahmed Mattoo, chairman of PFMA's Punjab chapter, said, ""We don't wish to trouble the public during Muharram, which is why the industry continued to supply flour to the market until July 10 despite bearing a tax burden of millions of rupees.""Mattoo said that now it was not feasible for them to bear the burden of tax.

Pakistan's begging business collects $42 billion annually: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-begging-business-collects-42-billion-annually-report/articleshow/111667723.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's economy is in a precarious state, prompting the government to seek financial assistance from other nations and international organizations. This has led to the term 'begging' becoming a significant part of the country's political discourse, with citizens lamenting the need to constantly seek foreign aid .Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged this issue two years ago, stating, ""Today, when we go to any friendly country or make a phone call, they think that we have come to beg for money.""While the government seeks financial help, begging has become an organized industry within Pakistan, with beggars operating in cities and towns and even being exported to other countries.The government has recently decided to block the passports of more than 2,000 beggars for seven years and also restrict the activities of agents who facilitate this overseas begging business . Pakistani beggars primarily operate in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq.A parliamentary probe revealed that a significant number of beggars arrested in foreign countries were of Pakistani origin, with many exploiting pilgrim visas to travel to holy sites. The Interior Ministry has offloaded 44,000 individuals in the past two and a half years, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called for increased screening before issuing passports.Within Pakistan, begging is a highly organized and competitive business, with an estimated 38 million beggars in the country. The average daily amount collected by beggars varies across cities, with Karachi having the highest at Rs 2,000. Annually, beggars extract $42 billion, which is more than 12% of Pakistan's GDP. Turf wars between beggars for lucrative spots are common, with some even resorting to violence.The government has struggled to abolish beggary, and police action against beggars has often been met with resistance. In 2011, hundreds of beggars clashed with police officials in Faisalabad, throwing stones and bricks at the police station. One beggar remarked, ""Since when has begging become a crime in Pakistan? We will stop begging the moment our government stops begging from the IMF and other foreign countries.""","Pakistan's economy is in a precarious state, prompting the government to seek financial assistance from other nations and international organizations.

NEW DELHI: More than 100 students were injured on Monday in Bangladesh during a protest over the quota system in government jobs The protest marks first major demonstration against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since her fourth consecutive term victory in January's opposition-boycotted election.Universities nationwide, including in Dhaka, witnessed violent clashes between anti-quota protesters and members of Hasina's Awami League student wing.According to police and eyewitnesses, the altercations took place between two groups of students: those who opposed the quota system and those who supported the governing party's stance on the matter.Rocks were thrown, and sticks and iron rods were used as weapons, resulting in injuries on multiple campuses, according to police and eyewitnesses.The protests, which began earlier this month following a High Court order to restore 30% job quotas for descendants of freedom fighters, have persisted despite the top court's one-month suspension of the order last week.Hasina's refusal to meet the students' demands, citing the ongoing court proceedings, further escalated the protests on Sunday night. Her comments, labelling those opposing the job quotas as 'Razakar' collaborators with the Pakistani army during the 1971 War of Independence, prompted thousands of students to leave their dormitories at Dhaka University at midnight in protest.Protesters have called for continued marches and rallies nationwide to push for their demands. Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the anti-quota protests , stated, ""This is more than just a student movement. To suppress this movement, incitement from the highest levels of government has been made. So, common people have to come to the streets.""Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud accused attempts to transform the anti-quota movement into an anti-state one by exploiting young students' emotions. He emphasized that the government will not tolerate the development of an unstable situation.",More than 100 students were injured on Monday in Bangladesh during a protest over the quota system in government jobs.

The two countries share numerous rivers that flow from the Himalayas into the Bay of Bengal.An agreement on sharing the river’s water was reached in 2011 but could not be sealed after West Bengal, through which the river flows before it enters Bangladesh, objected to the deal.As India has dithered over resolving the issue, China stepped in with its proposal. New Delhi responded earlier this year with its own offer amid security concerns about Chinese engineers working close to its borders.“China has made an offer to us, they did a feasibility study. India has also made an offer, and will do a feasibility study,” Hasina said added, “But I would give greater priority to this being done by India because India has held up the Teesta’s waters.”",China and India both want to execute the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration.
