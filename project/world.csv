'We need to protect people': Zelenskyy fires air force commander after deadly F-16 crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/we-need-to-protect-people-zelenskyy-fires-air-force-commander-after-deadly-f-16-crash/articleshow/112938571.cms,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed, Lt General Mykola Oleshchuk , the commander of country's air force, four days after an F-16 warplane provided by western allies crashed during a Russian bombardment, killing the pilot.The firing took place as a dispute emerged involving a Ukrainian lawmaker's claims about the incident. The United States experts are aiding in the investigation of the crash, which marked the first reported loss of an F-16 in Ukraine.The dismissal order for Lt General Mykola Oleshchuk was published on the presidential website.Zelenskyy immediately addressed the country, stressing the need to protect personnel and strengthen the army at the command level. Shortly after, Lt General Anatolii Kryvonozhko was appointed as the acting air force commander by the Ukrainian army’s general staff.""We need to protect people. Protect personnel. Take care of all our soldiers,"" said Zelenskyy in his address following the publication of the order.The dismissal coincided with intense criticism directed at a deputy head of the Ukrainian parliament's defense committee, lawmaker Mariana Bezuhla, who claimed the F-16 was downed by a patriot air-defense system during its operation.Bezuhla’s claim, based on unnamed sources, demanded accountability for what she described as an error.In response, Oleshchuk accused Bezuhla of defaming the air force and discrediting US arms manufacturers. He expressed his hopes that she would face legal consequences for her claims.""The truth will win,"" Bezuhla posted on X shortly after the dismissal order was made public.Oleshchuk did not deny the possibility that the F-16 was hit by a Patriot missile. The air force confirmed that US experts have joined the Ukrainian investigation into the crash.While internal disputes unfolded, a Russian attack using powerful plane-launched glide bombs struck the northeastern city of Kharkiv, resulting in six fatalities, including a 14-year-old girl on a playground, and 47 injuries.Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that the bombs hit five locations across the city, which previously had a population of 1.4 million people. One of the bombs blasted a 12-story apartment block, trapping at least one person on an upper floor and raising fears of a structural collapse as emergency crews searched for survivors.In retaliation, Ukrainian rockets struck the Russian city of Belgorod and its surroundings late on Friday, killing five and injuring 37, according to Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. The region, which borders northern Ukraine, experiences frequent drone and artillery attacks.Zelenskyy cited the Kharkiv strikes as further evidence in urging Western partners to lift restrictions on what the Ukrainian military can target with donated weapons.The Kharkiv strike ""wouldn't have happened if our defense forces had the capability to destroy Russian military aviation at its bases. We need strong decisions from our partners to stop this terror,"" Zelenskyy said.F-16 warplanes, which Ukraine began receiving from European countries at the end of the previous month, are among the weapons that could be used to target Russian bases behind front lines. However, analysing the crash is ongoing, as announced by Oleshchuk on Telegram prior to his dismissal.""We must carefully understand what happened, what the circumstances are, and whose responsibility it is,"" Oleshchuk wrote shortly before his dismissal.The crash represented the first reported loss of an F-16 in Ukraine’s conflict, where at least six such jets are now believed to have been delivered. Military experts have voiced that the introduction of F-16s might not be a game-changer in the war against Russia, given Moscow's substantial air force and sophisticated air-defense systems.However, Ukrainian officials valued the addition of the supersonic jets, which are equipped with modern weapons, as an opportunity to challenge Russia's air superiority.On the battlefield, Russian forces continue their gradual advance into eastern Ukraine, while Ukrainian troops are holding positions in the Kursk border region of western Russia following a recent incursion.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, predicted losses of Western-provided military equipment for Ukraine during combat but emphasised the major impact of any F-16 losses on Ukraine's air defense capabilities.In further developments, European Union defense ministers agreed to enhance their training program for Ukrainian troops. The target was raised to 75,000 with an additional 15,000 recruits expected by the year’s end, confirmed EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.The announcement was made after a ministers' meeting in Brussels.""Today the ministers agreed to raising the target to 75,000, adding 15,000 more by the end of the year,"" Borrell told reporters post-meeting.""The training has to be shortened and adapted to the Ukrainian training needs,"" Borrell added. He noted that the EU would establish a small ""coordination and liaison cell"" in Kyiv to enhance the effectiveness of the training program.To date, 60,000 troops have completed the bloc's training scheme, which is conducted outside Ukraine.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed, Lt General Mykola Oleshchuk.

"Is US ready to accept the 2024 election outcome? Most Americans say yes, but poll shows Trump’s supporters have doubts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-us-ready-to-accept-the-2024-election-outcome-most-americans-say-yes-but-poll-shows-trumps-supporters-have-doubts/articleshow/112939073.cms,"Poll findings

Confidence in election integrity

Partisan and ideological divides

Methodology

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, a significant majority of Americans express readiness to accept the election results, though divisions persist, particularly regarding former President Donald Trump.According to the poll conducted by ABC News/Ipsos from August 23-27, 81% of Americans say they are prepared to accept the election results regardless of the outcome.In comparison, 68% believe Kamala Harris will accept the results, while only 29% feel the same about Trump.Support for accepting the election results varies significantly by political affiliation. Nearly all of Harris' supporters (92%) are ready to accept the outcome, contrasted with 76% of Trump's supporters. Additionally, 21% of Trump's backers—translating to about 8% of all adults — are unwilling to accept the election results.Confidence in the accuracy of the election count is also split. One-third of Americans (34%) express doubts about whether votes will be counted accurately, a figure unchanged since 2022. About 65% are confident in the vote count, with only 32% being very confident.This skepticism extends to beliefs about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. Thirty-four percent of Americans think Joe Biden did not win legitimately, a figure consistent since his inauguration. Views on election integrity and acceptance of the2024 results are closely linked. Among those confident in vote accuracy, 92% are prepared to accept this year's results, compared to 61% of those who lack confidence in the count.Partisan differences are evident in the survey. While 90% of Democrats express confidence in the vote count and 96% believe Biden was legitimately elected, only 48% of Republicans share this confidence, with just 30% acknowledging Biden's legitimacy. Independents are somewhat in the middle, with 64% confident in the vote count and 66% believing Biden's win was legitimate.Ideology also plays a role. Eighty percent or more of liberals, moderates, and somewhat conservatives are prepared to accept the election results. However, only 64% of very conservatives feel the same. Confidence in vote accuracy is lowest among very conservatives (38%) and highest among liberals (89%).The poll, conducted online, surveyed 2,496 adults. The sample reflects partisan divisions of 29% Democrats, 29% Republicans, and 30% independents, with a margin of error of 2 percentage points.This survey underscores the polarized nature of American politics as the 2024 election approaches, highlighting varying levels of acceptance and confidence across the political spectrum.","Support for accepting the election results varies significantly by political affiliation.

"Massive blackout strikes Venezuela's capital, Maduro govt cries 'sabotage'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/massive-blackout-strikes-venezuelas-capital-maduro-govt-cries-sabotage/articleshow/112938562.cms,"Venezuela's capital Caracas and much of the rest of the country were plunged into a blackout on Friday and the government blamed it on sabotage by the opposition,President Nicolás Maduro held his political rivals responsible and said there were ""attacks"" on the power grid, accusations the opposition has always denied.The blackout was the result of an attack on the Guri Reservoir, Venezuela's largest hydroelectric project, Maduro said, without providing any evidence on state television on Friday evening., according to Reuters news agency.""I won't say more because it is being investigated,"" Maduro said, adding that a rapid investigation was taking place.Recalling the 2019's blackout, with some lasting as long as three days, Maduro said, ""We are normalizing, regularizing, step-by-step... We are better prepared and in better conditions than in 2019.""The government called the power outage ""electrical sabotage"" and said that nobody can take away the peace of the Venezulan people.“Nobody will take away our peace and tranquility of the Venezuelan people,” Freddy Nanez, the communications minister, wrote in a message shared with journalists on Telegram, as per AP news agency.He further explained that all 24 Venezuelan states had been at least partially affected by the outage, characterizing it as a ""desperate"" attempt by Maduro's opponents to forcefully remove him from power.By evening, power had been restored in many areas of the capital following a day of intermittent outages. Maduro, appearing on state TV, expressed gratitude to Venezuelans for their patience after a tumultuous day that saw businesses close, hospitals rely on backup power, and the closure of Caracas' subway system, leaving thousands stranded.Despite the disruption, residents of the capital remained resilient. Traffic during the typically busy rush hour was lighter than usual, and some people reported difficulties communicating with family members due to a lack of cellphone service. Alejandra Martinez, a 25-year-old salesclerk, noticed the power outage when a fan stopped working but initially thought it would be short-lived. However, upon waking up, she realized it was a more extensive outage, reported AP news agency.Venezuela's power grid is heavily dependent on the Guri Dam, a massive hydroelectric power station that was inaugurated in the late 1960s. The electrical system has been strained by poor maintenance, a lack of alternative energy sources, and a loss of engineering talent as an estimated 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country's economic hardships in recent years.","Venezuela's capital Caracas and much of the rest of the country were plunged into a blackout on Friday and the government blamed it on sabotage by the opposition.

Explosive Trump biopic to hit US theaters before election: Reports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explosive-trump-biopic-to-hit-us-theaters-before-election-reports/articleshow/112938820.cms,"LOS ANGELES: A controversial biopic of Donald Trump that depicts the former president raping his wife and which has drawn legal threats from his attorneys will hit US theaters this October, it was reported Friday.Tiny indie studio Briarcliff Entertainment plans to release "" The Apprentice "" for US audiences less than a month before Trump takes on Kamala Harris in the country's razor-tight presidential election, the Hollywood Reporter said.Representatives for Briarcliff did not immediately respond to AFP queries.The explosive film about Trump's younger years caused shockwaves at the Cannes Film Festival in May.Its most talked about scene shows Trump raping his first wife, Ivana, after she belittles him for growing fat and bald.In real life, Ivana accused Trump of raping her during divorce proceedings but later rescinded the allegation. She died in 2022.The movie also shows Trump suffering erectile dysfunction, and undergoing liposuction and surgery for hair loss.Just hours after ""The Apprentice"" premiered in May, Trump's lawyers vowed to sue the producers, calling the film ""garbage"" and ""pure malicious defamation.""Further complicating the film's prospects for US release is that one of its early financial backers was pro-Trump billionaire Dan Snyder, who was reportedly displeased with its depiction of Trump and sought to block the movie.He has now been bought out of his financial stake in the movie, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The film is set to be released in US theaters October 11, the Los Angeles Times said.Sebastian Stan's lead performance as young New York property tycoon Trump received largely positive reviews at Cannes.The film's screenplay was written by Gabriel Sherman, a journalist who covered real estate for the New York Observer and regularly spoke to Trump.Far from a simple hatchet job, the film depicts Trump as an ambitious but naive social climber desperately trying to navigate the cutthroat world of Manhattan property deals and politics.The Times of London argued it would ""make you feel sympathy for Trump.""But Trump's decency is gradually eroded as he learns the dark arts of dealmaking and power from his mentor Roy Cohn, played by ""Succession"" star Jeremy Strong.Film director Ali Abbasi told AFP he included the rape scene to show how Trump distanced himself from ""human relationships that define him and that hold him in check as a human being.""Stan, best known from the Marvel superhero movies, added that Trump's early behavior ""is much more relatable than we want to admit.""Briarcliff Entertainment launched in the late 2010s. Its founder Tom Ortenberg previously helped steer Oscar campaigns for best picture winners ""Spotlight"" and ""Crash.""He is expected to promote ""The Apprentice"" in Hollywood's upcoming award season.The news comes on the same day ""Reagan,"" another biopic of a former Republican president, Ronald Reagan, hits US theaters.","Briarcliff Entertainment plans to release ""The Apprentice "" for US audiences.

Among the victims, three are in life-threatening condition, one is seriously injured, and the fifth has minor wounds.The recent violence echoes a stabbing attack in Solingen, where a 26-year-old Syrian man, who was pending deportation to Bulgaria, carried out a deadly assault.This incident sparked significant debate over Germany's immigration policies.In response to the rising violence, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government has introduced new regulations, including restrictions on carrying knives in public and on long-distance transport. Additional measures include limiting benefits for some illegal migrants.Earlier this week, police also fatally shot a man suspected of attacking pedestrians with knives in Moers, a town near Solingen.","A 32-year-old woman was arrested after stabbing five people on a bus in Siegen, western Germany, on Friday.

She’s a defective person, and we don’t need another defective person as President of the United States.""Trump’s appearance at the annual Moms for Liberty event was a strategic move to galvanize support among his base. The group, known for its efforts to remove mentions of LGBTQ+ identity and structural racism from K-12 curricula, has been a significant force in conservative circles. The majority of its 130,000-plus members support Trump's stance on education and oppose racial equity programs and transgender accommodations in schools.However, Trump risks alienating moderate voters who view Moms for Liberty's activism as too extreme. The group's influence, once seen as a potential asset for the Republican ticket, has recently faced scrutiny due to scandals and lackluster local results.Moms for Liberty has also been linked to Project 2025, a controversial blueprint for a conservative presidency that Trump has distanced himself from. Despite this, the group remains active, with notable successes in recent Florida primaries and endorsements of several first-time candidates.At the conference, Trump did not reveal specifics about his speech but highlighted his education proposals, including promoting school choice and opposing transgender athletes in girls' sports. He also criticized the Biden administration's approach to public education.The event, marked by a lively atmosphere and Trump’s characteristic style, included his usual rhetoric on illegal immigration and manufacturing. Amidst the festivities, Trump continued to criticize Harris and Democratic policies, using the occasion to reinforce his campaign themes.As Trump addressed the crowd, he underscored his stance on issues like fossil fuel production, leveraging Pennsylvania’s significance to bolster his arguments. Despite the festive mood, the event was also marked by an incident involving a man who breached the media area before being subdued by law enforcement.","Former President Donald Trump spoke at the Moms for Liberty conference on Friday.

Ever wondered why so many Roman statues are headless? An archaeological perspective,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ever-wondered-why-so-many-roman-statues-are-headless-an-archaeological-perspective/articleshow/112916610.cms,"Unravelling headless statues mystery: Archaeological insights

Natural weak points and accidental damage

Deliberate destruction: Damnatio Memoriae

Modern-day decapitations: Art market exploitation

When exploring classical art museums, it’s common to encounter Roman statues with missing heads, shattered noses, and severed limbs, ever wondered why? Unlike the usually complete displays of modern art, ancient Roman statues often exhibit significant damage, particularly to their heads.To understand why so many Roman statues are headless , experts like Rachel Kousser, a classics and art history professor at Brooklyn College, employ a method akin to ""archaeological CSI."" This involves analysing the context and breaks in the sculptures, looking for patterns, and comparing them to other known cases to piece together the history behind the damage.One of the primary reasons for headless statues is the inherent vulnerability of the neck. It is a natural weak spot on statues, making it prone to breakage during falls, transport, or handling over time. This kind of damage is often accidental and results from the statue being moved or handled improperly.Not all headless statues are the result of accidents. Sometimes, the destruction was deliberate. In ancient Rome, a process known as ""damnatio memoriae"" was used to erase the memory of disgraced emperors. This involved removing or defacing their images from public view. For instance, many portraits of the notorious emperor Nero were intentionally damaged or altered.Roman sculptors sometimes designed statues with removable heads. Kenneth Lapatin, antiquities curator at the J. Paul Getty Museum, explains that this design allowed for different sculptors to work on various parts of the statue or to replace the head if needed. Statues with removable heads often feature a smooth edge where the neck joins, rather than a jagged break.In rare cases, statue heads have been removed in modern times. As Roman sculptures became valuable on the antiquities market, unscrupulous dealers realised they could profit more by selling a headless body and a separate head. One notable example is the Statue of a Draped Woman, which was missing its head when acquired by the Getty Museum in 1972. Archival photographs revealed that the head had been separated from the body sometime before the museum’s acquisition.The process of reuniting a headless statue with its head can be complex. Despite the challenges posed by sloppy cutting and drilling, conservators have successfully restored some statues to their original form. The restoration of the Statue of a Draped Woman is a rare example of a successful reunion between a statue and its head, highlighting the ongoing efforts to preserve and understand these ancient artefacts.","Ancient Roman statues often exhibit significant damage, particularly to their heads.

He was eventually detained by the airport security and handed over to the cops.While the flier who could not fly had his reasons to throw a fit, social media users asked whether he just happened to have walked into the airport with a hammer in his suitcase.

Chavez was granted $50,000 bond and allowed to remain free pending further proceedings. The doctor faces a single felony count of conspiracy to illegally distribute ketamine.Chavez, who has previously signed an agreement to enter a guilty plea , did not enter a plea during the brief hearing.Defense attorney Matt Binninger confirmed that Chavez intends to formally plead guilty at a later date, which will be scheduled in the coming weeks.In addition to the bond, Chavez was required to surrender his passport and agreed to relinquish his medical license. Binninger addressed the media outside the courthouse, stating, “My client is accepting responsibility. He’s doing everything in his power to cooperate, to help in this situation, and he’s incredibly remorseful.”Binninger emphasized that Chavez’s remorse is focused on the tragedy of Perry’s death rather than the actor's celebrity status. “The regret stems from the fact that someone who was trying to seek treatment died,” Binninger said.Chavez's case is part of a broader investigation involving multiple defendants. Dr. Salvador Plasencia, another physician charged in the case, has pleaded not guilty. Jasveen Sangha, an alleged ketamine supplier known as the ""ketamine queen,"" and other individuals connected to the distribution of the drug have also been charged. Kenneth Iwamasa, Perry's personal assistant, and the alleged middleman involved in obtaining the drug have both pleaded guilty.Authorities have revealed that Plasencia purchased ketamine from Chavez and discussed the pricing with him in text messages, one of which derogatorily referred to Perry: “I wonder how much this moron will pay.”Perry, 54, died in October 2023 from “acute effects” of ketamine, which led to him losing consciousness and drowning in his hot tub, according to the December 2023 autopsy report. The actor had long struggled with substance abuse issues, including during his time on the iconic 1990s sitcom ""Friends.""","Chavez was granted $50,000 bond and allowed to remain free pending further proceedings.

Who is Durek Verrett

?

Norway princess Martha Louise is getting married to her partner, Durek Verrett , a self-styled shaman from US, very popular in Hollywood. The festivities have begun in Norway as on Friday, the guests are travelling by sea to Geiranger. The couple who has been in news for the royal family's grave disapproval over the relationship will tie the knot on Saturday at a private event.Martha, the 52-year-old princess who was once married with an artist announced her engagement with 49-year-old Verrett in 2022.The princess – the eldest of Norwegian King Harald’s two children – was previously married to the late writer and artist Ari Behn, with whom she had three daughters - Maud, Leah and Emma. The two divorced in 2017. Behn, who had discussed suffering from depression, died on Christmas Day 2019. King Harald, 88, is one of Europe's longest-serving monarchs.Martha claims to be a clairvoyant and she has invited a lot of criticism for that. She lost her honorific ""Her Royal Highness"" title in 2002 to start her own business. She ran a school in which she taught students to create miracles and talk to angels.Verrett claims to be a a sixth generation shaman, “servant of god and energy activator” who “demystifies spirituality” through his “no-nonsense teachings”. He claimed to have risen from the dead. He said when he was a child, a relative predicted that he would marry the princess of Norway.He has a huge following in Hollywood including Gwyneth Paltrow, Antonio Banderas.The African-American shaman in his book 'Sprit Hacking' wrote that cancer is a choice. He has also recommended exercises to remove ""imprints"" from women's vaginas left by previous sexual partners.Verrett is a businessman and the announcement of the engagement ran into troubled waters as now Verrett will also become a member of the royal family. The royal family, however, decided that Verrett will not hold any title. Their business activity will not have anything to do with the royal family. The couple has now been working with Netflix for a documentary on their relationship.","Martha Louise, 52, and Durek Verrett, 49, will tie the knot on Saturday.

Kamala Harris: How Kamala Harris defended her policy shifts on fracking in CNN interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-kamala-harris-defended-her-policy-shifts-on-fracking-in-cnn-interview/articleshow/112931758.cms,"When questioned about her shift from liberal to more moderate policy positions, Harris emphasized that her core values have remained consistent, citing her commitment to addressing climate change as an example. In response to questions about her reversal on banning fracking — a method used to extract gas and oil from shale rock — Harris expressed confidence that U.S.climate goals could still be met without enforcing such a ban.Republicans have largely criticized Harris by portraying her as an extremist, often pointing to her 2019 statements to support their claims. At that time, she advocated for closing immigration detention centres and decriminalizing illegal border crossings. Her stance on border issues has since become more stringent, emphasizing her experience ""prosecuting transnational, criminal organizations"" during her time as California's attorney general.Earlier this year, Harris supported a bipartisan border security bill that allocated hundreds of millions of dollars for additional wall construction. Trump urged Republicans in Congress to oppose the bill, a move Harris described in a CNN interview as a cynical political tactic.For weeks, Republicans have criticized Harris for her changes in stance, labeling her a flip-flopper and warning that she is a ""dangerously liberal"" contender for the White House.Trump — who has also changed his stance on various issues this year, including abortion and the TikTok ban — mocked Harris for her policy shifts at a rally on Thursday. “She probably goes back to her room and gets sick to her stomach when she says what she says,” the former president told supporters in Michigan. “She’s a Marxist, she’s a fascist, and she never believed. Now she’s saying, ‘Oh, we want to build a strong border.’ Where has she been for 3 1/2 years?”The American public is ready to ""turn the page"" on Donald Trump Kamala Harris has stated, claiming that her Republican rival is promoting an agenda that ""divides"" the country and ""diminishes the character"" of its people. In her first major television interview of her presidential campaign , the 59-year-old US Vice President, who will face Trump in the 5th November elections, said that Americans are prepared for a ""new way forward"".""I think sadly in the last decade, we have had in the former president someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans — really dividing our nation,"" Harris said in a joint interview with her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, on CNN.""And I think people are ready to turn the page on that,"" Harris, the Democratic Party 's candidate, added.""The American people are ready for a new way forward. Our former president has pushed an agenda that diminishes the character and strength of who we are as Americans, and divides our nation. People are ready to turn the page,"" she reiterated in a post on X, linking to an interview snippet.Harris, who is of Indian and African heritage, also refused to engage in Trump's identity politics during the interview.She sidestepped questions regarding Trump's claims about her racial identity, describing them as part of the ""same old tired playbook.""Last month, Trump questioned Harris' racial identity at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago, implying that she had previously identified as South Asian but ""happened to turn Black"" for political reasons.Her decision not to comment aligns with her campaign's strategy to avoid focusing on identity politics following Trump's remarks, CNN reported.When asked about a previous debate on the decriminalisation of US borders, she responded, ""I believe there should be consequence. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally.

The Republican vice-presidential nominee attempted to pre-emptively mock Kamala Harris ' much-anticipated interview on Thursday night by posting a 2007 video clip of Caitlin Upton , who represented South Carolina in that year's Miss Teen USA pageant.In the clip, Upton is seen badly fumbling a response to a question about Americans' inability to locate their own country on a map. CNN's John Berman challenged Vance over the difficulties that the contestant later faced.""So when you posted this last night, were you aware that the woman you are posting a picture of had contemplated committing suicide for the attention that it received?""

I posted a meme from 20 years ago, and I think the fact that we're talking about that instead of the fact that American families can't afford groceries or healthcare, young families can't afford to buy a home to raise their families, and those are the real crises that we should focus on, and there's nothing that says we can't tell some jokes along the way while we deal with the very serious business of bringing back our public policy.""""Politics has gotten way too lame, John, way too boring,"" Vance added. ""You can have some fun while making a good argument to the American people about how you're going to improve their lives.""Berman wasn't satisfied with his response and asked whether he was prepared to apologise for bringing up that embarrassing moment in such a public way.""I just want to be clear, though – you said you didn't know,"" Berman pressed. ""Would you like to apologise to Caitlin Upton for posting that last night, given what you've now learned?""Trump's running mate declined the opportunity to apologise to Upton, who is now 35.""John, I'm not going to apologise for posting a joke, but I wish the best for Caitlin,"" Vance said.

Credit ratings agency Moody's has upgraded Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to ' Caa2 ' from 'Caa3' citing improving macroeconomic conditions and moderately better government liquidity and external positions.The ratings upgrade reflects Pakistan's decreased default risk after a USD7 billion IMF bailout staff level agreement in July.However, despite doubling since June 2023, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves remain insufficient for its external financing needs, according to the agency.""There is now greater certainty on Pakistan's sources of external financing, following the sovereign's staff-level agreement with the IMF on 12 July 2024 for a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of USD7 billion,"" Moody's said in a statement.The IMF stated that the program's approval depends on Pakistan securing necessary financing assurances from its development and bilateral partners. Moody's said it expects the IMF Board to approve the program within a few weeks.Following the upgrade, Pakistan's international bonds made broad gains. The 2027 maturity was up 0.7 cents to 85.9 cents in the dollar by 1007 GMT - not far off the one month high hit earlier in the day, according to Tradeweb data.Topline Securities CEO, Mohammed Sohail, said the credit upgrade was anticipated following the IMF agreement, and another upgrade within a year is plausible.The announcement comes a day after Pakistan's central bank chief told Reuters in an interview that the country would be looking for about USD4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks.Sohail said Fitch's upgrade in July and Moody's upgrade should ""boost bankers' confidence"".Historically, Pakistan has depended on friendly countries to ""rollover"" debt to avoid a repayment crisis.Although Moody's previous concerns about a potential balance of payments crisis have eased, it warned that risks remain high as Pakistan continues to rely on timely financing from official partners.There is also uncertainty over the government's ability to fully implement IMF-mandated reforms, Moody's said.The coalition government, formed after February elections, may struggle to implement revenue-raising measures without stoking social tensions.Moody's cautioned that any slippages in reform implementation could lead to delays in or withdrawal of financing support from official partners.","Moody's upgrades Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to'Caa2'from 'Caa3' The ratings upgrade reflects Pakistan's decreased default risk after a USD7 billion IMF bailout staff level agreement in July.

Overcoming Challenges

KARACHI: Pakistan aims to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year, the country's central bank chief told Reuters on Tuesday, as the country looks to plug its external financing gap .In a wide-ranging interview, his first with any media organisation since taking office in 2022, State Bank of Pakistan Governor Jameel Ahmad said Pakistan was also in the ""advanced stages"" of securing $2 billion in additional external financing required for International Monetary Fund approval of a $7 billion bailout program.Pakistan and the IMF reached an agreement on the loan program in July, subject to approval from the IMF's executive board and it obtaining ""timely confirmation of necessary financing assurances from Pakistan's development and bilateral partners"".Ahmad said he expected the country's gross financing needs would be smoothly met - both over the next fiscal year and in the medium term.In the past, Pakistan has relied on long-time allies such as China, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates to 'rollover' debt rather than force a repayment crunch. Ahmad said he expected similar assurances would be given for the next three years, giving the government more time to get its finances in order.In addition, Ahmad said the central bank reckoned Pakistan's gross financing needs for the coming years would be lower than the 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product projected by the IMF in its latest country report in May.""Pakistan's external gross financing needs have been declining in the past few years,"" he said.""Since (the IMF's) assessment was based on a higher current account deficit than realized in fiscal 2024 and now projected for the next few years, we assess the ratio of gross financing needs to GDP to be lower than the 5.5 per cent level.""Asked about monetary policy, Ahmad said recent interest rate cuts in Pakistan have had the desired effect, with inflation continuing to slow and the current account remaining under control, despite the cuts.Pakistan's annual consumer price index inflation was 11.1 per cent in July, having fallen from highs of over 30 per cent in 2023.""The Monetary Policy Committee will review all these developments,"" Ahmad said, adding that future rate decisions could not be pre-determined.Pakistan's central bank cut rates for two straight meetings from a historic high of 22 per cent to 19.5 per cent, and will meet again to review monetary policy on September 12.There have been some concerns in markets that the government might take advantage of lower interest rates to borrow more, but the central bank chief said this was not his expectation.""We understand that the government will continue on the path of fiscal consolidation, notwithstanding the reduction in interest rates,"" said Ahmad.Ahmad, who was appointed governor of Pakistan's central bank for a five-year term in August 2022, said his first year had been 'quite difficult'.In 2023, Pakistan faced an acute balance of payments crisis with only enough central bank reserves to cover a month of imports.After eight months of tough negotiations over fiscal discipline, the IMF threw Pakistan a lifeline in the form of a nine-month $3 billion bailout program.""Last year was much better,"" said Ahmad. ""Now everything is under control from an external account management perspective.""Ahmad said the central bank would now focus on growth, digitalisation and financial inclusion.""Those are also equally important for job creation and other socioeconomic issues,"" said Ahmad, noting the bank's mandate was to ensure price and financial stability before shifting its focus to growth.","Pakistan aims to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year.

The perpetrators set fire to at least 10 vehicles before making their escape from the crime scene.In a separate incident, gunmen targeted individuals in the Qalat district, also in Balochistan, resulting in the loss of at least 10 lives. Among the victims were police officers and also civilians who were passing by when the attack occurred.In yet another incident, a rail line between Pakistan and Iran and a railway bridge connecting Quetta to the rest of the country were damaged in recent attacks involving explosives.Police said they had found six bodies that have yet to be identified, near the attack on the railway bridge.""We have confirmed 39 people killed in several coordinated attacks carried out by the BLA terrorists,"" Shahid Rind, a spokesman for the Balochistan provincial government was quoted as saying by AFP.The southwestern province faced more violence as insurgents carried out a series of attacks across different districts.Mohsin Naqvi, the interior minister of Pakistan, strongly condemned the attack, describing it as ""barbaric"" and assured that those responsible would face the full force of the law and not evade justice.The attacks came after separatist group Baluch Liberation Army warned people to stay away from highways, as they launched attacks on security forces in various parts of the province.Baloch seperatist elements in Baluchistan have a history of targeting workers and individuals from the eastern Punjab province, as part of their efforts to pressure them into leaving the region. Balochistan has been grappling with a low-intensity insurgency for many years.The majority of such previous killings have been attributed to the banned Baluchistan Liberation Army and other organizations seeking independence from the central government in Islamabad. Additionally, Islamic militant groups also maintain a presence in the province.In a similar attack in April, 11 labourers were killed when they were abducted from a bus in Naushki city of Balochistan.","At least 39 people killed by militants in Balochistan province of Pakistan.

Dynasties forged in blood

'Politics based on religion'

DHAKA: Two women dominated Bangladeshi politics for decades. One was chased into exile. The other is newly free from custody and too sick to rule, but her heir looks set to take power. Autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina , 76, fled the country by helicopter for neighbouring India this month as huge crowds demanding an end to her rule marched towards her palace.Hours after the student-led uprising sparked the sudden collapse of her government, her lifelong rival and two-time prime minister Khaleda Zia , 79, was released from house arrest for the first time in years. Members of Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) endured crackdowns and mass arrests under Hasina, who pointed to her opposition's cosy relations with Islamists as justification.A caretaker government has run the country since Hasina's ouster, but it has to hold new elections eventually, and now that the BNP has emerged from the underground, its members are confident of their prospects. ""People who supported us from behind for a very long time, they are now coming to the front,"" Mollik Wasi Tami, a leader of the party's student wing, told AFP.Interim leader and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, has said he has no plans to continue in politics after his current role is finished. The students who led Hasina's overthrow have no fondness for Zia either, and it remains unclear whether they would support a future BNP government or seek to form their own party.But whatever they decide, analysts say that when polls are held, the BNP is the force with the cross-country network, the political experience and the drive to win. ""In the next election, whenever it takes place, the BNP has more appeal,"" Bangladeshi politics expert and Illinois State University professor Ali Riaz told AFP.Zia herself is too ill to assume the prime ministership a third time. She has suffered from numerous chronic health complaints since she was jailed in 2018 after a graft conviction widely seen as politically motivated, whatever the charge's true merits. Zia has only appeared in public once since her release, in a pre-recorded video statement to a BNP rally in Dhaka from a hospital bed, during which she appeared sick and frail.""We need love and peace to rebuild our country,"" she told thousands of party faithful at the rally, held two days after Hasina left Bangladesh. Her supporters are planning to take her abroad for urgent medical care, clearing the way for her eldest son and heir apparent, Tarique Rahman , to take the reins.Tarique has led the BNP since his mother's conviction while in exile in London, where he fled to avoid his own set of graft charges, which his party is now working to quash.""When the legal problems are solved, he will come back,"" Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the BNP's secretary-general, told AFP. Tarique's visage already appears alongside that of his mother on the party's banners and campaign materials, including at the rally held two days after Hasina's toppling.The fact that rally happened at all was a remarkable departure from Hasina's rule. The BNP's senior leaders and thousands of activists were jailed late last year ahead of January elections that, absent any genuine political opposition, returned Hasina to power.The decades-old contest between Zia and Hasina is a dynastic battle that predates the political career of both women.Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Zia's husband, Ziaur Rahman , both led the country in the early years after its 1971 liberation war against Pakistan. Both were assassinated.Both women joined forces in protests that ousted a military dictator in 1990 and then contested elections against each other the following year. They have alternated in power ever since, with their parties serving as vehicles for their fierce rivalry.Zia's first administration in 1991 was hailed for liberalising Bangladesh's economy, sparking decades of growth. But her second term from 2001 saw several graft scandals -- some implicating Tarique -- and Islamist attacks, including one that almost killed Hasina.Zia was also accused of steering Muslim-majority Bangladesh, and her nominally big tent, BNP, away from their secular roots by allying with the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami. The partnership gave Hasina cover to persecute both parties by claiming she was fighting extremism—an excuse bolstered by several terror attacks during her time in office.Retired Dhaka University professor Abul Kashem Fazlul Haq told AFP that any collaboration between both forces risked antagonising the avowedly secular students who toppled Hasina. ""They are aware that they will be hurt if they do politics based on religion,"" he said.But Alamgir, the BNP's secretary-general, said the party was open to renewing the alliance if it boosted their chances of forming the next government. ""BNP will definitely look for victory,"" he said. ""If Jamaat helps, then definitely.""","Two-time prime minister Khaleda Zia released from house arrest for the first time in years.

Instead, he was freed, in teak gardens near Chittagong district in southeastern Bangladesh, around 250 km from Dhaka.The 45-year-old was tortured and beaten for weeks by his captors, who questioned him about his opposition to then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, he said.“They kept asking me why I criticise the Awami League government in my social media, they said AL is the government and the government is the state. Therefore no one should criticise the actions of AL or Sheikh Hasina,” Chakma said, as per the Guardian.His captors woke him up in the dark, tiny cell where he was being held and thrown into a car, handcuffed and blindfolded.""I thought they will kill me,"" he said. Instead, he was freed, in teak gardens near Chittagong district in southeastern Bangladesh, around 250 km from Dhaka.Chakma controlled his tears as he shared his ordeal: ""It was difficult to breathe. Initially, they told me that they would release me soon, but as months and years passed, I gave up hope of getting out. Each day felt like 100 days there"".The activist endured mental and physical torture during his captivity in spaces so confined it felt like “a grave”, he said, as reported by the Guardian.Chakma says he had lost all hope of ever seeing his family or daylight again.“My family assumed I was dead and conducted all religious rituals for a funeral in my absence,” Chakma tells the Guardian. “My return is as shocking to me as it is miraculous for them. It truly feels like a resurrection.""“This ‘afterlife’ still unnerves me from time to time. I suffer from nightmares and mental breakdowns, and I’m often terrified by sounds. I can’t sleep; everything seems so scary to me,” he adds.Chakma is among hundreds of people killed or detained during Hasina’s regime, which faced criticism for its increasing authoritarianism. He was among three political prisoners released after the student protests which forced Hasina from power and saw the appointment of an interim government headed by entrepreneur and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.The interim government said this week the commission will ""investigate enforced disappearances that occurred"" since January 1, 2010 ""allegedly involving members of the police"" and arms of the paramilitary, intelligence and military.Asia Deputy Director for Human Rights Watch Meenakshi Ganguly said, ""As a first step, the security forces should release all those that are disappeared, or if they were killed in custody, provide answers to the families"", as per Reuters news agency.","Michael Chakma, a Bangladeshi indigenous people's rights activist who was abducted five years ago in April 2019, was found alive earlier this month.
