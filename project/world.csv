"'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,' China trolls new US tariffs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/what-doesnt-kill-you-makes-you-stronger-china-trolls-new-us-tariffs/articleshow/110161464.cms,"'What doesn't kill you'

BEIJING: China's measured response to the US move to hike tariffs on $18 billion of Chinese goods from syringes to batteries suggests relations between the world's two largest economies face more frost rather than a fresh firefight over trade.China denounced the Biden administration 's action and vowed ""resolute measures"" to protect its interests.But Beijing's response also suggests a new dynamic - and confidence - compared with 2018 when Trump-era tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods touched off an escalating trade war , analysts said.Among the differences between then and now: the Biden White House flagged potential measures to Chinese officials in advance and the tariffs target industries, including EVs and batteries, where the economic impact is limited and Chinese companies' dominance appears unassailable.In response to the tariffs, Chinese state media have shot back, accusing the United States of subverting its own free trade principles and taking action that threatens climate goals and will push up costs for American consumers.In essence, the argument goes, you are hurting yourself.That marks a break from the tone in 2018, when a Chinese negotiator said Washington was putting ""a knife to China's neck"" and state media had suggested extreme counter-measures like a boycott of US food imports or a sell-off of US bonds.""China can take the moral high ground,"" said Wang Huiyao, founder and president of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, a think tank. ""It doesn't play around with those who break international standards and norms.""In the starkest language of its response, the Chinese commerce ministry said the White House had broken the spirit of an agreement to steady bilateral relations reached by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden late last year in San Francisco.Biden has said he wants to win this era of competition with China but not to launch a trade war, and US officials have looked to engage Beijing on limited areas of cooperation, including climate change.China has time to punch back with targeted actions of its own before the tariffs go into effect, analysts said. But a lot has changed since the trade throwdown in 2018.In that year, Chinese automakers built just under 800,000 electric vehicles. By 2023, EV output had jumped by a factor of eight times, China had surpassed Japan as the world's biggest auto exporter and Chinese carmakers were cranking up expansion plans from Southeast Asia to Europe.Huawei, which had been crippled by US sanctions in 2019, has bounced back, spearheading demand for China-made chips and challenging Apple in the China smartphone business and Tesla for EVs.""What does not kill you makes you stronger,"" Xinhua said in a commentary on the US tariffs. ""It seems the famous quote applies to China's technology companies.""Beijing knew this round of tariffs was coming. In recent visits to China, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others had drove home a message that China's industrial capacity to make more EVs, solar panels and batteries than its economy can absorb was a risk to American jobs and business.Chinese officials and state media have rejected that argument, saying the country's EV makers dominate because of innovation and supply chain advantages, not subsidies.The United States imported $427 billion in goods from China last year and exported $148 billion to the world's No 2 economy, a trade gap that has persisted for decades and become an ever more sensitive subject in Washington.Both 2024 presidential candidates are taking a tough line on China ahead of November's election, context Chinese officials understand, analysts said.""Does China really want to go to the mat fighting over these tariffs?"" said Sean Stein, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, who said the announced action was at the ""far low end"" of expectations.""The US rollout was restrained,"" he added.Beijing will also be considering who it would prefer to work with once the election is over.""The thing about this Biden initiative is that it is election driven,"" said Wang. ""It is different to what Trump did, as he had already been president for one year and so was pursuing a trade war, rather than election.""","China's measured response to the US move to hike tariffs on $18 billion of Chinese goods suggests relations face more frost rather than a fresh firefight over trade.

Putin arrives in Beijing seeking greater support for war effort,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/putin-arrives-in-beijing-seeking-greater-support-for-war-effort/articleshow/110160973.cms,"Transactions slow

BEJING: Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in China on Thursday to meet with counterpart Xi Jinping as he seeks greater support from Beijing for his war effort in Ukraine and his isolated economy.This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and the second in just over six months to China, an economic lifeline for Russia after the West hit it with unprecedented sanctions over its military offensive in Ukraine.Putin was greeted by Chinese officials and an honour guard as he got off his plane at around dawn for the two-day state visit, Russian television footage showed.The Russian leader's arrival came hours after he hailed his country's troops for advancing on ""all fronts"" on the battlefield in Ukraine, following a major new ground assault.Xi, who returned last week from a three-nation tour of Europe, has rebuffed Western criticism of his country's ties with Moscow, enjoying cheap Russian energy imports and access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline.It is a relationship the leaders described in 2022 as one of ""no limits"".""This is Putin's first trip after his inauguration, and it is therefore intended to show that Sino-Russian relations are moving up another level,"" independent Russian political analyst Konstantin Kalachev told AFP.""Not to mention the visibly sincere personal friendship between the two leaders.""But as the economic partnership comes under close scrutiny in the West, Chinese banks fearing US sanctions that might cut them off from the global financial system have begun turning the screws on Russian businesses.The Kremlin this week said the two leaders would discuss their ""comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation"" as well as ""define key areas of development of Russian-Chinese cooperation and exchange views on international and regional issues"".Putin, in an interview published in Xinhua ahead of his visit, also hailed Beijing's ""genuine desire"" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met Xi in Beijing last month, warned China's support for Russia's ""brutal war of aggression"" in Ukraine had helped Russia ramp up production of rockets, drones and tanks -- while stopping short of direct arms exports.China claims to be a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict and the foreign ministry in Beijing said the two leaders will exchange views on ""bilateral ties, cooperation in various fields, and international and regional issues of common interest"".China-Russia trade has boomed since the Ukraine invasion and hit $240 billion in 2023, according to Chinese customs figures.But after Washington vowed to go after financial institutions that facilitate Moscow, Chinese exports to Russia dipped during March and April, down from a surge early in the year.An executive order by President Joe Biden in December permits secondary sanctions on foreign banks that deal with Russia's war machine, allowing the US Treasury to cut them out of the dollar-led global financial system.That, coupled with recent efforts to rebuild fractured ties with the United States, may make Beijing reluctant to openly push more cooperation with Russia -- despite what Moscow may want, analysts said.Eight people from both countries involved in cross-border trade told AFP in recent days that several Chinese banks have halted or slowed transactions with Russian clients.According to Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, the banks are ""operating on better-be-safe-than-sorry principles, which reduces the volume of transactions"".""Finding out whether the payments are related to the Russian military-industrial complex... is creating a considerable challenge for Chinese companies and banks,"" he told AFP.Putin's post-election trip to Beijing echoes Xi's own visit to Russia after his re-anointing as leader last year.Experts expect this week's highly symbolic meeting to result in toasts to the ""no limits"" partnership, as well as some deals signed and pledges to increase trade.The two leaders are set to sign a joint declaration following the talks, the Kremlin said, and attend an evening marking 75 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Putin will also meet Premier Li Qiang -- China's number two official -- and travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo.","Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives in China to meet with counterpart Xi Jinping.

Supreme Court orders Louisiana to use congressional map with additional Black district in 2024 vote,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/supreme-court-orders-louisiana-to-use-congressional-map-with-additional-black-district-in-2024-vote/articleshow/110158782.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered Louisiana to hold congressional elections in 2024 using a House map with a second mostly Black district , despite a lower-court ruling that called the map an illegal racial gerrymander.The order allows the use of a map that has majority Black populations in two of the state's six congressional districts, potentially boosting Democrats' chances of gaining control of the closely divided House of Representatives in the 2024 elections.The justices acted on emergency appeals filed by the state's top Republican elected officials and Black voters who said they needed the high court's intervention to avoid confusion as the elections approach. About a third of Louisiana is Black.The Supreme Court's order does not deal with a lower-court ruling that found the map relied too heavily on race. Instead, it only prevents yet another new map from being drawn for this year's elections.The Supreme Court has previously put court decisions handed down near elections on hold, invoking the need to give enough time to voters and elections officials to ensure orderly balloting. ""When an election is close at hand, the rules of the road must be clear and settled,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote two years ago in a similar case from Alabama. The court has never set a firm deadline for how close is too close.Louisiana has had two congressional maps blocked by federal courts in the past two years in a swirl of lawsuits that included a previous intervention by the Supreme Court.The state's Republican-dominated legislature drew a new congressional map in 2022 to account for population shifts reflected in the 2020 Census. But the changes effectively maintained the status quo of five Republican-leaning majority white districts and one Democratic-leaning majority Black district.Noting the size of the state's Black population, civil rights advocates challenged the map in a Baton Rouge-based federal court and won a ruling from US District Judge Shelly Dick that the districts likely discriminated against Black voters.The Supreme Court put Dick's ruling on hold while it took up a similar case from Alabama. The justices allowed both states to use the maps in the 2022 elections even though both had been ruled likely discriminatory by federal judges.The high court eventually affirmed the ruling from Alabama and returned the Louisiana case to federal court, with the expectation that new maps would be in place for the 2024 elections.The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals gave lawmakers in Louisiana a deadline of early 2024 to draw a new map or face the possibility of a court-imposed map.New Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, had defended Louisiana's congressional map as attorney general. Now, though, he urged lawmakers to pass a new map with another majority Black district at a January special session. He backed a map that created a new majority Black district stretching across the state, linking parts of the Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge areas.A different set of plaintiffs, a group of self-described non-African Americans, filed suit in western Louisiana, claiming that the new map also was illegal because it was driven too much by race, in violation of the Constitution. A divided panel of federal judges ruled 2-1 in April in their favor and blocked use of the new map.Landry and a Republican ally, state Attorney General Liz Murrill, argue that the new map should be used, saying it was adopted with political considerations - not race - as a driving factor. They note that it provides politically safe districts for House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, fellow Republicans. Some lawmakers have also noted that the one Republican whose district is greatly altered in the new map, Rep. Garret Graves, supported a GOP opponent of Landry in last fall's governor's race. The change to Graves' district bolsters the argument that politics was the driving factor rather than race, lawmakers have said.Voting patterns show a new mostly Black district would give Democrats the chance to capture another House seat and send a second Black representative to Congress from Louisiana. Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, a former congressman who is Black, had said he will run for Congress in the new district, if it's in place for the next election.",Louisiana has had two congressional maps blocked by federal courts in the past two years in a swirl of lawsuits.

Blinken's song choice raises eyebrows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/blinkens-song-choice-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/110157585.cms,"US secretary of state and amateur musician Antony Blinken may have thought he had the perfect upbeat song to perform with a Kyiv bar band on his fourth visit to the capital since the conflict began in 2022. Strumming a red Fender guitar, Blinken and the local group 19.99 performed Neil Young 's hit ""Rockin' in the Free World"", ostensibly to encourage Ukrainians to keep up the fight against Russia and hold to their Western aspirations.With its refrain ""Keep on rockin' in the free world "", Young's 1989 song sounds like it should be an homage to the glory of living in the West, uncompromised by communism or authoritarianism. In fact, as numerous social media critics noted, the tune is a lament about despair and misery caused by homelessness, drug addiction and poverty in the celebrated free world. Kyiv-based analyst Oleksandr Kraiev said many Ukrainians were puzzled by his stop at Barman Dictat, which was seen as inappropriate by some, given the current fraught wartime climate.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken performs Neil Young's ""Rockin' in the Free World"" Critics say the song is a lament about despair and misery caused by homelessness, drug addiction and poverty in the celebrated free world.

However, he remains incarcerated as he is serving sentences in the cipher and iddat cases. Notably, his sentences in two distinct Toshakhana cases were suspended by the IHC.During Tuesday's court session, NAB Special Prosecutor Amjad Pervaiz had indicated that the trial of the former premier and his spouse was nearing completion in his closing remarks.Last December, the National Accountability Bureau launched an inquiry against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and others, regarding the alleged acquisition of numerous acres of land under the guise of Al Qadir University Trust.

What is cold lava? The volcano phenomenon that has caused havoc in Indonesia's Sumatra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/what-is-cold-lava-the-volcano-phenomenon-that-has-caused-havoc-in-indonesias-sumatra/articleshow/110124536.cms,"NEW DELHI: Flash floods , landslides, and a destructive stream of cold lava from Mount Marapi , an active volcano in Sumatra, Indonesia , resulted in the deaths of at least 43 people and left 19 missing over the past weekend. Cold lava, also known as "" lahar "" in Javanese, comprises a mixture of water and rock fragments that flows rapidly down the slopes of a volcano, entering river valleys and spreading across wide areas.The disaster response agency in Indonesia shared distressing images and videos that showed roads and fields near Mount Marapi covered in thick mud and ash. This cold lava can flow at speeds of hundreds of kilometers per hour and reach distances as far as 60 km from the volcano, posing a significant threat to anything in its path, a report in the Independent said.According to the United States Geological Survey, lahars are considered more destructive and deadlier than regular lava flows. They have the potential to crush or bury almost anything, and by destroying infrastructure such as bridges and roads, they can trap people in areas that are vulnerable to further volcanic activities.Brittany Brand, director of the Boise State Hazard and Climate Resilience Institute at Boise State University , explained that even a small eruption of ash or lava could melt enough snowcap to produce devastating lahars. ""A small eruption of ash or lava can melt enough of that snowcap to produce devastating lahars,"" she said in an interview with Newsweek.The region frequently experiences landslides and flash floods, exacerbated by its geographical location on the Pacific Ring of Fire , home to 127 active volcanoes, more than any other country in the world. Mount Marapi alone has erupted 11 times in the 21st century, with a significant eruption in December spewing ash up to 3,000 meters into the air and covering towns and villages in ash.The situation remains precarious as Indonesian authorities continue to warn residents and climbers to avoid areas within a 4.5 km radius of Mount Marapi's crater. This recent activity underscores the ongoing volcanic threat faced by millions living in mountainous or flood-prone areas across Indonesia’s vast archipelago of over 17,000 islands.","Cold lava, also known as "" lahar "" flows rapidly down the slopes of a volcano, entering river valleys and spreading across wide areas.

MUMBAI: Just days ago, Tesla employees who were laid-off and were on H-1B visas took to social media frantically searching for a job. After all, H-1B workers get a grace period of only 60 days within which to find another job in the US (under an H-1B transfer process, where the new employer does the sponsorship and relevant paperwork).Today, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) posted on ‘X’ formerly twitter stating: When H-1B or other noncitizen workers are laid off, they may not be aware of their options and may wrongly assume that they have no choice but to leave the country within 60 days.While the guidance is not new, USCIS has made it more convenient for laid-off workers to get information at a glance, as it has collated together the various provisions. This guidance note is available on its site.TOI had earlier covered the other options available – such as transition to a visitor visa or a student visa. In its edition of November 5, 2022, Robert Webber, a US immigration attorney was quoted as saying: “If you do not have an H-1B transfer job offer lined up, after about 45-days, you could start the preparation for filing an I-539 application to change status from H-1B to B-2 to ‘buy time’ to transition out of the US. You will not have authorization to work on this visa, so this option is based on the assumption that you can support yourself during this period on your savings.” The B-2 visa is a visitor visa and the maximum stay is six months, but a few months extension is possibleRead also: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-is-a-double-whammy-for-laid-off-h-1b-employees-as-the-clock-is-ticking/articleshow/95325843.cms Later when USCIS broadened the parameters for backlogged skilled workers with approved I-140 petitions to obtain temporary work authorisation (employment authorisation document-EAD) for up to one year, under ‘compelling circumstances’, TOI in its edition of November 5, 2022, analysed how this could also help laid-off H-1B workers.While the compelling-circumstances-EAD has been in existence since 2017, very few could avail of it, as the standards were very strict. Cyrus Mehta, New-York based attorney had then told TOI “On June 14, 2023, USCIS relaxed the standard by allowing persons who have lived in the US with family for a significant amount of time to demonstrate that due to job loss they would be forced to sell their home, pull their children out of school, lose their health insurance and forced to relocate to their home country”.Read also: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/laid-off-workers-in-us-could-benefit-from-broadening-of-compelling-circumstances-norms/articleshow/101068686.cms When a non-immigrant worker’s (ie: H-1B employee’s ) employment ends, either voluntarily or involuntarily, they typically may take one of the following actions, if eligible, to remain in a period of authorized stay in the US:·File an application for a change of non-immigrant status;·File an application for adjustment of status;·File an application for a “compelling circumstances” employment authorization document; or·Be the beneficiary of a nonfrivolous petition to change employer.If they take one of the above actions during their 60 day grace period, their period of authorised stay can exceed 60 days. If the laid-off worker takes no action within the grace period, they and their dependents may then need to depart the US within 60 days, or when their authorized validity period ends, whichever is shorter.If the laid-off worker has a spouse who is holding a valid H-1B visa, he or she can become the dependent of this spouse (in other words obtain an H-4 visa. This is also possible if the spouse is holding an L visa (granted to those on an intra company transfer), the laid off H-1B worker can be the dependent spouse of an L visa holder. Some spouses of H-1B workers (such as those on track for a green card) can obtain work authorization. It is also possible for a spouse of an L visa holder to get work authorization. Or a laid off H-1B worker can transit to a student visa (F-1) or a visitor visa (B-1). USCIS cautions that non-immigrant visitors are specifically precluded from ‘performing skilled or unskilled labour’ in the US. Certain F-1 students, by regulation, may engage in limited employment.USCIS states that some workers may be eligible to file a self-petitioned immigrant visa application concurrently with an adjustment of status application. Examples of immigrant classifications that are eligible for self-petitioning include EB-1 (for those who can prove extraordinary ability) and EB-5 which is the investment linked green card program. Workers with a pending adjustment application are generally eligible to remain in the US in a period of authorised stay and can obtain an employment authorisation. Workers with a pending adjustment application are generally eligible to remain in the US in a period of authorised stay and obtain an EAD, explains USCIS.Workers who are the beneficiary of an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition (Form I-140) – this is the application for permanent residence – aka green card; may be eligible for a compelling circumstances EAD for up to one year if they: Do not have an immigrant visa available to them based on the Department of State’s Visa Bulletin; and Face compelling circumstances.A compelling circumstance EAD is a discretionary stopgap measure intended to assist certain individuals on the path to lawful permanent resident status by preventing the need to abruptly leave the US. Workers who begin employment on compelling circumstances EAD will no longer be maintaining non-immigrant status but generally will be in a period of authorized stay and will not accrue unlawful presence in the US while the EAD is valid, explains USCIS.H-1B portability allows eligible H-1B non-immigrants to change employers, or ‘port’, to a new H-1B employer and begin working for the new employer as soon as a nonfrivolous H-1B petition with a request to amend or extend H-1B status is properly filed with USCIS, without waiting for the new petition to be approved.The post on ‘X’ by USCIS has elicited a variety of responses, with some saying that the 60-day grace period is not adequate and must be of a longer duration.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) posted on ‘X’ formerly twitter stating: When H-1B or other noncitizen workers are laid off, they may not be aware of their options and may wrongly assume that they have no choice but to leave the country within 60 days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110148338,imgsize-787137,width-400,resizemode-4/110148338.jpg"
Pakistan's Gwadar port exposes China's Belt and Road failure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-gwadar-port-exposes-chinas-belt-and-road-failure/articleshow/110100113.cms,"'Investors thought Gwadar would become Dubai'

China investing heavily in its Belt and Road network

Gwadar performs worse than other new ports

CPEC hampered by political, economic instability

China learning from its mistakes in Pakistan

Unsustainable investment pushes countries into debt

In November 2016, Gwadar port symbolized stability, peace and prosperity for Pakistan — at least according to then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.""This day is the dawn of a new era,"" he told the opening ceremony crowd, which had gathered to witness a row of Chinese trucks arriving to load cargo onto the first-ever container ship to pass through the port.It was the official launch of the port's operations nearly a decade after its completion. The ceremony also marked the start of the prestigious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), part of China's global collection of infrastructure projects and trade networks known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Yet today, nearly eight years later, this new era has yet to dawn. A DW analysis shows what went wrong.The idea behind the CPEC was to connect China's western Xinjiang province with the sea via Pakistan. This would shorten trade routes for China and help avoid the contentious Malacca Strait choke point, a narrow waterway between Malaysia and Sumatra that links the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Pakistan, meanwhile, would benefit from increases in trade, infrastructure and industry along the 2,000-kilometer corridor (1,240 miles), all financed by China.In addition to the already established port of Karachi, Gwadar was chosen to connect the corridor to the global shipping network. The small fishing city lies near the Iranian border, some 500 kilometers away from Karachi.Gwadar's recently built deep-sea port, completed in 2007 and handed over to a Chinese operating company in 2013, was to become the heart of the CPEC. It would be integrated into a new special economic zone that would transform Gwardar into a bustling port city.The port has potential, said Azeem Khalid, an assistant professor of international relations at COMSATS University Islamabad who studies Chinese investments in Pakistan. ""It is a natural deep-sea port which can host bigger ships than Karachi. It sits at the crossroads of the global oil trade. And it would consolidate China's regional interests,"" he told DW.At home, China has already proven it can transform sleepy fishing villages into economic powerhouses. Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, is the best example. In just four decades, the city's population grew from around 60,000 inhabitants to more than 17 million today.""Back then, investors thought Gwadar would become the next Dubai,"" said Khalid.Pakistan is not alone in pursuing this vision. All over the world, governments are hoping to boost their economies through new and expanded ports and other infrastructure projects — and Chinese banks are more than willing to provide financing. Chinese companies often build and operate the ports as well.DW has collated information on at least 38 ports that have been built with Chinese investment since 2000; an additional 43 ports are planned or in construction. Seventy-eight existing ports also have Chinese stakeholders, DW found.These deals are lucrative for China, said Jacob Mardell, a former analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank, and a journalist covering the BRI.""This model almost kind of acts as a subsidy for Chinese companies,"" he told DW. He explained that Chinese banks loan money to governments that then give that money to Chinese construction companies and pay the loan back to the bank over time. This means the money essentially never leaves China, ""while the bill is ultimately footed by taxpayers in other countries.""One common pattern appears to be building new ports relatively close to already established ones, as is the case with Gwadar and Karachi. The new ports are often meant to supplement or replace the older, less efficient ones over time.This is also the case in Cameroon and Nigeria, for instance. In Cameroon, the newly built port of Kribi is set to replace the congested and far too shallow port of Douala, while in Nigeria, the port of Lagos is supplemented by the just-opened Lekki deep-sea port, less than 100 kilometers away. Both ports were financed and built by Chinese state-owned companies.Similarly, in 2017, the government of Sri Lanka granted China a 99-year lease and majority stake in its relatively new Hambantota port, which was originally intended to supplement the country's main port of Colombo.Lekki port received 26 ships in 2023, its first year of operation, according to ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic. It's a modest number compared to bigger ports — but Gwadar, despite being completed in 2007, has only logged 22 ships in its best year to date. It has also failed to attract any regularly scheduled deep-sea shipping lines.This means Gwadar processes almost no cargo that could generate income for Pakistan — or, for that matter, for the Chinese operating company. And it's no wonder: Gwadar is operating at very limited capacity. The port's three berths, where loading and unloading takes place, can handle 137,000 standard 20-foot shipping containers per year. In contrast, Karachi and its 33 berths can handle the equivalent of 4.2 million 20-foot containers per year.While ports like Kribi or Lekki are comparatively small, they outshine Gwadar, the supposed new centerpiece of trade for South and Central Asia.Khalid told DW that although Gwadar has the potential to eventually surpass Karachi, a lack of investment is holding it back. A $1.6 billion (€1.5 billion) expansion was promised in 2015, but little progress appears to have been made at the port since then. Much of the supporting infrastructure, including roads and railways needed to transport cargo to and from Gwadar, is also missing.Publicly, investors like the China Pakistan Investment Corporation still claim Gwadar port is ""becoming a focal point for trade and investment in the region."" But the empty port site suggests the opposite.Mardell and Khalid said that behind the scenes, both Pakistan and China have become disillusioned with the project.""Jobs promises were not met. Industrial promises were not met. The business opportunities for Pakistanis were not met,"" said Khalid. ""They [China] promised nine special economic zones. Not one is fully functional to date.""The of development in Gwadar broadly mirrors the situation in the rest of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. ""CPEC has had problems since its inception,"" said Mardell.Some of these problems are specific to the border region of Balochistan, where Gwadar is situated. It is among the poorest regions of Pakistan and has strong separatist militias that commonly carry out attacks, including some that have specifically targeted Chinese nationals. In turn, the militias have been violently suppressed by the Pakistani military.At the national level, Pakistan has been experiencing a severe economic crisis in recent years, and the country is still struggling to stabilize politically after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022.""Since the political and security situation in Pakistan has deteriorated more recently, that's hampered CPEC even more,"" said Mardell.On the Chinese side, Mardell thinks decision-makers might have miscalculated.""When it comes to investment decisions, the Chinese are famously not risk-averse,"" he told DW. He says ""basically unlimited"" state backing for state-owned investment and construction companies, coupled with the political will to rapidly step up competition with Western economies, has led China to fund even very risky projects in less stable countries worldwide.""I just don't think they fully understood the situation in Pakistan going in,"" said Mardell, though he believes this might change for other projects going forward. ""I think they've learned from their mistakes with the BRI and with CPEC, and they're probably more reluctant to commit capital nowadays.""In the last few years, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, China's spending on BRI projects has slowed. But while the country may now be more selective in which projects it funds, it is starting to invest more again, with total BRI investment amounts having reached pre-pandemic levels.Still, countries like Pakistan are now stuck paying back large amounts of debt to Chinese lenders. ""Pakistan has to pay billions of dollars back in loans, because of reckless investments in the name of CPEC,"" said Khalid.Similar cases have previously led to criticism that China is conducting debt-trap diplomacy, allowing partner countries to go into unsustainable amounts of debt to gain political influence.Moreover, part of the revenue from the newly built projects also goes back to China.""China gets the lion's share of everything,"" Khalid said, referring to CPEC investments. With Gwadar port, for instance, 90% of the quite limited revenue goes to the Chinese operating company. The Pakistani government receives 10%, while nothing goes to the Balochi regional government.Mardell said that the CPEC and Gwadar port with it will likely continue despite all its issues.""There's no way that China will lose face and admit that it's a disaster. And pulling out of CPEC and abandoning Pakistan isn't an option now. They're in too deep, and Pakistan is too important an ally,"" he said.Instead, he thinks it's likely China will continue to drag its feet on large investments in Pakistan, but still show token amounts of effort to keep the project going.Yet, he said, there's still a chance for Gwadar. ""If the situation in Pakistan changes for the better, then maybe CPEC will make progress.""","Gwadar port was to become the heart of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The idea was to connect China's western Xinjiang province with the sea via Pakistan. Pakistan, meanwhile, would benefit from increases in trade, infrastructure and industry. But despite being completed in 2007, Gwadar has only logged 22 ships in its best year to date.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110101231,imgsize-834597,width-400,resizemode-4/110101231.jpg"

The van, transporting prisoner Mohamed Amra , also known as ""The Fly,"" was rammed by a car at a toll booth while en route from court to prison.Following the collision, gunmen opened fire on the prison officers, resulting in the death of two officers and leaving two others in critical condition.A large-scale manhunt involving several hundred police officers and gendarmes has been initiated to apprehend the perpetrators. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his commitment to finding those responsible, saying on X that ""everything is being done to find the perpetrators"".Prosecutors have identified the escaped inmate as Mohamed Amra, a 30-year-old born in 1994. Amra, who has ties to a gang in Marseille, a city grappling with drug-related gang violence, was convicted of burglary on May 10 and had been indicted for a kidnapping that resulted in a death. The ambush occurred around 11:00 (09:00 GMT) near a toll booth on the A154 motorway as Amra was being transported back to jail in Évreux after attending a court hearing in Rouen.French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti confirmed that the officers were shot with ""heavy weapons"" by the prisoner's accomplices. The attackers fled the scene in a car, which police believe has been recovered, abandoned near the toll gate where the attack took place.Roadblocks have been set up across north-west France, and police are following up on every lead.In a press conference following a crisis unit meeting, Mr. Dupond-Moretti shared the tragic personal details of the deceased officers, with one leaving behind a wife and two children who were meant to celebrate their 21st birthday in two days, and the other leaving a wife who is five months pregnant.He vowed that ""Everything - and I mean everything - will be put in place to find the perpetrators of this vile crime,"" and that they would be punished ""in a way that is proportionate to the crime"".","Two French prison officers lost their lives when a prison van was ambushed.

"Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree on presidential debates on June 27, in September",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-biden-and-donald-trump-agree-on-presidential-debates-on-june-27-in-september/articleshow/110155069.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on Wednesday agreed to hold two campaign debates in June and September - the first hosted by CNN, the second on ABC - setting the stage for the first presidential face-off in just weeks.The quick agreement on the timetable to meet followed the Democrat's announcement that he will not participate in fall presidential debates sponsored by the nonpartisan commission that has organized them for more than three decades.Biden's campaign instead proposed that media outlets directly organize the debates with the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees, with the first to be held in late June and the second in September before early voting begins. Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, said he was ""Ready and Willing to Debate"" Biden at the proposed times.Hours later, Biden said he accepted an invitation from CNN to a debate on June 27, adding, ""Over to you, Donald. As you said: anywhere, anytime, any place."" Trump told Fox News Digital he accepted the invitation: ""I'll be there,"" he told the outlet. Soon after, they accepted a second debate on ABC.The swiftness with which the June 27 match-up came together reflects how each of the two profoundly unpopular candidates thinks he can get the better of his opponent in the showdown.CNN said that the debate would be held in its Atlanta studios and that ""no audience will be present."" It said moderators and other details would be announced later. Disagreements about moderators and debate rules were some of the very questions that prompted the formation of the Commission on Presidential Debates in 1987.The two campaigns and television networks had held weeks of informal talks on ways to circumvent the commission's grip on presidential debates, owing to years of complaints and perceived slights, according to two people familiar with the matter.Biden's campaign had proposed excluding third-party candidates, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., from the debates outright. Under the debate commission's rules, Kennedy or other third-party candidates could qualify if they secured ballot access sufficient to claim 270 Electoral Votes and polled at 15% or higher in a selection of national polls.CNN held open the door to Kennedy's participation if he or any other candidate met polling and ballot access requirements similar to the commission's.As recently as Wednesday morning, Trump expressed his desire for a large live audience.""I would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds - That's only because he doesn't get them,"" Trump said. ""Just tell me when, I'll be there.""Trump has been pushing for more debates and earlier debates, arguing voters should be able to see the two men face off well before early voting begins in September. He has repeatedly said he will debate Biden ""anytime, anywhere, any place,"" even proposing the two men face off outside the Manhattan courthouse where he is currently on criminal trial in a hush money case. He also has been taunting Biden with an empty lectern at some of his rallies.Trump's campaign on Wednesday challenged the Biden campaign to agree to at least two other debates between the two candidates, beside the June and September dates. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Biden's campaign has long held a grudge against the nonpartisan commission for failing to evenly apply its rules during the 2020 Biden-Trump matchups - most notably when it didn't enforce its COVID-19 testing rules on Trump and his entourage.Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon on Wednesday sent a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates to say that Biden's campaign objected to the fall dates selected by the commission, which come after some Americans begin to vote, repeating a complaint also voiced by the Trump campaign. She also voiced frustrations over the rule violations and the commission's insistence on holding the debates before a live audience.""The debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home - not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors,"" she said. ""As was the case with the original televised debates in 1960, a television studio with just the candidates and moderators is a better, more cost-efficient way to proceed: focused solely on the interests of voters.""There was little love lost for the commission as well from Trump, who objected to technical issues at his first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and was upset after a debate with Biden was canceled in 2020 after the Republican came down with Covid-19. The Republican National Committee had already promised not to work with commission on the 2024 contests.The Trump campaign issued a statement on May 1 that objected to the scheduled debates by the commission, saying that the schedule ""begins after early voting"" and that ""this is unacceptable"" because voters deserve to hear from the candidates before ballots are cast.The commission said in a Wednesday statement that ""the American public deserves substantive debates from the leading candidates for president and vice president,"" adding that its missing is ""to ensure that such debates reliably take place and reach the widest television, radio and streaming audience.""O'Malley Dillon said the debates ""should be one-on-one, allowing voters to compare the only two candidates with any statistical chance of prevailing in the Electoral College - and not squandering debate time on candidates with no prospect of becoming President.""Kennedy, in a statement, said ""Presidents Trump and Biden are colluding to lock America into a head-to-head match-up that 70% say they do not want. They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win. Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy."" His campaign hasThe Biden campaign also proposed that the Biden-Trump debates this year be hosted by ""any broadcast organization that hosted a Republican Primary debate in 2016 in which Donald Trump participated, and a Democratic primary debate in 2020 in which President Biden participated - so neither campaign can assert that the sponsoring organization is obviously unacceptable: if both candidates have previously debated on their airwaves, then neither could object to such venue.""Those criteria would eliminate Fox News, which did not host a Democratic primary debate in 2020, and potentially NBC News, which did not host a GOP one in 2016 - though its corporate affiliates CNBC and Telmundo were co-hosts of one debate each that year.In teeing up the debates, both Biden and Trump traded barbs on social media - each claiming victory the last time they faced-off in 2020.""Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020, since then, he hasn't shown up for a debate,' Biden said in a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. ""Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal.""Trump, for his part, said Biden was the ""WORST debater I have ever faced - He can't put two sentences together!""The Democrat suggested that the two candidates could pick some dates, taking a dig at Trump's ongoing New York hush money trial by noting that the Republican is ""free on Wednesdays,"" the usual day off in the trial.The president first indicated he would be willing to debate Trump during an interview with the radio host Howard Stern last month, telling him that ""I am, somewhere. I don't know when. But I'm happy to debate him.""Biden indicated again last week that he was preparing to debate, telling reporters as he was leaving a White House event: ""Set it up.""",Biden's campaign had proposed that media outlets directly organize the debates with the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees.

The incident, which occurred on January 27, involved a violent confrontation caught on video, leading to charges of second-degree assault and obstruction of a government administration.The defendants, Ulises Bohorquez , Yohenry Brito , Edgarlis Vegas, Darwin Andres Gomez-Izquiel, Wilson Juarez, Yorman Reveron, and Kelvin Servita Arocha, were presented in front of Judge Laura Wood at the New York Supreme Criminal Court. During the altercation, Lieutenant Ben Kurian and Officer Zunxu Tian suffered injuries including lacerations, bruising, and substantial shoulder pain as they attempted to disperse a disorderly group outside 220 West 42nd Street.Judge Wood expressed particular frustration with Yohenry Brito, who has been described as the 'most culpable' among the accused. Brito faced additional scrutiny for being rearrested on petty larceny charges while on bail. Judge Wood sternly warned him, stating, ""I am furious that Mr. Brito was rearrested and charged with petty larceny while he was out on this case. If you jaywalk, if you jump a turnstile, if you do anything at all and I have to issue a warrant, you will not see the light of day until this case is over. Do I make myself perfectly clear?""The Manhattan District Attorney's office proposed plea deals whereby Bohorquez, Brito, and Gomez-Izquiel would serve a year in prison for pleading guilty to second-degree assault. Meanwhile, Arocha and Juarez were offered six months for obstructing government administration. Vegas and Reveron have yet to receive any deal offers.This legal development has drawn significant attention and criticism, particularly regarding the perceived leniency of the plea deals in relation to the severity of the charges. The defense attorneys have not accepted the offers, and Judge Wood has scheduled a return to court on June 18, where a trial date will be set if no agreement is reached.The case has raised broader questions about the handling of violent crimes involving migrants and the appropriate level of judicial response, particularly in high-profile incidents involving law enforcement officers.","Five of the seven Venezuelan migrants accused of assaulting two NYPD officers in Times Square have been offered plea deals.

"'Zombie' wildfires resurface in Canada, worsening US air quality",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/zombie-wildfires-resurface-in-canada-worsening-us-air-quality/articleshow/110154209.cms,"NEW DELHI: A troubling environmental occurrence has been reported in Canada with the emergence of so-called 'zombie' wildfires. These fires, known for their ability to smolder underground during the colder months, have resurfaced with the arrival of spring, causing significant air quality concerns in both Canada and the United States.CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa detailed the nature and impact of these fires, saying, ""'Zombie' wildfires currently spreading through Canada are causing air quality issues in parts of the US."" This statement underscores the far-reaching effects of these wildfires, which, despite originating in remote Canadian forests, have the capacity to affect atmospheric conditions over a vast geographical area.The term 'zombie' wildfire refers to fires that do not extinguish completely but instead remain dormant under the insulating cover of snow and ice through the winter. With the onset of warmer weather, these fires reignite, fueled by dry conditions and abundant organic material left from the previous fire season.This phenomenon highlights the challenges posed by wildfire management in the context of global climate change. As temperatures rise and winters become milder, the conditions become more favorable for the persistence and resurgence of these fires. This presents a recurring threat to ecological stability, forest management, and public health due to the spread of smoke and particulate matter across borders, the CNN report said.The implications for air quality are particularly concerning. Smoke from these wildfires can travel thousands of kilometers, impacting air quality across continents and posing health risks to populations far from the original fire sites. This calls for increased international cooperation and innovative strategies in wildfire management and environmental protection to mitigate the impacts of these persistent blazes.As the situation develops, authorities on both sides of the border are monitoring the fires closely, and public health officials are issuing guidelines to help residents minimize exposure to smoke and poor air quality. The recurring nature of 'zombie' wildfires serves as a reminder of the ongoing and evolving challenges posed by environmental and climatic changes.","'zombie' wildfires are known for their ability to smolder underground during the colder months. These fires have resurfaced with the arrival of spring, causing significant air quality concerns in both Canada and the United States. Smoke from these wildfires can travel thousands of kilometers, impacting air quality across continents.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110154363,imgsize-20226,width-400,resizemode-4/110154363.jpg"
Hitler-themed assignment at Atlanta school sparks controversy over 'antisemitic tones',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hitler-themed-assignment-at-atlanta-school-sparks-controversy-over-antisemitic-tones/articleshow/110146655.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent assignment given to eighth-grade students at a private school in Atlanta has sparked controversy among parents due to its perceived antisemitic undertones. The Mount Vernon School assignment prompted students to evaluate Adolf Hitler's leadership qualities through a series of questions, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.Reportedly, students were asked to rate Hitler's characteristics as a leader using a rubric called the ""Mount Vernon Mindset."" One question inquired about Hitler's effectiveness as a ""solution seeker,"" while another questioned his ethical decision-making abilities.The options given along with the questions included “lacks evidence, approaching expectations, meets expectations, exceeds expectations” to describe the dictator.Parents voiced concern over the assignment's potential antisemitic implications and expressed worries that such questions could be interpreted as glorifying Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany responsible for orchestrating the Holocaust.Additionally, former students noted that they had not encountered similar questions during their time at the school.In response to the backlash, Mount Vernon School officials removed the assignment from the curriculum. Principal Kristy Lundstrom issued a statement explaining that the assignment aimed to explore World War II and deepen students' understanding of historical events, particularly Hitler's manipulation of fear in connection to the Treaty of Versailles.","Students were asked to rate Hitler's characteristics as a leader using a rubric called the ""Mount Vernon Mindset"" One question inquired about Hitler's effectiveness as a ""solution seeker,"" while another questioned his ethical decision-making abilities.

Clark Brewster, representing Daniels, informed CNN that the trial proceedings had deeply affected her, leading her to tears the night before her testimony.""She wore a bulletproof vest daily until arriving at the courthouse,"" Brewster said.""She was paralyzed with fear – not of taking the stand or telling her story, but what might some nut might do to her. And I’m genuinely concerned about it as well..""Over two days last week, Daniels testified for over eight hours, divulging details of her alleged 2006 affair with former American President Donald Trump, which he denies. Trump has been on trial since April 15, facing 34 counts of falsifying business records related to payments made to Daniels before the 2016 election to prevent her from making allegations about their affair.The legal dispute escalated when Trump's attorney, Susan Necheles, questioned Daniels during cross-examination to challenge her credibility. ""This has been your profession for over 20 years, involving writing, acting, and directing adult films. You possess considerable experience in presenting fabricated narratives about sexual encounters as genuine, correct?"", Trump’s attorney had said.Despite facing grueling cross-examination from Trump's defense team, Daniels stood firm in defending her career in the adult entertainment industry.This is not the first time Daniels has expressed fear over the hush money scandal. In 2018, she revealed feeling threatened by a stranger in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011, along with her infant daughter.The trial proceeded this week with testimony from Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, who allegedly facilitated the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Cohen acknowledged his desire for Trump's conviction in the case. During the intense cross-examination, Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, raised questions about Cohen's social media activity, highlighting a post where Cohen said, ""Trump belongs in a cage."" When directly asked if he wished for Trump to be convicted, Cohen responded affirmatively with ""sure"", as reported by CNN.The former Trump aide admitted to exerting pressure on individuals such as attorney Keith Davidson in 2018 to falsify information regarding deals with Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Cohen confessed to perpetuating these falsehoods out of loyalty to Trump and to shield him from scrutiny.","Stormy Daniels’ attorney disclosed that the adult film actress wore a bulletproof vest during Donald Trump’s hush money trial due to concerns about potential harm.

NEW DELHI: Eleven people were killed in a series of mass shootings on Tuesday in a small town in the southern Mexico 's Chiapas state, officials said.The shooting took place in Chicomuselo township in Mexico, known as a trafficking route for migrants and drug smuggling activities that has been hit by cartel turf wars in recent months.The killings occurred in Morelia, a remote hamlet within the township of Chicomuselo, situated near the border between Mexico and Guatemala.There have been confrontations between drug cartels in the area as recently as Monday, but at least some of the victims of Tuesday's shootings appeared to be simply residents of the town.As of Monday, clashes between drug cartels have been ongoing in the area. However, some of the victims of Tuesday's shootings seemed to be ordinary residents of the town, unrelated to any criminal activity.The ongoing turf war between the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels has led to widespread violence and displacement in the Chiapas border region.These criminal organisations are vying for control over various illicit activities, including the smuggling of migrants, drugs, and weapons, as well as the forcible recruitment of local individuals into their ranks.","Eleven people were killed in a series of mass shootings on Tuesday in a small town in the southern Mexico's Chiapas state.

The combined value of these properties is around $11 billion.“Dubai Unlocked”, an investigative project by over 70 media outlets around the globe, has revealed ownership of hundreds of properties of prominent global figures, including corrupt politicians,money launderers and drug lords, in Dubai.The data covers records of residential properties from 2020 till 2022.Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaksowning 23,000 properties in Dubaiare President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly, former PM Nawaz Sharif’s son Hussain Nawaz, home (interior) minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife, and several national and provincial lawmakers.While Zardari’s elder daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, is a Dubai resident, his son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and daughter, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, were listed as owners of four properties. Through her lawyers, Aseefa said that all assets owned by her in Dubai have been duly declared to the relevant authorities in Pakistan, including the electoral watchdog.The Pakistani list also features the late former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, former PM Shaukat Aziz, ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s son, and more than a dozen retired army generals as well as a police chief, an ambassador and a scientist, all of whom owned properties either directly or through their spouses and children.The Altaf Khanani network, which was sanctioned by the US for involvement in money laundering, has also surfaced in the leaks. Moving illicit funds for organised crime groups, including drug cartels and violent terrorist organisations, the network raked in an estimated turnover of between $14 billion and $16 billion annually. Altaf Khanani, the international face of the organisation, was ultimately convicted and spent nearly six years in a US prison; he was blacklisted by the US on money-laundering charges along with his son, Obaid Khanani, and nephew, Hozaifa Khanani. In Dubai, a country where, reportedly, investing in real estate with bags of cash raises few questions, the Khananis are listed owners of a massive real estate portfolio. Obaid himself is linked to around 30 properties, while the family as a whole were listed owners of 85 properties in early 2020, including around a dozen villas.Notably, several Pakistani families involved in politics and business were absent from the data, despite it being well known that they have bases and family residences in Dubai. This underscores that although the data is solid, it is neither a historical record of property ownership nor a comprehensive representation of all properties purchased by Pakistanis in Dubai . Many owners, according to data, still remain undetected, especially those who purchased property via a third party, or lesser-known company.","Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaks are President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly.

According to Dawn.com, the leaked data provides a detailed overview of hundreds of thousands of properties in Dubai and information about their ownership or usage, largely from 2020 and 2022.It was obtained by the Centre for Advanced Defence Studies (C4ADS), a non-profit organisation based in Washington, DC, that researches international crime and conflict.The data was then shared with Norwegian financial outlet E24 and the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which coordinated an investigative project with media outlets from around the world.

In fact, several of those approached for comment on their properties said they were declared to the tax authorities.""But it does paint an astonishing picture of contrasts.

People value their elected government and if any issues arise, it is resolved through dialogue,"" he said, adding that people place no trust in the imposed governments in Gilgit-Baltistan, PoK, Punjab, and Pakistan; hence the widespread unrest and frustration.He said further backlash will ensue against Form 47 governments when the budget is announced.He further said an artificial set-up has been imposed on the people in the country.""This government has absolutely no authority. An unconstitutional institution like SIFC (Special Investment Facilitation Council, an initiative of the army) has been imposed on Pakistan and no one dares to question it. It was established with the sole purpose of bringing investments, while the Pakistan Business Council has openly stated that investors are withdrawing their investments instead of investing in the country.""On the one hand, the nation was misled with the false hopes of the agricultural revolution and on the other hand, wheat importation to embezzle billions of rupees, has devastated the wheat farmer economically,"" he added.Khan said in this bogus setup, the government is given to those who have all their wealth lying outside in the form of dollars.""A leader has to make sacrifices and this group of Nawaz and Zardari will not sacrifice under any circumstances nor will they bring their money back to the country. General Musharraf and later ISI provided details to everyone including me on their looted money and today they have been imposed on us and their corruption charges are being cleared. The purpose of imposing this fake system on the nation is only to increase the power of this one man (Gen Munir) who has destroyed the entire country for his personal power,"" he said and vowed not to cut a deal with the military.""This country is my country and I will never leave it. Moreover, any deal is also out of the question. Pakistan is being run in a dictatorial manner. Our total revenue is 13.9 trillion rupees, while we have to pay 9.8 trillion rupees annually as interest. The country can never progress with such a punitive use of coercive measures,"" Khan said.","Imran Khan has been in jail since August last in different cases. He has asked Army chief General Asim Munir to apologize to him for his ""illegal"" abduction. Khan said the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) and the Chief of Army Staff are tarnishing the image of the army.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110121730,imgsize-37074,width-400,resizemode-4/110121730.jpg"

The paramilitary Rangers, which were called in to maintain law and order in the disputed region, came under attack while moving out of the region, the Dawn newspaper reported.Instead of exiting via Brarkot, the village bordering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the 19-vehicle convoy, including five trucks, chose to exit the region from Kohala, it said.As the convoy reached Muzaffarabad in a ""charged atmosphere"", it was pelted with rocks near Shorran da Nakka village, to which they responded with teargas and firing, the report said.After entering the city through the Western Bypass, the Rangers were welcomed with rocks again, prompting them to use teargas and bullets. The shelling was so intense that the entire neighbourhood reeled from it, the report said.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had yesterday approved a Pakistani Rs 23 billion subsidy for immediate release to the region after the negotiations between the protesters and the regional government ended in a deadlock.However, the government's decision to dole out the subsidy failed to pacify the region, the report said.The disputed region also witnessed clashes on Saturday between the police and activists of a rights movement, leaving at least one police officer dead and injuring over 100 people, mostly policemen. A completestrike has also been observed in the territory since Friday, bringing life to a halt.Shortly before the violence, Prime Minister Sharif and the disputed region's 'prime minister' Anwarul Haq after a meeting had approved the release of Pakistani Rs 23 billion for the region on account of power and wheat subsidies.The subsidised rate for 40kg flour will be Pakistani Rs 2,000, down from Pakistani Rs 3,100. The electricity tariff was reduced to Pakistani Rs 3, Rs 5 and Rs 6 per unit for up to 100, 300, and more than 300 units, respectively, the Dawn reported.The protest is led by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee ( JAAC ), which has traders at the forefront in most parts of the region, who have been seeking the provision of electricity as per hydropower generation cost in the region, subsidised wheat flour and an end to the privileges of the elite class.A long march led by the JAAC left for Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK , on Monday as the wheel-jam strike entered its fourth day.The movement announced its march on Muzaffarabad after the talks between the JAAC core committee and Chief Secretary of the region Dawood Bareach ended in a stalemate.Expressing deep concern over the violent clashes between the police and the protesters, Prime Minister Sharif on Sunday said that there should be ""absolutely no tolerance for taking the law into one's own hands"".""I urge all parties to resort to a peaceful course of action for resolution of their demands. Despite the best efforts of detractors, the matter will hopefully be settled soon,"" he said.As part of his efforts to calm down tensions, President Asif Ali Zardari urged all the stakeholders to exercise restraint and resolve the issues through dialogue and mutual consultation.","Security forces open fire on protesters in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir's capital Muzaffarabad.

Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved Monday around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes against escalating electricity tariffs , flour prices and taxes. The protests have left a police officer dead and 90 others, mostly cops, injured in the last few days.The growing unrest poses a grave challenge to Pakistan’s military, which maintains a significant presence in the region to guard the Line of Control with India.On Monday, protesters led by Awami Action Committee (AAC), an activist group that has united people to demand lower rates for essentials, continued a march to regional capital Muzaffarabad after negotiations with the govt ended in deadlock.The stalemate prompted PM Sharif, already under pressure over postponement of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman’s crucial visit to Pakistan later this month, to clear the grant for PoK at a special meeting in Islamabad. The meeting was attended by PoK’s PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, local ministers and other top figures. Following the meeting, PoK PM Haq announced cuts in bread prices and electricity tariffs.Meanwhile, mobile and internet services suspended in PoK a day earlier have not been restored in most parts. Govt offices, markets, trade centres and educational institutes also remained shut.Although there have been no calls for independence in the current wave of turmoil, locals said the protests reflected a general feeling of discontent with Islamabad. In the past, Islamabad had come under fire for suppressing regional movements that demanded total independence.The recent crisis began Friday when AAC started a Muzaffarabad strike that soon snowballed into violent clashes with law-enforcement officials. The detention of over 70 activists fuelled the unrest. The movement announced its march on Muzaffarabad after talks between AAC’s core committee and PoK’s chief secretary, Dawood Bareach, in Rawalakot ended inconclusively.PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari vowed to address the “genuine demands” of protesters, urging all to exercise restraint and resolve issues through dialogue.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes.
