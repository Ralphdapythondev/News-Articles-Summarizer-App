Who are the far-right groups behind the UK riots?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/who-are-the-far-right-groups-behind-the-uk-riots/articleshow/112257148.cms,"Here is what we know about the unrest and some of those involved.

Where have riots taken place?

Which groups are behind the unrest?

What is the English Defence League?

Why is the disorder so hard to quash?

Violent unrest has erupted in several towns and cities in Britain in recent days, and further disorder broke out Saturday as far-right agitators gathered in demonstrations around the country.The violence has been driven by online disinformation and extremist right-wing groups intent on creating disorder after a deadly knife attack on a children’s event in northwestern England, experts said.A range of far-right factions and individuals, including neo-Nazis, violent soccer fans and anti-Muslim campaigners, have promoted and taken part in the unrest, which has also been stoked by online influencers.Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed to deploy additional police officers to crack down on the disorder. “This is not a protest that has got out of hand,” he said Thursday. “It is a group of individuals who are absolutely bent on violence.”The first riot took place Tuesday evening in Southport, a town in northwestern England, after a deadly stabbing attack the previous day at a children’s dance and yoga class. Three girls died of their injuries, and eight other children and two adults were wounded.The suspect, Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain, but in the hours after the attack, disinformation about his identity — including the false claim that he was a migrant living in the country illegally — spread rapidly online. Far-right activists used messaging apps including Telegram and X to urge people to take to the streets.More than 200 people descended on Southport Tuesday night, many traveling by train from elsewhere in Britain, police said. Rioters attacked a mosque, wounded more than 50 police officers and set vehicles alight.On Wednesday night, another far-right demonstration brought clashes with the police in central London, leading to more than 100 arrests. Smaller pockets of disorder broke out in Hartlepool, in northeastern England; in the city of Manchester; and in Aldershot, a town southeast of London.On Friday night, Northumbria Police said its officers had been “subjected to serious violence” as far-right demonstrators set fires and attacked officers in Sunderland, a city in the northeast.On Saturday, activists clashed police in the northern cities of Liverpool, Hull and Nottingham, among other places.The chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Gavin Stephens, told BBC Radio on Friday that extra officers would be on Britain’s streets and that police would use lessons learned from the 2011 London riots.“We will have surge capacity in our intelligence, in our briefing and in the resources that are out in local communities,” he said.Several far-right groups have been at the riots or promoted them on social media. David Miles, a prominent member of Patriotic Alternative, a fascist group, shared photographs of himself in Southport, according to Hope Not Hate, a Britain-based advocacy group that researches extremist organizations .Other far-right agitators spread information about the protest on social media, including British Movement, a neo-Nazi group. Images of the protests examined by Hope Not Hate showed some people with Nazi tattoos.After the disorder in Southport, police said supporters of the English Defence League had been involved. The riots have also attracted people linked to soccer violence, or hooliganism, which has long overlapped with nationalist movements in Britain.Officials noted that not everyone at the demonstrations had far-right views. David Hanson, a Cabinet minister, told LBC Radio on Friday: “Some might be caught up in the summer madness. Some might be people who’ve got genuine concerns.”But, he warned, “If you are organizing this now, we will be watching you.”Created in 2009, the English Defence League was a far-right street movement notorious for violent protests and an anti-Islam, anti-immigration stance.The group emerged in Luton, England, where community tensions had risen after a handful of Islamic extremists chanted abuse at British soldiers returning home from Iraq. Luton was already associated with Islamist extremism, because it was home to a small number of adherents to Al Muhajiroun, an extremist group implicated in the 2005 London bombings.Among the English Defence League founders was Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who goes by the name Tommy Robinson. Born in Luton, he was at one time a member of the far-right British National Party. He also had connections to soccer violence and was convicted of leading soccer fans in a brawl in Luton in 2010.In the group’s early years, regional divisions carried out local demonstrations, including protests over planned mosques, and engaged in actions such as placing pig heads around Muslim sites.According to Matthew Feldman, a specialist on right-wing extremism, the group represented a new stage in far-right British politics, because unlike the National Front or the British National Party, it did not contest elections.“This is direct-action politics, disseminated and coordinated via the new media — ranging from Facebook to mobile phones, and digital film to YouTube,” Feldman wrote in a 2011 academic study of the English Defence League.In 2013, Yaxley-Lennon said he had broken ties with the league. And after leadership disputes and internal divisions, the group no longer formally exists. But experts say that many of its supporters remain active through other nationalist groups with similar aims and tactics.In the later 2010s, Yaxley-Lennon rose to prominence in international circles that shared his anti-Muslim stance, including in Europe and the United States. In the past week, he has used social media, including a previously banned X profile that was reinstated under Elon Musk, to promote falsehoods about the identity of the Southport attacker.Nowadays, experts say the English Defence League has evolved into a diffuse idea spread mainly online. Its Islamophobic and xenophobic stance has become an “ideal that people self-radicalize themselves into,” said Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a nonprofit that researches public attitudes on immigration and identity.Many far-right groups in Britain have deliberately moved away from formal hierarchies and leadership structures, experts say.Joe Mulhall, Hope Not Hate’s director of research, called the movement “post organizational” in a 2018 analysis. Social media and other technologies, he wrote, offer “new ways for it to engage in activism outside the confines of traditional, organizational structures.”Violent street rallies, a core part of the English Defence League’s rise, often serve as a recruiting tool for extremist groups, according to Paul Jackson, a University of Northampton professor who specializes in the history of radicalism and extremism.“Social movements thrive on such demonstrations,” he wrote in a 2011 paper. “They are ‘performances’ that can reinforce the perceived senses of injustice and being ignored by mainstream voices to followers.”Police may struggle to respond to mobs that can be conjured within hours through private messaging apps. According to Feldman, “police are still oftentimes thinking in 20th-century terms — that something like this might take a few days to set up; that they might ask for a permit for a march.”The Southport riot, he said, “was very nearly a flash demo.”","Violent unrest has erupted in several towns and cities in Britain in recent days.

"Passenger spots lice crawling in woman’s hair mid-air, forces American Airlines emergency landing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/american-airlines-flight-makes-emergency-landing-after-passenger-spots-lice-crawling-in-womans-hair-mid-air/articleshow/112257147.cms,"In a bizarre turn of events, an American Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Phoenix after a passenger reportedly saw bugs crawling in a fellow traveler’s hair.The flight, originally en route from Los Angeles to New York, had a routine start until a disconcerting situation unfolded.According to TikTok creator Ethan Judelson, who was on board, the crew gave minimal information about the diversion, leaving passengers puzzled.Judelson shared his experience in a TikTok video, recounting a sudden commotion as a woman across the aisle bolted to the front of the plane as soon as they landed. His initial reaction was confusion, as there was no apparent panic among the passengers.In a subsequent interview with the People, Judelson described the scene, noting that the woman’s rush seemed overly dramatic for the situation. He and another passenger wondered why she was so frantic, since everyone would be deplaning together.Judelson recounted, “I look around, no one’s on the ground, no one’s freaking out. I’m like, ‘it can’t be that dire.'” Upon landing, the situation became more peculiar. “As soon as we land, this woman across the aisle from me shoots up and rushes to the front of the plane,” he ewas quoted as explaing, noting that it seemed like an exaggerated urgency to be the first off the aircraft.The situation grew even stranger when passengers were told they would face a 12-hour delay and were given hotel vouchers. Judelson’s confusion deepened as he questioned whether they were stuck in Phoenix indefinitely.American Airlines confirmed in a statement that the flight was diverted due to a medical emergency. However, the specifics remained unclear until Judelson learned through word of mouth that the real cause was a lice outbreak. He overheard other passengers discussing how bugs had been spotted in the woman's hair, prompting the emergency landing.Despite the unusual interruption, passengers eventually continued their journey to New York, albeit with an unexpected detour.","A flight from Los Angeles to New York was forced to make an emergency landing in Phoenix.

Trump’s federal election interference case resumes after long pause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-federal-election-interference-case-resumes-after-long-pause/articleshow/112257131.cms,"After a nearly eight-month hiatus, former President Donald Trump 's federal election interference case is back in motion. On Saturday, Judge Tanya Chutkan scheduled a hearing for August 16 in Washington to discuss the next steps in the case, which had been stalled due to a Supreme Court ruling on Trump's immunity.The Supreme Court's landmark decision last month granted Trump broad immunity against criminal prosecution for actions taken during his presidency.However, the ruling left unresolved the matter of whether Trump’s alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, detailed in the indictment, could proceed to trial.The upcoming hearing will address how to handle this complex fact-finding mission. Judge Chutkan will confer with Trump’s lawyers and special counsel Jack Smith’s team to determine which parts of the indictment can advance and which are protected under presidential immunity .While Saturday's scheduling of the hearing was procedural, it marks the first substantive action in the case since December. The Supreme Court's decision on immunity was issued on July 1, but the formal mandate was only executed on Friday, returning the case to the lower courts.Judge Chutkan's order instructs both defense and prosecution to submit proposals for pretrial proceedings by next Friday. The details of how the fact-finding will be conducted—whether through written briefs or a more detailed hearing—are yet to be determined.","Judge Tanya Chutkan scheduled a hearing for August 16 in Washington to discuss the next steps in the case.

Donald Trump sparks new feud with Georgia governor: 'Little Brian' slammed as 'disloyal'; Kemp fires back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-sparks-new-feud-with-georgia-governor-little-brianslammed-as-disloyal-kemp-fires-back/articleshow/112256954.cms,"Donald Trump reignited his feud with Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp on Saturday as he campaigned in the crucial swing state, where he is working to reverse his narrow 2020 loss to President Joe Biden. Trump's criticism of Kemp was fueled by his ongoing grievances over the 2020 election results and the role of GOP officials who did not support his unfounded claims of election fraud.Before his rally , Trump attacked Kemp on his social media platform, Truth Social, accusing him of prioritizing ""Unity and the Republican Party"" over combating crime. Trump also criticized Kemp's wife, Marty, for planning to write in her husband's name rather than voting for the Republican nominee in the upcoming election.At the rally, Trump delivered a roughly 10-minute tirade against Kemp, calling him a “bad guy,” “disloyal,” and “very average.” He also referred to him derogatorily as “Little Brian, Little Brian Kemp.”In response, Kemp took to X (formerly Twitter) to urge Trump to “leave my family out of it” and criticized him for engaging in “petty personal insults” and focusing on past grievances rather than current issues. “Stop attacking fellow Republicans,” Kemp added.The clash comes as Georgia is poised for another tightly contested election, with Democrats energized by Biden’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. To secure a win, Trump will need to garner support from Kemp’s political network and moderate voters, beyond his base.Trump’s rally in Atlanta, Georgia’s largest media market, attracted thousands of supporters. Among them was Draic Coakley, a 23-year-old trucking industry worker from Heflin, Alabama, who attended his third Trump rally. Coakley expressed his belief that Trump “gets us” and contrasted him with what he sees as the elitism of Biden and Harris.In the 2020 election, Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes. Trump’s attempts to overturn the results included pressuring Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” votes and presenting slates of “fake electors.” Trump was indicted in Georgia for his efforts, but the case is on hold pending court decisions.Kemp, who certified Biden’s electors and resisted Trump’s efforts to replace them, has managed to maintain his position of influence within the GOP. Despite Trump’s endorsement of Kemp's primary rival in 2022, Kemp won reelection decisively against Democrat Stacey Abrams and is expected to chair the Republican Governors Association for the 2026 cycle.Conservative commentator Erick Erickson criticized Trump for his focus on personal attacks rather than uniting the party. “Trump can’t help himself,” Erickson wrote on X. “If he loses, it’ll be because of this stuff, not a stolen election.”While both parties are concentrating on Georgia, recent Democratic efforts have shifted focus to the Midwest following Biden’s campaign exit. Trump’s allies have urged him to concentrate on key issues like the economy and immigration, areas where they believe he holds an advantage over Harris.Trump’s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, used the rally to attack Harris, describing her as a “San Francisco liberal” and claiming Trump had “exposed a massive coverup” during the debates that led to Biden’s withdrawal from the race.The Harris campaign preemptively criticized Trump’s rally, predicting he would continue to deny the 2020 election results and expressed disappointment over his decision to propose a debate with Harris on Fox News instead of attending a previously agreed-upon debate.Former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, who has repudiated Trump, commented after the rally, accusing Trump of prioritizing his own grievances over the needs of the country. “Millions of Americans are fed up with his grievance-filled campaign focused only on himself,” Duncan said.","Donald Trump reignited his feud with Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp on Saturday as he campaigned in the crucial swing state.

Florida braces for Debby: Fourth named storm set to become hurricane,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/florida-braces-for-debby-fourth-named-storm-set-to-become-hurricane/articleshow/112256872.cms,"Tropical Storm Debby formed north of Cuba on Saturday, rapidly intensifying as it charted a path through the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) has now predicted that Debby will likely strengthen into a hurricane before making landfall .With maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), Debby was situated approximately 100 miles (160 kilometers) west-southwest of Key West, Florida, and was moving northwest at 14 mph (22 kph).The storm's reach already extends over a vast area, impacting southern Florida, the Florida Keys, and the Bahamas with wind and thunderstorms.Forecasters anticipate that Debby will bring heavy rain and coastal flooding to much of Florida’s Gulf Coast by Sunday night, with the potential to make landfall as a hurricane on Monday. The storm is expected to cross northern Florida and enter the Atlantic Ocean, where it may continue to affect the southeastern United States.This marks the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, following Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl, and Tropical Storm Chris—all of which formed in June.As Debby approaches, the NHC has issued a hurricane warning for parts of the Big Bend and the Florida Panhandle. Tropical storm warnings are also in effect for Florida’s West Coast, southern Florida Keys, and the Dry Tortugas, with a tropical storm watch extending farther west into the Panhandle.The NHC predicts 6 to 12 inches (150 to 300 mm) of rain for affected areas, with isolated totals reaching up to 18 inches (450 mm), raising concerns about flash and urban flooding. Rivers along Florida’s West Coast are also at risk of moderate flooding. Coastal areas, including Tampa Bay, could see storm surges of 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters), with a surge of up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) expected in the Big Bend region.Local officials have initiated evacuation orders in vulnerable areas, particularly in Citrus and Levy counties, where coastal residents are urged to seek safer ground. Shelters have opened in multiple counties to accommodate evacuees.In preparation for Debby, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency across 61 counties, and the National Guard has activated 3,000 members to assist with response efforts. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has also issued an emergency proclamation in anticipation of the storm's impact.As the storm looms, residents and officials are taking precautions. In Tampa, more than 30,000 sandbags have been distributed to help protect homes from potential flooding. Coastal businesses and marinas, like the Blue Pelican Marina in Hernando Beach, are securing equipment and tying down boats in preparation for the storm.Despite the warnings, some residents, like Betti Silverman of Crystal River, remain hesitant to evacuate, recalling past experiences with storms. However, authorities continue to emphasize the potential dangers, urging everyone in affected areas to stay vigilant and prepared.Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, Hurricane Carlotta and Tropical Storm Daniel continue their courses, although neither is expected to make landfall. Carlotta is gradually losing strength, and Daniel is forecasted to dissipate into a remnant of thunderstorms.As Florida braces for the impact of Debby, memories of previous storms with the same name resurface, particularly the devastating 2012 tropical storm that caused significant damage and loss of life. Residents and officials are hoping for a less severe outcome this time, but remain prepared for the worst.","Tropical Storm Debby formed north of Cuba on Saturday, rapidly intensifying as it charted a path through the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida.

In a conversation with his son Chip, Carter humorously shared his determination to cast a vote for Harris, as revealed by his grandson Jason Carter in a report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.The former president, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and advocate for numerous charitable causes, remains the longest-living president in US history.Despite his health challenges, Jason Carter mentioned that his grandfather has shown renewed interest in politics and global events, particularly the ongoing conflict in Gaza.With President Joe Biden ending his re-election bid last month, Vice President Harris has quickly revitalized the Democratic base in preparation for the November 5 election against Donald Trump.Carter, a Democrat, served one term as president after being elected in 1976. His presidency was marked by achievements like the Camp David Accords and challenges such as the Iran hostage crisis. Despite health setbacks, including beating brain cancer in his 90s, Carter continues to inspire with his resilience.According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Georgia's early voting period will allow Carter to cast his vote as early as October 15, just two weeks after his centennial birthday.","Former US President Jimmy Carter will celebrate his 100th birthday on October 1.

She is a light for Venezuela.""- 'Mother of all marches' -Venezuela's CNE election authority, loyal to Maduro, on Friday proclaimed him the winner with 52 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Gonzalez Urrutia, a result that defied pre-election polls.Thousands of Maduro supporters responded to his call for ""the mother of all marches"" Saturday afternoon, gathering in central Caracas to march to the presidential palace in the name of ""national peace.""""We will not accept"" the opposition's claims of victory and moves to ""usurp the presidency of the republic again,"" Maduro declared at the rally.After Venezuela's last election, in 2018, Maduro was proclaimed winner amid widespread accusations of fraud. Eventually the United States and dozens of other countries recognized the then-speaker of parliament, Juan Guaido, as Venezuela's acting president.But Guaido failed to remove Maduro from office as many had hoped he would, and the once wildly popular young politician has largely faded from public life.""We are at the beginning of a new era, the era of the consolidation of the revolution, the era of well-being,"" 69-year-old professor Ali Garcia said at the rally.Maduro, 61, has slammed the international criticism, describing allegations of vote fraud as a ""trap"" orchestrated by Washington to justify ""a coup.""The opposition has launched a website with copies of 84 percent of ballots cast, showing an easy win for Gonzalez Urrutia. The government claims these are forged.Maduro has led the oil-rich, cash-poor country since 2013, presiding over a GDP drop of 80 percent that pushed more than seven million of once-wealthy Venezuela's 30 million citizens to emigrate.Experts blame economic mismanagement and US sanctions for the collapse.Maduro has maintained power thanks to loyalty from the military leadership, electoral bodies, courts and other state institutions, as well as the backing of Russia, China and Cuba.- Security -Maduro on Saturday also said ""military and police patrols"" would continue throughout the country to ""protect the people.""Rights groups reported 11 dead in protests Monday and Tuesday as angry Venezuelans took to the streets.Maduro said two officers were killed, and 2,000 people detained. He has said his administration was preparing two maximum security prisons to hold protest-related inmates.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke Friday with Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia, expressing ""his concern for their safety and well-being"" and congratulating Gonzalez Urrutia ""for receiving the most votes,"" the State Department said.Venezuela emigres in cities across the Americas also rallied Saturday against Maduro and his claims of victory.""We don't want violence, we just want him to leave, we only want peace,"" 43-year-old Maudie Lopez, a crafts worker, told AFP in Colombia's capital Bogota, where hundreds joined in song and prayer.""I want to return to my country.""Colombia is housing some three million of the seven million Venezuelans who have fled since Maduro came to power.","Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado emerges from hiding, declares ""We have never been so strong"" President Nicolas Maduro slams what he calls attempts to ""usurp the presidency"" Thousands of Maduro supporters respond to his call for ""the mother of all marches"" Brazil, Colombia and Mexico urge an ""impartial verification"" of the result.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112257739,imgsize-1201033,width-400,resizemode-4/112257739.jpg"

Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance in a podcast spoke how he was chosen as the VP pick by the GOP after 18 months of being a Senator and said that during the vetting process, he was asked by a lawyer whether he had a secret family -- another spouse apart from Usha Chilukuri Vance. JD said his wife was sitting there and three children were sleeping upstairs when the lawyer said he had to ask an intrusive question.""I was like, 'Are you serious?' Do I have a secret family? Like, what do you mean? He said sometimes you know people have another spouse, other kids in a place like Alaska,"" Vance said.""Oh by the way, if I did I am not gonna admit it in front of my wife. It's one of those questions where if you got to that point in your life that you are such a dishonest person and have a secret family in Alaska, I think they would hide it. But no, I don't have a secret family in Alaska,"" Vance said laughing adding that they ask all these weird questions to prepare for the media firestorm.JD detailed how he got to know that he has been named as VP pick by Trump. Because of the ongoing vetting process, he knew he was one of the candidates Trump was shortlisting but the moment it was decided, he was on a plane to Milwaukee without Wi-Fi and on landing, he saw 350 messages.At the hotel room, when he finally got the opportunity to speak to Trump, Trump said, ""JD, you missed a very important phone call and now I'm gonna have to pick somebody else."" JD said his son at that time was talking continuously about Pikachu. ""I told him, son shut hell up for 30 seconds... I have the most important phone call of my life...""

Elon Musk: 'Destroyer of woke': Elon Musk gets the Turkish shooter meme treatment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/destroyer-of-woke-elon-musk-gets-the-turkish-shooter-meme-treatment/articleshow/112220020.cms,"How did Dikec go viral?

In 3 Idiots, Dr. Viru ""Virus"" Sahastrabuddhe assures his students, while extolling the virtues of cut-throat competition, that no one remembers who comes second. Of course, that was before the era of virality (pun intended). In fact, if you ask most casual internet users, they’d be hard-pressed to tell you who won the 10m mixed air pistol shooting event, but they will instantly recognize Yusuf Dikec , who went viral for his casual, nonchalant vibe and ‘main character energy.’ Dikec and his partner Sevval Ilayda Tarhan won the silver medal at the event, where Serbia’s Zorana Arunovic and Damir Mikec picked up the gold, and India’s Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh secured bronze.However, on social media , it’s Dikec who has become an instant star, with many calling him the Turkish John Wick and being bowled over by his ""cat dad"" persona. In fact, he has become so popular that even Elon Musk got the Dikec makeover, with one user sharing Musk’s face on Dikec’s image with the caption: “I am become meme , Destroyer of woke.”The phrase is a reference to Elon Musk’s war on “woke” culture. Musk has been a vocal critic of ""woke"" culture, which he associates with a form of social justice activism that he believes stifles free speech and promotes ideological conformity. Musk's disdain for ""woke"" culture is also personal; his daughter, who came out as transgender and has since estranged herself from him, is reportedly influenced by the very cultural and ideological trends he critiques. Musk has expressed concern that ""woke"" culture has led to a breakdown in their relationship, as it promotes values and beliefs that are at odds with his own. This personal dimension, combined with his broader libertarian beliefs in individual freedom, anti-establishment views, and concerns about the impact of ""woke"" culture on corporate environments and innovation, fuels his public opposition to what he sees as the excesses of political correctness and cancel culture.The 51-year-old athlete has captured global attention, not only for his skill but also for his unique style. Dikec competed in a plain T-shirt without any of the protective gear or special lenses typically worn by his peers, making him a standout figure in the competition.He and his partner, Sevval Ilayda Tarhan, won the silver medal in the mixed team 10-meter air pistol event, while India's Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh took home the bronze. Reflecting on his achievement, Dikec expressed hope for a gold medal in the upcoming Los Angeles 2028 Summer Games.Before becoming an Olympian, Dikec was born in 1973 and has represented Turkey in every Summer Olympics since 2008.

Our planet is home to billions of people, each navigating the complexities of daily life through work, thought, play, and planning. In the midst of this chaos, some individuals manage to stay focused and disciplined, creating entirely new perspectives on life, the universe, and its meaning. Among these exceptional individuals are those who receive Nobel Prizes.The Nobel Prizes are far from ordinary awards.Established in 1895 by Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel, they honour significant contributions in six fields: literature, peace, economics, chemistry, physics, and medicine. Laureates receive a diploma, a gold medal, and a monetary award, which usually exceeds $1 million. While most prizes are awarded to individuals, the Peace Prize can also go to organisations. Occasionally, multiple recipients share a prize, but no more than three people can share one award.Since their inception in 1901, Nobel Prizes have been awarded 573 times to 900 recipients and organisations. Some have won more than once. Although prizes are generally awarded annually, there may be years when no prize is given if no achievement meets the high standards set.The significance of these awards lies not just in the accolades themselves but in the groundbreaking work they recognize. Nobel laureates are trailblazers who dedicate their lives to uncovering the mysteries of our existence, thereby advancing human knowledge and understanding. This article highlights ten such transformative figures who have made a profound impact on our world.Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, made significant contributions to science with her research on radioactivity. Born in 1867, Curie and her husband Pierre, along with Henri Becquerel, were awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics for their studies on radiation. She later won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her discoveries of radium and polonium, becoming the first individual to receive Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. During World War I, Curie applied her knowledge to develop mobile X-ray units, enhancing battlefield medical care. Her groundbreaking work continues to impact medicine and technology, and her daughter, Irene Joliot-Curie, also won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935.Albert Einstein transformed our understanding of physics and the universe. Awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which showed that light consists of particles, Einstein’s work laid the foundation for technologies such as television and motion pictures. His theories of relativity further revolutionised physics, reshaping our perception of time, space, and the fundamental nature of reality. Einstein's contributions advanced both quantum theory and technological innovations.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times: in 1917, 1944, and 1963. Founded in Geneva in 1863, the ICRC is committed to providing aid to the wounded and sick in wartime, regardless of nationality. It plays a vital role in upholding the Geneva Conventions, documenting violations, and assisting prisoners of war and civilians. The ICRC’s efforts exemplify humanitarian principles amidst global conflicts.Alexander Fleming, Ernst Chain, and Howard Florey were honoured with the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of penicillin. Fleming discovered that mould (Penicillium notatum) produced an antibacterial substance, leading to the development of penicillin-based antibiotics. These antibiotics revolutionised medicine by effectively treating diseases such as tuberculosis, gangrene, and syphilis, thereby saving countless lives.Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her extensive charitable work. In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Catholic organisation dedicated to helping the poor, sick, and orphaned in India. The organisation expanded its mission to assist those affected by AIDS, war, and famine. Mother Teresa’s lifelong commitment to humanitarian work continues through her organisation, which operates in over 130 countries and supports thousands of people in need.Ivan Pavlov, awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology, is renowned for his research on conditioned reflexes. His experiments with dogs demonstrated that they could be conditioned to salivate in response to a stimulus, such as a bell, when it was repeatedly associated with feeding. Pavlov’s work had a profound impact on psychology and behaviourism, shaping our understanding of learned behaviours. His influential research also led to significant advancements in behavioural science.Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his leadership in the American civil rights movement. King advocated for racial equality and freedom through non-violent protests and activism, notably leading the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955. His extensive efforts to combat racial discrimination and his influential speeches made a lasting impact on American society. Despite his assassination in 1968, his legacy endures as a symbol of non-violent resistance and social justice.James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. Their discovery of the double-helix structure was crucial in understanding genetic information transmission within organisms. Their achievements were greatly aided by Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray photographs of DNA, though her contributions were overshadowed by her male counterparts. Franklin passed away before the Nobel committee could consider her for the prize, as posthumous awards are not allowed.Hermann Muller received the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the effects of X-rays, demonstrating that they cause genetic mutations. His studies in the 1920s showed that X-rays caused genetic damage in Drosophila flies, leading him to conclude similar effects in humans. Although he struggled to publicise his findings, the atomic bombings of Japan during World War II highlighted the dangers of radiation, leading to the recognition of his work. Muller’s discoveries and his anti-nuclear stance provided a crucial counterbalance to technological advancements of the Atomic Age.Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 but1, but was unable to accept it until 2012 due to her detention by Myanmar’s oppressive military regime. Her advocacy for democracy and human rights led to her house arrest starting in 1990, which lasted intermittently until 2010. After her release, Suu Kyi led her party, the National League for Democracy, to a major electoral victory in 2015. Although she was barred from the presidency due to her sons' foreign citizenship, she served as state counsellor. However, her reputation has been marred by criticism over her handling of the Rohingya crisis, with some arguing that her power was limited by the military’s control.","The Nobel Prizes honour significant contributions in six fields: literature, peace, economics, chemistry, physics, and medicine.

Now look, we want to get people in.

And we got our people back, but boy, we made some horrible, horrible deals. And it’s nice to say we got them back, but does that set a bad precedent?”Moving from congratulating Putin, the former president said, “Harris has the most ultra-left-wing agenda of any presidential candidate ever in history.”“She is considered more left-wing then Crazy Bernie Sanders. She is worse than Bernie.”Taking the attack one step further and personal, Trump continued to attack the VP Kamala Harris with this 'low IQ' rant.“She happens to be really a low IQ individual,” Trump said in his attack. “She has a very low IQ.

The agency said it will happen soon but did not give a date.""We consistently engage with our partners in the Government of Mexico and work together to adjust policies and practices in response to the latest migration trends and security needs,"" CBP said in a statement.The statement confirmed remarks a day earlier by Mexico's foreign affairs secretary Alicia Barcena , who said closer relations with the United States cut migration sharply from late last year.US officials have said increased Mexican enforcement is largely responsible for a sharp drop in US arrests for illegal border crossings during the first half of this year. Mexican officials have stepped up their presence at highway checkpoints and on railroads leading to the US border, returning most to southern Mexico.In June, the US temporarily suspended asylum processing for those who enter the country illegally, making CBP One of the only avenues for migrants to enter the US to seek asylum and further driving down illegal entries. US officials said arrests for illegal crossings plunged 30% in July from the previous month to the lowest level of Joe Biden 's presidency and the lowest since September 2020.""We have managed to decompress our (northern) border in a very meaningful way and that has helped ... our relationship with the United States be very, very dynamic and very positive,"" Barcena said Friday.More than 680,000 people scheduled CBP One appointments at eight Mexican land crossings with the US from its introduction in January 2023 through June. The top nationalities are Venezuelan, Cuban and Haitian. US authorities recently limited slots for Mexicans due to the high number of applicants from the country.The perils of traveling through Mexico to be kidnapped or robbed has prompted many migrants to fly to northern border cities like Tijuana for their CBP One appointments once they reach the southernmost point from which they can apply until now, Mexico City.Migrants generally enter Mexico in Chiapas or Tabasco from Guatemala.

The announcement drew a sharp reaction from Harris, who criticized Trump for what she saw as an attempt to avoid a fair confrontation.Trump announced his social media platform, Truth Social, saying that the debate would feature a ""full arena audience"" and take place in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.Trump's proposal echoes the format of the first debate he had with President Joe Biden, who has since exited the reelection race. The second debate was originally planned for September 10 on ABC News, but Trump suggested moving it to Fox News, a network favored by his supporters. Harris, who officially secured the Democratic nomination on Friday, responded by reaffirming her commitment to the original debate date.The change, which Trump announced, raised objections from the Harris campaign and appeared to throw a potential showdown between the rivals into question.A campaign official for Harris on Saturday accused Trump of scheming up the Fox News debate to distract from reneging on his commitment to the ABC debate. Trump had agreed to that debate in May, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.“Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out,” Michael Tyler, communications director for the Harris campaign, said. “He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10.”Tyler said that the Harris campaign was open to discussing further debates if Trump honored his commitment to the ABC debate.A spokesperson for ABC News would not say whether the network would go ahead with its debate and give time only to Harris, reported NYT.Harris took a direct jab at Trump, questioning his sudden change of plans. “It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe space,’” Harris remarked. She reaffirmed her commitment to the scheduled debate, adding, “I’ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there.”According to Trump’s post on his social media site, the Fox News debate would take place on Sept 4 at a to-be-determined location in Pennsylvania. The network’s anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum would moderate.Trump said on social media that the Fox News debate would have a live audience; the previous debate between him and Biden was hosted by CNN in an empty venue. Although both campaigns agreed to the format of the first debate, Trump had bemoaned the lack of a crowd.Besides, at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday night, Trump continued to take jabs at Harris, this time targeting her racial identity. He falsely suggested that Harris had downplayed her Black heritage, an accusation he made earlier to the National Association of Black Journalists. Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, identifies as both Black and Asian.During the rally, Trump mocked the pronunciation of Harris’ first name and called her a ""lunatic,"" further escalating the personal attacks that have characterized his campaign rhetoric.Trump also claimed that the ABC debate was ""terminated"" due to Biden’s withdrawal and his own ongoing litigation with the network. However, ABC had recently outlined qualification requirements for the debate without mentioning any specific candidates. These requirements, including polling support and state ballot access by September 3, reflect the tight race between Harris and Trump, who had maintained a lead over Biden after the first debate.ABC News and Fox News have both declined to comment on the status of the debate. Trump's proposal for the Fox debate came just after the Democratic National Committee launched an ad campaign accusing him of being ""afraid to debate"" and questioning his stance on abortion.David Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who recently joined the Harris campaign, took to social media to criticize Trump’s move. “Now, he seems only comfortable in a cocoon, asking his happy place Fox to host a Trump rally and call it a debate. Maybe he can only handle debating someone his own age,"" Plouffe wrote, highlighting the age difference between Trump, 78, and Harris, 59.","Former President Donald Trump announced that he was dropping out of an ABC News debate scheduled for September 10.

I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,"" Emhoff said.The affair was disclosed to President Biden’s vetting committee four years ago before he chose Harris as his running mate on the 2020 ticket, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.The source also mentioned that Emhoff informed Harris about the affair long before they got married, and that the relationship ended prior to Emhoff starting to date Harris.However, when approached by the Daily Mail, Naylor did not refute the affair or pregnancy claims and expressed her unease about the situation.""I'm kind of freaked out right now,"" she reportedly said.Efforts to reach Naylor for further comments on Saturday were unsuccessful.Doug Emhoff, 59, and his movie producer ex-wife divorced in 2009, reportedly following the discovery of the affair. The couple has a son, Cole, 29, and a daughter, Ella, who is a 25-year-old model and fashion designer.

However, Biden's campaign recently suggested that the Sun Belt and North Carolina appeared increasingly difficult to secure.Harris's leadership has reinvigorated the campaign, leading to increased energy, funding, and enthusiasm. This renewed vigor is reflected in polling data, which shows her either even with or ahead of Donald Trumpin some key battleground states.Since Biden endorsed Harris on July 21, an additional 200,000 volunteers have joined her campaign. Additionally, over 350,000 supporters participated in their first phone bank, rally, or other campaign activity, representing a 350% increase in event attendees, according to Kanninen.Her campaign announced on Friday that it raised $310 million in July, driven largely by small-dollar donations.

The nanny, identified as Najen Naylor , 47, was employed at the same private school attended by Emhoff's children.According to The Daily Mail, Emhoff allegedly had an affair with Naylor, who was also working as the family's nanny, while he was still married to his ex-wife Kerstin.A close friend of Naylor disclosed the affair and pregnancy to The Daily Mail but mentioned that Naylor did not keep the baby. When approached for comment, Naylor did not deny the affair or the pregnancy but said, ""I’m kind of freaked out right now.""Stacey Brooks, a friend who had twins around the same time, also refrained from denying the allegations but told the outlet she couldn't discuss the matter without Naylor's permission.The alleged extramarital affair is reportedly causing concern within Harris’ camp, particularly in light of recent political developments where polls suggest former President Donald Trump ’s advantage in battleground states is waning.Doug Emhoff, 59, and his movie producer ex-wife divorced in 2009, reportedly after she discovered the affair. The couple has a son, Cole, 29, and a daughter, Ella, who is a 25-year-old model and fashion designer.

The school's tuition fees range from $32,525 to $41,535. A mother who sent her children to the school and was aware of the affair described Naylor as ""a lovely person, a great teacher to my kids,"" while expressing distaste for Emhoff's actions.There are no birth records in Los Angeles County for a baby named ""Brook Naylor"" born in 2008 or 2009, nor exist any birth records for a baby with the last name ""Emhoff"" during those years. Emhoff, who is an advocate for abortion rights, remarked in May, ""This is an issue of fairness to women.""A friend close to Naylor who knew her around the time of the alleged affair denied the claims, asserting that Naylor was never pregnant. ""She was adorable; everyone loved her; she was the best teacher,"" the friend said. The friend added, ""Every parent wanted her to be the teacher for their kid. She was the perfect person. She came from a good family. She was not pregnant. There was no baby. I would know.""Another source mentioned that Naylor's move to New York had left the friend ""bummed,"" and while they hadn't been in touch recently, they had ""heard"" that Naylor now has two children and is happy.","Doug Emhoff, the husband of US vice president Kamala Harris, allegedly had an affair with the family nanny and got her pregnant while still married to his first wife.

Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, who addressed reporters alongside the party's secretary-general Omar Ayub Khan outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail where the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician is lodged since last August, said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has decided to expand the opposition alliance in a meeting with Imran Khan on Thursday, Geo News reported.Qaiser announced that the former ruling party would gather all opposition parties to run a powerful anti-government movement. He said that the party's forthcoming power show in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi was aimed at raising a ""strong voice"" for the release of the PTI founder and other detained leaders.""This country will only be governed in accordance with the law and the Constitution,"" Qaiser emphasised.During his address, Qaiser also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills.

Ayub blamed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for stopping the release of former first lady Bushra Bibi despite having no connections with the Toshakhana corruption case.The PTI secretary general demanded Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq to recuse themselves from hearing the PTI founder's cases, Geo News reported.The PTI believes he is being arrested in more cases at the behest of the powerful military establishment to make sure that he does not come out of jail.Khan was first arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a 190-million-pound corruption case.

However, Imran Khan's lawyer requested the IHC Chief Justice Amir Farooq to recuse himself from the case.He said that Farooq should not hear the case as Khan had registered a complaint against him in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). The lawyer called for the transfer of the case to another bench.Although Farooq rejected the request for recusal, he had to constitute a new bench as Justice Imtiaz went on summer vacation, and the previous bench was dissolved. The case has been moved to a separate division comprising Justices Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Arbab Muhammad Tahir.Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court's (LHC) Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi on Thursday overruled an objection to Bushra Bibi's petition against her arrest in the third Toshakhana case, according to Dawn report.The judge removed the registrar's office's objection to the maintainability of the petition and ordered that it be fixed for a hearing.

However, they were re-arrested in a new case with malicious intent, Dawn reported.It claimed that female officials assaulted and humiliated the petitioner during the arrest in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail. The petitioner stated that she was arrested without a warrant from the NAB and was imprisoned as an act of political victimisation.It requested the court to take action against the jail superintendent and the female officials involved in the alleged assault on the petitioner and declare Bushra Bibi's arrest illegal.Imran Khan (71), who served as Pakistan's Prime Minister from 2018 to 2022, has been incarcerated in Adiala Jail since August 2023 on multiple charges, including the Toshakhana case, the cypher case and the unlawful marriage case.

Protests erupted across Pakistan after Imran Khan was arrested on May 9, 2023.

He mentioned that UAE authorities have raised concerns about inappropriate behavior, including making videos of women in Dubai without their consent.He also pointed out a declining trend in overseas employment for Pakistani workers, attributing this to the lack of skills despite technological advancements and modernisation efforts.Mahmood suggested that countries like Bangladesh serve as a model for Pakistan in terms of skilled labour force and recommended that Pakistan should follow their example.""The governments of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait have expressed various concerns regarding overseas Pakistanis,"" Mahmood informed the committee.He also said that the Pakistani diaspora consists of 10.7 million individuals, primarily employed in Saudi Arabia, UAE, the US, UK, and Canada.Another issue brought to light was the presence of organised gangs of Pakistani beggars operating in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, having entered these countries as pilgrims. Mahmood noted that many individuals travel to Saudi Arabia on Umrah visas, with Saudi authorities reporting that 90 percent of beggars arrested in the country are Pakistani.Senator Nasir Abbas raised concerns about Pakistanis living illegally in Iraq and questioned whether the ministry could assist them, as they are often subjected to poor treatment.Senator Zeeshan Khanzada also pointed out that many Pakistanis living illegally in Italy often deny their nationality, while the Pakistani embassy recognises them as citizens. He urged the ministry to take a more proactive role in obtaining a clear understanding of the situation and extending help to stranded Pakistanis.In response to the committee's queries, Mahmood said, ""A lack of resources and skill development among Pakistani workers has led to their replacement by workers from other countries.""","The senate standing committee on overseas Pakistanis was informed that employers in the Gulf region prefer hiring workers from countries like Bangladesh over Pakistan due to the 'deplorable standards' of Pakistani labour.

Pakistan to launch new messaging app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-launch-new-messaging-app/articleshow/112152439.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has said it would “soon” launch a new messaging application , “Beep Pakistan”, which will initially be used for communication by govt employees and later made available to the general public.The announcement came as Pakistani users have been facing problems with WhatsApp , especially when sending and receiving media files. Digital rights advocates suspect that the country’s testing and deployment of an internet firewall , intended to stifle dissent and crack down on free speech, may be the cause of the disruption.“Beep Pakistan”, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication which says it will be launched “soon” among other government departments.“The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and telecommunication.When the plan was announced last year, the then IT minister, Syed Aminul Haque, described it as Pakistan’s alternative to WhatsApp.Now, govt is distancing itself from that comparison. “Any comparison to WhatsApp is misplaced as there is no intention to compete with any third-party platform,” Khwaja said, adding the purpose of this app is to protect privacy and data.Haque, who currently heads the National Assembly’s standing committee on IT, said govt plans to roll out the application to all its employees within the next 45 days. “Then we will see the situation and launch it for the public too,” he said. Unlike WhatsApp, the former IT minister said, “Beep’s data centre will be in Pakistan, ensuring 100% safety and security. Just as China has WeChat and America has WhatsApp, Pakistan now has its own app.”Pakistani authorities have long been concerned about WhatsApp’s security features, particularly after reports in Dec 2019 that at least two dozen senior officials were targeted by Pegasus, a spyware developed by an Israeli cybersecurity firm. At that time the Pakistan govt instructed all officials to avoid sharing sensitive and confidential documents over WhatsApp.When asked if WhatsApp would be banned in the country following Beep Pakistan’s public launch, Khwaja, the IT minister, denied any plans to block WhatsApp in the country. Haque said he was not in favour of a ban. “But since Beep Pakistan is safe and secure we wish it to be used in Pakistan and those who want to use WhatsApp can continue to use it,” he said.","“Beep Pakistan’, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication. “The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and tele communication.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112152447,imgsize-401505,width-400,resizemode-4/112152447.jpg"

They chanted against the government and called for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation. The protests have spread to include people from various backgrounds. Pro-government groups also held rallies in the city.According to the Prothom Alo newspaper, seven protesters were shot in Cumilla, eastern Bangladesh, when pro-government groups allegedly fired at them while they blocked a road.Thirty protesters were injured, although a ruling party leader denied their supporters attacked the protesters. TV stations reported many injuries across the country.The protests began last month against a quota system reserving 30% of government jobs for families of 1971 war veterans. Initially peaceful, the protests turned violent on July 15 when students clashed with police and ruling party activists at Dhaka University. Over 200 people have died, and thousands have been injured.Even after the Supreme Court reduced the quota to 5% on July 21, protests continued due to outrage over the violence . Authorities closed schools and universities, blocked internet access, and imposed a curfew, leading to 11,000 arrests. Internet service has since been restored, and banks and offices have reopened, but tensions remain high.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina offered to talk with student leaders on Saturday, but a coordinator refused on Facebook, saying they couldn't seek justice from a ""killer government."" Hasina promised to investigate the deaths and punish those responsible. The protests have become a major challenge for her, having returned to power for a fourth term in January after an election boycotted by her main opponents.Initially, the students had a nine-point demand, including a public apology from Hasina and the release of arrested students. On Saturday, they announced a single demand: Hasina's resignation. They also called for a ""non-cooperation"" movement, urging people not to pay taxes or utility bills and to keep factories and offices closed. The ruling party's general secretary said their supporters would demonstrate on Sunday.Hasina and her ministers blamed the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the now-banned Jamaat-e-Islami party for infiltrating the protests and inciting violence. Both parties denied the allegations. The opposition party's secretary-general said they would continue supporting the protesters.","Thousands of protesters gathered in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, on Saturday.
