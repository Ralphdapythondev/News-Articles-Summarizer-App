SYDNEY: New Zealand said on Tuesday it would send 41 more military personnel to the United Nations mission along the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea , as it looks to step up its role in international missions.

Defence minister Judith Collins said the decision to increase New Zealand's military presence from 12 to as many as 53 at the UN Command Security Battalion reflected its commitment to support peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.

The mandate for the longstanding deployment to South Korea has been extended until September 2026, Collins said.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has been working to increase New Zealand's international engagement since taking office last year, including sending a maritime security team to the Red Sea.

Baltimore Port shipping channel reopens 11 weeks after bridge collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-port-shipping-channel-reopens-11-weeks-after-bridge-collapse/articleshow/110887855.cms,"Explosive charges are detonated to bring down collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge resting on container ship Dali (AP file photo)

NEW DELHI: Baltimore's main shipping channel has reopened to its original depth and width following the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge . The reopening follows an extensive cleanup effort , during which crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.

The US Army Corps of Engineers certified the riverbed as safe for transit on Monday, confirming that the Fort McHenry Federal Channel has been restored to its original dimensions of 700 feet wide and 50 feet deep. This allows for two-way traffic and removes the additional safety requirements that had been in place due to the temporarily reduced channel width.

The channel had been obstructed by the wreckage of the bridge, which collapsed after a container ship, the Dali , lost power and crashed into one of bridge's supporting columns. The incident resulted in the deaths of six members of a roadwork crew, all of whom were Latino immigrants working an overnight shift to fill potholes on the bridge.

The operation involved more than 1,500 individual responders and 500 specialists from around the world, utilizing a fleet of boats. The effort included 56 federal, state, and local agencies. Surveying and removal of steel at and below the 50-foot mud-line will continue to ensure future dredging operations are not impacted, with wreckage transported to Sparrows Point for further processing.

In April, the FBI opened a criminal investigation into the collapse. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the Dali had lost electrical power several times before the crash, including experiencing a blackout during in-port maintenance and shortly before the collision. Maryland estimates it will cost $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion to rebuild the bridge, with completion anticipated by fall 2028.

Jurors in Hunter Biden’s gun trial begin deliberating whether he’s guilty of federal firearm charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jurors-in-hunter-bidens-gun-trial-begin-deliberating-whether-hes-guilty-of-federal-firearm-charges/articleshow/110887170.cms,"WILMINGTON: Jurors in Hunter Biden ’s gun trial began deliberating Monday whether the president’s son is guilty of federal firearms charges over a revolver he bought in 2018 when prosecutors say he was addicted to crack cocaine.He's charged with three felonies in the case that has laid bare some of the darkest moments of his drug-fueled past. Prosecutors have used testimony from former romantic partners, personal text messages and photos of Hunter Biden with drug paraphernalia or partially clothed to make the case that he broke the law.“No one is above the law,” prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors in his closing argument as first lady Jill Biden watched from the front row of the Wilmington, Delaware, courtroom.Jurors deliberated for less than an hour before leaving the courthouse for the day. Deliberations were to resume Tuesday morning.President Joe Biden's son has publicly detailed his struggle with a crack cocaine addiction before getting sober more than five years ago. But the defense sought to show that that he did not consider himself an “addict” when he bought the gun and checked “no” on the form that asked whether he was “an unlawful user"" of drugs or addicted to them.The case has pitted Hunter Biden against his father's Justice Department in the midst of the Democratic president's reelection campaign. The charges were brought by special counsel David Weiss, who was nominated by Republican former President Donald Trump to be U.S. attorney for Delaware and led the yearslong investigation.Before the case went to the jury, the prosecutor urged jurors to focus on the “overwhelming” evidence against Hunter Biden and pay no mind to members of the president's family sitting in the courtroom.“All of this is not evidence,” Wise said, extending his hand and directing the jury to look at the gallery. “People sitting in the gallery are not evidence.”Jill Biden and other family members left the courthouse shortly after deliberations began. The first lady sat through most of the trial, missing only one day last week to attend D-Day anniversary events with the president in France. At one point Monday, Hunter Biden leaned over a railing to whisper in his mother’s ear.Defense attorney Abbe Lowell told jurors in his closing argument that prosecutors had failed to prove their case. Lowell said the his client may have a famous last name, but he is still presumed innocent until proven guilty like any other defendant.“With my last breath in this case, I ask for the only verdict that will hold the prosecutors to what the law requires of them"" — a verdict of not guilty, Lowell said.Hunter Biden's lawyers have suggested he was trying to turn his life around at the time of the gun purchase, having completed a detoxification and rehabilitation program at the end of August 2018. The defense called three witnesses, including Hunter's daughter Naomi, who told jurors that her father seemed be improving in the weeks before he bought the gun.Closing arguments came shortly after the defense rested its case without calling Hunter Biden to the witness stand. Biden didn't elaborate on his decision when he told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika that he was waiving his right to testify , according to a transcript of the sidebar discussion at the bench.Hunter Biden smiled as he chatted with members of his defense team and flashed a thumbs-up sign to a supporter in the gallery after the final witness — an FBI agent called by prosecutors in their rebuttal case.The trial has put a spotlight on a turbulent time in Hunter Biden's life after the 2015 death of his brother, Beau, from brain cancer. The proceedings have played out in the president’s home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington, and Beau Biden was the state's attorney general.Hunter Biden's ex-wife and two former girlfriends testified for prosecutors about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. One woman, who met Hunter Biden in 2017 at a strip club where she worked, described him smoking crack every 20 minutes or so while she stayed with him at a hotel.Jurors have also heard him describe at length his descent into addiction through audio excerpts played in court of his 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things."" The book, written after he got sober, covers the period he had the gun but doesn’t mention it specifically.A key witness for prosecutors was Beau’s widow, Hallie, who had a brief, troubled relationship with Hunter after his brother's death. She found the unloaded gun in Hunter’s truck on Oct. 23, 2018, panicked and tossed it into a garbage can at a grocery store in Wilmington, where a man seeking recyclables inadvertently fished it out of the trash.The prosecutor pointed to text messages he said show Hunter trying to make drug deals in the days around the gun purchase. In one message, Hunter told Hallie he was smoking crack. “That’s my truth,” Hunter wrote.“Take the defendant’s word for it. That’s his truth,” Wise said. He urged jurors to reject the defense's suggestion that Hunter did not really mean what he was texting at the time and was simply trying to avoid being with Hallie.“You don’t leave your common sense behind when you come into that jury box,” Wise said.The defense told jurors that there was no actual witness to drug use by Hunter during the 11 days that he had the gun. Lowell also sought to discredit testimony from Hallie and another ex-girlfriend. He told jurors to consider their testimony “with great care and caution,” noting that they were given immunity agreements in exchange for taking the witness stand for prosecutors.Joe Biden said last week that he would accept the jury’s verdict and ruled out a presidential pardon for his son. After flying back from France, the president was at his home in Wilmington for the day and was expected in Washington in the evening for a Juneteenth concert. He was scheduled to travel to Italy later this week for the Group of Seven leaders conference.Last summer, it looked as if Hunter Biden would avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether, but a deal with prosecutors imploded after the judge, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, raised concerns about it. Hunter Biden also faces a trial scheduled for September on felony charges alleging he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.If convicted in the gun case, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.","Hunter Biden is charged with three felonies in the case that has laid bare some of the darkest moments of his drug-fueled past.

Efforts on for centrist alliance amid far-right surge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/efforts-on-for-centrist-alliance-amid-far-right-surge/articleshow/110886845.cms,"European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen (AFP image)

Brussels: European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen began trying to piece together a coalition on Monday after the far right surged in a European Parliament election.

Von der Leyen, the German president of the EU's powerful executive body, emerged strengthened from the four-day election across 27 countries, as her centre-right European People's Party (EPP) gained seats.

But to secure a second five-year term, von der Leyen needs the support of a majority of the EU's national parties and a working majority in the European Parliament. Provisional results on Monday gave the main parties that backed von der Leyen last time - the EPP, socialists and liberals - a total of 402 seats in the 720-member chamber. But that is regarded as too tight a majority for comfort. So von der Leyen may also reach out to the Greens, who suffered heavy losses, and Italy's nationalist PM Giorgia Meloni, with whom she has worked closely.

She said she aims to work with those who are ""pro-European, pro-Ukraine and pro-rule of law"" - a description she said applies to Meloni's Brothers of Italy but not to some other far-right parties.

According to a poll conducted by Swg and published by La7, Meloni's right-wing Brothers of Italy party was expected to emerge as the clear winner, securing between 27% and 31% of the vote, a significant increase from the mere 6% it obtained in 2019.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni delivers her speech during at an electoral rally.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is set to solidify her power after winning the vote in Italy for the European Parliament as far-right parties gained across the union.

Meloni’s right-wing Brothers of Italy party was on course to be the winner, according to a poll by Swg, published by La7, with the party expected to gain 27% to 31% compared to just over 6% in 2019.

According to the poll, the immediate runner-up was the left-wing Democratic Party, getting 21.5% to 25.5% of the vote, highlighting polarization between Italy’s two main political parties.

Matteo Salvini’s League and Antonio Tajani’s Forza Italia, founded by the late Silvio Berlusconi, both coalition partners in Meloni’s government, were projected to gain just under 10%.

Meloni’s projected victory is part of a slew of positive results for right-wing parties in Europe, led by France and Germany. Her position will be key in deciding vital alliances in the European Parliament — and selecting the successor to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is running to retain her job.

Sunday night’s victory for Meloni is a significant vote of mid-term confidence from Italians, who rocketed her party to first place in the 2022 election with 26% of votes. In a bid to get more votes and have Italians rally around her persona, Meloni decided to top her party’s lists in the election even if she has no intention of leaving her job in Rome, telling them to simply vote for “Giorgia.”

NEW DELHI: Ukrainian forces for the first time targeted a state-of-the-art Russian Su-57 fighter jet stationed at an air base within Russia's borders, claimed Ukraine 's GUR defense intelligence agency on Sunday, accompanied by satellite images to support their claim.In a Telegram post, the GUR did not disclose the method used to hit the Su-57 or identify the specific Ukrainian military unit responsible.A notable Russian pro-war military blogger, known as Fighterbomber , affirmed that the strike on the Su-57 did indeed occur. The blogger suggested that the jet was hit by a drone.The GUR stated that the aircraft was positioned at the Akhtubinsk airfield .

Both nations regularly carry out strikes into each other's territories using missiles and drones.Due to a lack of an extensive missile arsenal like Moscow's, Ukraine has focused on developing long-range drones to target deep into Russian territory.Russian blogger Fighterbomber said the fighter jet was damaged by shrapnel. He noted that the aircraft was currently undergoing assessment to determine if it can be repaired.He added that if deemed irreparable, this would mark the first combat loss of a Su-57.Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti 's military correspondent, Alexander Kharchenko, posted a cryptic message regarding the incident. He didn't explicitly acknowledge the strike but criticized the absence of hangars to safeguard military aircraft.Although the Su-57 is promoted as a Russian fifth-generation fighter meant to rival its U.S. counterpart, its development has faced delays and a crash in 2019. Per its manufacturer, the serial production of the aircraft commenced in 2022.","Ukrainian forces for the first time targeted a state-of-the-art Russian Su-57 fighter jet stationed at an air base within Russia's borders, claimed Ukraine's GUR defense intelligence agency.

Baltimore shipping channel fully reopens after bridge collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-shipping-channel-fully-reopens-after-bridge-collapse/articleshow/110888632.cms,"BALTIMORE: The main shipping channel into Baltimore’s port has fully reopened to its original depth and width following the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge , which blocked most maritime traffic into the harbor.Officials announced the full reopening in a news release Monday evening. It comes after a massive cleanup effort as crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.The channel was blocked by wreckage of the fallen bridge, which collapsed after a container ship lost power and crashed into one of its supporting columns, sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths. All of the victims were Latino immigrants working an overnight shift to fill potholes on the bridge.The Port of Baltimore , which processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country, was effectively closed for several weeks while the wreckage was removed. Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks.On May 20, the wayward cargo ship Dali was refloated and guided back to port. The vessel had been stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow.After the Dali was moved, crews opened a channel that was 50 feet (15 meters) deep and 400 feet (122 meters) wide. The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet (213 meters) wide, which means two-way traffic can resume, officials said. They said other additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width.Thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse, prompting local and state officials to prioritize reopening the port and restoring its traffic to normal capacity in hopes of easing the economic ripple effects .The announcement Monday means the commerce that depends on the busy port can begin ramping back up.Officials said a total of 56 federal, state and local agencies participated in the salvage operations, including about 500 specialists from around the world who operated a fleet of 18 barges, 22 tugboats, 13 floating cranes, 10 excavators and four survey boats.“I cannot overstate how proud I am of our team,” said Col. Estee Pinchasin, Baltimore district commander for the Army Corps of Engineers. “It was incredible seeing so many people from different parts of our government, from around our country and all over the world, come together in the Unified Command and accomplish so much in this amount of time.”In a statement Monday, Pinchasin also acknowledged the loss of the victims’ families.“Not a day went by that we didn’t think about all of them, and that kept us going,” she said.The Dali lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka in the early hours of March 26. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found it experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the collapse.Officials have said they hope to rebuild the bridge by 2028.","The main shipping channel into Baltimore’s port has fully reopened to its original depth and width.

Trump completes mandatory presentencing interview in Hush money case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-completes-mandatory-presentencing-interview-ahead-of-sentencing-in-hush-money-case/articleshow/110887178.cms,"(With AP inputs)

NEW DELHI: Donald Trump underwent a mandatory presentencing interview on Monday, which concluded after less than 30 minutes of questioning. Trump was interviewed by a New York City probation officer to prepare a report for Judge Juan M Merchan ahead of Trump's July 11 sentencing in his hush money criminal case .This report will assist the judge in determining Trump's punishment following his May 30 felony conviction for falsifying business records related to a potential sex scandal. The judge has a range of options for punishment, from probation and community service to up to four years in prison.Trump, who did not testify during his trial, attended the probation interview via video conference from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. His lawyer, Todd Blanche, was present during the interview. This arrangement has led to complaints of special treatment, but city officials maintain that it is not unusual.Typically, convicted individuals in New York must meet probation officials in person for their presentence interviews and are not allowed to have their lawyers present. However, after Blanche's objections, Judge Merchan allowed him to attend Trump's interview.Public defenders in the city have criticized the special arrangements made for Trump and have called for equal treatment for all convicted individuals. They argued that all defendants should be allowed counsel during their probation interviews, not just those with significant financial resources.Presentence reports include a defendant’s personal history, criminal record, employment details, and any family obligations. These reports, prepared by probation officers, social workers, or psychologists, also offer defendants a chance to explain why they believe they deserve a lighter sentence.Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records stems from efforts to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.Trump, who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, plans to appeal his conviction but must wait until after sentencing. He maintained his innocence and claimed the case aims to damage his chances of regaining the presidency.",Donald Trump underwent a mandatory presentencing interview on Monday.

Signing up together: Parents in US are pledging to keep kids phone-free,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/signing-up-together-parents-in-us-are-pledging-to-keep-kids-phone-free/articleshow/110886377.cms,"Kiley DeMarco recently attended Safety Night at her children's public elementary school on Long Island in New York. As she walked around different booths learning about how to protect her children, one station caught her eye: A parent was asking other parents to take a pledge not to give their children smartphones until the end of eighth grade.DeMarco has two children, one in kindergarten and one in first grade. Like many parents, she has already read books and research arguing that smartphones, and the social media apps on them, drastically increase anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts in teenagers. Asking parents in the same school to commit to holding back phones until a certain age made sense to her. ""It means there is no gray area,"" she said. ""There is a clear grade level when they get the phone."" The idea of acting collectively made her feel more confident that she could keep her commitment. ""Down the road, when my kids start begging for phones, we can say we signed this pledge and we are sticking to it,"" she said.In schools and communities across the country, parents are signing documents pledging not to give their children smartphones until after middle school. The idea, organisers say, is that if parents take action together, their children are less likely to feel isolated because they aren't the only ones without TikTok in their pockets.Considering the prevalence of smartphone use among young people, it's a bold step: Research shows that half of children in the US own cellphones by age 11 - roughly fifth or sixth grade. According to Zach Rausch, an associate research scientist at New York University who studies child and adolescent mental health, case-by-case decisions not to have a smartphone or social media can be ""risky"" for individual children. ""They are saying, 'I might be banished from all my friends and my social network',"" he said. ""But if the parents collectively work together, it will reduce a lot of conflict. It won't be, 'My friend has this, but I don't.'""Many groups of parents are drawing on a playbook created by 'Wait Until 8th', an organisation that helps parents collect no-phone pledges from their children's classes at school. Fifty-four pledges in 16 states were created in April alone.But there has been resistance too. There are parents who feel the need to be in touch with their children, especially since America witnesses school attacks. To address those concerns, the organisation includes a list of devices on its website that allow parents to text their children but don't allow access to social media. If smartphones are off the table, dumber devices may be the solution, it says.","In schools and communities across the country, parents are signing documents pledging not to give their children smartphones until after middle school.

It was not clear what the US might offer Hamas in exchange, according to the report, which cited two current and two former US officials.

The US says Hamas is holding five Americans who were taken hostage in the group's Oct. 7 incursion inside Israel, which prompted Israel to retaliate. Officials are hoping to recover the bodies of three other Americans who were killed that day, NBC reported.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken, asked about the report as he left Cairo, said, ""The best way, the most effective way to get everyone home, including the American hostages, is through this proposal, is through the ceasefire deal that's on the table right now.""

Any unilateral talks would be conducted through Qatari negotiators and would not involve Israel, the unidentified officials, who have all been briefed on the negotiations, told NBC. They said Hamas would have an incentive to reach such a deal with Washington as it would strain US-Israel ties further and add pressure on Israeli PM Netanyahu, who has been criticised for not doing more to get hostages out.

The class president welcomed the crowd. Then the principal, looking out at the clouds, declared all the students graduates and told those in attendance to find shelter immediately. ""The sky turned pea green, horrible clouds rolled in, and sirens started going off,"" said Nuala Murray South, one of the graduates. Sterling Crim, another graduate, grabbed the hand of his girlfriend and dragged her under the bleachers next to the brick wall of a concession stand. The tornado never materialised. But the day - and the rite - were ruined.

They unceremoniously picked up their diplomas from the high school later. But long after going off to college, starting careers and families, many harboured a hope that they would eventually cross the stage.

South, Crim and about 200 of their fellow classmates or relatives of those who died got a commencement redo Saturday.

The desire for a commencement ceremony had become a running theme at alumni reunions for the Moore High School class of 1974. The former classmates debated the idea on social media. Finally, last year, a former student, Mike Wilson, who works as a sports announcer at the school, broached the school administration with the idea of a commencement timed with the class's 50th reunion . ""The older you get, you just look back and think you've missed out on something,"" Wilson said, adding that the administration was quick to offer a full ceremony in the high school auditorium, complete with a processional to the music of Edward Elgar's ""Pomp and Circumstance"" march and crossing the stage for their diplomas.

","The event was to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the opening day of the University of Texas at Austin's football stadium.

And this comes from none other than Pranay Vaddi, special assistant to Joe Biden, the US president.Vaddi, of Andhra origin, is senior director for arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation at the National Security Council of the US.As recent as June 7, he told a meeting of the US Arms Control Association in Washington that keeping in view of the upgrades by Russia, China, and North Korea to their nuclear capabilities, “... we (US) are modernizing each leg of our nuclear triad , updating our nuclear command, control, and communication systems, and investing in our nuclear enterprise — to ensure that we can sustain and, if necessary, enhance our capabilities and posture.”He said that as part of the nuclear modernization programme, the US is pursuing the B61-13 gravity bomb to provide additional capability against certain harder and large-area military targets.The B61-13 is a thermonuclear gravity bomb designed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.Pointing that the B61-13 is an example of a qualitative improvement to the US nuclear arsenal, Vaddi said that “ ... it will enhance deterrence without increasing overall numbers.”According to him, this will allow the US to move beyond the outdated megaton-class B83-1 which is being retired.In addition, the life of certain Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines is being extended to provide additional margin during transition from legacy to modern capabilities across the triad, he stated.“Russia, the PRC (People’s Republic Of China), and North Korea are all expanding and diversifying their nuclear arsenals at a breakneck pace, showing little or no interest in arms control,” he said.“Those three, together with Iran, are increasingly cooperating and coordinating with each other — in ways that run counter to peace and stability, threaten the United States, our allies and our partners, and exacerbate regional tension,” he said.On account of this scenario “... we will have no choice but to adjust our posture and capabilities to preserve deterrence and stability.”“We may reach a point in the coming years where an increase from current deployed numbers is required and we need to be fully prepared to execute if the President makes that decision,” he stated, adding, “If that day does come, it will result from a determination that more nuclear weapons are required to deter our adversaries and protect the American people and our allies and partners.”Vaddi said the reality is that further enhancing US capabilities and posture is incredibly important to rejuvenating strategic arms control .","Vaddi, of Andhra origin, is senior director for arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation at the National Security Council of the US.

Trump did not say when the meeting would take place.In the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president, a Manhattan jury last month found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up his former lawyer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says they had a decade earlier.Trump denies the encounter and has vowed to appeal the verdict after his July 11 sentencing hearing before Justice Juan Merchan. Trump has called the charges, brought by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a partisan attempt to interfere with his campaign.A probation officer's report is intended to give the sentencing judge a holistic view of a defendant's life circumstances and background to help decide whether a jail sentence or an alternative like probation is appropriate, said Duncan Levin, a New York defense lawyer and former Manhattan prosecutor.In a typical interview, the officer will ask defendants about their family, their childhood circumstances, their immigration status, and any drug use to compile a report to give judges context that may not have come out earlier in the case.Such details are less relevant in this case because Trump's biographical details are already widely known, Levin said.""The judge is already highly educated as to who this particular defendant is,"" Levin said.The probation officer's recommendation is just one factor that judges consider in determining a sentence for criminal defendants. Prosecutors and defense lawyers also suggest sentences.Merchan on Friday signed an order allowing Trump's defense lawyer Todd Blanche to be present during the interview. That is common, Levin said.For defendants convicted of felony falsifying business records in the past, punishments like probation or fines are most common - but jail sentences are not unprecedented.One factor that Merchan may consider is Trump's decision to take his case to trial. While any criminal defendant has the right to do so, judges often look favorably on people who admit culpability and express remorse.Trump also faces three other criminal cases stemming from efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden and his handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in 2021. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases, none of which are likely to reach trial before the Nov. 5 election.",Donald Trump will be interviewed by a probation officer ahead of his sentencing next month.

NEW DELHI: A disturbing incident occurred during Brooklyn Pride in Park Slope on Saturday night, when millionaire investment banker Jonathan Kaye allegedly assaulted a woman on the street. The shocking act was captured on video, showing Kaye delivering a forceful overhand right punch to the woman's face, sending her crashing to the pavement.

The video, which has garnered nearly 5 million views on social media , shows the woman covering her injured face as she crumpled to the ground. Nearby, another presumably injured person lay on the pavement. The crowd of partygoers reacted in horror to the violent scene.

Social media users quickly identified the assailant as Jonathan Kaye, a managing director at Moelis & Co., a New York-based investment bank. ""We have become aware that one of our employees was involved in a serious incident in Brooklyn on June 8. We take this matter very seriously and are conducting an investigation,"" a spokesperson for Moelis & Co. stated. However, the company did not confirm whether Kaye was the employee in question or if he faced any disciplinary action.

Kaye, who oversees the Global Business Services franchise at Moelis & Co, declined to comment when contacted by The Post. The NYPD has yet to release any information regarding the assault .

The video does not reveal the moments leading up to the incident, but it does show the assailant, believed to be Kaye, walking away with a jacket streaked with liquid. ""She f–king threw s–t all over me,"" Kaye can be heard saying in the footage. Onlookers condemned the attacker, calling him an “asshole” and a “horrible person.”

Reports indicate that the woman suffered a broken nose and another person had their arm injured. The alleged attacker, Kaye, resides in a luxurious four-bedroom townhouse in Park Slope valued at over $4 million, just three blocks away from Ginger’s Bar, one of Brooklyn's last remaining lesbian bars.

The assault took place as thousands gathered in Park Slope to celebrate the 28th annual Brooklyn Pride Multicultural Festival, a day-long event featuring a 5K run and a parade along Fifth Avenue.","A disturbing incident occurred during Brooklyn Pride in Park Slope on Saturday night.

NEW DELHI: In a shocking turn of events, three shark attacks occurred within a single day on the same stretch of coastline in Florida's panhandle, leaving one woman severely injured and two teenage girls wounded. The 45-year-old woman suffered critical injuries, resulting in the amputation of part of her left arm, while the teens, aged 15 and 17, were also hurt, with one sustaining significant injuries to her upper leg and hand.

The Walton County sheriff's office has temporarily closed the beaches and is actively patrolling the waters following the incidents. They have since reopened but urge swimmers to remain cautious and aware of their surroundings at all times. The department said in a Facebook post, ""Deputies spotted a 14-foot hammerhead east of South County Highway 395 in Santa Rosa Beach this morning from the boat — which is NOT uncommon. We want to reiterate that sharks are always present in the Gulf. Swimmers and beachgoers should be cautious when swimming and be aware of their surroundings at all times.""

Authorities have posted red and purple flags on the beach to warn swimmers of the high hazard and dangerous marine life. In another Facebook post, the sheriff's office reminded visitors, ""remember, we are guests in the Gulf [of Mexico].""

Two doctors, Ryan Forbess and Mohammad Ali, who were vacationing together, happened to be in the water during the attacks and provided potentially life-saving care to the wounded girl. They worked alongside other EMTs and trauma nurses who were in the area to help the injured victim. Forbess remarked, ""It was amazing. Kind of just … it was God's will that everyone was there to help at the same time.""

Walton County Sheriff Michael A Adkinson, Jr emphasized the rarity of such incidents, saying, ""This is an anomaly … everything from it being three victims, to where it's at. All we can do is respond, control, and mitigate what we can."" The last shark attack in the county was reported in 2021, with the last fatal attack occurring in 2005.

In response, Israel launched an assault on the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said in its Sunday update, and reduced the enclave to a wasteland.Israeli forces rescued four hostages held by Hamas since October in a raid in Gaza on Saturday, during which 274 Palestinians were killed, according to Gaza's health ministry.Blinken's trip comes after Israeli minister Benny Gantz announced his resignation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's emergency government on Sunday, withdrawing the only centrist power in the embattled leader's otherwise far-right coalition during the war in Gaza.Blinken is expected to meet with Gantz on Tuesday, a senior State Department official said.The departure of Gantz's centrist party will not pose an immediate threat to the government. But it could have a serious impact nonetheless, leaving Netanyahu reliant on hardliners, with no end in sight to the war and a possible escalation in fighting with Lebanese Hezbollah.Blinken has previously met with Gantz in visits to Israel.The conflict between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah is dangerously poised after more than eight months of fighting triggered by the Gaza war, with hostilities escalating and both sides signaling a readiness for a bigger confrontation.Blinken during this week's trip will discuss with partners the need to reach a ceasefire agreement that secures the release of all hostages, as well as the need to prevent the conflict from escalating further, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement on Friday.He will emphasize the importance of Hamas accepting the proposal on the table, Miller added.Ceasefire talks have intensified since Biden's speech and CIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the plan.Biden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, but there has been only one, week-long truce, in November.",US Secretary of State Antony Blinken landed in Egypt on Monday at a critical time.

Gen Z is turning away from military service in record numbers; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gen-z-is-turning-away-from-military-service-in-record-numbers-heres-why/articleshow/110863816.cms,"Enter the 'anxious generation'

Waning national pride

The moral imperative

So how do we boost recruitment?

Only 80% of the 69,000 personnel needed to meet future challenges have signed up. The government recently announced recruitment will be opened up to some foreign citizens to try to fill this gap.Not only is the Australian military failing to achieve planned growth, it is actually shrinking, as defence chief general Angus Campbell told a Senate inquiry in February.There are two fundamental reasons for the current recruitment impasse.One is economic - low unemployment and a perception of better opportunities, work conditions and future prospects in the private sector.The other reason is cultural: a declining willingness of Gen Z to identify with - and fight to defend - their nation.Either way, the key to the recruitment crisis lies in understanding the motivations of this generation, the main pool of potential recruits today.We recently interviewed 19 serving Australian soldiers from a range of demographics (two were Gen Z) and across military branches in a study funded by the Australian Defence ForceWe wanted to find out what makes Gen Z recruits tick, and what the force might do to persuade more of them to serve their country.Researchers study every new generation as a guide to the future, from the baby boomers to Generation X (like the authors of this article), and millennials.None is more distinctive than generation Z, or Zoomers - people born roughly between 1997 and 2008.They are the first generation to grow up with smartphones and social media. In his current bestseller, The Anxious Generation, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt outlines the cataclysmal effect: he claims a large increase in depression and anxiety in young people is the direct effect of unsupervised social media use during adolescence.Zoomers' mental health is a barrier to service, as US Marine Corps Lieutenant Matthew Weiss spells out in his book on Gen Z military recruitment.A military career can be detrimental to psychological wellbeing, as Australia's Royal Commission into Veteran Suicide has demonstrated. The force's rigorous mental health entry standards may have reinforced this perception.The soldiers we spoke to said mental health is an issue for recruitment. On one hand, they agreed that service is mentally challenging, and that younger soldiers are more psychologically vulnerable. On the other hand, interviewees said the force's mental health support has been improving. This is a step in the right direction - it may well be that media coverage of veterans' mental health issues worries Zoomers considering enlistment.Weiss argues private sector jobs (and money) afford much more online currency than military service . The respondents in our interviews agreed younger recruits were very savvy about pay and conditions.But there may be another motivator: as shadow defence minister Andrew Hastie recently told the ABC: ""People who join the defence force don't just do it for economic reasons, they do it because they love their country.""This means if love of country falls from generation to generation, military recruitment falls too. Weiss suggests in the United States, low patriotism partly explains Gen Z's reluctance to enlist.Our interviewees said traditional nationalism played only a modest role for enlisting for young people. They thought a lesser sense of obligation and service is one reason.Another is the fact that the black-and-white picture of ""my country right or wrong"" has been muddied following media coverage of alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan.The evidence confirms waning national pride among young Australians. We analysed publicly available data from the World Values Survey, a wide-ranging poll of people's values around the globe conducted since 1981.It shows in 1981, 70.3% of Australians were ""very proud"" of their nationality. This fell to 60.8 per cent in 2018, the first year to feature Gen Z members in the survey.That year, only 41.6% of twentysomethings (including some millennials) were very proud Australians - the lowest proportion of any Australian age group in any year since the survey began.All else being equal, older adults tend to be more nationalistic, as surveys in different periods and countries show. But the nationalism gap between old and young has opened up further with Gen Z.According to the survey data, in 1981, 69% of Australians in their twenties were willing to fight for their country. This was a slightly greater proportion than the 65% of over-70s. By 2018, this was reversed, with only 44% of Australians in their twenties willing to fight, compared with 59% of over-70s.Our interviewees suggested that if nationalist values motivate Zoomers, this is only in terms of ""doing the right thing"". This offers an alternative opportunity for recruiters: the changing role of the military towards peacekeeping and disaster relief makes defence attractive to those with humanitarian values.Zoomers fall into this category. Research shows, and our interviewees agreed, that Gen Z care about the environment, diversity, equity and inclusion.This is reflected by their attitudes to work. Zoomers want a calling and not just a career (let alone merely a job). According to our interviewees, young recruits place greater importance on the intrinsic aspects of work, like learning skills, experiencing adventure and challenges.Our own and other research suggests Gen Z is strongly motivated by things that support their own growth and wellbeing, both materially and spiritually, rather than service toward others. Researchers label these ""pro-self"" motivations.Zoomers may be hard to recruit, especially given the increasing war for talent, but they have a great deal to offer the military. They may be the most success-orientated among recent generations. They have an unprecedented ability to handle digital technologies that are becoming increasingly important in the military.The inaugural National Defence Strategy unveiled in April has conceded ""the need for a fundamental transformation of defence's recruitment and retention system"".Many of the proposals to raise military recruitment in Australia are general.The government recently raised pay and bonuses in the defence force, for example. Other measures include making the recruitment process easier, making military service an opt-out system, reducing medical requirements, or increasing the maximum recruitment age and galvanising junior military leaders to change outdated traditions that harm recruitment.Our research suggests building a force that appeals to Gen Z's social values and intrinsic motivations is the way forward. Recruitment strategies need to be tailored.","Only 80% of the 69,000 personnel needed to meet future challenges have signed up.

Blinken returns to Mideast as Israel politics scramble push for truce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blinken-returns-to-mideast-as-israel-politics-scramble-push-for-truce/articleshow/110858490.cms,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was heading back to the Middle East on Monday to push a ceasefire plan , but Israeli politics and silence from Hamas raised further questions on whether he can succeed.The top US diplomat, paying his eighth visit to the region since war broke out, was set to start the trip in Egypt and head later Monday to Israel Blinken is scheduled to hold closed-door talks first in Cairo with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a key US partner in peace efforts, and later in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Blinken planned the visit to push forward a proposal announced on May 31 by President Joe Biden, who has stepped up efforts to end a war that has taken a mounting toll on civilians and alienated parts of his base ahead of November elections.But Hamas, which opened the war with a massive October 7 attack on Israel that triggered a relentless retaliatory campaign, has not formally responded.And while Biden has described his plan as coming from Israel, the resignation on Sunday of a key centrist, Benny Gantz, from Netanyahu's war cabinet throws a new wild card on US diplomatic efforts.Gantz, a former general who leads in polls to replace Netanyahu if new elections are called, protested that the prime minister had not made the hard decisions to enable ""real victory"", including by thinking out a post-war plan for Gaza.Gantz has cast himself as a smoother partner for the United States than Netanyahu, a veteran of political squabbles with Israel's vital ally. Biden in recent weeks suspended a shipment of weapons to Israel and accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war to stay in power, an assertion on which he backtracked.Gantz defied Netanyahu by visiting Washington on his own in March and has regularly met in Israel with Blinken, although a meeting on the latest trip was not immediately announced.- Border crossing dilemma -The short-term effect of Gantz leaving the war cabinet could be removing a counter-balance to Netanyahu's far-right allies, who abhor any compromise and have threatened to quit if Israel accepts the ceasefire plan.Israel also showed Saturday it has more tools than diplomacy to free hostages -- its key priority -- with an operation that freed four Israeli captives and which Palestinian officials say killed 274 other people.Overall Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 37,084 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, also mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Under the plan laid out by Biden, Israel would withdraw from Gaza population centres and Hamas would free hostages. The ceasefire would last an initial six weeks, with the ceasefire extended as negotiators seek a permanent end to hostilities.Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, said Sunday it was difficult to say how the rescue operation would affect negotiations on a ceasefire.""If Hamas came and said yes to the deal on the table, there would be an end to the need for these kinds of operations, because the hostages would be coming out peacefully and not through military actions,"" Sullivan told ABC News.In Egypt, Blinken is also expected to speak to Sisi about solutions to open the key crossing into Gaza at Rafah.The month-long closure has worsened the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, sending prices of scarce goods skyrocketing and worsening fears voiced by the United Nations of famine in the blockaded territory.Israel seized the crossing from Hamas and has blamed Egypt for the closure.Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel, has hit back and said that drivers feel unsafe going through what is now an Israeli checkpoint.Blinken was heading to the region from France, where he joined Biden on a state visit that marked the 80th anniversary of Allied troops' D-Day landing in German-occupied Normandy.Blinken will also visit two more key Arab partners, Jordan and Qatar, before returning Wednesday to join Biden at the Group of Seven summit in Italy.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading back to the Middle East to push a ceasefire plan.

Donald Trump floats tax-free tips in pitch to win Las Vegas workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-floats-tax-free-tips-in-pitch-to-win-las-vegas-workers/articleshow/110858451.cms,"Donald Trump said he’d scrap taxes on tipped earnings for hospitality workers if he wins the White House , calibrating his message for swing-state voters in Nevada as he fights back after his felony conviction.“We’re going to do that right away first thing in office because it’s been a point of contention for years and you do a great job of service — you take care of people,” the former president said at a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, his first since he was found guilty at his criminal trial in Manhattan.Trump’s latest tax-cut pledge signaled a bid to appeal to Nevada’s booming service industry dominated by young workers and people of color, two voter groups he’s courting as he heads toward the Republican National Convention in mid-July.The rally took Trump to a crucial state that President Joe Biden won in 2020, but where the president’s softening support among Black and Hispanic voters threatens to create an opening for Trump.“For those hotel workers and people that get tips, you’re going to be very happy,” he told the crowd. “Because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on people making tips.”A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll in May found support for Trump and Biden tied at 47% in Nevada. Trump led Biden by 48% to 44% among voters across seven swing states, including Nevada, that are likely to determine the outcome of the election.The Culinary Union, which represents workers in the hospitality industry, derided Trump’s pledge. While relief is needed for tip earners, there’s a “difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,” Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement.The presumptive Republican nominee has stepped up campaigning after the New York trial largely kept him tied up in court, holding a town hall in battleground Arizona on Thursday and doing televised interviews. That follows a scaled-back campaign stretch with fewer rallies to preserve a war chest hit hard by legal fees.As a convicted felon running for president, Trump has thrust US politics into uncharted waters after a jury found him guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide a hush-money payment to an adult film actress. He still faces three other criminal trials, but those are unlikely to take place before the general election in November.","Donald Trump said he'd scrap taxes on tipped earnings for hospitality workers if he wins the White House.

"Nawaz reaches out for peace, PM Modi says security remains India’s priority",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/nawaz-reaches-out-for-peace-pm-modi-says-security-remains-indias-priority/articleshow/110883535.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time but more significant was a felicitation message from the elder Sharif - former PM Nawaz Sharif - who spoke about replacing hate with hope and seizing this “opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia”. Modi expressed appreciation for the message, saying the people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas.“Advancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority,” said Modi, who did not invite Pakistan for the inauguration of his third term. Modi’s emphasis on security is in line with his government’s long held position that Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism is not conducive for dialogue.Nawaz had just before the election outcome too reached out to India’s incoming government by reiterating his position that it was Pakistan which had violated his 1999 peace agreement with India in the form of the Lahore Declaration through its Kargil offensive. However, his remarks now constitute the first direct peace outreach to India since the coalition government in Pakistan took power earlier this year.Nawaz said Modi’s success in elections reflects the confidence of the people in his leadership. “Let us replace hate with hope and seize the opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia,” said Nawaz, who was recently re-elected president of his party, in a post on X.Coming from the most powerful civilian leader in Pakistan, and one who is known to share a close rapport with Modi himself, the remarks are particularly significant. Modi thanked Shehbaz for his message.It was under Modi and Nawaz - in 2015 when then foreign minister Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad - that the 2 sides had their last substantive bilateral engagement. That dialogue saw India and Pakistan relaunching the dialogue process under the new name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. This was followed by Modi’s famous drop by, and only visit to Pakistan as PM, in Lahore on Nawaz’s birthday but that initiative also quickly fizzled out because of the Pathankot terror attack and later the Uri attack.India has refused to have any diplomatic engagement ever since, except for the Indus Waters Treaty talks, and Pakistan itself decided to downgrade ties by recalling its high commissioner in 2019 after India revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K.The 2 countries will have an opportunity to attempt a reset in ties next month when both PMs travel to Kazakhstan for the SCO summit. However, it’s unlikely India will propose any meeting, given the understanding in the government that Pakistan is yet to act decisively against cross-border terrorism. Official sources also maintain Pakistan has to review its decision to downgrade ties before nursing any thought of forward movement in the relationship.Nawaz’s call for working together also doesn’t sit well with Pakistan’s official position that India must reverse its “unilateral and illegal” measures in J&K for talks to take place. With the Supreme Court upholding the revocation of the special status, the Indian government believes Pakistan cannot have any say in how the internal affairs of J&K are run.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for taking over as prime minister for the third time.

Pakistan installs social media firewall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-installs-social-media-firewall/articleshow/110883200.cms,"Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms (AP photo)

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has started installing a nationwide firewall system to regulate social media platforms and stop the spread of undesirable content. Government sources said the firewall would apply to all popular platforms like Facebook, YouTube and X.

The firewall, a senior official said, seeks to identify sources of propaganda material, examine data from various internet protocol addresses and limit the content’s visibility. One of the system’s primary functions is keyword filtering, which identifies and hides offensive content .

Additionally, protocols are being developed to oversee Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which many have employed to evade limitations placed on X, formerly Twitter. Initial restrictions on VPNs drew criticism from the corporate sector, which led the govt to temporarily suspend its implementation.

The X blockade has brought its usage in Pakistan to almost half, from 4.5 million to 2.4 million users. It seems the management of X is gradually adhering to govt directives to block accounts that disseminate fake news, allow conversations on sensitive subjects or circulate contentious ideas.

In April, the home ministry had provided the Islamabad high court a detailed report outlining the rationale for X’s prohibition. The report brought attention to X’s non-registration and its disregard for Pakistani legal requirements.

The report claimed that X’s refusal to comply with Pakistani regulations was the reason for its blocking. It argued that the action did not infringe on fundamental rights.

Nations in West Asia and elsewhere have also reached out to them.Recently, Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan had a meeting in Kabul with Taliban home minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, who also heads the Haqqani network, a powerful faction within the governing group.Kabul had approached New Delhi, through its deputy foreign minister Sher Muhammad Abbas Stanikzai, soon after the formation of the interim govt in Afghanistan in 2021. The correspondence between the two sides had opened a window for communication, which culminated into formal contacts.On the contrary, the ties between Islamabad and Kabul are growing more hostile every day. Kabul’s refusal to curb the alleged activities of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants on its soil has seriously dented relations between the two countries. Travel restrictions on Afghan nationals and the expulsion of Afghan refugees from Pakistan further worsened the ties.Experts suggest that Kabul’s diplomatic efforts will not yield any results until they focus on solving problems such as human rights, women's education and employment.Sweden-based Afghan analyst Nur Rehman Sherzad said that since coming to power in August 2021, the Taliban govt has not formulated any foreign policy.According to him, a govt that is not officially recognised by any country does not have diplomatic and legal status in its relations with the international community and neighbouring countries.“The representatives of the Taliban govt are now gradually realising that the policies of the last three years are not bringing any significant results,” Sherzad said, adding that officials of the international community and other countries in the region visit Afghanistan also to inform Kabul about their security concerns.Describing the acceleration in the Taliban's diplomatic efforts, Arif Yusufzai, an expert on Afghan affairs, told TOI that these types of contacts help build mutual intelligence ties. According to him, the Taliban are making many claims on their own, but they are not doing what the international community is asking them to do. “They are not changing their behaviour at all,” he added.Afghan journalist Abdul Haq Omari believes that Taliban currently face two challenges for the survival of their power. One is to establish formal relations with foreign countries and the other is to maintain their religious narrative internally under which they had fought for two decades.“The survival of the religious narrative is important for the Taliban because if they withdraw suddenly, Taliban's rival groups in Afghanistan, Islamic State or Daesh Khorasan, may strengthen the anti-Taliban narrative,” he added.","Afghan Taliban has intensified its efforts to open different channels of communication with the regional and neighbouring countries.

Additionally, the deeply conservative culture makes it difficult to be openly gay.As a result, the man was transferred to the Sarhad hospital for psychiatric diseases in Peshawar on May 9. He faced significant abuse for his application from local citizens and politicians alike.As per the Telegraph report, the leader of the Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI) party, a conservative religious group, claimed that the applicant's attempt to set up the club followed a recent return from the UK. A local MP from the far-Right Pakistan Awami Tehreek party expressed extreme opposition, stating he would have doused the club with petrol and set it alight, while the party leader, Naseer Khan Nazir, warned of ""very severe consequences"" if the club was allowed to open.Friends of the man, who were also unnamed, expressed fear for his well-being and reported being blocked from visiting him or obtaining any information about him. ""Everyone is afraid that talking about it will put them in danger,"" one friend said. ""I do not know about his well-being for many days,"" they added, noting their unsuccessful attempts to gather information about him.Before his hospitalization, he told the paper, ""I talk about human rights and I want everyone's human rights to be defended."" He emphasized his commitment to advocating for the rights of the most neglected community in Pakistan, saying, ""If the authorities refuse, then I will approach the court, and I hope that like the Indian court, the Pakistani court will rule in favor of gay people.""His application clearly said that there would be ""no gay (or non-gay) sex (other than kissing)"" at the club, with a notice on the wall warning, ""no sex on premises.""

Pakistan and IMF disagree over new income tax rates that will burden salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-and-imf-disagree-over-new-income-tax-rates-that-will-burden-salaried-class/articleshow/110836835.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons and the imposition of a standard 18 per cent sales tax on agriculture and health sector goods, according to a media report on Sunday.On Friday, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) authorities discussed the outstanding issues related to taxation and the energy sector.Citing sources, the Express Tribune newspaper reported that both sides could not resolve their differences on the income tax threshold, the merger of salaried and non-salaried rates and the maximum income tax rate for individuals.Discussions are revolving around whether to charge a new backbreaking 45 per cent income tax from salaried and non-salaried individuals on a monthly income of just over Pakistani Rs 4,67,000, sources said.At present, the maximum rate of 35 per cent applies to a monthly income of over Pakistani Rs 5,00,000.However, both sides have converged on the issue of increasing the income tax burden on exporters in the next budget who paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 86 billion this year, which is 280 per cent less than the taxes paid by the salaried people.Pakistan also showed a willingness to tax pensions beyond a certain income threshold.In the latest talks, the international money lender insisted on merging the slabs related to salaried, non-salaried and other incomes.On the government's proposal of increasing the annual threshold of taxable income to Pakistani Rs 9,00,000, the IMF is asking for the maximum income tax rate to be increased from 35 per cent to 45 per cent.However, the government is unwilling to increase the maximum rate for salaried individuals to 45 per cent but showed flexibility to keep the taxable income threshold at the current Pakistani Rs 6,00,000.It is also asking to keep the salaried and non-salaried slabs separate but is willing to increase the highest tax rate for non-salaried persons to 45 per cent, said the sources.The non-salaried business individuals pay tax after excluding expenses while the salaried persons pay tax on their gross income without excluding the expenses.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is until now unwilling to increase the burden on the salaried class .According to a proposal, if the taxable income threshold is increased to Pakistani Rs 900,000 per annum, the income tax rate can be up to 7.5 per cent on a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 100,000. The current rate is 2.5 per cent for this category.For the next slab, if the monthly income is up to Pakistani Rs 133,000, the under-discussion tax rate is 20 per cent. The current rate is 12.5 per cent, that too for up to a monthly income of Pakistani Rs 200,000.The IMF wants a higher rate at the lower income level. This slab will directly hit Pakistan's middle-income group.At present, on an income of over Pakistani Rs 500,000, a 35 per cent tax rate is charged. The salaried class has until now paid Pakistani Rs 325 billion in income tax in 11 months, which is expected to rise to around Pakistani Rs 360 billion at the end of the current fiscal year.If the revised income tax rates are accepted, the tax contribution of the salaried class will jump to Pakistani Rs 540 billion in the next fiscal year, said the sources. To absorb this increase in the tax rates, even a 30 per cent pay hike will not be sufficient.Sources said that the IMF had asked Pakistan to share alternative proposals, in case it was unwilling to increase the tax burden on the salaried class. Another round of discussions is expected soon.Sources said that an understanding had been reached between Pakistan and the IMF on changing the tax regime for the richest exporters.As against the existing one per cent final income tax on exporters, it has been proposed that from the next fiscal year, the one per cent rate should be treated as a minimum, according to government sources.Pakistan's taxation system promotes inequality and puts a higher burden on people who have little capacity to bear it. The IMF has asked Pakistan to end all special tax regimes, like the low-income tax on gains made by investing in the stock market and bank deposits.The global lender has recommended treating these gains as part of normal income. The IMF is pushing Pakistan to increase the burden on the salaried class until the country recovers higher taxes from the non-salaried business individuals.During the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the exporters paid a paltry sum of Pakistani Rs 85.5 billion in taxes, which was Pakistani Rs 241 billion, or 280 per cent, less than the amount paid by the salaried class.During July-May FY24, the salaried class paid Pakistani Rs 326 billion in taxes, higher by 40 per cent, or Pakistani Rs 93 billion, compared to the same period last year.The record Pakistani Rs 326 billion in tax payments by the salaried class is also 223 per cent more than the combined tax paid by the rich exporters and influential retailers.Sources said that there was also no consensus on slapping the standard 18 per cent sales tax on fertiliser, pesticides and seeds – the crucial inputs for the agriculture sector.The government was also unwilling to impose an 18 per cent sales tax on medicines, solar panels and medical and surgical equipment. In case, the 18 per cent tax is imposed on medicines, there will be an additional collection of Pakistani Rs 130 billion in the next fiscal year.Similarly, taxing the medical and health-related supplies will generate another Pakistani Rs 100 billion, according to the paper.Pakistan urgently needs a new loan from the IMF to keep the fear of default at bay. The government is eager to ink the agreement before the end of June when the fiscal year ends.","Talks between Pakistan and the IMF have ended inconclusively due to a disagreement over new income tax rates for salaried and non-salaried persons.

However, after 10 days, the child developed bilateral lower limb weakness, which progressively worsened and eventually affected the upper limbs, as reported by Dawn.He was subsequently admitted to the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) in Karachi, where he was diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Despite medical efforts, the child succumbed to the illness on May 22.Samples collected from three contacts of the victim revealed the presence of the wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in one of the siblings and a cousin residing in the same household. Importantly, there was no history of recent travel to other districts prior to the onset of paralysis, indicating local transmission.Investigations are underway to determine whether the case resulted from vaccine refusal, although records indicate that the child had received five doses of vaccine during supplementary immunisation activities.Malik Mukhtar Bharath, the prime minister's coordinator on national health services, emphasised that until Pakistan achieves polio eradication, children remain vulnerable to this debilitating disease.Muhammad Anwarul Haq, coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, highlighted the ongoing efforts to investigate the source of the virus and identify gaps in vaccination coverage . This includes targeting populations that may have missed out on polio immunisation to prevent further outbreaks.","The case, which occurred on April 29 and was confirmed on June 8, highlights a significant delay of six weeks in diagnosis.

Two members of Ahmadi community shot dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-members-of-ahmadi-community-shot-dead/articleshow/110826007.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Two members of the minority Ahmadi community were shot dead in Pakistan ’s central Punjab province on Saturday, days after a vicious campaign was launched against the Supreme Court order releasing a person from the persecuted sect in a 2022 case.

The incident occurred in Sadullapur area of Mandi Bahauddin district.

The victims, a 50-year-old man and another 25 years old, were targeted by an unknown assailant when they were en route to a nearby market.

District police officer Ahmad Mohiuddin said the suspected attacker has been arrested from the same locality and the murder weapon seized. “He was involved in both shootings,” he claimed.

Following the incident, a large police force was deployed in the area.

Police said they first took both bodies into custody and moved them to a local government-run hospital for post-mortem analyses, after which the bodies would be handed over to the victims’ relatives.

There are an estimated four million Ahmadis in Pakistan, a country of over 220 million people. They live in fear in a Muslim majority country due to intimidation and threats of death. A sustained hate campaign has been on against them for decades. The community’s members avoid revealing or speaking about their faith in public.

Over the last few decades, Pakistan’s minority communities have borne the brunt of mob brutality, bomb attacks, arsons, lynchings and other forms of violence. Last month, a district president of the Ahmadi community was killed by unknown assailants.
