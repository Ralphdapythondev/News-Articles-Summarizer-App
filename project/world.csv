Israel-Iran attacks show India needs stronger air and missile defence systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-iran-attacks-show-india-needs-stronger-air-and-missile-defence-systems/articleshow/109448246.cms,"NEW DELHI: Missile defence is technically complex, and very expensive. It’s virtually like firing a bullet to stop an incoming bullet. But with the sheer operational criticality of air and missile defence systems being reinforced by the tit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Iran, India needs to majorly crank up efforts to make its airspace as impregnable as possible.India has taken some strides in the arena but much more clearly needs to be done for an effective multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, reliable command and control posts, land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles.Unlike India, Israel of course has only a small territory to defend. And it did so effectively on April 13, thwarting Iran’s mass missile and kamikaze drone attack with its wide array of defence systems, from the short-range Iron Dome to long-range Arrow, as well as help from some others like the US. India’s air defence systems are geared towards protecting only some vital areas and installations. “India is simply too vast to be effectively protected from all kinds of aerial threats. But yes, apart from buying bullets, we need to invest much more in bulletproof jackets as well. Missile defence is now an overwhelming tactical necessity rather than a strategic one,” a senior officer said.For one, India needs to get cracking on operationally deploying its indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy nuclear and other ballistic missiles both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth’s atmosphere at altitudes from 15-25 km to 80-100 km for “a higher kill probability”.After “successfully completing” a series of tests for Phase-1 of the land-based BMD sy stem quite a while ago, the DRDO also conducted the maiden flight-trial of a sea-based interceptor missile in April last year. The govt, however, has so far not sanctioned fullscale deployment of the BMD system at any vital location. This could be due to the exorbitant costs involved or a few technological gaps, or even strategic calculations that it may provoke Pakistan to go in for a larger nuclear arsenal and countermeasures to defeat the BMD system, as reported by TOI earlier.IAF, of course, now has three squadrons of Russian S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems, which can detect, track and destroy incoming strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, drones and even some intermediaterange ballistic missiles at a range of 380-km. They are deployed in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan.Delivery of the remaining two S-400 squadrons, under the $5.43 billion contract inked in 2018, has been delayed to 2025-26 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.Parallelly, India is developing its own long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system under the ambitious Project Kusha. With an interception range of around 350-km, this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29.Then, there is the Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile (MR-SAM) systems, with an over 70-km range, jointly developed with Israel. After the Navy and IAF, Army in Feb last year operationalised its first ‘Abhra’ MR-SAM regiment in the 33 Corps, which defends the frontier with China in Sikkim and the Siliguri Corridor.Army and IAF have also inducted in large numbers the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, with an interception range of 25-km, while a new-generation sleeker version is also now ready for user trials.","India has taken some strides in the arena but much more clearly needs to be done for an effective multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield.

India in wait-and-watch mode after limited Israeli hit on Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-in-wait-and-watch-mode-after-limited-israeli-hit-on-iran/articleshow/109443755.cms,"NEW DELHI: Following Israel 's retaliatory strike on Iran , Indian govt is closely monitoring the situation but whether it asks Indian nationals in the two countries to leave will depend on whether there is any further escalation.While Israel did launch an air strike on Iran, its actions so far have been limited in scope, intended perhaps to not escalate further.Iran has denied any of its military or nuclear facilities took a hit in the Israeli action.For India, if indeed the situation worsens, the top priority would be to safely evacuate Indian nationals in both the countries. India had earlier issued an advisory , but it was restricted to asking Indian nationals to not travel to both the countries till further notice. MEA had also urged Indians residing in Iran and Israel to exercise caution and restrict their movement.While US asked its embassy staff to restrict movement, Australia Friday told its citizens to leave Iran and Israel citing ""threat of military reprisals and terrorist attacks"".""All options are on the table but it's a wait and watch approach for the time being,"" said a govt source who spoke on condition of anonymity. India had earlier also put on hold a proposal to allow thousands of India construction workers to go to Israel, which is facing acute labour shortage, under a bilateral agreement signed last year in May.Fortunately, both Israel and Iran seemed keen to avoid further escalation with the latter playing down the Israeli action and indicating it had no plans to retaliate. Iranian media and officials described a small number of explosions, which they said resulted from air defences hitting three drones over the city of Isfahan in central Iran. Notably, according to a Reuters report, they referred to the incident as an attack by ""infiltrators"", rather than by Israel, obviating the need for retaliation.","Israel did launch an air strike on Iran, its actions so far have been limited in scope, intended perhaps to not escalate further.

Iran says it will respond at 'maximum level' if Israel acts against its interests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-threatens-immediate-and-maximum-response-to-israeli-actions/articleshow/109448656.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Friday that Iran is prepared to react at an immediate and ""maximum level"" if Israel takes actions against its interests.""If Israel wants to do another adventurism and acts against the interests of Iran, our next response will be immediate and will be at the maximum level,"" Amirabdollahian said in an interview with NBC News.His remarks come in the wake of reports of an Israeli strike on Iran early Friday.The Israeli military , earlier on Friday morning, launched an attack on Iran in response to an aerial assault on Israel over the past weekend. According to two Israeli and three Iranian officials, the strike seemed to be limited in scope. ""The reaction from both Israel and Iran was muted,"" said the officials.Officials from Iran reported that the strike targeted a military air base close to Isfahan, a city in central Iran. The attack was executed using small drones. ""The drones may have been launched from within Iran,"" the officials said. They also mentioned that ""Iran's radar systems had not detected any unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace.""The launching of drones from within Iran would showcase Israel's capability to conduct covert operations in Iranian land. Officials from Iran revealed that another set of small drones was intercepted in Tabriz, approximately 500 miles north of Isfahan.During the retaliatory strike, Israeli warplanes launched missiles, as confirmed by a Western official and two Iranian officials. ""It remains unclear if Iran's defenses were able to intercept the missiles or determine their landing location,"" the officials said.Israel's military chose not to provide any comments on the situation. A senior US official disclosed that Israel had informed the United States using various communication channels just before the strike. All officials requested anonymity as they were not permitted to publicly address the issue.Speaking to journalists during a gathering of foreign ministers from the Group of 7 in Italy, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized that the United States had ""not engaged in any offensive activities"" in Iran. However, he refrained from providing additional comments and refused to verify the Israeli strike, opting to mention ""reported events.""Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, explained that the sounds of explosions in Isfahan on Friday morning were due to ""our air defense firing at a suspicious object."" He reassured that ""no damage"" was incurred. Iranian lawmaker Seyed Nezamedin Mousavi criticized the strike as ""ridiculous,"" suggesting that it indicated Israel's acceptance of defeat and satisfaction with these ineffective actions.World leaders, who had been urging Israel and Iran to de-escalate tensions, reiterated their plea for both countries to ""avoid any taking any further action"" that could set off a wider war in the Middle East .

'Fight and win' wars: Xi Jinping orders China's biggest military reorganisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/fight-and-win-wars-xi-jinping-orders-chinas-biggest-military-reorganisation/articleshow/109438873.cms,"Chinese hackers preparing to attack US infrastructure

China has announced the creation of a new military cyber corps, the Information Support Force , aimed at bolstering Beijing's capability to ""fight and win"" wars. The formation of this new force was declared on Friday by the defense ministry spokesman, Wu Qian, who emphasized its role as a ""key support for coordinated development and application of network information systems.""This strategic initiative is part of China's continued investment in military modernization, which has seen billions of dollars allocated to upgrading its armed forces amidst growing tensions with the United States and other regional powers.The establishment of the Information Support Force represents a significant reorganization of China’s military resources, focusing on enhancing cyber warfare capabilities.President Xi Jinping , who has worked to tighten his grip on the military since taking power, ""extended warm congratulations"" at a ceremony in Beijing, which was broadcast on state television. Dressed in military attire, Xi addressed officers and underscored the founding of the new force as a pivotal decision by the Communist Party to refine the military system ""with Chinese characteristics.""In his speech, Xi reiterated the need for the military to ""resolutely obey the party's command"" and to uphold the principles of the party's absolute leadership over the military. The reorganization also involves the termination of the Strategic Support Force , established in 2015 to boost China's capabilities in space, cyber, political, and electronic warfare. The aerospace and cyber units from this now-defunct force will be realigned under the new Information Support Force.This military reshuffle is reported to be the largest since 2015 and comes at a time when cyber tensions with global powers such as the US are escalating. The US, along with the UK and New Zealand, has recently accused China of sponsoring cyber activities targeting democratic institutions, highlighting the critical nature of cyber warfare in global conflicts.China's contentious territorial claims, including its assertion over Taiwan and almost the entireSouth China Sea , further complicate the regional security landscape. The reorganization under Xi's leadership is seen as a move to strengthen China's hand in these ongoing disputes and to ensure more cohesive military operations across different domains.Meanwhile, FBI director Christopher Wray has raised alarms about Chinese government-linked hackers infiltrating US critical infrastructure, describing a grim scenario where they could launch devastating attacks at their discretion. Speaking at Vanderbilt University, Wray outlined the threats posed by an ongoing Chinese hacking campaign known as Volt Typhoon.According to Wray, this campaign has successfully penetrated the systems of several key American industries, including telecommunications, energy, and water, specifically targeting 23 pipeline operators. His remarks were made during the 2024 Vanderbilt Summit on Modern Conflict and Emerging Threats.Wray expressed concerns about China's capabilities, saying, ""China is developing the ability to physically wreak havoc on our critical infrastructure at a time of its choosing."" He further elaborated on the potential motives behind these cyber intrusions, suggesting they are part of a broader strategy to undermine U.S. resolve in defending allies, such as Taiwan. ""Its plan is to land low blows against civilian infrastructure to try to induce panic,"" Wray emphasized.The intent behind these cyber activities remains challenging to pinpoint, but Wray indicated that they align with China's larger strategic objectives to deter the US from any defensive actions towards Taiwan.(With inputs from agencies)","China has announced the creation of a new military cyber corps, the Information Support Force.

"US sanctions ally of Israeli minister, entities backing 'extremist' settlers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-sanctions-ally-of-israeli-minister-entities-backing-extremist-settlers/articleshow/109447400.cms,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on an ally of Israel's far-right national security minister and two entities that raised money for Israeli men accused of settler violence, the latest actions aimed against those Washington blames for an escalation of violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank .The sanctions, in addition to those already imposed on five settlers and two unauthorized outposts already this year, are the latest sign of growing US frustration with the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .The moves on Friday, which freeze any US assets held by those targeted and generally bar Americans from dealing with them, hit two organizations that launched fundraising campaigns to support settlers accused of violence and targeted by previous sanctions, the Department of the Treasury said in a statement.The Biden administration's moves against Israeli settlers have upset right-wing members of Netanyahu's governing coalition who support the expansion of Jewish settlements and ultimately the annexation of the West Bank, where Palestinians envisage a future state.They come as the complex relationship between Washington and its ally Israel is tested by the war in Gaza and as the Biden administration urges Israel to show restraint in responding to retaliatory strikes by Iran.Washington sanctioned Ben-Zion Gopstein, founder and leader of the right-wing group Lehava, which opposes Jewish assimilation with non-Jews and agitates against Arabs in the name of religion and national security. Gopstein has said Lehava has 5,000 members.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said members of the group had engaged in ""destabilizing violence affecting the West Bank.""""Under Gopstein's leadership, Lehava and its members have been involved in acts or threats of violence against Palestinians, often targeting sensitive or volatile areas,"" Miller said in a statement, warning of additional steps if Israel does not take measures to prevent extremist attacks amid an escalation of violence in the West Bank in recent days.The European Union also said on Friday it had agreed to take sanctions against Lehava and other groups linked to violent settlers.A spokesperson for Israel's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Gopstein, the most prominent Israeli figure targeted by US sanctions , is a close associate of and has family ties to National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who himself lives in a West Bank settlement.Ben-Gvir, like Gopstein, was a disciple of the late Meir Kahane, an ultranationalist rabbi whose Kach movement was listed by Washington as a specially designated global terrorist organization.Ben-Gvir on Friday slammed what he called harassment against Lehava and ""our dear settlers who have never engaged in terrorism or hurt anyone,"" labeling the allegations against them a ""blood libel"" by Palestinian groups and anarchists.""I call on Western countries to stop cooperating with these antisemites and end this campaign of persecution against the pioneering Zionist settlers,"" Ben-Gvir said in a statement released by his office.CROWDFUNDINGSince the 1967 Middle East war, Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the core of an independent state. It has built Jewish settlements there that most countries deem illegal. Israel disputes this and cites historical and Biblical ties to the land.The Biden administration in February said settlements were inconsistent with international law, signaling a return to long-standing US policy on the issue that had been reversed by the previous administration of Donald Trump.One entity targeted on Friday, Mount Hebron Fund, launched an online fundraising campaign that raised $140,000 for settler Yinon Levi, the Treasury said, after he was sanctioned on Feb. 1 for leading a group of settlers that assaulted Palestinian and Bedouin civilians, burned their fields and destroyed their property.It said the second entity, Shlom Asiraich, raised $31,000 on a crowdfunding website for David Chai Chasdai, who the United States sanctioned for initiating and leading a riot that included setting vehicles and buildings on fire and causing damage to property in the Palestinian town of Huwara, resulting in the death of a Palestinian civilian.""These types of enforcement actions against entities helping violent settlers evade US sanctions are what give sanctions teeth,"" said Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man, director of research for Israel-Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now, a human rights group that has highlighted efforts by supporters to evade sanctions against settlers.",The United States imposes sanctions on an ally of Israel's far-right national security minister. The sanctions are the latest sign of growing US frustration with the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

"10-year-old boy confesses to fatally shooting a man in his sleep 2 years ago, Texas authorities say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/10-year-old-boy-confesses-to-fatally-shooting-a-man-in-his-sleep-2-years-ago-texas-authorities-say/articleshow/109447393.cms,"AUSTIN: A 10-year-old boy has confessed to an unsolved killing in Texas , telling investigators that he shot a man he did not know while the victim slept, authorities said Friday.The boy, who was just shy of his eighth birthday when the man was shot two years ago, has been evaluated at a psychiatric hospital but cannot be charged with the crime because of his age at the time, the Gonzales County Sheriff's Office said in a news release.Texas law requires a child to be at least 10 years old to have criminal culpability. The boy is being held in juvenile detention for threatening a student on a bus in another incident earlier this month, authorities said.Brandon O'Quinn Rasberry, 32, was shot in the head in 2022 while he slept at an RV park in Nixon, Texas, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of San Antonio, investigators said. He had just moved in a few days before.The boy's possible connection to the case was uncovered after sheriff's deputies were contacted on April 12 of this year about a student who threatened to assault and kill another student on a school bus. They learned the boy had made previous statements that he had killed someone two years ago.The boy was taken to a child advocacy center, where he described for interviewers details of Rasberry's death ""consistent with first-hand knowledge"" of the crime, investigators said.The boy said he had been visiting his grandfather, who lived a few lots away from Rasberry in the RV park. He described the 9 mm pistol and its ""dirt and army green"" color, and said he took it from the glove box of his grandfather's truck.The boy described entering Rasberry's RV, shooting him in the head, and shooting again into the couch before leaving, then returning the gun to the truck, investigators said.The boy told his interviewer he had seen Rasberry in the RV park earlier in the day, but never met him and had no reason to be mad at him. Rasberry's body was found after he failed to show up for work for two days.The boy said his grandfather later sold the pistol. Deputies located it at a pawn shop. Shell casings from the previous crime scene were matched to the gun, investigators said.The boy was placed in 72-hour emergency detention ""because of the severity of the crime and because of the continued concern for the child's mental wellbeing,"" the sheriff's office said.He was brought to a psychiatric hospital in San Antonio for evaluation and treatment and then was taken back to Gonzales County. He was placed in juvenile detention on a charge of making a terroristic threat for the school bus incident.It was not immediately clear if the boy's family has an attorney. The Associated Press left a telephone message seeking comment at the office of Gonzales County Attorney Paul Watkins.",Boy was just shy of his eighth birthday when the man was shot two years ago. Texas law requires a child to be at least 10 years old to have criminal culpability. The boy is being held in juvenile detention for threatening a student on a bus in another incident earlier this month.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109447422,imgsize-14110,width-400,resizemode-4/109447422.jpg"

McKinley, Fisher and Leahy were all Alameda police officers at the time. McKinley and Leahy are still with that department but Fisher is now a Contra Costa County sheriff's deputy.The officers confronted Gonzalez after receiving 911 calls that said he appeared disoriented or drunk. According to police video, he resisted being handcuffed and they pinned him to the ground for several minutes before he became unconscious.The county coroner's autopsy report listed the cause of death as ""toxic effects of methamphetamine"" with the contributing factors of ""physiologic stress of altercation and restraint,"" morbid obesity and alcoholism. Then-District Attorney Nancy O'Malley subsequently found that the officers' actions were reasonable.A second, independent autopsy done at the request of Gonzalez family lawyers found that he died of ""restraint asphyxiation."" The district attorney's office noted the second autopsy in announcing the involuntary manslaughter charges .Defense attorneys denounced the charges as politically motivated, noting that an effort to oust Price has gathered enough signatures to force a recall election this year.Fisher's attorney, Michael Rains, said the charges are a ""desperate effort to shore up her chances of remaining in office,"" Bay Area News Group reported.The district attorney waited ""until the 11th hour"" before the statute of limitations was set to expire and just days after it was confirmed she would face a recall, attorney Alison Berry Wilkinson, who represented the three officers in previous investigations and now represents Leahy, said in an email to The Associated Press.""There is no new evidence,"" Berry Wilkinson wrote. ""This is a blatantly political prosecution.""Berry Wilkinson said the officers' actions were reasonable, necessary and lawful, and the death was due to drug toxicity.""We are confident a jury will see through this charade and exonerate the officers, just as the two prior independent investigations did,"" the attorney said.An attorney for McKinley was not immediately available for comment Friday.Price said she was ""walled off"" from the case review, which was conducted by her office's Public Accountability Unit.Last year, Alameda settled two lawsuits over Gonzalez's death. The city agreed to pay $11 million to his young son and $350,000 to his mother.""A wrong has been righted,"" Adante Pointer, the attorney for Gonzalez's mother, told the news group.","Mario Gonzalez, 26, died in the city of Alameda on April 19, 2021.

"US House advances Ukraine-Israel package after rare bipartisan show, far-right fumes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-house-advances-ukraine-israel-package-after-rare-bipartisan-show-far-right-fumes/articleshow/109444357.cms,"The House took a critical step on Friday toward approving a long-stalled package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and other American allies, as Democrats supplied the crucial votes to push the legislation past Republican opposition so that it could be considered on the floor.The 316-94 vote cleared the way for the House to bring up the aid package , teeing up separate votes on Saturday on each of its parts.But passage of those measures, each of which enjoys bipartisan support from different coalitions, was not in doubt, making Friday's action the key indicator that the legislation will prevail.The rule for considering the bill - historically a straight party-line vote - passed with more Democratic than Republican support, but it also won a majority of GOP votes, making it clear that despite a pocket of deep resistance from the far right, there is broad bipartisan backing for the $95.3 billion package.The vote was an enormous victory in the long effort to fund Ukraine as it battles against Russian aggression, a major priority of Prez Biden that has met with bitter resistance from the right. It was a triumph against the forces of isolationism within the GOP and a major moment of bipartisan consensus in a Congress that for the past year has been mostly defined by its dysfunction. But it came only after Speaker Mike Johnson , who put his own job on the line to push through the plan over his party's objections, was forced to turn to Democrats in a significant breach of custom in the House, further imperiling his position even as he paved the way for the legislation to be voted on and approved.It was the second time during this Congress that Republicans have had to rely on Democratic votes in the House to even bring to the floor legislation to address a critical issue. They did so last year to allow for a vote to suspend the debt ceiling bill and avoid a catastrophic federal default.Many Republicans spoke on Friday in favour of the legislation to send aid to Ukraine and Israel. But the far-right flank of the Republican conference, which has wielded outsized power in a tiny majority, spoke out to oppose the bill. ""I'm concerned that the speaker's cut a deal with the Democrats to fund foreign wars rather than secure our border,"" said Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, one of the most vocal opponents of the legislation who has threatened to vote to oust Johnson because of it.In order to steer around opposition from members of his own party, Johnson broke down the package into three pieces, adding a fourth bill to sweeten the deal for conservatives. The rule was critical toJohnson's strategy, because it allows separate votes on aid to Israel and aid to Ukraine, which are supported by different coalitions, but then folds them together without requiring lawmakers to cast an up-or-down vote on the entire bill.",The vote was an enormous victory in the long effort to fund Ukraine as it battles against Russian aggression.

""But there was no involvement on the part of the United States,"" Tajani said. ""It was simply information which was provided,"" adding that he believed the G7's collective efforts deserved credit for ""the small scale of the event.""A senior US official said on Friday that Israel had notified the US through multiple channels shortly before its attack against Iran. Israel gave the administration an alert moments before its warplanes struck the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus on April 1, but the official said the latest attack was expected given all the warnings Israel had issued during the week. ""We were not surprised,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Publicly, Biden officials were tight-lipped about the strike to avoid getting the US pulled into the conflict between Iran and Israel, the official saidIsrael, too, said nothing about Friday's drone attacks on the Iranian city of Isfahan. There was also no word from Tel Aviv as to whether further action might be planned. Apart from direct strikes on Iranian territory, it has other ways of attacking, including cyberattacks and strikes on Iranian proxies elsewhere.In Iran, news reports on Friday's incident made no mention of Israel, and state television carried analysts and pundits who appeared dismissive about the scale. Shortly after midnight, ""three drones were observed in the sky over Isfahan. The air defence system became active and destroyed these drones in the sky"", Iranian state TV said. By morning, Iran had reopened airports and airspace that were shut during the strikes.Israeli media avoided quoting Israeli officials directly, instead referring to foreign media reports that cited Israeli sources as confirming Israel was behind the attacks. Some Israelis suggested the aim was to demonstrate the capability to attack without causing harm.Violence between Israel and Iranian proxies across the West Asia has intensified throughout six months of bloodshed in Gaza, raising fears the longstanding foes' shadow war could spiral into a direct conflict.","US secretary of state Antony Blinken repeatedly declined to confirm a reported Israeli attack on Iran on Friday.

NEW DELHI: A van carry five Japanese autoworkers was targeted in a suicide attack in Karachi . The bomber was wearing an explosive-laden vest and the blast injured three by-standers.The spokesperson, Abrar Hussain Baloch, announced that the Japanese individuals have been relocated to a secure location under police protection, despite injuries sustained by bystanders and a guard accompanying the visitors.Baloch stated, ""The police mobile unit, which was nearby, responded to the attackers quickly and the security guards of the foreign guests responded immediately.""According to Pakistani counter-terrorism official Raja Umar Khatab, one of the two attackers on motorcycles detonated explosives strapped to his body as soon as the vehicle slowed down, but failed to hit the intended target.Khatab reported, ""I think he fired some 15 or 16 shots,"" and added that the attackers were killed by the foreigners ' private security guards and a nearby police patrol who returned fire. He also mentioned that the assailants had trailed the Japanese group's vehicle for a while before the attack, leading authorities to believe they had conducted reconnaissance to identify the target and the location of the attack.According to local police chief Arshad Awan, the five Japanese nationals were employed at Pakistan Suzuki Motors in an industrial region, where the vehicle was headed. He noted that the assault also led to the deaths of twoterrorists involved in the attack and caused damage to another vehicle nearby.“All the Japanese who were the target of the attack are safe,” he said.Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, informed the press in Tokyo that one Japanese citizen was verified to have been injured, and the government was gathering more information while cautioning other Japanese nationals in Pakistan about potential risks.Both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan condemned the attack on the Japanese nationals. They complimented the police in different statements for their prompt action in stopping the attack. They also prayed for the quick recovery of those injured in the incident and pledged to eradicate terrorism.Although no one took credit for the incident right away, suspicions will probably point to the Pakistani Taliban or a minor separatist organization that has increased its attacks on security personnel in recent years. Chinese workers in Pakistan engaged in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which encompasses numerous megaprojects including building roads, power plants, and agricultural fields, have also been targeted by insurgents.In March, five Chinese nationals along with their Pakistani driver were killed after a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle into their convoy in northwest Pakistan.Their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine off the mountainous Karakoram Highway after the bomber rammed his car into them and detonated his explosives, police said.",A van carry five Japanese autoworkers was targeted in a suicide attack in Karachi.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) asked emergency services to remain vigilant with millions under threat for severe storms.Weather conditions weigh on crop yields At least 21 people, including seven children, were killed in Punjab and another 21 were killed in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, officials said. Rain also lashed the capital, Islamabad, and killed seven people in southwestern Baluchistan province. Streets flooded in the northwestern city of Peshawar and in Quetta, the Baluchistan capital. Extreme weather has put the harvesting season on hold, with concerns that heavy rainfall due Thursday could also cause major damage in fields and result in significant crop yield losses.Dozens dead in neighboring Afghanistan Floods caused by heavy rains over the last four days also killed at least 50 people in neighboring Afghanistan, the country's disaster agency said Tuesday.

Pakistan's anti-corruption agency clears Nawaz Sharif in Toshakhana vehicle case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-anti-corruption-agency-clears-nawaz-sharif-in-toshakhana-vehicle-case/articleshow/109370202.cms,"KARACHI: The National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) has granted a clean chit to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the Toshakhana vehicle reference, Dawn reported.The Toshakhana is a government department tasked with storing gifts bestowed upon rulers, parliamentarians, bureaucrats, and officials by foreign heads of state and dignitaries.According to NAB's allegations, then-Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilpurportedly facilitated the retention of vehicles gifted to Nawaz Sharif and then-President Asif Ali Zardari by foreign states and dignitaries.This allegedly occurred through the relaxation of procedures related to gift submission to Toshakhana, aiming to confer illegal benefits to Nawaz and Zardari, as reported by Dawn.The accused purportedly retained these vehicles ""through dishonest and illegal means for their personal benefit and interest,"" the reference stated, allowing them to keep the vehicles by paying a nominal fee of 15 per cent of the total value.In June 2020, an accountability court issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Nawaz Sharif, who was abroad at the time. He challenged the warrants in the Islamabad High Court but withdrew the petition shortly after.Subsequently, in September 2020, Nawaz Sharif was declared a proclaimed offender in the case, prompting an accountability court to initiate processes for the confiscation of his properties and directing NAB to pursue his arrest through Interpol.However, prior to his return to Pakistan in October of the same year, an accountability court suspended the perpetual arrest warrants against Nawaz Sharif, granting him bail shortly afterward.In November, NAB informed a Lahore accountability court that it had recorded Nawaz Sharif's statement in the reference, according to Dawn.Today, NAB submitted a report to an Islamabad accountability court following orders to have Nawaz Sharif join the investigation. The report indicated that the vehicle in question, gifted to Nawaz by the government of Saudi Arabia in 1997, was initially submitted to Toshakhana. However, it was later included in the federal transport pool.The report clarified that Nawaz Sharif purchased the vehicle from the federal transport pool, not Toshakhana, in 2008. Therefore, NAB concluded that the case lacked relevance to Toshakhana benefits since the vehicle was not part of Toshakhana when Nawaz acquired it.Consequently, NAB urged the accountability court to acquit or discharge Nawaz Sharif from the reference, Dawn reported.","The National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) has granted a clean chit to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the Toshakhana vehicle reference.

MAE SOT: A stream of people, some fearing air strikes, queued at a border crossing to flee Myanmar early on Friday, a day after the strategically vital town of Myawaddy near Thailand fell to anti-junta resistance that is gaining strength.The loss of the town robs the junta, already grappling with an economy in free fall, of vital earnings from border trade while strengthening rebel groups such as the Karen National Union (KNU) that led the assault on Myawaddy, analysts say.""I am afraid of air strikes,"" said Moe Moe Thet San, a Myawaddy resident who crossed to Thailand with her son, who is about five years old.""They caused very loud noises that shook my house,"" added the 39-year-old mother, one of those gathered at the single fully-operational border crossing at Mae Sot, who said the sound of bombs drove them to leave home, fearing for their safety.""That's why I escaped here. They can't bomb Thailand,"" she added.Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara is set to visit Mae Sot, just across the Moei River from Myawaddy, on Friday to assess matters after Myanmar's embattled junta lost yet more territory in the latest round of fighting.Junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun told Myanmar media some of its troops had surrendered because they were accompanied by their families and talks with Thailand for their return were in progress.He did not respond to a telephone call from Reuters to seek comment.Myanmar has been in turmoil since 2021, when the powerful military deposed an elected civilian government, triggering widespread protests it sought to crush with brutal force.Simmering anger against the junta turned into a nationwide armed resistance movement that is now increasingly operating in coordination with established ethnic rebel groups to challenge the military across large parts of the Southeast Asian nation.About 200 Myanmar military personnel withdrew on Thursday to a bridge linking to Mae Sot after the KNU said it had taken control of Myawaddy.But the Myanmar military may still seek to mount a counter-attack, supported by its air force, to regain the town, said Dulyapak Preecharush, an associate professor of Southeast Asian Studies at Bangkok's Thammasat University.""So there is a question about possible intensification of fighting in the coming days,"" he told Reuters.As fighting in Myanmar intensified, the numbers crossing to Mae Sot from Myawaddy doubled this week to about 4,000 a day.On Thursday, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said the fighting in Myanmar should not spill into his country's airspace.In an interview with Reuters last week, Srettha said the Myanmar junta was ""losing strength"", as he pushes to open talks with the regime.Thailand, which says it is keeping neutral in the Myanmar conflict and can accept up to 100,000 people displaced by it, has pursued engagement, including aid deliveries, with its neighbour since Srettha came to power last August.Yet the junta could find itself stretched further after the Arakan Army rebel group warned it would renew an offensive in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine.Arakan Army chief Twan Mrat Naing warned residents of the Rakhine cities of Sittwe and Kyauk Phyu to relocate ahead of ""a decisive battle"", the group said in a statement.One of Myanmar's most powerful ethnic armed forces, the Arakan Army was part of Operation 1027, a major assault by three rebel groups last October that seized significant territory from the junta.","Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara is set to visit Mae Sot, just across the Moei River from Myawaddy.

The statement for US sanctions mentions the designation of five companies across multiple jurisdictions providing materials for steel production to Iran’s Khuzestan Steel Company (KSC), a significant steel producer in Iran. Moreover, three subsidiaries of the Iranian automaker Bahman Group have been singled out for their support to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.The sanctions from US and UK come amidst broader international efforts to curtail Iran's capacity to acquire, produce or transfer weapons for activities deemed destabilizing in the region.The Group of Seven industrial democracies and European Union leaders have both signaled their intentions to intensify sanctions against Iran in response to the recent escalation of tensions.The ramped up sanctions are in response to Iran's retaliation for what it claims was an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus on April 1. Israel, on the other hand, has vowed retaliation for the Iranian attacks.In response to Israeli threats, a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander has hinted at the possibility of a review of Iran's ""nuclear doctrine”, raising concerns of potential escalation.","The US and UK have unveiled fresh sanctions against Iran in response to the recent missile and drone attack on Israel.

UK Conservative lawmaker suspended over allegations of misusing funds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-conservative-lawmaker-suspended-over-allegations-of-misusing-funds/articleshow/109399348.cms,"LONDON: Britain's governing Conservative Party has suspended one of its lawmakers while he is investigated over allegations that he misused campaign funds , a spokesperson for the Conservatives' head of party discipline said on Thursday.The Times newspaper reported that Mark Menzies had allegedly asked his former campaign manager for thousands of pounds to pay ""bad people"" who he said had detained him overnight in a flat and then used campaign funds to reimburse her.The newspaper said the Conservative Party had been made aware of the allegations in January.Menzies' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment but the Times quoted him as strongly disputing the allegations, saying he had ""fully complied with all the rules for declarations"".""Following a call with the Chief Whip (the Conservative in charge of party discipline), Mark Menzies has agreed to relinquish the Conservative whip, pending the outcome of an investigation,"" the spokesperson said, referring to his suspension, which means he must sit in parliament for now as an independent lawmaker.The allegations against Menzies are a fresh setback for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose party is lagging far behind the main opposition Labour Party in opinion polls ahead of a national election expected later this year.Earlier this month, another Conservative lawmaker left the party after he admitted handing over the personal phone numbers of his colleagues to someone he had met on a dating app.","Britain's governing Conservative Party has suspended one of its lawmakers.

Prince Harry updates country of residence to US on official records,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-harry-updates-country-of-residence-to-us-on-official-records/articleshow/109386728.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prince Harry , the Duke of Sussex , has recently updated his records with Companies House , indicating that his usual country of residence is now the United States of America, rather than the United Kingdom, according to Daily Mail report.According to documents filed with Companies House, the official residence of Prince Henry Charles Albert David, Duke of Sussex, has been updated to the United States of America.The filings, which list his full name as 'Prince Henry Charles Albert David Duke of Sussex,' previously stated that his country of usual residence was the United Kingdom.This change comes amidst increasing pressure on the US government to release Harry's visa records, following comments made by the American ambassador to London suggesting that he would not face deportation under the current administration.The conservative Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington DC has submitted these remarks as part of its ongoing court case seeking the release of Harry's visa file. The new details filed with Companies House for Harry's eco travel venture, Travalyst , also raise questions about his eligibility to remain as a Counsellor of State, a role that requires a UK domicile. This is particularly relevant as Harry no longer has a home in the UK after being asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage by King Charles.The situation surrounding Harry's status as a Counsellor of State is complex, as the law does not easily account for a second son of the King choosing a life away from royal duties. In 2022, the King asked parliament to add Princess Anne and Prince Edward to the list of Counsellors of State, but chose not to remove Harry and Prince Andrew, likely to avoid escalating family tensions. However, the King's recent cancer treatment has made the situation more urgent.Harry has also faced legal challenges related to his security in the UK, having lost a court case against the Home Office's decision to remove his right to automatic Metropolitan Police protection. The judge rejected his bid to halve the amount he had to pay in legal costs, describing part of his application as 'frankly hopeless'.Additionally, the Heritage Foundation has been pushing for the release of Harry's visa records under America's freedom of information laws, particularly in light of his admission to taking cocaine in his memoirs, which can potentially block a visa application in the USA.","Prince Harry's usual country of residence is now the United States of America.
