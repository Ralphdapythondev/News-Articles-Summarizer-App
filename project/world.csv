Donald Trump keeps low profile while Joe Biden faces furor over candidacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-keeps-low-profile-while-joe-biden-faces-furor-over-candidacy/articleshow/111473647.cms,"Former President Donald Trump has finally learned a key rule of politics: never interrupt your enemy when he’s making a mistake.The presumptive Republican nominee has largely disappeared from the national stage in the aftermath of President Joe Biden ’s disastrous debate performance, clearing way for Democrats’ anxieties to overwhelm the news cycle and ratchet up political pressure on his opponent.Aside from a celebratory rally last Friday, Trump has largely gone silent — even canceling a planned television interview with a Virginia network, according to local outlet 13News Now. After flirting with announcing his vice presidential pick in the days before the debate, his campaign reverted to their original plans to unveil the pick closer to the Republican convention.Trump has been rewarded by an opponent in freefall, with polls showing the Republican candidate widening his lead over the president both nationally and in swing states while Democratic lawmakers openly declare that they don’t believe their party will retain control of the White House in November.The former president and his advisers concede they don’t know how the episode will resolve itself, and that they’re not sure how Biden withdrawing from the ticket might impact the race’s dynamics. Vice President Kamala Harris , in particular, could offer voters a younger face and offset inroads Trump has made with women, independents, and voters of color.“I’m going to show up and I’m going to campaign whether it’s him or somebody else,” Trump said in an interview with Richmond, Virginia radio station WRVA.But Trump’s relative self-restraint has given Republican strategists hope that he’ll be able to avoid pitfalls of his own making through the campaign’s final four months.“Trump can be a disciplined messenger when he wants to be,” Republican strategist Doug Heye said in an interview. “By staying out of the spotlight — not announcing a veep pick, for instance — he keeps the very negative spotlight on Biden.”Democrats, by contrast, have desperately tried to bring Trump’s behavior back into the headlines — to no avail. Biden’s bid to focus attention on Trump’s conduct after the Supreme Court offered a broad interpretation of presidential immunity was quickly overwhelmed by his own political woes.Aides at Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware headquarters have said returning focus to Trump is essential as the president charts an increasingly narrow path back to competitiveness. On Wednesday, his team released a new ad arguing Trump “already led an insurrection and threatened to be a dictator.”“We must remind people of the choice in this election,” Biden’s campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez and chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in an email to staff.Publicly, Trump has commented little on the calls for Biden to drop out of the race and the growing uncertainty within Democratic ranks, though he did express skepticism in his WRVA interview.“If he doesn’t want that to happen, then it can’t happen because he has the votes,” Trump said on Monday. “He’s got all these delegates.”Laying low has offered the former president other advantages. For one, his campaign has avoided spending money on costly rallies — helping to preserve a cash advantage over the president. It’s also allowed for some holiday-week golfing at Trump’s Bedminster club in New Jersey.Trump and his top advisers have expressed skepticism that Biden would step aside, but have ratcheted up attacks on Harris and other Democrats as the clamor for the president to exit the race has grown.In a statement Wednesday, Trump senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles argued Democrats have purposely hid the truth of Biden’s physical and mental state.“President Trump will beat any Democrat on November 5th because he has a proven record,” they said, going on to call Harris a “cackling copilot.”MAGA Inc, the political action committee supporting Trump’s bid, released a statement calling Harris the administration’s “invasion czar” — in reference to the vice president’s portfolio addressing the root causes of migration — and attacking her record on immigration and the economy.A post-debate CNN survey released Tuesday found that Harris was polling better than Biden in a hypothetical matchup against Trump. While the Republican candidate led Harris 47%-45%, he was favored over Biden by a 49%-43% margin.The National Republican Congressional Committee released an ad on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday that highlighted Biden’s age and reminded voters that Harris would be next in line.“This November: Vote Republican. Stop Kamala,” the ad read, while videos of Harris laughing played to the tune of ominous music.",The presumptive Republican nominee has largely disappeared from the national stage in the aftermath of President Joe Biden ’s disastrous debate performance. The former president and his advisers concede they don’t know how the episode will resolve itself. But Trump’s relative self-restraint has given Republican strategists hope that he’ll be able to avoid pitfalls of his own making.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111473783,imgsize-1808881,width-400,resizemode-4/111473783.jpg"

The fire ignited off Grubbs Road and Brollier Way in Palermo just before 4 pm (local time) on Wednesday, according to unofficial sources, including the Watch Duty App.Fire fighters lined roads and helicopters dropped water on the growing wildfire on Wednesday in Northern California , which has forced at least 26,000 people to evacuate.The state is currently experiencing extreme heat. The Grubbs fire is just one of many fire s affecting the region. The Thompson fire , which broke out before noon Tuesday about 70 miles north of Sacramento near Oroville, has grown to more than 5.5 square miles and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible from space. Despite the challenging conditions, Oroville Mayor David Pittman reported a significant drop in fire activity by Wednesday afternoon, expressing hope that some residents could soon return home. However, the fire remains uncontained along its northern edge.Meanwhile, another fire broke out Wednesday afternoon about 5 miles south of Oroville near Palermo, prompting new evacuations . This fire , named the Grubbs fire , also remains uncontained. Several zones in Butte County are under evacuation warnings, including Zone 867, Zone 868, Zone 866, and Zone 869, according to the Butte County evacuation map.More than a dozen other wildfire s, mostly small, are active across the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and fire Protection (Cal fire ). A fire in Simi Valley briefly prompted evacuations on Wednesday. The largest blaze, the Basin fire in the Sierra National Forest in eastern Fresno County, covers nearly 22 square miles and is 26% contained.In Oroville, a state of emergency was declared on Tuesday night, and evacuation centers were established. The evacuation zone expanded into the foothills and rural areas beyond the city. Authorities have also warned that fire works are banned in many areas, including most of Butte County, due to the fire risk.There have been no immediate reports of property losses. However, an Associated Press photographer saw three suburban-style homes burn in Oroville. fire fighters saved one home as residents watched aircraft make water drops to contain the fire .The cause of the Grubbs fire is under investigation. Red flag warnings for critical fire weather conditions, including gusty winds and low humidity, were in effect when the fire erupted. The conditions have led Pacific Gas and Electric to implement targeted public safety power shutoffs in parts of some Northern California counties to prevent fire s from being ignited by downed or damaged wires.Hot conditions with potential triple-digit temperatures are expected to continue into next week. Authorities have warned of full legal consequences for any illegal use of fire works during the Fourth of July holiday.Governor Gavin Newsom announced late Tuesday that federal funding had been approved to assist with fire fighting efforts. The State Operations Center has been activated to coordinate California's response, dispatch mutual aid, and support communities as they respond to wildfire and excessive heat threats.In Southern California, Joshua Tree National Park officials closed Covington Flats on Wednesday due to extreme fire risk. The area is home to important Joshua tree populations, which are at risk due to abundant grass that has dried after spring rains. A June 2023 fire burned 1.6 square miles of Joshua trees and desert tortoise habitat.","Evacuation orders for the Grubbs fire in Palermo have been reduced to warnings, according to the county's evacuation map.

All the governors agree with that, president Biden agreed with that,” said Minnesota governor Tim Walz, speaking outside of the White House with New York governor Kathy Hochul and Maryland governor Wes Moore, The Hill reported.“A path to victory in November is the number one priority and that’s the number one priority of the president,” he continued.According to a report in The Hill, despite acknowledging that the presidential debate was a 'bad performance', Walz asserted that Biden is fit for officePresident Biden's re-election campaign announced that after a meeting with over 20 governors, both in-person and virtually, all participants ""reiterated their shared commitment"" to supporting Biden's victory in 2024. The campaign claimed that the purpose of the meeting was to ""discuss their continued partnership"" and seek the ""advice and expertise"" of the governors on defeating former President Trump in the upcoming election.The campaign also emphasized the significance of electing Democrats at all levels of government, including governors, Congress, and statehouses across the country. Governor Moore, considered a rising star in the Democratic party and a potential replacement for Biden, described the meeting as ""honest"" and ""candid,"" noting that the governors openly expressed their concerns and the concerns they have heard from others.""We said we will stand with him. The president has always had our backs, we're going to have his back as well,"" Moore said. Governor Hochul added that the governors ""pledged our support"" to Biden during the meeting.

However, Representative Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) expressed doubts about the current strategy, stating that he is ""taking time to seriously consider the best strategy for Democrats to win this election"" and noting that ""when your current strategy isn't working, it's rarely the right decision to double down.""Meanwhile, the White House also asserted that Biden is absolutely considering stepping down from the race.""Is President Biden considering stepping down in the race?"" reporters asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre during her daily news conference.""Absolutely not. And you heard, I believe directly from the campaign as well,"" she said amid a volley of similar questions from White House reporters.""Given the groundswell of concern from fellow Democrats, from donors, from supporters, doesn't he owe it to the American public to reflect on whether he should step down?"" she was asked again.""He's done it a couple times at this point and laid out what happened that night, talked about how he understands, and it was not his best night,"" Jean-Pierre said.""He understands that it is fair for people to ask that question, but we cannot forget his record and what he's been able to do. We cannot forget how he has been able to deliver for the American people for almost four years,"" she added.","A small group of Democratic governors on Wednesday extended their support for President Joe Biden following a White House meeting.

The CNN poll, conducted by SRS, shows Trump leading Biden by six points.Interestingly, the poll also indicates that Harris is within close range of Trump in a hypothetical matchup. The results show that ""47% of registered voters support Trump, 45% Harris, a result within the margin of error that suggests there is no clear leader under such a scenario.""The poll attributes Harris' slightly better performance against Trump to ""broader support from women (50% of female voters back Harris over Trump vs. 44% for Biden against Trump) and independents (43% Harris vs. 34% Biden).""When asked about the poll results, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refrained from directly commenting on the matter, stating that it falls under the purview of the campaign.

UN panel declares former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's detention arbitrary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/un-panel-declares-former-pakistan-pm-imran-khans-detention-arbitrary/articleshow/111412979.cms,"A panel of UN experts has determined that the detention of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is arbitrary and violates international law . The United Nations Working Group on arbitrary detention has called for Khan's immediate release, stating that his detention lacks legal basis and appears politically motivated.The working group raised serious concerns about multiple cases brought against Khan since his ousting in April 2022.Their opinion, dated March 25 but made public on Monday, highlights that Khan's deprivation of liberty breaches several international laws and norms.""Khan's detention had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office,"" the working group concluded. ""Thus, from the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose.""The five independent experts called on Pakistan 's government to ""take the steps necessary to remedy the situation of Mr Khan without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms.""""The appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law,"" they added.Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022 and has faced over 200 legal cases since his removal, which he claims is a campaign to keep him from power. He has been detained since August and barred from standing for office.In April, Pakistan's high court suspended Khan and his wife's 14-year prison sentences for graft. This month, his 10-year sentence for treason was overturned, but he remains in Adiala jail, south of Islamabad, for an illegal marriage conviction.Khan was cleared for release before those convictions in the days leading up to Pakistan's February 8 general elections.Neither Pakistan's interior nor information ministry immediately responded to a request for comment.Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party hailed the ruling as ""a huge victory.""""It has shown without any one percent of doubt that Imran Khan is innocent and has been thrown into prison illegally,"" said PTI spokesman Syad Zulfiqar Bukhari in a statement.",UN Working Group on arbitrary detention calls for immediate release of Imran Khan.

Scientists have noted an increase in clear air turbulence, attributed to climate change, with a 2023 study showing a 17 per cent rise in annual turbulence duration from 1979 to 2020, and severe cases increasing by over 50 per cent.Earlier this year, a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX, and two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 resulted in the deaths of 346 people. These events have intensified scrutiny on Boeing's safety and manufacturing practices.In response to the ongoing safety concerns, Boeing announced the departure of CEO Dave Calhoun in March and revealed plans to acquire its subcontractor Spirit to enhance safety and quality control.Boeing is also under scrutiny from the US Department of Justice (DOJ), which concluded in May that the company could face prosecution for violating a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement related to the 737 MAX crashes. The DOJ has reportedly offered Boeing a plea deal to avoid a trial, but victims' families are calling for criminal prosecution and seeking a nearly $25 billion fine.","Air Europa Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner made an emergency landing in Natal, northeastern Brazil, on Monday after encountering strong turbulence.

Bob Menendez says he didn't testify because prosecution failed to prove its bribery case against him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bob-menendez-says-he-didnt-testify-because-prosecution-failed-to-prove-its-bribery-case-against-him/articleshow/111473958.cms,"NEW YORK: New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez said he chose not to testify Wednesday at his New York trial because he believes prosecutors failed to prove ""every aspect"" of the bribery case against him, a decision that cleared the way for closing arguments as early as Monday.Lawyers for the Democrat rested their case after calling several witnesses over two days to counter seven weeks of testimony and hundreds of exhibits and communications introduced by Manhattan federal prosecutors .Menendez, 70, maintains he is not guilty of charges that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold and cash from 2018 through 2022 in exchange for using his clout in the Senate to deliver favors benefiting three New Jersey businessmen.Judge Sidney H. Stein asked Menendez to rise from his seat to confirm that the decision not to testify was his alone. Menendez said that after extensive talks with his lawyers, he had decided against taking the stand.As he left the courthouse, Menendez told reporters: ""From my perspective, the government has failed to prove every aspect of its case.""He said that to ""give them another chance"" by taking the witness stand was ""simply not something that makes any sense to me whatsoever.""""I expect my lawyers will produce a powerful and convincing summation, deduce how the evidence came out, and where they failed across the board, and how the jury will render a verdict of not guilty,"" Menendez said before wishing reporters who followed him to his car a ""Happy Fourth of July.""Two of the businessmen he is accused of accepting bribes from - Fred Daibes and Wael Hana - are on trial with him. A third, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty to charges and testified against the trio during the trial.Daibes and Hana also have pleaded not guilty and were given an opportunity to present a defense, though the judge told jurors that the burden is on prosecutors and a defense was not required. Lawyers for Daibes rested at the same time as Menendez without presenting a defense. Hana's lawyers began presenting their case by calling one of Hana's employees as a witness.Prosecutors took seven weeks to present their case before resting last Friday. They offered evidence to show that Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, served as a go-between most times to connect the senator and the businessmen.Nadine Menendez, 57, who began dating the senator in 2018, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, but her trial has been postponed as she recovers from breast cancer surgery.Lawyers for Bob Menendez have argued that his wife hid her financial troubles from him, including an inability to afford mortgage payments on her Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home, along with many of her dealings with the businessmen. They've also said she inherited gold found in her bedroom during a 2022 FBI raid on their home.An FBI agent testified earlier in the trial that he ordered the seizure of more than $486,000 in cash and over $100,000 in gold bars during the raid because he suspected that a crime may have taken place.Among witnesses called by Menendez's lawyers was his sister, Caridad Gonzalez, 80, who told the jury that members of her family routinely stored large amounts of cash at their homes after Menendez's parents fled Cuba in 1951 with only the money they had hidden in the secret compartment of a grandfather clock.""It's normal. It's a Cuban thing,"" she said.Bob Menendez was born after the family arrived in Manhattan.Menendez has pleaded not guilty to bribery, fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. After the charges were announced in September, he was forced out of his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.He has resisted calls to resign from the Senate and a month ago filed papers to run for reelection as an independent.Prosecutors allege that Daibes delivered gold bars and cash to Menendez and his wife to get the senator's help with a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, prompting Menendez to act in ways favorable to Qatar's government.They also say Menendez did things benefiting Egyptian officials in exchange for bribes from Hana as the businessman secured a valuable deal with the Egyptian government to certify that imported meat met Islamic dietary requirements.A previous corruption prosecution of Menendez on unrelated charges ended with a deadlocked jury in 2017.","Bob Menendez said he chose not to testify because he believes prosecutors failed to prove ""every aspect"" of the bribery case against him. Menendez, 70, maintains he is not guilty of charges that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold and cash from 2018 through 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111473990,imgsize-1304786,width-400,resizemode-4/111473990.jpg"

Amid uncertainty over President Joe Biden following his 'ship-wreck' debate performance , reports claimed that some White House staffers have been forced to tiptoe around Biden while briefing him on certain topics and they are scared 's***less'. Politico reported that the inner sanctum of Biden enabled what happened on the debate stage as they maintained a protective circle around him -- limiting his exposure to the media.Contrary to the perception that Biden is a very easy boss, the reports claimed that some senior officials are putting in a lot of effort to curate information for the president to avoid provoking a negative reaction.“It’s like, ‘You can’t include that, that will set him off,’ or ‘Put that in, he likes that,’” said one senior administration official. “It’s a Rorschach test, not a briefing. Because he is not a pleasant person to be around when he’s being briefed. It’s very difficult, and people are scared shitless of him,"" the report quoted an official as saying.And Biden does not take information from anyone else apart from the top aides.Senior adviser Anita Dunn, former chief of staff Ron Klain are Biden's two main advisers apart from Mike Donilon, Steve Ricchetti and Bruce Reed, as well as Ted Kaufman who could have stopped the disaster as they were familiar with Biden's sudden 'freezing off' etc but Biden reportedly told them that he was not blaming them.“The number of people who have access to the president has gotten smaller and smaller and smaller. They’ve been digging deeper into the bunker for months now,"" Politico quoted a strategist. ""The more you get into the bunker, the less you listen to anyone,"" the person added.Biden told a key ally that he was weighing in whether he should continue in the race, as reported by the New York Times but the White House rejected the report asserting that Biden was focused to deliver to the people of America.

'What does president do apart beyond 10 to 4'

'If he is awake...'

The White House briefing Wednesday saw a major firefighting on part of press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defending President Joe Biden 's dismal debate and the aftermath. The press briefing came on the back of intense speculations over Biden option out of the race, Kamala Harris' approval rate soaring, both making a joint appearance and the White House asserting that Biden is not opting out -- all in a day.Karine was asked whether Biden was jet-lagged because his international trip was almost a week and a half ago. The press secretary said Biden already spoke about the debate in front of his supporters and he owned that the debate was not his best night. In addition to two major trips, Biden was doing his presidential duties, debate preparation and he had a cold and jet lag, the press secretary said.""The president travels six time zones forward to G7 in Italy, 9 time zones back to LA and 3 time zones forward again to DC...and on top of that he did have a cold...we certainly don't want to explain that away,"" she said.Based on reports that Biden is prone to gaffes beyond the 10-4 window, the press secretary Wednesday was asked about Biden's schedule outside that specific time period. ""Well, you heard him speak to supporters yesterday outside 4 pm. You saw the president landing in North Carolina in the middle of the night. He was greeting hundreds of supporters...so he's been pretty much out there after 4 pm and before 10 am, for sure,"" she said.""Let me be very clear about this. This is a president that wakes up every morning and puts the American people first. That's what he does. He does that every single day,"" Karine told on being asked about President's nap time.'Have you had a cold before,' Karine darted to a reporter who asked her to explain how Biden was tired during the debate but delivered the next day during the campaigning.Things happen when you keep working pushing through jet lag and cold, she said. ""We didn't share the information that he had a cold ahead of the debate. We did not use that,"" the press secretary said.During the press briefing, a correspondent said they would like to invite the President to come and address them. ""Noted,"" the press secretary said.

Amid doubt over President Joe Biden 's candidacy and vice president Kamala Harris ' approval rate soaring, the duo made a surprise joint appearance Wednesday on a Democratic National Committee call, reiterating to staffers that they are in this fight for reelection together, according to AP. The agency said it was a pep talk, stressing the stakes of the election and returning to Biden's previous post-debates comments that when he gets knocked down he gets back up and still plans to win the election.The joint appearance came as New York Times reported that Biden was mulling whether to continue in the race.The report claimed Biden has told a key ally that he knows he may not be able to salvage his candidacy if he cannot convince the public in the coming days that he is up for the job. The White House, on the other hand, dismissed the reports and said Biden was not withdrawing from the race.Meanwhile, Kamala Harris emerged with a better chance of retaining the White House, according to the latest CNN poll.Biden convened the meeting with Kamala Harris and a group of influential Democratic governors amid speculations that he may announce his decision to drop out of the re-election bid. But the meeting was like a pep talk confirming that Kamala Harris was not going to take Biden's place and Biden was not mulling to opt out either.The June 27 debate saw an escalation of things as Democrats became growingly doubtful over Biden. A Democratic congressman publicly called on the president to step aside — the first lawmaker from his party to do so — and several others publicly cast doubt on his ability to beat Trump in November. Public opinion polls published since then have shown Biden losing ground to his Republican rival. A new CBS News poll conducted after the debate and published on Wednesday showed Trump with a two-point lead over Biden nationally. The same poll gave Biden a lead a month ago. On Tuesday, a CNN poll conducted after the debate showed Biden’s approval rating had plunged to an all-time low and found that Harris polled better than him in a hypothetical match-up against Trump.As a vice president, Kamala Harris had a low approval rating but as a potential replacement for Biden, her rating gained momentum after the debate. Betting markets Wednesday turned sharp upwards in Kamal's favor.The vice president maintained a low profile since the debate and her lunch Wednesday was her first face-to-face meeting with the president after the debate.","Biden and Harris made a surprise joint appearance on a Democratic National Committee call, reiterating to staffers that they are in this fight for reelection together.

At minimum, it’ll be the public’s sense of relief, akin to the feeling of gratitude that a tortured prisoner feels for his liberator.The Democrats’ ideal scenario is for the election to occur during that honeymoon phase, long before the “public scrutiny” of the new nominee begins. Every day that passes between now & late August to make the switch, the better off they will be. Conventional wisdom says it’s messy for them to swap someone out late, but it’s increasingly clear that view is wrong.""Meanwhile, the Republicans will stand for what it stands for ""irrespective of which puppet the Democratic machine puts up next"".""Individual, family, nation, and God beats race, gender, sexuality and climate.

Following a debate where Biden struggled, key figures within the party, including Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Jared Golden, have voiced their apprehensions.

Despite her clear stance, her popularity remains high, making her a significant figure in discussions about potential Democratic candidates.Why are Democrats concerned about President Joe Biden's performance?Concerns have been raised following President Biden's recent debate performance, where he ""almost fell asleep on stage"" due to a demanding travel schedule.

While he has appeared more energetic in public rallies and appearances after the debate, Biden did himself no favors by saying he nearly fell asleep during the debate because of fatigue from international travel.“I didn’t have my best night, but the fact is that you know, I wasn’t very smart,"" Biden said at a campaign fundraiser on Monday. ""I decided to travel around the world a couple times, going through around 100 time zones ... before ... the debate.""Didn’t listen to my staff and came back and nearly fell asleep on stage. That's no excuse but it is an explanation,"" he added.The US President , at 82 the oldest to hold office, traveled to France and Italy in two separate trips in two weeks last month.He flew overnight from the Group of Seven summit in Bari, Italy, to appear at a fundraiser with former President Barack Obama in Los Angeles on June 15 before returning to Washington the following day. But he then spent six days at Camp David preparing for the June 27 debate, where he suffered brain freeze on occasions and was often incomprehensible.Although party grandees like former President Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi publicly took a charitable view of the debacle, skepticism about Biden's viability for a second term is rippling through the party rank and file, with many lawmakers -- dubbed the ""bedwetting brigade"" by the President's supporters -- in a panic mode.Texas Congressman Lloyd Doggett became the first Democratic lawmaker to go public asking Biden to quit the race, saying, ""President Biden saved our democracy by delivering us from Trump in 2020. He must not deliver us to Trump in 2024.""""President Biden has continued to run substantially behind Democratic senators in key states and in most polls has trailed Donald Trump. I had hoped that the debate would provide some momentum to change that. It did not. Instead of reassuring voters, the President failed to effectively defend his many accomplishments and expose Trump's many lies,"" Doggett said.In a new effort to allay party and voter concern, Biden aides have scheduled several public events and an unscripted interview on ABC News on Friday, which will bring even greater focus on his mental acuity. Any more missteps and his candidacy may well be toast.That would bring into play, Kamala Harris, who as vice-president and his running mate in 2024, could inherit the campaign infrastructure and funds raised by Biden.Although several other prominent Democrats, including California governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer are being discussed as potential replacements, Harris has the best name recognition and the advantage of being in national office.In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, Harris, trailed Trump by one point -- 42% to 43% -- a difference well within the poll's 3.5 per cent margin of error.But Harris herself has been cautious about writing off the man who picked her to be his running mate when her presidential campaign tanked badly in 2019.""Vice President Harris looks forward to serving a second term with President Joe Biden,"" a statement from her office said on Tuesday in a vote of confidence for Biden.Despite running Trump close in the Reuters/Ipsos poll, Harris is seen as a weak candidate, partly on account of the US never having elected a woman -- much less one of color to the White House. Her performance and profile as Biden's vice-president has also not been particularly striking.But with only 47 days to go before the Democratic Convention in Chicago starting August 19 -- and 125 days till the November 5 election -- a Biden to Harris ticket would be the most obvious and logical transition given the time, money and effort it will take for other candidates to step up.","Biden has virtually sealed the party nomination well before the party convention in August.

According to reports the Trump phone messages, now released, were in a file marked 'Triangle' which was the code for the Epstein case. Before marrying Melania in 2005, Trump was calling Jeffrey Epstein on the regular in 2004. The newly revealed messages are reportedly in between girls calling to confirm massage appointments. The transcripts reveal that Florida prosecutors were aware of Epstein's sexual transgression two years before they cut a plea deal. The transcripts show that the grand jury heard testimony that Epstein, who was then in his 40s, had raped teenage girls as young as 14 at his Palm Beach mansion, often paying them so he could commit statutory rape or assault. The teenagers testified and told detectives they were also paid cash or rented cars if they found him more girls. Another teenager told detectives that she was 17 years old when she was approached by a friend who said she could make $200 by providing a massage at Epstein’s home.

New documents which were unreleased so far claim that Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were closer than it was believed. Transcripts show Trump called Epstein many times between 2004 and 2006. The screenshots were sealed in 2008 as part of Alexander Acosta's deal for Jeffrey Epstein and were released on July 1.The fresh revelation has the anti-Trump camp up in the arms ahead of the election.""Trump’s name appears over and over again on Jeffrey Epstein’s message logs in the grand jury docs released this week. It is also undisputed: Trump’s name appears 7 times on Epstein’s private jet flight logs, that Epstein flew on Trump’s jet with a young girl of indeterminate age, girls who Epstein trafficked worked at Mar-A-Lago, a girl Epstein trafficked mentioned visiting Trump’s casino in a recently released deposition transcript. Trump said Epstein is a great guy who likes girls on the younger side, Trump frequently “partied” with Epstein, Trump wished Ghislaine Maxwell well at her criminal trial, and someone who testified under the pseudonym JANE DOE at the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal trial stated that she was introduced to Trump by Epstein when she was 14 years old,"" a user posted on X.As the transcripts went viral on X, a community note claimed Donald Trump and Epstein talked about a piece of real estate in which they both were interested.

In an interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, she said politics is a ""rough, rough business"" and a ""pretty dark world"" but she is there to support her father.Having left politics, she will not be there in any political capacity at the event though.Ivanka spoke about her father's conviction in the hush money case and said it was painful to experience. “On a human level, it’s my father and I love him very much, so it’s painful to experience, but ultimately, I wish it didn’t have to be this way,” Ivanka said.During Trump's presidency, Ivanka served as a senior advisor in the administration but in the last four years, she recoiled from politics and has not been a part of her father's 2024 campaign. She said politics is not a part-time business and it was not possible for her to balance her family and a political role simultaneously.“I think first and foremost, it was a decision rooted in me being a parent, really thinking about what they need from me now...Politics is a rough, rough business and I think it’s one that you also can’t dabble in. I think you have to either be all in or all out,"" she told Fridman.“And I know today, the cost [my children] would pay for me being all in, emotionally in terms of my absence at such a formative point in their life. And I’m not willing to make them bear that cost, the mother of Arabella (12), Joseph (9) and Theodore (7) said.“I also think for politics, it’s a pretty dark world. There’s a lot of darkness, a lot of negativity, and it’s just really at odds with what feels good for me as a human being,” she said.","Ivanka spoke about her father's conviction in the hush money case and said it was painful to experience.

Ra'Ad: Pakistan arming JF-17 jets with Ra'ad nuke missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-arming-jf-17-jets-with-raad-nuke-missiles/articleshow/111454243.cms,"A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft. The photograph depicts a JF-17 carrying what appears to be a Ra'ad air-launched cruise missile (ALCM), marking the first public observation of this configuration.Analyzing images of a JF-17 Thunder Block II from the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade rehearsals, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) confirmed that the fighter jet was equipped with a Ra'ad-I nuclear missile.""Notably, this was the first time such a configuration had been observed in public,"" the FAS said in its report.To determine the specific type of Ra'ad missile in the image, comparisons were made with Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II missiles displayed in previous Pakistan Day Parades. While the Ra'ad-II, first unveiled in 2017, was presented as having nearly double the range capability of the Ra'ad-I, external features did not clearly distinguish the two versions until 2022. The latest Ra'ad-II, displayed in 2022 and 2024, features a distinct 'x-shaped' tail fin configuration, while the missile photographed on the JF-17 more closely resembles the 'twin-tail' configuration of the Ra'ad-I, the FAS report said.Using Photoshop's Vanishing Point feature and reference measurements from the vehicles carrying the missiles, the lengths of the Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II were estimated to be around 4.9 meters each. The missile on the JF-17 was also measured using the aircraft's length as a reference, resulting in a similar 4.9-meter estimate. These measurements, along with the tail fin configuration, suggest that the missile observed on the JF-17 is likely the Ra'ad-I ALCM rather than the newer Ra'ad-II or the conventional anti-ship variant, Taimoor, the FAS report by Eliana Johns said.The image provides evidence that Pakistan has made significant progress in equipping its JF-17s with the capability to supplement or replace the nuclear strike role of the ageing Mirage III/Vs. However, questions remain about the deployment status of the Ra'ad systems and whether Pakistan will continue to retain a nuclear gravity bomb capability or transition to stand-off cruise missiles exclusively.These developments occur amidst an ongoing nuclear arms competition in the region, with Pakistan, India, and China pursuing advanced technologies such as multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). The heightened tensions and the development of short-range, lower-yield nuclear-capable systems by Pakistan have raised concerns about accelerated arms racing and escalation risks in a potential conflict between India and Pakistan.",A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft.

"Pakistan slams UN body report calling Imran’s arrest 'arbitrary, politically motivated'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-slams-un-body-report-calling-imrans-arrest-arbitrary-politically-motivated/articleshow/111440399.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday denounced a UN report that termed the detention of former prime minister Imran Khan as “arbitrary and in violation of international law”, asserting that the arrest of the cricketer-turned-politician and the cases against him were an “internal matter” of the country.Imran, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.The Election Commission of Pakistan subsequently disqualified him for five years, ahead of the national elections in Feb. He is also facing prosecution in the cipher and Iddat cases.In an opinion released on Monday, the Geneva-based UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Imran’s detention had no legal basis, and appeared to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office. “…From the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose,” it stated, adding that Imran’s legal woes were part of a “much larger campaign of repression” against him and his party.In the run-up to the 2024 general election, the working group report stated, PTI members were arrested and tortured and their rallies were disrupted. It also alleged “widespread fraud on the election day”.The “appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law”, the UN working group said.Imran and his party have always maintained that the charges against him are politically motivated and aimed at thwarting his return to power.In recent months, courts have suspended Imran’s sentence in some cases and also overturned his conviction on charges of leaking state secrets. However, he has remained behind bars following his conviction in the Iddat case, with a trial court ruling that Imran’s 2018 marriage had violated Islamic law. Khan also faces a trial under anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence in May last year.Responding to the UN report, Pakistan’s law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said, “As a sovereign state, the constitution and prevailing laws are enforced by courts in Pakistan. PTI founder has all rights as per the national constitution and law and international norms. He is in jail as a convicted prisoner.”In his statement, Tarar said court relief to the PTI founder in some of the cases was “a reflection of a transparent and fair trial and judicial system”. “Any demand beyond the constitution, law and international norms will be called discriminatory, biased and unfair,” he added.Last Friday, Pakistan’s parliament had denounced a US congressional resolution that called for an independent investigation into allegations that the country’s elections were rigged.",Imran Khan has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.

This sentencing follows a severe mob attack targeting Christians in the eastern Punjab province last year.In August 2023, violence erupted in Faisalabad's Jaranwala when some local Muslims claimed to have seen a Christian, Raja Amir, and his friend tearing pages from a Quran, throwing them on the ground, and writing insulting remarks on other pages.Police chief Rizwan Khan said the alleged act angered the local Muslims, who attacked multiple churches and several Christian homes, burning furniture and other household items. Some members of the Christian community fled their homes to escape the mob.Ehsan Shan, who was not directly involved in the alleged desecration, was accused of reposting the defaced Quranic pages on his TikTok account, according to his lawyer, Khurram Shahzad.

When the sentry obliged, the prisoner overpowered him, snatched his keys, and opened other barracks from where at least 19 prisoners made their way to the main gate, according to Dawn citing police.At that time, a pistol was thrown inside through the roof , which was used to break the lock from the inside.

Wickremesinghe responds to critics on Sri Lanka's debt restructuring deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/wickremesinghe-responds-to-critics-on-sri-lankas-debt-restructuring-deal/articleshow/111427573.cms,"COLMBO: Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday countered the Opposition's criticism of the cash-strapped country's external debt restructuring agreement with major bilateral creditors and promised to table all agreements and documents regarding debt restructuring to a parliamentary panel for scrutiny. The planned two-day debate in Parliament on the deal was, however, postponed as Opposition members protested the lack of transparency regarding the agreements reached.Dismissing the Opposition's criticism as inaccurate, Wickremesinghe argued, ""No bilateral creditor would agree to a reduction of principal amount.Instead, concessions are allowed through extended repayment periods, grace periods and lower interest rates .""The president, who also holds the portfolio as the finance minister, said the agreements with bilateral creditors include extending principal repayments until 2028, maintaining interest rates below 2.1 per cent, and extending the full debt resettlement grace period until 2043.Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka's external debt now totals USD 37 billion, which includes USD 10.6 billion in bilateral credit and USD 11.7 billion in multilateral credit. The commercial debt is USD 14.7 billion, of which USD 12.5 billion is in sovereign bonds. The debt restructuring, he said, aims at making the debt sustainable, freeing up funds for public services.President Wickremesinghe said he would submit all agreements and documents regarding debt restructuring to the Public Finance Committee of Parliament, emphasising the need for thorough scrutiny and broad attention to the matter, his office posted on X.He said the restructuring of debt was to make it sustainable and would make way for allocating more funds for public services.""The country is now able to secure foreign loans and resume projects that had been halted midway due to lack of foreign funding,"" Wickremesinghe said.Foreign lending to Sri Lanka ceased in April 2022 when the government declared a sovereign default.Wickremesinghe acknowledged the short-term credit assistance provided by India and Bangladesh during that period. ""At that stage we were helped by two friendly nations -- India and Bangladesh -- who gave us short term credit assistance. No other country was permitted to extend long term loans,"" he said.Wickremesinghe assured that all debt restructuring agreements would be presented to Parliament once the ongoing talks with sovereign bond holders concluded.Wickremesinghe's statement was followed by the main opposition leader, Sajith Premadasa, who reiterated that the government has failed to secure the best possible deal in the debt restructuring process.","Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe promises to table all agreements and documents regarding debt restructuring to a parliamentary panel for scrutiny.

She stated that the Taliban authorities were informed that women must be included in public life, despite their refusal to sit across the table with Afghan civil society in this format.The UN-hosted meeting, which began on Sunday, is the third such gathering to be held in Qatar in just over a year, but the first to include the Taliban authorities who regained power in Afghanistan in 2021.The talks were intended to discuss increasing engagement with Afghanistan and a more coordinated response to the country, including economic issues and counter-narcotics efforts. However, the international community has struggled with its approach to the Taliban since their return to power, with no country officially recognizing their government.The Taliban refused an invitation to Doha talks in February, insisting on being the only Afghan representatives, to the exclusion of civil society groups. However, their condition was accepted in the build-up to this latest round. The United States agreed to participate in Monday's talks after receiving assurances that the talks would meaningfully discuss human rights.US representatives ""made clear that the Afghan economy cannot grow while half the population's rights are not respected"", according to State Department spokesman Vedant Patel.DiCarlo, who chaired the UN talks in the Qatari capital, expressed hope that ""there'll be new consideration"" of Taliban government policy on women in public life, including girls' education.The UN and international delegations will have the chance to meet with civil society representatives, including women's rights groups, following the close of the main meetings.

The formal announcement of this new alliance is expected soon. “Agreement has been signed between Nepali Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli overnight to form a new government. As per which Oli will lead the government for the next one and a half years and Deuba the remaining time until the election which lies three years ahead,” a senior Nepali Congress leader present at the meeting told news agency ANI.The two parties also agreed on the division of ministries. According to a UML leader, the party leading the government will not get the home ministry. Apart from the central government, the two parties also agreed on the distribution of leadership in various provinces. The CPN-UML will lead the governments in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces, while the Congress will lead in Bagmati, Gandaki, and Far-Western provinces. The Madhesh-based parties will head the government in Madhesh Province. The UML leader confirmed, “The party who will be leading the government will not get the Home Ministry has been agreed. Apart from the union government, the CPN-UML will be forming a government in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces while the Congress will lead the Bagmati, Gandaki and Far-Western provinces. The Madhesh-based parties will lead the government in Madhesh Province has been agreed between the two leaders.”Additionally, the new alliance has established a committee to suggest amendments to the election procedures and the constitution. The committee is led by former Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha. The largest and second-largest parties in the parliament also drafted a constitutional amendment agreement, which states that the Vice President would be made the chairman of the National Assembly.Before signing, leaders from the Congress and UML briefed President Ram Chandra Paudel about the coalition change. During their meeting, the leaders informed the President about activating Section 76 (2) to form a new government if the incumbent Prime Minister, Prachanda, failed to take a vote of confidence after UML withdrew its support.Prachanda, who came to power after the 2022 general elections and has tested the floor of parliament four times, must now seek a new vote of confidence. There has been no immediate reaction from the Maoist Center, led by Prachanda, regarding the change in coalition. However, during Monday's cabinet meeting, Dahal assured the ministers that the current alliance would remain intact.The minister for communication and information technology Rekha Sharma, quoting Dahal, said, “The reports in the media are just rumors. We are still in dialogue with our coalition partners.” “The Prime Minister briefed us on the internal situation and dismissed external rumors. There are concerns about what will happen to this government, but there will be no changes. Some want this coalition to be short-lived, but we are determined to keep this government stable for a long time,” she added.Earlier on March 4, Prachanda revived a coalition with the CPN-UML, surprising the largest coalition partner, Nepali Congress. A new coalition, including the CPN-UML, CPN-Maoist Center, Rastriya Swatantra Party, and Janata Samajwadi Party, was initially formed. However, the Nepali Congress formally withdrew its support the following day, activating Article 100 Sub-section (2). According to this article, a Prime Minister is required to secure the threshold of 50 percent, which is 138 votes as per the present number of parliamentarians.As a result of the coalition split, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also left the government and joined the opposition. Pushpa Kamal Dahal came to power in December 2022 by aligning with arch-rival CPN-UML, after previously forging an alliance with the Nepali Congress for the November 2022 election.The vote of confidence on January 10, 2023, saw extensive support for Dahal, with 268 out of 270 present parliamentarians voting in favor, marking the highest percentage in the known history of the Nepali parliament since the establishment of democracy. However, within three months, Dahal realigned with the Nepali Congress, securing a majority in the vote of confidence on March 20, 2023. In this second vote, Dahal received 172 votes out of 262 lawmakers present, with 89 votes against him, while one abstained.","The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) ( CPN-UML ) struck a deal to form a new coalition government.
