US woman found innocent after 43 years in prison for murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-woman-found-innocent-after-43-years-in-prison-for-murder/articleshow/111031388.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: A Missouri judge overturned the conviction of Sandra Hemme , a woman who has been in prison for 43 years for a murder her attorneys argue was committed by a now-discredited police officer.Judge Ryan Horsman ruled that Hemme had established evidence of actual innocence and must be released within 30 days unless prosecutors decide to retry her. The judge cited ineffective trial counsel and the failure of prosecutors to disclose evidence that would have helped Hemme's case.Hemme's attorneys from the New York-based Innocence Project claim that this is the longest time a woman has been wrongfully imprisoned . They have filed a motion seeking her immediate release and have vowed to continue their efforts to dismiss the charges and reunite Hemme with her family.When Hemme was first questioned about the death of 31-year-old library worker Patricia Jeschke, she was heavily sedated and restrained, according to her lawyers. They allege that authorities ignored Hemme's inconsistent statements and suppressed evidence implicating Michael Holman, a then-police officer who tried to use the victim's credit card.The judge noted that ""no evidence whatsoever outside of Hemme's unreliable statements connects her to the crime,"" while ""the evidence directly ties Holman to this crime and murder scene.""The case began on November 13, 1980, when Jeschke's mother discovered her daughter's body in her apartment. Hemme, who had a history of hospitalizations for mental health issues, became a suspect nearly two weeks later.During interrogations, Hemme was being treated with antipsychotic drugs that caused involuntary muscle spasms and made it difficult for her to comprehend the questions. Despite the inconsistencies in her statements, Hemme eventually pleaded guilty to capital murder in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. However, her plea was later thrown out on appeal, and she was convicted again in 1985 after a one-day trial in which jurors were not informed of the coercive nature of her interrogations.Larry Harman, who helped Hemme get her initial guilty plea overturned and later became a judge, believed in her innocence and said, ""the system failed her at every opportunity.""",Sandra Hemme has been in prison for 43 years for a murder her attorneys argue was committed by a now-discredited police officer.

This town is located about 62 miles northwest of Los Angeles, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The flames broke out around 1:45 pm, with authorities promptly notifying the public.Evacuations are currently in place near Pyramid Lake , Gorman Post Road, the Hungry Valley SVRA recreation area, and surrounding communities in the Grapevine area . The 5 Freeway has been closed in both directions at Quail Lake and Gorman Post Road.Initially, the fire was reported on the side of the southbound lanes of the 5 Freeway. It later spread from a hillside to a nearby auto repair shop, destroying the building and numerous parked cars in the lot.Additionally, the 5 Freeway has been closed in both directions at Quail Lake and Gorman Post Road.“It started as a brush fire,” said D C Williams with the California Highway Patrol. “It jumped the road, unfortunately taking out the auto shop and some cars in the parking lot. Fortunately, it missed a school. The wind is blowing extremely strong, which isn’t helping things. Unfortunately, it is still growing.”Helicopters and aircraft from several fire departments have responded, dropping water and flame retardants on the growing flames.It's unclear how the fire started or if any containment has been achieved.

"Gates begins building smaller, cheaper nuclear reactors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gates-begins-building-smaller-cheaper-nuclear-reactors/articleshow/111028285.cms,"Kemmerer, Wyoming: Outside a small coal town in southwest Wyoming , a multibillion-dollar effort to build the first in a new generation of US nuclear power plants is underway. Workers began construction Tuesday on a novel type of nuclear reactor meant to be smaller and cheaper than the hulking reactors of old and designed to produce electricity without the carbon dioxide that is rapidly heating the planet.The reactor being built by TerraPower , a startup, won't be finished until 2030 and faces daunting obstacles. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission hasn't yet approved the design, and the company will have to overcome the inevitable delays and cost overruns that have doomed countless nuclear projects before.What TerraPower does have, however, is an influential and deep-pocketed founder. Bill Gates , currently ranked as the seventh-richest person in the world, has poured more than $1 billion of his fortune into TerraPower, an amount that he expects to increase. ""If you care about climate, there are many, many locations around the world where nuclear has got to work,"" Gates said during an interview near the project site Monday.""Wind and solar are absolutely fantastic, and we have to build them as fast as we can, but the idea that we don't need anything beyond that is very unlikely,"" Gates said.As demand for electricity surges because of new data centers, factories and electric vehicles, there is a renewed enthusiasm around nuclear energy .Traditional reactors are huge, complex, strictly regulated projects that are difficult to build and finance. And nuclear power is prohibitively expensive. The only two US reactors built in the past 30 years, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia, cost $35 billion, more than double initial estimates. Gates is betting that radically different technology will help. With TerraPower, he funded a team of engineers to redesign a nuclear plant from scratch.Today, every US nuclear plant uses light-water reactors, in which water is pumped into a reactor core and heated by atomic fission, producing steam to create electricity. Because the water is highly pressurized, these plants need heavy piping and thick containment shields to protect against accidents. TerraPower's reactor, by contrast, uses liquid sodium instead of water, allowing it to operate at lower pressures. In theory, that reduces the need for thick shielding. In an emergency, the plant can be cooled with air vents rather than complicated pump systems. The reactor is just 345 megawatts, one-third the size of Vogtle reactors, making for a smaller investment.Chris Levesque, TerraPower's CEO, said its reactors should ultimately produce electricity at half the cost of traditional nuclear plants. ""This is a much simpler plant,"" he said. ""That gives us both a safety benefit and a cost benefit.""","Bill Gates has poured more than $1 billion of his fortune into TerraPower, a startup.

Clash between Pakistan judiciary & military establishment intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/clash-between-pakistan-judiciary-military-establishment-intensifies/articleshow/111007675.cms,"Islamabad: The clash between Pakistan’s superior judiciary and the powerful military establishment has intensified as judges have started questioning the conduct of serving army and Inter-Services Intelligence officers over their blatant interference in judicial matters.Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics such as secret surveillance, and even abduction and torture of their family members, to secure favourable outcomes in political cases related to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.Addressing an event in the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Friday, Lahore high court chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad claimed he has received complaints — many verbally — and letters regarding interference in judicial matters by “institutions” (a reference to the army and ISI).“But I have full faith that this interference of the (military) establishment in the judiciary will come to its end very soon,” he asserted.He said he was saying so not just because it was “part of my faith but also includes my experience”.“To get rid of the (military) establishment’s interference, we have to face it with bravery, courage, and without any fear, and with the belief that this interference, God-willing, will end soon,” the Lahore CJ said. “Temporary worries do come but you have to face them eye to eye and not be a target of any of their blackmailing. Do not be hesitant to make any kind of sacrifice,” he added.Justice Ahmad said Pakistan was currently “going through one of the longest periods of a civil government”, adding that the 2007 lawyers’ movement “closed the doors for martial law forever”.On Wednesday, the Lahore HC had summoned Punjab police chief Usman Anwar and other officials on a complaint from a presiding judge of an anti-terrorism court alleging harassment by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.On June 7, the HC registrar’s office had received a special report on district and sessions judge Muhammad Abbas wherein he had said that on May 25, the first day of his new charge, a message was conveyed to him that some ISI authority wanted to meet him in his chamber.Upon refusing to meet the said authority, Abbas alleged that ever since then he had been encountering various incidents, such as firing outside his court in Punjab’s Sargodha city and questioning of family members, among other things.Earlier, in March, six of the eight Islamabad HC judges had penned a startling letter to Supreme Court judges, regarding attempts by the ISI to pressure them through the abduction and torture of their relatives as well as secret surveillance inside their homes.

However, Maulana Rehman refused to join the government, a JUI-F spokesperson said.""I don't think it's true (that the JUI-F will join the government). Seeking power is not a part of our politics. We already had a better offer before the formation of the present government,"" the spokesperson claimed.Maulana Rehman led an opposition alliance, namely the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM), during the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government of Imran Khan.The PDM later formed a government at the centre, led by prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, after the ouster of Imran Khan's government in a vote of no-confidence in April 2022.The fissures within Pakistan's ruling coalition government have surfaced in recent days, with the PPP, a key ally, accusing the ruling PML-N of side lining its inputs in the preparation of the annual budget and questioning if the Shehbaz Sharif-led government still values its support.The PPP expressed its reservations in its parliamentary committee meeting presided over by the party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday, ahead of the presentation of the budget for the financial year 2024-25 in Parliament.The PPP has blamed the PML-N government for not taking any inputs from the party while preparing the annual budget and wondered if it still wanted the ally's support.",Shehbaz Sharif has invited his former ally JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to become a part of the ruling coalition.

The judge has been hearing the cases against opposition leader in parliament Omar Ayub and other workers of Imran's PTI party in connection with the May 9, 2023 violence related to attacks on military installations in May last year. Ayub had alleged last week at a hearing that the judge was ""hostage"" of the intelligence agencies.

CJ Ahmad Khan summoned Punjab IGP Usman Anwar on Thursday and asked him why the roads leading to anti-terrorism court (Sargodha), some 200 km from Lahore, were closed by police when the judge refused to meet an ISI officer. The IGP replied: ""The roads were closed as the judge was facing serious threats"". The chief justice reserved his verdict on the alleged harassment of the ATC judge by the ISI.

In March, six judges of the Islamabad high court reached out to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) informing alleged intrusion of intelligence operatives in judicial matters.

Pakistan plans to borrow $23 billion in next fiscal year: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-plans-to-borrow-23-billion-in-next-fiscal-year-report/articleshow/110964344.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan plans to borrow at least $23 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, including a $12 billion bilateral debt rollover, to support its development initiatives and meet external financing needs, according to a media report on Thursday.This reliance on global financial institutions like the IMF will continue to shape the country's foreign and economic policies. The budget documents for fiscal year 2024-25 revealed that Pakistan would borrow a minimum of $23.2 billion, or Rs 5.9 trillion, excluding any loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as reported by The Express Tribune newspaper. The IMF loan will be used for balance of payments support.The government has incorporated $20 billion of the total $23 billion in budget documents. The rollover of $3 billion by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has not been included in the federal books as it is intended for balance of payments support. The details indicate that Pakistan will take $19 billion in loans to finance its budget and build foreign exchange reserves. This substantial amount will maintain the country's dependence on the IMF, World Bank, Saudi Arabia, China, the UAE, and the Islamic Development Bank, which are now imposing their terms due to Pakistan's ongoing reliance on them.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced receiving investment pledges of $15 billion from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but these promises have not yet materialized into formal agreements. The government has once again budgeted $3.9 billion for foreign commercial loans in the new fiscal year, despite being unable to secure new debt from foreign commercial banks. In the current year, China rolled over $1 billion of commercial debt.There were expectations that international credit rating agencies would upgrade Pakistan's junk rating under the $3 billion IMF standby arrangement. However, political and economic vulnerabilities hindered any improvement in Pakistan's standing. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated on Tuesday that the rating agencies were awaiting approval of the new Extended Fund Facility from the IMF. If the ratings do not improve soon, the government's plan to raise $4.9 billion through Eurobond and foreign commercial loans may not materialize.The government has again included the rollover of $5 billion in cash deposits from Saudi Arabia, indicating that the country will be unable to return the money, of which $3 billion was taken in 2019 for just one year. However, Saudi Arabia has not agreed to extend the $1 billion oil facility to the next fiscal year, leading the government to exclude it from the projection of external loan receipts. Similarly, no new loan from Saudi Arabia for petrol imports has been included.China's $4 billion cash deposit has been added to the rollover queue once more, with $2 billion maturing next month. The UAE's financing has not been included in the federal borrowing plan as the funds are provided for balance of payments support and will be serviced by the central bank from its profits. Out of the $3 billion, $1 billion is maturing next month.The government has also estimated a new loan of $500 million from the Islamic Development Bank and $465 million from Naya Pakistan Certificates. Approximately $1.1 billion will be borrowed to finance the federal Public Sector Development Programme, according to the report.","Pakistan plans to borrow at least $23 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, including a $12 billion bilateral debt rollover.

Then why nobody speaking about other livestock

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has recently released its Economic Survey but all everyone cares about is the population of donkeys in the country -- the increase in the number, to be specific. The population has increased by 1.72%to reach 5.9 million during the fiscal year 2023-24. The data reveals that the number has been on a steady rise: 5.5 million in 2019-2020, 5.6 million in 2020-21, 5.7 million in 2021-22, and 5.8 million in 2022-23, while it jumped to 5.9 million in 2023-24.Livestock plays a crucial role in Pakistan's economy and hence the economic survey reveals the figures of all livestock populations including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, horses, donkeys and mules. In fact, the population of cattle has also increased by 2 million.""The focus of the present government is on breed improvement for enhanced productivity, establishing a nucleus herd, identifying breeds well adapted to various agro-ecological zones of Pakistan, and importing high-yielding exotic dairy, beef, mutton breeds, and genetic materials (semen, ova, embryos). By implementing these measures, the government aims to stimulate growth in the livestock sector, generate employment opportunities, and contribute to the country's overall economic growth and foodsecurity,"" the Economic Survey document said.Pakistan has the world's third-highest population of donkeys. Ethiopia and China rank first and second. Pakistan's donkey population is an international issue as China wants to import donkeys from Pakistan. China needs more donkeys to obtain gelatin from their skin for Chinese medicine manufacture. A report said China in 2022 expressed its interest in importing donkeys and dogs from Pakistan.Eying at an impetus to the donkey export, the Pakistan government set up a farm of over 3,000 acres in Okara district in its Punjab province which is used to rear donkeys of ""great breeds"", including American. China earlier used to import its stock of donkeys from Niger and Burkina Faso but then turned to Pakistan after the two West African countries banned their export.(Image AI generated)","Pakistan has the world's third-highest population of donkeys.

Pakistan has been in talks with the IMF for a loan estimated to range from $6 billion to $8 billion as it seeks to avert a default in the face of its economy growing the slowest among all countries of the region.Islamabad entered into a $6.5 billion three-year agreement with IMF in 2019. It received a final $3 billion under a standby arrangement last year, just before the agreement was to expire.The finance ministry and IMF were reportedly locked in last-minute talks as the global lender presented some more tough conditions last week to include in the budget.A ministry official said the IMF's key demands include a higher tax revenue target, withdrawal of subsidies, taxes on the agriculture sector, increased taxes and levies on the power, gas, and oil sectors, privatisation of sick govt organisations and units, and improved administration.Despite Pakistan's aggressive pursuit of economic diplomacy to improve trade and investment ties with other nations, finance ministerMuhammad Aurangzeb , who presented the budget in parliament, explicitly said there were no alternatives to IMF under the current circumstances.""As you all know, I have been in this role for about three to three and a half months,"" he said at a presser. ""But even when I was in the private sector, I was very loud and clear that we should go into the IMF programme because there is no plan B. If there were a plan B, the IMF would not be called the lender of last resort. There's a reason for that.""Even with depleted foreign reserves and an economic crisis, the govt allocated 2,100 billion rupees to defence in the federal budget, a 19% increase over the previous year.

This allowed elected local representatives to continue the provision of services to their electorate. The local elections were subsequently held in August 2023 for 72 key positions in 21 districts.Commenting on the law and order situation in the province, the rights body alleged that over 160 policemen, 70 military personnel, 60 civilians, and more than 170 alleged militants were killed in dozens of targeted militant attacks and security operations in 2023.Attempting to address the situation, Pakistan forcibly deported over 1.5 million documented and 0.7 million undocumented Afghan refugees and migrants from the province following an announcement by the federal caretaker government.Shedding light on the financial issues faced by people, the rights body stated that hundreds of teachers, doctors, health workers, and sanitation workers protested against delays in payment of salaries and other dues in separate demonstrations across the province in 2023.The report also addressed the status of Public health and environmental crises which has been a major issue of concern to the citizens. The HRCP report stated, that at least 11 per cent of the population suffers from drug abuse, and around 40 fatalities from rains, flash floods, and dust storms occur in several districts.Persons with disabilities also remained deprived of essential accessibility measures in most buildings despite court orders, and 4.7 million children, 66 per cent of which included girls, remained out of school in 2023, the report added.According to HRCP's media monitoring for 2023, there were at least 20 cases of domestic violence, 72 cases of sexual violence, 49 'honour' killings, and 246 femicide-related murders that reportedly took place in the province.HRCP cited a report from the Digital Rights Foundation, which stated that 112 complaints related to cyber harassment and gender-based violence were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In January, women councilors from the Khyber district elected in the 2021 local government polls protested the denial of functional authority and development funds to help female constituents of their areas.While over 100 women contested in the polls and several were elected, they had neither been provided offices nor resources, unlike their male counterparts, thereby lowering their status in people's perceptions, the report added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in its annual report, highlighted the precarious situation of human rights, law and order.

Myanmar rebels face new threat as junta deploys armed drones in civil war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmar-rebels-face-new-threat-as-junta-deploys-armed-drones-in-civil-war/articleshow/110968211.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a significant development in Myanmar's ongoing civil war , resistance fighters who had previously relied on a scattered fleet of modified Chinese-made commercial drones to battle against the country's feared military are now finding their familiar weapons in the hands of the ruling junta .According to seven people with knowledge of the matter, the rebels have encountered the junta's use of armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in recent months, marking a shift in the conflict's dynamics.""The battle is changing now as drones are being used by both sides,"" said a 31-year-old rebel fighter in the country's southeast, identifying himself by the nom de guerre of Ta Yoke Gyi.He and other rebel fighters described instances where the junta had deployed modified Chinese-manufactured drones to carry explosives and attack rebel positions. Some resistance fighters have been injured in these attacks, highlighting the junta's improved proficiency in utilizing UAVs.According to Min Zaw Oo, executive director of the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security think-tank, the junta began procuring thousands of Chinese commercial UAVs at the start of the year, modifying them to carry locally-manufactured munitions. While the junta has not publicly addressed its recent use of UAVs, regime leader Min Aung Hlaing acknowledged last year that rebels had dropped over 25,000 bombs using drones during a major October offensive on military posts.Despite the junta's acquisition of armed CH-3 UAVs from China around 2013, resistance members report that the military is currently deploying multi-rotor commercial drones, including those designed for agriculture, in their latest sorties. The limited number of junta drones observed on the frontline suggests that the military has not yet deployed all of its newly procured aircraft.As the civil war continues, the resistance appears to have lost its early advantage of being the main fighting force using drones, according to analysts and rebel fighters. The junta's expanding UAV attack fleet is a welcome development for demoralized military forces relying on conscription to replenish shrinking frontline battalions. As the military retrains and refits, it is expected to maintain a defensive posture while harassing opposition positions with drones.(With inputs from agencies)","Rebels had previously relied on a scattered fleet of modified Chinese-made commercial drones to battle against the country's feared military.

"No competitive politics left in Bangladesh, says nobel laureate Yunus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/no-competitive-politics-left-in-bangladesh-says-nobel-laureate-yunus/articleshow/110901366.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh has turned into a ""one-party"" state as the ruling party stamps out political competition, Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, a pioneer of the global microcredit movement, said in an interview.An election in January won prime minister Sheikh Hasina a fourth straight term, but it was boycotted by the main opposition party, whose top leaders were either jailed or in exile ahead of the poll.Yunus, who helped to lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans of sums less than $100 to the rural poor, angered Hasina with a 2007 plan to set up a political party.The 2006 Nobel laureate accused Hasina's ruling Awami League party of being involved in rampant corruption, saying Bangladesh lacked a genuine political opposition.""Bangladesh doesn't have any politics left,"" Yunus, 83, said last week in his office in Dhaka, the capital. ""There's only one party which is active and occupies everything, does everything, gets to the elections in their way.""He added, ""They get their people elected in many different forms- proper candidates, dummy candidates, independent candidates - but all from the same party.""Law minister Anisul Huq said he completely disagreed with Yunus' comments, however.""It's not only I who disagree, but the people of the country will also disagree,"" Huq told Reuters by telephone, calling the remarks an ""insult"" to the people of the country.""Democracy is fully functional in this country,"" he added.Yunus, an economist who won the Nobel for his work on microcredit, was forced out of Grameen Bank in 2011 by Hasina's government, which said he had stayed on past the legal retirement age of 60.Hasina, 76, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of the South Asian nation killed in an army coup in 1975, along with most of his family. She first became prime minister in 1996.As Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister, Hasina has been credited with turning around the economy, though critics have also accused her of human rights violations and suppression of dissent.The US state department said January's elections were not free and fair while the British government's foreign office also condemned acts of ""intimidation and violence"".At the time, the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) denounced the exercise as a ""sham"" election, calling for its cancellation, Hasina's resignation and the formation of a non-party neutral government to hold a fresh one.Just before the election, a court in Bangladesh had sentenced Yunus to six months in prison for violations of labour law, which he denied.Although he is not in prison after securing bail in that case, Yunus faces more than 100 cases regarding the violations and graft accusations, which he dismissed as ""very flimsy, made-up stories"".Huq denied the accusations against Yunus were false, however, adding, ""He has gone to the highest court of the country, which found there was a case against him.""As an example, Huq cited taxes paid by Yunus after the supreme court ruled against him in a tax-evasion case, but declined comment on others as being sub-judice.Yunus' supporters say Hasina's government has sought to discredit him because he once considered setting up the political party, called ""Citizens' Power"".Hasina, who denies the contention, called Yunus a ""bloodsucker"" of the poor in 2011.""Is it a crime for a citizen to try to make a political party?"" Yunus asked, saying he dropped the idea of such a party after just 10 weeks, on realising that he was not suited to politics.Reviving a competitive political landscape in Bangladesh will be difficult, however, Yunus said.""Restarting will be very painful because we have brought it to a point where it has completely disappeared.""","Bangladesh has turned into a ""one-party"" state, Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus says.
