"Typhoon Shanshan brings torrential rains, travel turmoil across Japan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/typhoon-shanshan-brings-torrential-rains-travel-turmoil-across-japan/articleshow/112910794.cms,"FUKUOKA: Typhoon Shanshan deluged large parts of Japan with torrential rain on Friday, prompting warnings for flooding and landslides hundreds of miles from the storm 's centre, halting travel services and shutting production at major factories .In the southwestern region of Kyushu , where what authorities say could be one of the strongest storms ever to hit the region made landfall on Thursday, residents in Fukuoka city were hunkering down, with streets quiet and shops shuttered.Sheltering at the entrance of a rain-lashed, deserted shopping mall near the city's train station, university student Kokoro Osoegawa, 21, was struggling to get home.""There are no trains because of the typhoon so my parents are coming to pick me up. I stayed at a friend’s house, and then came here. I thought there would be some trains but there are none,"" she said.""I’ve never experienced all the trains stopping before.""At least three people have been killed and 78 injured in storm-related incidents in recent days, according to the disaster management agency.Bringing gusts of up to 50 metres per second (180 km per hour/112 mph), strong enough to blow over moving trucks, the typhoon was near the coastal city of Kunisaki in Oita Prefecture at 8:45 a.m. (2345 GMT) and moving northeast, according to authorities.Around 125,000 households in seven prefectures were without power in Kyushu, according to Kyushu Electric Power Co.But the warm and moist air flowing around the typhoon have also brought heavy rains in areas far from the main body, which authorities say is concerning given its slower than expected movement across the country.Notices advising residents to be ready to evacuate have been issued to more than 4 million people across the country, mainly in the hard-hit Kyushu area but as far away as the capital Tokyo and nearby Yokohama. Authorities in Yokohama said there were risks of landslides in some areas due to heavy rain.But, as of Thursday, only some 30,000 had been evacuated, mainly in Kyushu, disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura said.After moving from Kyushu, the storm was expected to approach the central and eastern regions, which includes Tokyo, around the weekend, the weather agency said.Toyota suspended operations in all of its domestic plants due to the storm, while other automakers Nissan and Honda, semiconductor firms Renesas and Tokyo Electron, and electonics giant Sony also temporarily halted production at some factories.Airlines , including ANA Holdings and Japan Airlines, have announced cancellations of hundreds of domestic and some international flights. Many ferry and rail services, including the bullet train between Tokyo and the central city of Nagoya, were suspended on Friday morning.Lin Yue-Hua, a 60-year-old tourist from Taiwan, had her flight from Fukuoka back home cancelled on Thursday. She was told to book another flight but did not know when she could return.""We were very worried and upset because we didn’t know what to do,"" she said.""We stayed one more day in Japan. Then we saw it in the news that our flight from Taiwan couldn’t land in Japan after flying around the area for about 40 minutes and it flew back to Taiwan. So we have been busy trying to find our way home.”Typhoon Shanshan is the latest harsh weather system to hit Japan, following Typhoon Ampil, which also led to blackouts and evacuations, earlier this month.","Typhoon Shanshan deluged large parts of Japan with torrential rain on Friday, prompting warnings for flooding and landslides.

Hush money case: Trump seeks federal court intervention in bid to overturn conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-case-trump-seeks-federal-court-intervention-in-bid-to-overturn-conviction/articleshow/112910209.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former US President Donald Trump 's legal team submitted a request to a federal court on Friday, seeking its intervention in his hush money criminal case . The objective is to find a way to overturn his conviction and postpone his sentencing indefinitely, which is currently set for next month.Trump's attorneys argued that the state-level prosecution infringed upon his constitutional rights and contradicted the recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity .They asked the US district court in Manhattan to assume control of the New York City criminal case.In May, Trump was found guilty in state court in Manhattan on 34 counts of falsifying business records. These charges were related to a payment made to suppress allegations of an affair that had the potential to overshadow his 2016 presidential campaign.Last year, a federal judge denied Trump's initial attempt to transfer the case to federal court, paving the way for his unprecedented trial in state court.According to the filing submitted on Friday, Trump's lawyers said that transferring the case to federal court following his conviction on May 30 would provide him with an ""unbiased forum, free from local hostilities"" to address the aforementioned issues.

Governor Walz on personal pride and missteps

Vice President Kamala Harris gave her first major TV interview as the Democrats' presidential nominee in a conversation with CNN’s Dana Bash, ahead of the US presidential election going to be held in November. Held in Savannah, Georgia, the interview was part of Harris's bus tour through the crucial Sun Belt state, alongside her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.Here are the key takeaways from the interview.When asked about her priorities on Day One in the White House, Harris emphasized a shift away from former President Donald Trump's divisive agenda. “Sadly, we’ve had a decade where a former president pushed an agenda that diminished the character and strength of who we are as Americans,” Harris said, underscoring the need for change.On her economic plans, Harris reiterated her focus on her “opportunity economy” strategy. She proposed reducing the cost of daily essentials and offering a $6,000 tax credit for new parents. “I’m proud of the work we’ve done to lower inflation and cap insulin costs for seniors,” Harris noted, defending the administration’s handling of the economy and asserting that ""Bidenomics"" is working. She also highlighted achievements like the extension of the child tax credit and the creation of new manufacturing jobs.Addressing her past statements on fracking, Harris affirmed her position remains unchanged. “I will not ban fracking. My values have not changed,” she said. Harris explained her evolution on the issue, emphasizing the progress made through the Inflation Reduction Act and investments in clean energy jobs, while maintaining that fracking can coexist with climate goals.On immigration, Harris defended the Biden administration’s actions regarding asylum restrictions and border security. She criticized former President Trump for blocking a bipartisan border security bill that would have added more agents to the border. “If elected, I will work to revive that bill,” Harris promised.Responding to questions about her evolving policy positions, Harris reiterated that her core values remain constant. She also expressed openness to including Republicans in her administration, stating, “I think it’s important to have a diversity of opinion.”Harris defended President Biden’s fitness for office, expressing admiration for his leadership. She contrasted Biden’s approach with Trump’s divisive rhetoric, emphasizing the need for leadership that lifts people up rather than tearing them down.Harris shared a touching moment about how she learned of Biden’s decision to drop out of the 2024 race while spending time with her family. She also reacted to a poignant photograph of her great-niece looking up to her, saying, “It’s very humbling.”Governor Walz spoke about his pride in his son and addressed past missteps, including mischaracterizations about his military service and family’s fertility treatments. He expressed gratitude for the support and understanding of the American public, emphasizing his commitment to addressing important issues.","Kamala Harris gave her first major TV interview as the Democrats' presidential nominee in a conversation with CNN’s Dana Bash.

US-China Relations: US NSA Sullivan and Xi Jinping seek stable America-China relations amid rising tensions: ‘Competition does not have to lead to conflict’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-nsa-sullivan-and-xi-jinping-seek-stable-america-china-relations-amid-rising-tensions-competition-does-not-have-to-lead-to-conflict/articleshow/112910244.cms,"Commitment to stable relations

Sensitive issues and military communication

Efforts to manage tensions

Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday as Sullivan concluded a three-day visit focused on maintaining open communication despite rising tensions.The visit included discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and top military officials, emphasizing the need to prevent competition from escalating into conflict .Sullivan stressed the importance of diplomacy in managing US-China relations , saying, ""We believe that competition with China does not have to lead to conflict or confrontation. The key is responsible management through diplomacy."" This effort comes as both nations seek to stabilize relations ahead of potential changes in the US presidency in January, reported the AP.Xi Jinping echoed this sentiment, affirming China's commitment to a stable relationship with the United States. ""While great changes have taken place in the two countries and in China-US relations, China's commitment to the goal of a stable, healthy, and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged,"" he said.Sullivan added that President Biden is dedicated to managing this consequential relationship responsibly, ensuring that competition doesn't escalate into conflict.Plans were made for a phone call between Xi and Biden in the coming weeks, with the potential for an in-person meeting at significant international summits later this year. Sullivan noted, ""The likelihood is they'll both be there, and if they are, it would only be natural for them to have the chance to sit down with one another.""The discussions also addressed sensitive topics, including Taiwan, the South China Sea, and China’s support for Russia. On Taiwan, Gen. Zhang Youxia, one of China’s vice chairs of the Central Military Commission, emphasized, ""Reunification of Taiwan with the mainland is 'the mission and responsibility' of the military,"" demanding that the US cease military interactions with Taiwan.Sullivan acknowledged the rarity of such exchanges and underscored their importance. ""It is rare that we have the opportunity to have this kind of exchange,"" Sullivan said. The meeting resulted in an agreement for a call between military commanders in the Indo-Pacific region, which Sullivan described as a ""very positive outcome.""A White House statement recognized progress in sustaining military-to-military communications, referencing the upcoming theatre-level call. Danny Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute highlighted the significance of Sullivan's meeting with Xi, noting that Sullivan was seen by the Chinese leadership as ""a direct extension"" of President Biden, and his messaging was viewed as ""coming straight from Biden.""Sullivan’s visit underscored the delicate balance of US-China relations as both nations navigate their competitive but interdependent relationship.","Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday.

Donald Trump promises free IVF treatments amid abortion rights debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-want-more-babies-trump-promises-free-ivf-treatments-amid-abortion-rights-debate-says-us-government-will-pay-but-how/articleshow/112909996.cms,"In a recent event in Michigan, former US President Donald Trump declared, “I’m announcing today in a major statement that under the Trump administration, your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment. Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.” IVF treatments are known for their high costs, often reaching tens of thousands of dollars per round, with no guarantee of success.This announcement comes amid ongoing criticism from Democrats over Trump’s role in appointing Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending federal abortion rights . The decision has become a significant issue for Democrats and women voters, highlighted during the party’s recent national convention and Vice President Kamala Harris' acceptance speech.In response to this criticism, Trump has positioned himself as a moderate on reproductive issues . In an interview with NBC before the Michigan event, Trump suggested he might vote to repeal Florida's six-week abortion ban, saying, “I think the six weeks is too short. It has to be more time.” However, Trump did not specify his stance on the ballot measure known as Amendment 4, which proposes a broader abortion timeline.Trump's comments drew sharp reactions from anti-abortion advocates. Marjorie Dannenfelser of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America criticized Trump for not committing to how he will vote on Amendment 4. “Voting for Amendment 4 completely undermines his position,” she said, emphasizing that Trump’s past stance was against abortions after five months of pregnancy.In addition to his IVF promise, Trump said that families would be able to deduct newborn care expenses from their taxes under his administration, asserting, “We’re pro-family.”Trump's stance on abortion has varied over the years. He had previously considered supporting a 15-week nationwide abortion ban but later declared that abortion regulation should be managed at the state level.","Former US President Donald Trump announced that the government would pay for IVF treatment.

Response to Trump’s remarks

Vice President Kamala Harris , in a CNN exclusive interview with Dana Bash today, offered a detailed explanation for her evolving positions on fracking and immigration, emphasizing that her core values remain intact despite shifts in policy. The interview comes ahead of the US presidential election which is scheduled for November this year. Harris, alongside her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, spoke about her perspective on pressing issues and her vision for the future.During the interview, Harris addressed questions about her policy reversals, particularly her stance on fracking.“I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed.”Reflecting on her previous position, Harris noted, “I have always believed – and I have worked on it – that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time.” She pointed to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act as evidence of her ongoing commitment to climate action, despite her earlier pledge to ban fracking.Harris also discussed her evolving views on immigration, highlighting her record as California Attorney General, where she prosecuted gangs involved in cross-border trafficking. “My values have not changed,” she asserted, attributing her policy adjustments to the practical experiences gained during her tenure as vice president.On her climate policy, Kamala said, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking, and starting with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands.”Looking ahead, Harris expressed her intention to foster diverse perspectives within her administration. “I think it’s really important,” she said, discussing her willingness to include a Republican in her Cabinet if elected. “I have spent my career inviting a diversity of opinion… It would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican.”Harris also addressed recent comments from former President Donald Trump, who questioned her racial identity. Dismissing Trump’s remarks as “same old, tired playbook,” Harris remained focused on the issues at hand, saying, “Next question, please.”","Kamala Harris spoke to CNN's Dana Bash ahead of the US presidential election.

The world's least populated countries offer fascinating insights into how geography, history, and economics shape human settlement. These nations, often marked by remote locations, limited land areas, and unique political statuses, host populations that are only a fraction of what might be expected in other parts of the world.From the spiritual hub of Vatican City to the isolated atolls of Tokelau, each of these countries tells a story of survival and adaptation in the face of natural and man-made challenges.Explore the ten least populated countries, highlighting the factors that contribute to their small populations.As the smallest internationally recognized independent state, Vatican City has a population of just 764 as of 2023–24. This is largely due to its tiny land area of only 49 hectares, strict citizenship requirements that limit the number of new residents, and its unique role as the spiritual and administrative centre of the Catholic Church rather than a typical country.Tokelau, a group of three remote atolls in the South Pacific, has a population of around 1,915 people. Its isolated location and limited land area of just 26 square kilometers naturally constrain its population. The absence of airports and accessibility only by boat from Samoa further contribute to its small population size.Niue, a self-governing island country in free association with New Zealand, has a population of about 1,935 people. Its remote Pacific location, coupled with a tiny land area of just 260 square kilometers and limited economic opportunities, restrict population growth.The Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic, has a population of approximately 3,803 people. Its isolated position and harsh sub-Antarctic climate make it an unattractive destination for large-scale settlement. The islands’ economy is primarily dependent on fishing and tourism.Montserrat, a Caribbean island nation, has an estimated population of 4,372 people. A devastating volcanic eruption in the 1990s destroyed much of the island and forced many residents to flee, resulting in its small population size. Ongoing volcanic activity and limited land area continue to constrain population growth.Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a French territorial collectivity in the North Atlantic, has a population of around 5,815 people. Its remote location off the coast of Canada and limited economic opportunities, mainly centered on fishing and tourism, contribute to its small population size.Saint Barthélemy, a French overseas collectivity in the Caribbean, has a population of approximately 11,019 people. The island’s tiny land area of just 25 square kilometers and focus on luxury tourism, rather than large-scale industry or agriculture, limit its population growth.Wallis and Futuna, a French overseas territory in the South Pacific, consists of three small volcanic islands with a total land area of just 142 square kilometers. Its remote location and lack of major economic activities contribute to its small population of around 11,439 people.Tuvalu, a Pacific island nation comprising nine small atolls, has a population of about 11,478 people. Its tiny land area of 26 square kilometers and isolation from major trade routes and economic centres contribute to its status as one of the least populated countries in the world.Nauru, the world’s smallest republic, has a population of roughly 12,884 people. Its total land area of just 21 square kilometers and remote location in Micronesia limit population growth. Economic challenges and a lack of natural resources further hinder the country’s development and population expansion.","The world's least populated countries offer fascinating insights into how geography, history, and economics shape human settlement.

Failure to cooperate with authorities: Durov and Telegram are alleged to have failed to provide necessary information or documents to French investigators, particularly regarding child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking.

Telegram’s response

A digital icon under fire

A history of defiance

The road ahead

Pavel Durov , once hailed as Russia's Mark Zuckerberg , is now at the center of a high-stakes legal drama that underscores the tension between digital freedom and regulatory control. His recent arrest in France has turned the spotlight on Telegram , the messaging app he founded, and reignited debates over the limits of online privacy and government intervention.More than a decade ago, Durov made headlines when he cheekily responded to Russian authorities’ demands to shut down opposition pages on his platform, VKontakte. His response? A picture of a hoodie-wearing dog with its tongue out, captioned: ""Official response to the intelligence services to the request to block groups."" This irreverent act underscored his long-standing defiance against government control over digital communication.However, Durov’s journey took a dramatic turn when he launched Telegram in 2013. The app quickly became popular for its secure messaging features and commitment to minimal content moderation. Telegram's rise mirrored Durov's own ascent as a symbol of digital freedom. Yet, his hands-off approach to policing the platform has drawn the ire of governments worldwide.Fast forward to 2024, and Durov's anti-establishment ethos seems to have landed him in hot water again. His arrest in France comes as part of an investigation into criminal activities on Telegram. Telegram’s reputation for minimal content moderation has made it a haven for various illicit activities.This weekend, Durov’s anti-establishment streak landed him in trouble once again. French authorities arrested him as part of an investigation into Telegram's involvement in criminal activities, including child pornography, drug trafficking, and money laundering. The arrest has raised alarms about Telegram’s role in facilitating illicit activities and has sparked a fierce debate about the balance between free speech and security.Released after four days of questioning, Durov now faces preliminary charges that could have serious consequences.French authorities have barred Durov from leaving the country and required him to pay a 5 million euro bail. He must also report to a police station twice a week. Preliminary charges indicate a strong belief in the occurrence of a crime, though further investigation is ongoing.The arrest has sparked outrage and debate globally:Telegram has defended its policies, asserting compliance with EU laws and industry standards for content moderation. The platform argues that holding it or its owner responsible for misuse of the app is unreasonable.In response to the arrest, Telegram stated, “It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform. Almost a billion users globally use Telegram for communication and vital information. We’re awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation. Telegram is with you all.”Durov’s arrest has garnered significant support from free speech advocates and tech luminaries. Elon Musk and Edward Snowden have publicly rallied behind him, with the hashtag #FreePavel trending as a symbol of resistance against perceived overreach by authorities.Telegram’s response to the arrest underscores its commitment to privacy. The company maintains that it complies with European laws and dismisses the notion that it should be held accountable for user behavior. “It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform,” Telegram stated.Durov’s arrest is not an isolated incident but the latest chapter in a history marked by defiance and controversy. His departure from Russia in 2014, after refusing to comply with government demands for user data, set the stage for his ongoing battle with global authorities. His personal quirks and outspoken nature have only fueled the narrative of a tech visionary at odds with the state.As Durov remains in custody, the tech world watches closely. His case raises pressing questions about the future of digital privacy and the role of platforms in moderating content. The outcome of this legal battle could set a precedent for how governments and tech companies navigate the delicate balance between security and freedom.","Pavel Durov was arrested in France as part of an investigation into Telegram's involvement in criminal activities, including child pornography, drug trafficking, and money laundering.

Alice Walton , the Walmart heiress, is on the brink of joining an exclusive group of centi-billionaires, a club that includes prominent figures like Elon Musk , Bill Gates , and Warren Buffett. As her wealth continues to climb, surpassing the $100 billion mark seems imminent, cementing her place among the world’s wealthiest individuals.Alice Walton: From heir to billionaireAlice Walton, the daughter of Walmart’s founder Sam Walton, has long been a notable figure in the world of finance.Recently, she overtook Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, the heiress to the L'Oréal fortune, to become the richest woman globally. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Alice Walton's net worth has now exceeded $95 billion for the first time, driven primarily by Walmart's impressive performance on the stock market.Walmart, the retail giant founded by Sam Walton, has seen a significant surge in its stock price, increasing by 44% to reach record highs this year. This surge has been a critical factor in boosting Alice Walton’s net worth by $25 billion. Her current valuation stands at over $95 billion, bringing her closer to the elite centi-billionaire status.In contrast, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, the French heiress to the L'Oréal fortune, has seen her wealth decrease by $9 billion this year, bringing her net worth down to $91 billion. This decline can largely be attributed to a 12% drop in L'Oréal’s share price since January. Bettencourt Meyers, who inherited a 35% stake in the world’s largest cosmetics company from her mother Liliane Bettencourt in 2017, has seen her position on Bloomberg’s rich list slip to 20th, while Walton has climbed to 18th.Alice Walton is not alone in her extraordinary wealth; her two brothers, Robson and Jim Walton, are also billionaires, with net worths of $95.8 billion and $98 billion, respectively. Assuming Sam Walton divided his Walmart stock equally among his four children, each sibling owns more than 11% of the company. Since 1992, the Walton family has collectively earned more than $15 billion from dividends and stock sales, according to Bloomberg estimates.","Alice Walton's net worth has now exceeded $95 billion for the first time.

"JD Vance’s donut shop disaster: 'Felt terrible ...', Trump's running mate breaks silence on viral cringe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vances-donut-shop-disaster-felt-terrible-trumps-running-mate-breaks-silence-on-viral-cringe/articleshow/112881543.cms,"Ohio Senator JD Vance broke his silence on the cringeworthy donut shop incident in Valdosta , Georgia that has sent shockwaves across social media . The campaign stop , which was meant to showcase Vance’s down-to-earth charm, instead became an internet sensation for all the wrong reasons.The now-infamous video captured Vance attempting to engage in small talk with a visibly uncomfortable clerk.With 20 Secret Service agents and 15 cameras in the shop, the woman appeared more like a deer caught in headlights than a willing participant in Vance's photo op. In his recent interview, Vance tried to put a positive spin on the fiasco, attributing the awkwardness to the clerk’s nervousness rather than any campaign misstep.“I just felt terrible for that woman,” Vance confessed, reported the NBC. “We walked in, and there’s 20 Secret Service agents, and there’s 15 cameras, and she clearly had not been properly warned, and she was terrified, right? I just felt awful for her.”Vance claimed the incident prompted him to reassess his campaign strategy, suggesting that future stops would include a more considerate approach. “I like to get out there and talk to people, and we want to make sure we’re doing it, but definitely make sure that people are at least OK with being on camera,” he added.Despite Vance’s attempts to downplay the situation, the internet was far from forgiving. Memes and TikTok parodies exploded online, with users ridiculing his clumsy interaction and speculating about his campaign team's alleged sabotage. The viral backlash intensified following Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's smooth, untroubled visit to a Nebraska sandwich shop just a day earlier. Walz's effortless rapport with the staff and his confident order contrasted sharply with Vance’s blunders, fueling comparisons and adding fuel to the fire.In his interview, Vance also took a swipe at the Harris-Walz campaign, referencing their recent Sheetz gas station stop where Walz handed Harris a bag of Doritos. Vance dismissed the staged nature of such events, saying, “We don’t want to have these scripted events—I don’t want to go and do three takes of buying Doritos at a Sheetz.”While Vance’s donut shop disaster has dominated headlines and memes, it remains to be seen how this embarrassing episode will impact his campaign’s fortunes as he battles to secure his place on the national stage.","Ohio Senator JD Vance broke his silence on the cringeworthy donut shop incident that has sent shockwaves across social media.

Kamala Harris gains ground: New poll shows shifting dynamics in 2024 US election race against Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-gains-ground-new-poll-shows-shifting-dynamics-in-2024-us-election-race-against-donald-trump/articleshow/112909635.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris has surged ahead of former President Donald Trump , leading him 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday. The poll, conducted over eight days ending Wednesday, marks a significant increase from Harris's previous 1-point lead in late July.Harris’s lead is bolstered by increased support from women and Hispanic voters.She is now ahead of Trump by 13 percentage points among both demographics—49% to 36%—a notable rise from her 9-point lead among women and 6-point lead among Hispanics in July. Trump continues to lead among white voters and men, but his advantage among voters without a college degree has shrunk to 7 points, down from 14 points.The shift in the race follows President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race on July 21 after a contentious debate performance. Since Biden’s exit, Harris has seen a boost in both national and swing state polls.In critical battleground states—Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan, and Nevada—Trump holds a slim 45% to 43% lead over Harris among registered voters. However, a separate Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll indicates Harris is either leading or tied with Trump in each of these states.Republican strategist Matt Wolking acknowledged the challenge Trump faces against Harris but emphasized the importance of focusing on his campaign strategy to retain voter support. Since accepting the Democratic nomination, Harris has been actively campaigning in key states, including Georgia, to solidify her support.The enthusiasm for Harris is evident: 73% of Democratic voters in the Reuters/Ipsos poll expressed increased excitement about voting in November, a significant rise from previous polls. Harris’s appeal as a forward-looking candidate contrasts with Trump’s emphasis on his past achievements, with 52% of Harris’s supporters voting to back her candidacy rather than merely opposing Trump.Trump retains support among his base, with 64% of his voters backing him due to his policies rather than solely opposing Harris. Trump is favored over Harris on economic management, but Harris holds a strong 47% to 31% advantage on abortion policy—a critical issue for many Democrats following the 2022 Supreme Court decision.The poll, which included 4,253 U.S. adults and 3,562 registered voters, reflects a dynamic shift in the presidential race. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign on August 23, had garnered 6% support in the survey.","Harris's lead is bolstered by increased support from women and Hispanic voters.

Bryan Kohberger Murder Case: Bryan Kohberger’s defense pushes for trial in 2022 Idaho murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mob-mentality-and-deeply-held-prejudgment-bryan-kohbergers-defense-pushes-for-trial-in-2022-idaho-murder-case/articleshow/112910037.cms,"Concerns about bias and safety

Background of the case

Bryan Kohberger ’s defense team is pushing to move his trial for the 2022 murder of four University of Idaho students out of Latah County , arguing that finding an unbiased jury there is impossible, CNN reported.Kohberger, who has pleaded not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder, is scheduled to stand trial in June 2025.The defense contends that extensive media coverage and local sentiment have prejudged Kohberger, jeopardizing his right to a fair trial .The defence argues that the ""mob mentality"" in Latah County not only threatens Kohberger’s chance at a fair trial but also endangers those involved in the case. They propose relocating the trial to Ada County , more than 300 miles away, which includes Idaho’s capital, Boise. The defense believes that the small town of Moscow, where the murders occurred, holds deeply rooted prejudicial opinions.""The traumatized town of Moscow is understandably filled with deeply heldprejudgment opinions of guilt,"" the defence stated.Surveys conducted by defence experts in Latah County revealed extreme sentiments among residents. Some respondents expressed violent intentions if Kohberger were acquitted, including threats of burning down the courthouse or engaging in vigilante justice.Amani El-Alayli, a social psychology professor at Eastern Washington University, testified that finding unbiased jurors in Latah County would be nearly impossible due to the extensive media coverage. El-Alayli explained that jurors exposed to pretrial publicity are more likely to convict based on fear-inducing headlines.“I think it would be so hard to be a member of that community and be able to come in and be objective—arguably impossible,” El-Alayli said.James Todd Murphy, president of the media analysis service Truescope, supported relocating the trial, noting that media coverage in Latah County is significantly higher compared to Ada County. Murphy pointed out that the smaller jury pool in Latah County increases the chances of exposure to the case.“This type of story will remain on the mind and be of interest up to and beyond the conclusion of this case,” Murphy said.However, Murphy acknowledged that Ada County had periods of heightened media coverage from January 2023 to June 2024. Despite this, the defence insists that Kohberger deserves a trial with an impartial jury, emphasizing that Latah County’s media coverage has often been inaccurate and inflammatory.The defence conducted surveys in several Idaho counties, including Latah and Ada. The surveys showed that the more media coverage a potential juror had been exposed to, the higher the likelihood of prejudgment.Defence expert Bryan Edelman led these surveys, which revealed significant community outrage in Latah County if Kohberger were not convicted. In contrast, respondents from Ada County felt their community would ""go on with life as always"" and ""take it well.""Additionally, the defence argued that Moscow lacks the facilities to accommodate the anticipated three-month trial. They cited similar cases where trials were moved, such as the murder trials of Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell.Vallow was sentenced to life, and Daybell to death, for the murders of Vallow’s two children and Daybell’s first wife.Prosecutors maintain that a fair trial is possible in Moscow, arguing that intense media coverage extends beyond Latah County. They criticized the defence’s survey findings, suggesting that Latah County residents who have heard about the case are statistically less likely to prejudge Kohberger.Prosecutors proposed alternative strategies, such as convening a large jury pool and thoroughly screening jurors to ensure impartiality. They also pointed out that moving the trial hundreds of miles away would be inconvenient for witnesses and the victims’ families.The case centres on the brutal murders of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin, and Xana Kernodle, who were stabbed to death in a home near the University of Idaho on November 13, 2022.The killings and subsequent manhunt shocked Moscow, raising concerns about student safety. Kohberger, a graduate student at Washington State University, was arrested on December 30 at his parents’ home in Pennsylvania.Law enforcement linked Kohberger to the crime through a white Hyundai Elantra seen near the crime scene and a DNA match from a knife sheath found at the scene.","Bryan Kohberger is accused of stabbing four University of Idaho students to death in 2022.

The incident occurred on Monday as Mes was defending Ukrainian airspace, one of the few pilots trained to operate the advanced jets recently supplied by NATO allies .Mes, a member of Ukraine’s elite group of combat pilots, was piloting one of the first F-16s delivered to Ukraine, a symbol of Western support in the ongoing conflict. The aircraft had successfully intercepted several Russian cruise missiles before disaster struck.According to Ukraine's military, communication with Mes's jet was suddenly lost amid the fierce battle. The wreckage was later discovered, confirming the worst: Mes had given his life in defense of his country.Ukraine's military has opened an investigation into the crash, with early reports suggesting that pilot error or mechanical failure may have been the cause, rather than enemy fire, according to the report by NYT.Mes had been part of Ukraine's air force since the early days of the conflict. His death has sent shockwaves through the country, with many seeing it as a significant blow to both the military and national morale.The F-16s, which arrived in Ukraine just weeks ago, were seen as a crucial component in the country’s defense strategy, and Mes was among the first to be trained to fly them.The crash occurred during what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as one of the largest Russian attacks since the invasion began.Over 200 missiles and drones were fired at Ukrainian targets, and Mes, along with his fellow pilots, was at the forefront of the defense effort. Despite the intense barrage, the F-16s had ""demonstrated their high efficiency,"" according to Ukraine’s general staff, shooting down multiple threats. But as the battle raged on, Mes’s jet went down.On Thursday, a large funeral was held in Lutsk, a city in northwestern Ukraine, where Mes was laid to rest with full military honors. The skies above the city were filled with the roar of Ukrainian air force jets performing a flyover in tribute to their fallen comrade. The funeral was attended by family, friends, fellow pilots, and citizens, all united in grief and admiration for a man who gave everything in defense of his homeland.""Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life,"" read a poignant post from the air force's western command on social media. The post captured the deep sorrow felt across the country, as well as the profound respect for Mes’s sacrifice.The pilot’s death comes at a critical time for Ukraine, as the country faces relentless pressure from Russian forces in the east. Mes’s passing is a stark reminder of the human cost of the war and the high stakes involved as Ukraine continues its fight for survival. While the F-16s represent hope for a stronger defense, the loss of a pilot like Oleksiy Mes underscores the ongoing peril and the sacrifices being made on the front lines.As the nation mourns, Mes’s legacy as a fearless pilot and a symbol of Ukraine's resilience will continue to inspire those who carry on the fight. His name now joins the ranks of those who have given their lives in the struggle for Ukraine's freedom, a reminder of the personal sacrifices behind the headlines of this devastating conflict.","Oleksiy Mes, a member of Ukraine's elite combat pilots, was killed when his F-16 fighter jet crashed during a massive Russian missile assault.

During a legal proceeding on August 21, Natasha was claimed to ""under the influence"" by the representative of one of the victims, who requested an investigation into the ""kind of drug"" that the accused was purportedly consuming.

Credit ratings agency Moody's has upgraded Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to ' Caa2 ' from 'Caa3' citing improving macroeconomic conditions and moderately better government liquidity and external positions.The ratings upgrade reflects Pakistan's decreased default risk after a USD7 billion IMF bailout staff level agreement in July.However, despite doubling since June 2023, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves remain insufficient for its external financing needs, according to the agency.""There is now greater certainty on Pakistan's sources of external financing, following the sovereign's staff-level agreement with the IMF on 12 July 2024 for a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of USD7 billion,"" Moody's said in a statement.The IMF stated that the program's approval depends on Pakistan securing necessary financing assurances from its development and bilateral partners. Moody's said it expects the IMF Board to approve the program within a few weeks.Following the upgrade, Pakistan's international bonds made broad gains. The 2027 maturity was up 0.7 cents to 85.9 cents in the dollar by 1007 GMT - not far off the one month high hit earlier in the day, according to Tradeweb data.Topline Securities CEO, Mohammed Sohail, said the credit upgrade was anticipated following the IMF agreement, and another upgrade within a year is plausible.The announcement comes a day after Pakistan's central bank chief told Reuters in an interview that the country would be looking for about USD4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks.Sohail said Fitch's upgrade in July and Moody's upgrade should ""boost bankers' confidence"".Historically, Pakistan has depended on friendly countries to ""rollover"" debt to avoid a repayment crisis.Although Moody's previous concerns about a potential balance of payments crisis have eased, it warned that risks remain high as Pakistan continues to rely on timely financing from official partners.There is also uncertainty over the government's ability to fully implement IMF-mandated reforms, Moody's said.The coalition government, formed after February elections, may struggle to implement revenue-raising measures without stoking social tensions.Moody's cautioned that any slippages in reform implementation could lead to delays in or withdrawal of financing support from official partners.","Moody's upgrades Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to'Caa2'from 'Caa3' The ratings upgrade reflects Pakistan's decreased default risk after a USD7 billion IMF bailout staff level agreement in July.

Overcoming Challenges

KARACHI: Pakistan aims to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year, the country's central bank chief told Reuters on Tuesday, as the country looks to plug its external financing gap .In a wide-ranging interview, his first with any media organisation since taking office in 2022, State Bank of Pakistan Governor Jameel Ahmad said Pakistan was also in the ""advanced stages"" of securing $2 billion in additional external financing required for International Monetary Fund approval of a $7 billion bailout program.Pakistan and the IMF reached an agreement on the loan program in July, subject to approval from the IMF's executive board and it obtaining ""timely confirmation of necessary financing assurances from Pakistan's development and bilateral partners"".Ahmad said he expected the country's gross financing needs would be smoothly met - both over the next fiscal year and in the medium term.In the past, Pakistan has relied on long-time allies such as China, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates to 'rollover' debt rather than force a repayment crunch. Ahmad said he expected similar assurances would be given for the next three years, giving the government more time to get its finances in order.In addition, Ahmad said the central bank reckoned Pakistan's gross financing needs for the coming years would be lower than the 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product projected by the IMF in its latest country report in May.""Pakistan's external gross financing needs have been declining in the past few years,"" he said.""Since (the IMF's) assessment was based on a higher current account deficit than realized in fiscal 2024 and now projected for the next few years, we assess the ratio of gross financing needs to GDP to be lower than the 5.5 per cent level.""Asked about monetary policy, Ahmad said recent interest rate cuts in Pakistan have had the desired effect, with inflation continuing to slow and the current account remaining under control, despite the cuts.Pakistan's annual consumer price index inflation was 11.1 per cent in July, having fallen from highs of over 30 per cent in 2023.""The Monetary Policy Committee will review all these developments,"" Ahmad said, adding that future rate decisions could not be pre-determined.Pakistan's central bank cut rates for two straight meetings from a historic high of 22 per cent to 19.5 per cent, and will meet again to review monetary policy on September 12.There have been some concerns in markets that the government might take advantage of lower interest rates to borrow more, but the central bank chief said this was not his expectation.""We understand that the government will continue on the path of fiscal consolidation, notwithstanding the reduction in interest rates,"" said Ahmad.Ahmad, who was appointed governor of Pakistan's central bank for a five-year term in August 2022, said his first year had been 'quite difficult'.In 2023, Pakistan faced an acute balance of payments crisis with only enough central bank reserves to cover a month of imports.After eight months of tough negotiations over fiscal discipline, the IMF threw Pakistan a lifeline in the form of a nine-month $3 billion bailout program.""Last year was much better,"" said Ahmad. ""Now everything is under control from an external account management perspective.""Ahmad said the central bank would now focus on growth, digitalisation and financial inclusion.""Those are also equally important for job creation and other socioeconomic issues,"" said Ahmad, noting the bank's mandate was to ensure price and financial stability before shifting its focus to growth.","Pakistan aims to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year.

He further said that operations against the insurgents continued on Monday and “those who killed our innocent civilians and security will be dealt with with full force.”The PM said the Balochistan attacks sought to harm Chinese-funded development projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which included roads and rail systems to link western China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s southwestern Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea.In recent years, BLA and other militants have also targeted Chinese nationals involved with CPEC projects.According to a witness, some killed in the latest attacks were ordered off local transport and shot.Sakina Nazir said that while traveling in a bus with her husband, gunmen signaled the driver to halt, following which, the men entered the bus and checked passengers' national identity cards.

It allows users to blur pictures except for specific matches and offers the option of having chaperones oversee meetings.Since its launch in 2015 in Britain, Muzz has attracted over 1.5 million users in Pakistan, making it the app's second-largest market after Morocco.The Lahore event provided a safe space for attendees like Aimen, 31, to step out of the confines of online interactions. “I used the app for two weeks, but when I saw an ad for this event, I thought, why not meet people in person?” she said.Moaz, 27, who has been using Muzz for a year, expressed hope that the event might help him find a life partner.However, he pointed out that many girls on the app expect parental involvement from the start, which he found challenging. ""That is not possible,"" he said, emphasising the importance of getting to know someone before involving families.In addition to Muzz, other events like Annie's matchmaking party in Lahore are also challenging traditional matchmaking norms .Noor ul Ain Choudhary, the 30-year-old organiser, faced criticism online for allegedly promoting a ""hookup culture."" She defended her event, explaining that it was intended to provide a safe space for singles to meet and connect.","Muzz, a UK-based matrimonial app, hosted an in-person event in Lahore.
