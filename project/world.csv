Angry Israelis push Netanyahu’s red lines on hostage deaths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/angry-israelis-push-netanyahus-red-lines-on-hostage-deaths/articleshow/113008482.cms,"After six Israeli hostages were found shot dead in a Gaza tunnel at the weekend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did something he hadn’t done in 11 months of war — he apologized to the bereaved families.“I want to tell you how sorry I am and ask for forgiveness for not being able to bring Sasha back alive,” he told the parents of Alexander Lobanov in the first of a series of such phone calls.The gesture was among signs the discovery may prove to be a turning point in Israel’s long-running conflict with Hamas , after several months of inconclusive cease-fire negotiations. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis protested on Sunday to demand a truce with the Iran-backed group, while the main trade union called a strike that temporarily shut down banks, shopping malls and even the main airport on Monday morning.“Netanyahu realized that a line had been crossed,” wrote commentator Yoav Limor in the Israel Hayom newspaper, a reference to the sense among many Israelis that the government didn’t do enough to save the hostages. “As of yesterday, Israel is not the same country.”What that means for Netanyahu’s stance on the war remains to be seen. On Monday night, he gave a defiant press conference, saying Israel will not give up control of the border area between Gaza and Egypt, the so-called Philadelphi corridor, as Hamas has demanded.Israel’s control of the area is key to “defeating Hamas, returning hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn’t pose a threat in the future,” he said. He added, “If we leave, we won’t go back,” citing “immense international pressure” that would be exerted on Israel.Through that corridor, he said, Hamas has imported tons of arms that it has used against Israel. That pathway must be permanently controlled by Israel, he said.Many argue US President Joe Biden ’s administration should use the moment to press both Israel and Hamas to finally reach an agreement. The Washington Post reported on Monday that the US, alongside other international brokers Qatar and Egypt, is preparing a “take-it-or-leave-it” final deal.“We’re very close” to tabling a proposal, Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday. Asked if Netanyahu is doing enough to secure the hostages, he answered simply “no.”Israel has waged its campaign in Gaza ever since thousands of Hamas operatives swarmed into the south of the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250. In that time the government has pursued two often contradictory goals: destroy the group’s military and political infrastructure and bring the hostages back alive.For the duration of the conflict — in which more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to health officials in Hamas-run Gaza — Israel assumed Hamas was protecting hostages to trade for concessions, such as the freeing of Palestinian prisoners. The discovery of the dead abductees casts doubt on that thesis.“What we see in Hamas now, after 11 months of war, is a collapse of the command structure,” said Uzi Rabi, a senior researcher on Palestinian issues at Tel Aviv University. “This means that Israel’s policy of increased military pressure, which you could argue was working, may no longer serve the purpose. It’s a double-edged sword, and Netanyahu may have to shift policy.”Hostages will “go back to their families in coffins” if Netanyahu keeps insisting on securing their release through military pressure, Abu Obaida, a spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing, said on his Telegram channel.Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has been arguing that the country should accept a cease-fire proposal put forward by the US. First made public by Biden at the end of May, it calls for a three-stage process starting with the freeing of hostages in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops.Netanyahu’s own position has moved around. Most recently, he’s come down on the side of his right-wing coalition partners, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who say Israel mustn’t stop fighting Hamas even for a day until total victory is achieved. The release of hostages, they say, will follow.Israeli public opinion, once on their side, has shifted. A monthly poll asking whether a hostage deal should be prioritized over destroying Hamas showed 72% in favor in July, up from 67% in June and 46% in May.Israeli media reports on the cease-fire negotiations showed that some of those found dead were on the list of hostages due to be exchanged. That made their deaths more painful for families and friends, and a key element of Sunday’s protests was that Israel failed them.“Our Hands Aren’t Clean of Their Blood,” ran a front-page headline in the centrist Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on Monday.Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition partners retain a degree of support, including among a small number of families of those still held in Gaza. They are members of a group called the Tikva Forum, which opposes compromise with Hamas and called on Israelis not to join demonstrations or strikes. Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by the US.The mother of one of those found dead on Sunday said on the radio that “he would not be willing to have one terrorist released for him.”Micah Goodman, a public intellectual of moderate political leanings, wrote in Israel Hayom that since the military has weakened Hamas, the strategic cost of a hostage deal is much lower than earlier in the conflict. It’s vital to find a way to reach an agreement, he said, to heal the nation.“The two war objectives can be translated into two moral and Jewish aspirations: to take Hamas apart and to put Israel back together,” he said.",Six Israeli hostages were found shot dead in a Gaza tunnel at the weekend. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to the bereaved families. The gesture was among signs the discovery may prove to be a turning point in Israel’s conflict with Hamas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113008548,imgsize-107822,width-400,resizemode-4/113008548.jpg"
Meandering? Trump says his 'weave' is oratorical genius,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meandering-trump-says-his-weave-is-oratorical-genius/articleshow/113008434.cms,"For weeks, ex-prez Donald Trump's advisers have urged him to be more disciplined and to stop straying off-message. But on Friday, while speaking at a rally , Trump insisted that his oratory is not a campaign distraction but rather a rhetorical triumph .""You know, I do the weave,"" he said. ""You know what the weave is? I'll talk about like nine different things, and they all come back brilliantly together, and it's like, friends of mine that are, like, English professors , they say, 'It's the most brilliant thing I've ever seen.'""Asked for examples of the technique, the Trump campaign provided what it called a ""masterclass weave"" - a four-minute, 20-second video of the candidate speaking at a rally in , North Carolina, in Aug in which he bounces from energy bills to Hunter Biden's laptop to Venezuelan tar to mental institutions in Caracas to migrant crime to ""the green new scam"" to Vice-Prez Kamala Harris.His campaign didn't identify which English professor friends of his had complimented his style. ""I highly doubt that Trump has any English professor friends,"" said Timothy O'Brien, a Trump biographer. ""What this really reflects is that he is aware of the criticism that he is publicly saying nonlinear, nonsensical word salad, and he's trying to pretend there is a strategy behind it.""The weave - a word more commonly associated with tapestry, tailoring and cosmetology - is a new formulation for Trump. Certainly, in the history of narrative, there have been writers celebrated for their ability to be discursive only to cleverly tie together all their themes with a neat bow at the end - William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens and Larry David come to mind. But in the case of Trump, it is difficult to find the hermeneutic methods with which to parse the linguistic flights that take him from electrocuted sharks to Hannibal Lecter's cannibalism, windmills and Rosie O'Donnell. James Shapiro, a professor of English at Columbia University and a renowned Shakespeare scholar, ruminated about Trump's use of the word: ""I take him at his word, as one of the Oxford English Dictionary definitions of 'weave' is 'to pursue a devious course'.""Elaborating on his own oratorical technique Friday, Trump said: ""What you do is you get off a subject, to mention another little tidbit. Then you get back onto the subject, and you go through this, and you do it for two hours, and you don't even mispronounce one word.""","Donald Trump insists his oratory is not a campaign distraction but rather a rhetorical triumph.

Previous recipients include Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.In a post on the Atlantic Council’s website in February, fellows Kaush Arha and Paolo Messa credited Meloni with being “instrumental in ensuring much-needed European aid to Ukraine.” Since taking office, they added, “the Italian leader has emerged as a powerful interlocutor across Europe and the world stage.”Musk and Meloni have met on a number of occasions, including at a political festival last December thrown by the prime minister’s right-wing Brothers of Italy party.Appearing on stage, Musk discussed Italy’s demographic crisis — the country has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe — and exhorted the crowd to “make more Italians.”“As simple as it sounds, if people do not have children there is no new generation,” Musk told the audience, echoing a prominent concern of Meloni’s. The billionaire also warned of the dangers of the “woke mind virus” — a favorite talking point — and unchecked migration.The Atlantic Council event won’t be the only meeting this month between Meloni and the world’s richest man.

France confronts horror of rape and drugging case as 51 men go on trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/france-confronts-horror-of-rape-and-drugging-case-as-51-men-go-on-trial/articleshow/113008290.cms,"PARIS: For years, she had been losing hair and weight. She had started forgetting whole days, and sometimes appeared to be in dreamlike trances. Her children and friends worried she had Alzheimer's. But in late 2020, after she was summoned to a police station in southern France , she learned a far more shattering story. Her husband of 50 years, Dominique Pelicot, had been crushing sleeping pills into her food and drink to put her into a deep sleep, police said, and then raping her.He had ushered dozens of men into her home to film them raping her, too, they said, in abuse that lasted nearly a decade.Using the man's photographs, videos and online messages, police spent the next two years identifying and charging those other suspects. On Monday, 51 men, including Pelicot, will go on trial in Avignon, in a case that has shocked France and cast a spotlight on the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse and the broader culture in which such crimes could occur.The accused men represent a kaleidoscope of working-class and middle-class French society: truck drivers, soldiers, carpenters and trade workers, a prison guard, a nurse, an IT expert working for a bank, a local journalist. They range in age from 26 to 74. Many have children and are in relationships. Most are charged with raping the woman once. A handful are accused of returning as many as six times to rape her.The victim, who has divorced her husband and changed her surname since his arrest, is now in her 70s. Since his arrest, Pelicot, 71, has ""always declared himself guilty"", said Beatrice Zavarro, his lawyer. ""He is not at all contesting his role."" Other defendants have denied the rape charges, with some arguing that they had the husband's permission and thought that was sufficient, while others claimed they believed the victim had agreed to be drugged.When police showed the victim some of the photographs they say her husband had carefully classified and stored, she expressed deep shock. She and her husband had been together since they were 18. She had described him to police as caring and considerate. She had no memory of being raped, by him or the other men, only one of whom she recognised, she told police, as a neighbour in town.The trial comes at a moment of heightened scrutiny of the handling of sexual crimes in the country. Rape is defined in French law as an ""act of sexual penetration"" committed ""by violence, coercion, threat or surprise"". A number of lawmakers want to amend that wording to say explicitly that sex without consent is rape, that consent can be withdrawn at any time, and that consent cannot exist if sexual assault is committed ""by abusing a state impairing the judgment of another."" ""There is a kind of naivete on the topic of predators in France, a kind of denial,"" said lawmaker Sandrine Josso.","51 men, including Dominique Pelicot, will go on trial in Avignon, in a case that has shocked France.

Toddlers should not be allowed to watch screens at all, Sweden told parents on Monday. Children under the age of two should be kept away from digital media and TV completely, the country's Public Health Agency said. Kids between the ages of two and five should be limited to a maximum of one hour of screen time a day, it said in new recommendations, while those aged six to 12 should spend no more than an hour or two a day in front of a screen.Teenagers aged 13 to 18 should be limited to two to three hours per day, the agency said. Public health minister Jakob Forssmed said Swedish teens aged 13 to 16 spend six and a half hours a day on average in front of their screens, outside of school hours. He said that didn't leave ""a lot of time for communal activities, physical activity or adequate sleep"", and lamented a Swedish "" sleep crisis "" noting that more than half of 15-year-olds did not get enough sleep.RMS Titanic, a Georgia-based company that holds the legal rights to the 112-year-old underwater wreck, has completed its first trip to the site since 2010 and released images from the expedition on Monday. A highlight was the rediscovery of the bronze statue ""Diana of Versaille"", last seen in 1986, the company said. On a sadder note, a significant section of the railing that surrounds the ship bow's forecastle deck has fallen, it said. The railing still stood as recently as 2022.","Swedish children under two should not be allowed to watch screens at all, health agency says.

Kimchi no more? Climate change puts South Korea's beloved cabbage dish at risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/kimchi-no-more-climate-change-puts-south-koreas-beloved-cabbage-dish-at-risk/articleshow/113007804.cms,"GANGNEUNG: South Korea 's famous kimchi is falling victim to climate change , with scientists, farmers and manufacturers saying the quality and quantity of the napa cabbage that is pickled to make the ubiquitous dish is suffering due to rising temperatures.Napa cabbage thrives in cooler climates, and is usually planted in mountainous regions where temperatures during the key growing summer season once rarely rose above 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit).Studies show that warmer weather brought about by climate change is now threatening these crops, so much so that South Korea might not be able to grow napa cabbage one day due to the intensifying heat.""We hope these predictions don’t come to pass,"" plant pathologist and virologist Lee Young-gyu said.""Cabbage likes to grow in cool climate and adapts to a very narrow band of temperatures,"" Lee said. ""The optimal temperatures are between 18 and 21 Celsius.""In the fields and in kitchens - both commercial and domestic - farmers and kimchi makers are already feeling the change.Spicy, fermented kimchi is made from other vegetables such as radish, cucumber and green onion, but the most popular dish remains cabbage-based.Describing the effect of higher temperatures on the vegetable, Lee Ha-yeon, who holds the designation of Kimchi Master from the Agriculture Ministry, said the heart of the cabbage ""goes bad, and the root becomes mushy.""""If this continues, then in the summer time we might have to give up cabbage kimchi,"" said Lee, whose title reflects her contribution to food culture.Data from the government statistics agency shows the area of highland cabbage farmed last year was less than half of what it was 20 years ago: 3,995 hectares compared to 8,796 hectares.According to the Rural Development Administration, a state farming think tank, climate change scenarios project the farmed area to shrink dramatically in the next 25 years to just 44 hectares, with no cabbage grown in the highlands by 2090.Researchers cite higher temperatures, unpredictable heavy rains and pests that become more difficult to control in the warmer and longer summers as the cause for the crop shrinkage.A fungal infection that wilts the plant has also been particularly troublesome for farmers because it only becomes apparent very close to harvest.Climate change adds to the challenges facing South Korea's kimchi industry, which is already battling lower-priced imports from China, which are mostly served in restaurants.Customs data released on Monday showed kimchi imports through the end of July was up 6.9% at $98.5 million this year, almost all of it from China and the highest ever for the period.So far, the government has relied on massive climate-controlled storage to prevent price spikes and shortages. Scientists are also racing to develop crop varieties that can grow in warmer climates and that are more resilient to large fluctuations in rainfall and infections.But farmers like Kim Si-gap, 71, who has worked in the cabbage fields of the eastern region of Gangneung all his life, fear these varieties will be more expensive to grow in addition to not tasting quite right.""When we see the reports that there will come a time in Korea when we can no longer grow cabbage, it was shocking on the one hand and also sad at the same time,"" Kim said.""Kimchi is something we cannot not have on the table.

Swing state dynamics

Poll insights and campaign implications

The 2024 presidential race tightened as Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly led Donald Trump , according to the latest poll data . With less than two months remaining until Election Day , Harris gained momentum and held a slight edge over her Republican rival.A new ABC News/Ipsos poll, released on Sunday, revealed that Harris led Trump 50% to 46% among all adults and registered voters.Among likely voters, Harris’ lead widened to 52% compared to Trump’s 46%. This result was consistent with polling conducted before the Democratic National Convention, where Harris stood at 49% and Trump at 45%.Pollsters noted that while most numbers remained stable since August, Harris gained ground among women, now leading by 13 points (54% to 41%), up from a 6-point lead before the convention. Harris also received higher marks for her campaign, with 56% of Americans rating her performance as excellent or good, compared to 41% for Trump.Harris outperformed Trump in the battleground states, maintaining a slight advantage within the margins of error in nearly every national survey. NBC News reported that Harris fared better against Trump than Biden did before his exit, indicating growing confidence in her leadership.The concept of a margin of error, as explained by Pew Research, refers to the range within which a survey result is expected to fall relative to the true population value. While Harris' lead was within this range, it underscored the competitive nature of the race.Despite Harris’ lead, Trump maintained advantages in areas critical to voters. He outperformed Harris on trust regarding key issues such as the economy and inflation, leading by 8 points in each category. Trump also had a 9-point lead over Harris on handling the US-Mexico border. However, Harris was perceived as more trustworthy on protecting American democracy and Supreme Court appointments.The latest polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ also showed Harris with a 3.8-point national lead over Trump. The ABC News/Ipsos poll, conducted from August 23-27 with 2,496 completed interviews, had a margin of sampling error of 2.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.Despite Harris' gains, Trump remained a formidable opponent, consistently polling at around 47% nationwide. Polls conducted by The Wall Street Journal, EPIC-MRA in Michigan, and Bloomberg/Morning Consult in Georgia and Michigan all placed Trump at this level of support. However, the overall trend showed a reversal in fortunes since Biden's departure, with Harris now holding a narrow edge.Swing state polls revealed a complex and evolving landscape. Bloomberg/Morning Consult polls indicated that Harris had overtaken Trump within the margin of error in Georgia (50%), Michigan (49%), Nevada (50%), and Pennsylvania (51%). In Wisconsin, she held a more decisive lead at 53%, while she was tied with Trump in Arizona and North Carolina. This sharply contrasted with Biden’s performance in these states, where he struggled to gain traction.Before Harris took over the Democratic ticket, Biden trailed Trump, even before the June 27 debate that further damaged his campaign. Harris, on the other hand, was now seen as a more trusted leader and was performing better across the board.Additional polls from The Wall Street Journal, Quinnipiac, and Suffolk/USA Today also showed Harris in the lead, with percentages ranging from 48% to 49%. Trump remained close behind, polling between 43% and 48% in these surveys.The ABC News/Ipsos poll reflected Harris’ ability to leverage her campaign effectively, despite the race remaining highly competitive. Trump, while maintaining a solid base, faced challenges in closing the gap with Harris, who managed to capitalize on recent Democratic momentum.As both campaigns intensified their efforts, the upcoming weeks were crucial in determining whether Harris could sustain her lead or if Trump would make a comeback. With the presidential election just around the corner, all eyes were on how these dynamics evolved.","A new ABC News/Ipsos poll, released on Sunday, revealed that Harris led Trump 50% to 46% among all adults and registered voters.

Who is Maya Neelakantan?

There are two major musical moments in Season 4 of Stranger Things. The first is, of course, Kate Bush’s ""Running Up That Hill,"" and the second is Metallica ’s "" Master of Puppets ,"" which Eddie Munson plays in the Upside Down, a scene that has been labeled ""the most metal scene of all time."" Now, Joseph Quinn (who plays Eddie Munson) has some competition, and she’s even more metal.One of the standout performers at America’s Got Talent was 10-year-old Maya Neelakantan whose Master of Puppets cover wowed every judge and even Metallica who shared her performance on Facebook.She wrote on YouTube: ""Thank you so much! It was such an honor that Metallica trusted me that I’ll make them proud and I was able to play this iconic Metallica song for the first time ever on AGT! And the AGT crew are amazing in creating such an incredible unforgettable experience. Metallica was the reason I started playing guitar since 6 years old and now it feels like a full circle that I got to play Metallica for my 2nd ever biggest stage performance. That's what made this day most special for me! Thank you all for the love and support. It means a lot!""Maya advanced to the quarterfinals of America’s Got Talent, where she delivered a powerful rendition of Metallica's Master of Puppets, using a Gibson Flying V metallic silver guitar. Despite her electrifying performance, she did not advance to the semifinals. However, her journey on AGT significantly boosted her profile, earning her fans worldwide, including notable musicians like Gary Holt of Exodus and Slayer, who attended her audition to show his support.Here’s what you ought to know about the guitar prodigy :Maya Neelakantan, born on May 4, 2013, in Chennai, India, is a young guitar prodigy renowned for her unique fusion of heavy metal and Carnatic music . Hailing from MRC Nagar, Raja Annamalai Puram in Chennai, Maya has captivated audiences worldwide with her extraordinary talent and innovative musical style. Her journey began at the tender age of six when she picked up the guitar under the influence of her father, who, though not a professional musician, had a passion for playing riffs from iconic metal bands like Metallica and Slayer. This early exposure to rock music sparked Maya's interest, and soon she was learning to play her first song, ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" by Metallica.Maya's multicultural background has played a significant role in shaping her musical identity. Her father, an IT company owner with a background in astrophysics, and her mother, Lorina, an Australian entrepreneur, met in Australia. Maya’s diverse heritage and her family's musical inclinations inspired her to explore various genres, blending them seamlessly in her performances. At nine, she began formal training in Carnatic music with Prasanna Ramaswamy, a renowned Tamil guitarist based in New York. Prasanna's mentorship helped Maya develop a profound understanding of Carnatic music, which she skillfully integrates with her heavy metal renditions.Maya’s talent soon caught the attention of the global music community. In 2022, her cover of ""7empest"" by the Grammy-winning rock band Tool went viral on her YouTube channel, which her father had set up to showcase her skills. This performance impressed Adam Jones, Tool's guitarist, who became an admirer of her work. Jones even gifted Maya a customized Gibson Adam Jones Les Paul guitar, marking a significant milestone in her burgeoning career.In 2024, Maya's exceptional abilities led her to the stage of America's Got Talent (AGT), where she auditioned for the show's 19th season. Her performance was broadcast in June 2024, but the actual audition took place two months earlier when she was just ten years old. Dressed in traditional Indian attire, Maya wowed the audience and judges with a mesmerizing blend of a Carnatic devotional intro and a heavy metal rendition of ""Last Resort"" by Papa Roach. This unique fusion not only earned her a standing ovation but also garnered praise from all the AGT judges. Simon Cowell, known for his critical eye, hailed her as a ""rock goddess,"" while Howie Mandel predicted that her performance would go viral.Beyond her television appearances, Maya has continued to develop her musical style, drawing on her dual love for heavy metal and Carnatic music. She credits her grandmother for introducing her to Carnatic music at the age of two, a genre that has remained close to her heart even as she explored the world of metal. Maya's ambition to merge these two seemingly disparate styles has driven her to create a unique sound that reflects her diverse influences and her desire to push musical boundaries.","Maya Neelakantan is a young guitar prodigy renowned for her unique fusion of heavy metal and Carnatic music.

However, she recognized a ""diverse population of people"" who experience symbiosexual attraction.The study included 145 reports from participants expressing attraction to couples rather than to individual persons within the relationship. Johnston's research suggests that most self-identified symbiosexuals are extroverted, desire intimacy, care, and attention, and are less prone to jealousy.""I hope that this work will reduce stigma in both monogamous and non-monogamous communities and expand conceptualizations of desire in sexuality studies,"" Johnston said.Some participants who identify as queer and sexually open reported being primarily attracted to queer and non-heterosexual couples. Johnston intends to further investigate this evolving sexual identity, focusing on its implications for mental health and relationship satisfaction.","Experts at Seattle University discovered a new sexual orientation called "" symbiosexuality"" It involves being attracted to the shared energy, multidimensionality, and power between people in relationships rather than to individuals themselves.

Israeli PM Netanyahu pushes back against new pressure over Gaza and hostages: 'No one will preach to me',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israeli-pm-netanyahu-pushes-back-against-new-pressure-over-gaza-and-hostages-no-one-will-preach-to-me/articleshow/113008020.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday pushed back against mounting pressure for a cease-fire deal in Gaza . This resistance follows a weekend of massive protests in Israel and a critical stance from US President Joe Biden, who indicated that Netanyahu's efforts have been insufficient.In his first public address since the discovery of six dead hostages, Netanyahu reiterated his demand for continued Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor, a critical area along Gaza's border with Egypt.""This is the oxygen of Hamas,"" Netanyahu declared, emphasizing his commitment to ensuring Hamas cannot rearm through tunnels. He added, ""No one is more committed to freeing the hostages than me. ... No one will preach to me on this issue.""The public response to the hostages' deaths has been fierce. Thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Sunday night, leading to what is considered the largest protest since the conflict began. Many blame Netanyahu for the hostages' deaths, arguing that a deal with Hamas could have spared them. Monday saw a rare general strike across the country, disrupting major sectors of the economy. Demonstrators gathered outside Netanyahu's residence and his Likud party headquarters, chanting, ""Deal. Now."" and carrying coffins draped in the Israeli flag. Scuffles broke out as police intervened, and several protesters were arrested.Despite this, some Israelis support Netanyahu's stance, believing that continuing the campaign against Hamas is necessary to secure a long-term resolution. Netanyahu has pledged ""total victory"" over Hamas and rejects a full withdrawal from Gaza, arguing that no other party could control Gaza's borders.The United States has shown impatience with the ongoing conflict. President Biden, after a Situation Room meeting with the US mediation team, expressed frustration, stating, ""No,"" when asked if Netanyahu was doing enough. He added, ""Hope springs eternal,"" indicating that negotiators are close to a deal but progress remains slow.Hamas has accused Israel of prolonging negotiations by adding new demands, including continued control over the Philadelphi corridor. The group has proposed releasing all hostages in exchange for ending the war, withdrawing Israeli forces, and releasing a significant number of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya criticized Netanyahu, saying he deemed the corridor ""more important"" than winning the hostages' release.Tensions within Israel's security apparatus are evident, with reports of a heated argument between Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Gallant, who supports a cease-fire, criticized Netanyahu for prioritizing border security over the hostages' lives. ""Netanyahu was favoring border arrangements over the lives of hostages,"" an official revealed.The conflict, which began with Hamas' attack on October 7, has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, and the region is experiencing widespread displacement and a worsening humanitarian situation.In the West Bank, Israeli raids on the Jenin refugee camp continue, with reports of significant destruction and casualties. Palestinian officials and human rights groups have raised concerns about the treatment of detainees and the overall impact of the Israeli military operations.As the situation remains fluid, the international community watches closely, hoping for a resolution that addresses both the immediate humanitarian needs and the long-term security concerns of all parties involved.","Netanyahu reiterates his demand for continued Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor.

A pool reporter confirmed that at least one person appeared to have broken an arm and was receiving medical treatment at the scene.Despite the severity of the crash, Governor Walz was unharmed. He continued with his planned schedule, addressing the incident at a Labor Day event in Milwaukee shortly after the crash.

US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned together for the first time Monday, marking a significant moment in their joint bid for the White House. Their appearance in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania, aimed to rally support in this crucial battleground state, highlighting their collaborative effort as the November 5 election nears.At the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union hall, Biden praised Harris’s candidacy and reaffirmed his support.""We have made a lot of progress, and Kamala and I are going to build on that progress,"" Biden stated. He emphasized his continued involvement in the campaign, even as he steps back from the forefront. ""I'll be on the sidelines, but I'll do everything I can to help,"" he added.Harris, who has been energized by recent rallies and fundraising success, expressed her admiration for Biden's presidency. ""Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed,"" she said. The vice president also highlighted their administration’s pro-union stance, resonating with the crowd’s chants of ""We’re not going back!""In contrast, Republican candidate Donald Trump took the weekend off from campaigning and had no public events on Labor Day. Harris’s campaign took a jab at Trump’s absence, questioning his commitment to workers. Trump, however, defended his economic record on his Truth Social platform, claiming that Harris and Biden have undone his achievements.Harris, who has been working to define her platform, faces scrutiny for her policy shifts, such as her reversal on banning fracking—a key issue in Pennsylvania. The state remains a pivotal battleground, and the joint appearance with Biden marks the beginning of the final push toward Election Day.As Labor Day traditionally signifies the end of summer and the start of the election sprint, Harris urged supporters to embrace the upcoming challenges. ""64 days until the most important election of our lives,"" she declared. ""We have some hard work then ahead of us. But here's the beauty of us in this room — we like our work. Hard work is good work.""Meanwhile, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Harris’s running mate, was separately campaigning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as part of the broader effort to secure key states ahead of the November election.","US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned together for the first time Monday.

Biden says Netanyahu is not doing enough to free hostages in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-says-netanyahu-is-not-doing-enough-to-free-hostages-in-gaza/articleshow/113007443.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden issued a one-word rebuke Monday to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's commitment to reaching a cease-fire and hostage release deal, the latest iteration of the White House's monthslong effort to cajole and censure the Israeli leader.As he exited Marine One on the White House lawn on the way to a meeting of his national security team, Biden was asked a series of questions by waiting reporters about whether Netanyahu was doing enough to achieve a deal to get the hostages back.The president responded simply: ""no.""But as the advisers briefed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, whose every utterance on the Israel-Hamas war is being examined for evidence that she is ready to shift administration policy, it became clear that far more than just Netanyahu's own political calculations was getting in the way of a preliminary hostage exchange and six-week cease-fire.While administration officials say that they have locked down 90% of the 18-paragraph-long preliminary accord, Hamas has still not approved a final list of which hostages would be released and who would be released in a first phase. In return, Israel would release a large number of Hamas fighters and other prisoners.Among those who had been expected to be freed were several of the six Israeli and American hostages who were executed over the weekend, apparently after their captors feared that an Israeli rescue operation was underway. One of them was Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, a dual American and Israeli citizen who had lost an arm trying to protect others during the Oct. 7 terror attack that precipitated the Israel-Hamas war.Hamas has demanded that all Israeli forces be withdrawn from the Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow strip of land, less than 9 miles long, on the border between theGaza Strip and Egypt. Netanyahu has said Israeli troops must remain in the corridor to prevent the movement of weapons and ammunition to Hamas.The draft agreement calls for a major reduction in Israeli forces in the corridor during the first phase of the cease-fire and full withdrawal thereafter. Israeli government negotiators have agreed to the phased withdrawal, but Netanyahu has backed away from that part of the deal, triggering an open dispute with his own defense minister, Yoav Gallant.""It is too late for the hostages who were murdered in cold blood,"" Gallant said Sunday, declaring that Netanyahu had to drop his insistence on the presence of troops in the corridor. ""We must bring back the hostages that are still being held by Hamas.""White House officials are considering pushing another ""final"" draft of the agreement in coming days, after the region has cooled off from the execution of the hostages.There have been other final drafts. A week and a half ago, White House and State Department officials said there would be a meeting of the negotiators, except for Hamas, to approve a final accord. That meeting never happened after Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, rejected elements of it, and Netanyahu insisted on the continued military presence in the corridor.After the Situation Room meeting Monday, Biden said little about his strategy over the next days and weeks, including whether there would be a presentation of another final draft. ""We're in the middle of negotiations,"" Biden said to reporters after the meeting, on the way to a campaign event with Harris in Pennsylvania.Biden ignored a question about Netanyahu's defiant stance during a news conference in Israel on Monday, when the prime minister questioned what message it would send to Hamas after the deaths of the hostages if Israel let up in the fighting. ""Slay hostages and you'll get concessions?"" the prime minister said.Biden would only say that ""we're still in negotiations -- not with him, but with my colleagues from Qatar and Egypt.""Harris did not talk about the strategy. At the Democratic National Convention two weeks ago, she strongly backed Israel, while saying more had to be done to relieve the sufferings of the Palestinian people. But she has been careful to hew closely to the administration's current policy and deflected calls from the progressive wing of the party to cut off at least some weapons shipments to Israel, a step the British took Monday.The British decision puts its government and Washington at odds on the tactics for dealing with Netanyahu. Washington suspended export of 2,000-pound bombs earlier this year, saying their use could lead to wide civilian casualties and were not needed by the Israelis. But Britain has gone further. David Lammy, Britain's foreign secretary, said that a legal review concluded there was ""clear risk"" that a number of weapons would be used in ways that would breach international law. Biden and Harris have not reached a similar conclusion.Still, Biden and Netanyahu have clashed often in the past 10 months and with particular intensity since the spring. White House officials thought they were near a hostage deal in mid-July, one of several moments in which they believed -- and Biden publicly declared -- that the negotiations mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt would result in a temporary cease-fire, with hopes of a longer-lasting one.Other obstacles to a deal have come from Sinwar, who has been engaged in the negotiations remotely as he hides out, presumably underground in Gaza. Israeli military and intelligence officials, with American help, are hunting for Sinwar, considered the lead architect of the Oct. 7 attack that killed roughly 1,100 Israelis.",Biden and Netanyahu have clashed often in the past 10 months.

This specific aircraft had been based at a Venezuelan military facility but was also utilized for international travel, further extending the reach of Maduro’s regime.Matthew S.

NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell confirmed that two of the victims were critically wounded, while the other three are expected to recover.The suspect fled the scene.""This was not random,"" Chell said, emphasizing that the act was deliberate and not indicative of a broader threat. ""We do not by no means have any active shooter or anything of that nature running around Eastern Parkway as we speak. The parade is going on and will go on until later on tonight.""Despite the shooting , the parade continued, with thousands of revelers dancing and marching down Eastern Parkway, a key thoroughfare in Brooklyn. The event, now in its 57th year, is a highlight of the city's Labor Day celebrations, drawing enormous crowds who come to enjoy the vibrant display of Caribbean culture.An AP videographer who was nearby during the shooting saw at least two people being treated for what appeared to be wounds to the face and arm. The violence left many attendees shaken.""I'm crying over this, it's so terrible. How can someone have the heart to fire a gun around so many people—babies, children, the elderly,"" Jalissa Bailey told the New York Post. ""I know this parade has a history of violence, but things have been peaceful in recent years, and we got to hoping that there was enough security in place that maybe that was over with.""Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who was marching in the parade at the time, completed the route without incident. Police have since cordoned off the area near the shooting, placing crime scene markers and collecting evidence.

The tragic event unfolded at the Forest Park Station , a suburb located approximately 10 miles west of Chicago.Authorities were alerted to the shooting around 5:30 am. According to a statement from the Village of Forest Park, the victims were shot while traveling westbound on the train.Three were pronounced dead at the scene, while a fourth succumbed to injuries at a nearby hospital. The identities and details of the victims have not yet been disclosed.Forest Park Deputy Police Chief Christopher Chin indicated that the shooting occurred in two separate train cars as the train approached the Forest Park Station. It remains unclear how many passengers were aboard at the time.The suspected shooter fled the scene but was later apprehended at a Pink Line station, thanks to video surveillance that also led to the recovery of a firearm. Despite the seriousness of the incident, authorities are describing it as an ""isolated"" event, with Deputy Chief Chin noting the unusual nature of such violence in the area.""This, obviously, is shocking,"" Chin said at a press conference. ""It is uncommon to have a mass shooting like this particularly close to home.""Forest Park Mayor Rory Hoskins echoed these sentiments, describing the shooting as an ""outlier"" and urging the CTA to enhance public safety measures.

Lawrence Bishnoi gang behind AP Dhillon's Vancouver house firing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lawrence-bishnoi-gang-behind-ap-dhillons-vancouver-house-firing/articleshow/113003612.cms,"AP Dhillon's Canada Residence Attacked; Goldy Brar's Role Suspected | Watch Video

NEW DELHI: The Lawrence Bishnoi gang has claimed responsibility for allegedly firing shots outside the residence of popular Punjabi singer AP Dhillon in Vancouver , Canada. The incident came to light on Sunday. According to reports, multiple gunshots were fired outside Dhillon's house, with a circulating point of view (POV) video depicting a man firing with an automatic pistol outside the house during the night.Dhillon, a prominent figure in the Punjabi music industry, resides on Victoria Island in British Columbia.In a social media post, Bishnoi's right-hand man, gangster Rohit Godara, wrote, ""Greetings to all brothers. On the night of Sept 1, we executed shootings at two locations in Canada-Victoria Island and Woodbridge, Toronto. I, Rohit Godara (Lawrence Bishnoi Group), claim responsibility for this act.""The post further reads: ""The house on Victoria Island belongs to AP Dhillon. Salman Khan is featured in your songs, and you flaunt your actions. The underworld life you emulate is the life we live. Stay in your place, or you will meet a dog's death.""The incident occurred shortly after Dhillon's latest music video release, ""Old Money"", which features Salman Khan. The intelligence agencies are investigating if this was the trigger for the shooting , as is evident from Godara's message.The incident in Canada bears a striking similarity to a previous shooting that took place outside Khan's residence at Galaxy Apartment in Mumbai's Bandra on April 14 this year. The investigation into that shooting revealed connections to the notorious Bishnoi gang, prompting the Mumbai police to invoke Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against all the individuals involved.The Lawrence Bishnoi gang has been implicated in several high-profile cases in the last year. His key associate, Godara, orchestrated the assassination of Karni Sena chief Sukhdev Gogamedi in Rajasthan last year. He has also been issuing threats to Delhi's business community.Godara was last found shuttling between Portugal and Azerbaijan but is suspected to have escaped to the US through the donkey route. Interpol had issued a red corner notice against Godara in Dec last year following a request from Indian law enforcement agencies.Associated with the Bishnoi and Goldy Brar syndicate for a few years, Godara fled the country in June 2022 from Delhi. ""On June 13, 2022, Godara is learnt to have fled from Delhi to Dubai on a forged passport issued in the name of one 'Pawan Kumar',"" said an official.Originally from Bikaner, Godara turned to crime in 2010 and is wanted in at least 32 serious cases.","Lawrence Bishnoi gang claims responsibility for allegedly firing shots outside the residence of popular Punjabi singer AP Dhillon in Vancouver, Canada.

There are contradictory accounts of what Queen Elizabeth II thought about former US president Donald Trump , his marriage with Melania . But now we know what Trump thought about the Queen. In his book Save America to be published on September 3, which is a collection of memorable photos from Trump's life, Trump wrote: ""They said I made the Queen happy, and I said, 'No she made me happy!"".This has been written next to a photo of Trump laughing with the late Queen.Recently, there was some controversy over Craig Brown's claim that the late Queen thought Trump was rude. Brown wrote in his book A Voyage Around the Queen that the Queen confided in a lunch guest that Trump was always looking over her shoulder as if he was looking for something more interesting. Brown claimed that the Queen also believed that Trump had some kind of an arrangement with Melania.Trump election campaign dismissed the claim and said it was a fake news intended to sell more copies of the book. ""This is nothing more than fake news intended to use made-up, salacious fabrications in order to sell copies of a book that belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section,"" Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director said.In the wake of the 'rude' claim, Donald Trump told Daily Mail that it was just the opposite. He was her favorite president, Trump said claiming that Queen told that to many people. “We spent hours together at a state dinner. She was a fantastic woman. I think it’s a shame that a sleaze bag can write an article that’s totally false. In fact, I’ve heard always the opposite,"" Trump earlier commented.""While people thought I didn't get along with her, I did very much get along with her. She was a strong leader who made two mistakes on energy and allowing in more than one million aliens (migrants) into Germany.

Arlington spat puts spotlight on Trump’s role in Afghanistan fiasco,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arlington-spat-puts-spotlight-on-trumps-role-in-afghanistan-fiasco/articleshow/113001977.cms,"WASHINGTON: Several ""Gold Star"" military families ripped into Kamala Harris on Sunday, holding her administration responsible for the death of their beloved in the botched US withdrawal from Kabul three years ago even as the fierce controversy over Donald Trump 's visit to the Arlington cemetery last week brought attention to his role in the American debacle in Afghanistan.Pushing back at the MAGA narrative that the Biden-Harris administration alone was responsible for the fiasco that culminated in the death of 13 US military personnel in a suicide bombing, Gen H.R.McMaster, who served as Trump's National Security Advisor before resigning in 2018, underscored the former President's role in the disaster by negotiating with the Taliban, including inviting them to Camp David, and throwing the Afghan government under the bus.Compounding that mistake the Trump administration released 5000 of the most heinous people and literally handing over the country to Taliban, McMaster said in a TV interview, while other critics said his decision to reduce US troops to 2500 was an invitation to disaster.Those released in the Trump deal included Abdul Ghani Baradar, Afghanistan's current deputy Prime minister, whom Trump frequently refers to only by his first name, while claiming that his threat to bomb ""Abdool"" by sending him a satellite photo of his house prevented US casualties.Meanwhile, the Trump campaign tapped into the anger of eight of the 13 Gold Star family members to release a video in which they excoriated Harris for not reaching out to them, and said they had invited Trump for the memorial and were honoured he attended the event. ""Are you in my shoes? I invited him. My son was murdered under the Biden-Harris administration,"" Gold Star mom Kelly Hoover told NBC when asked if it was “appropriate” for Trump to visit Arlington National Cemetery.Trump surrogates also sought to pin Harris to the tragedy citing her statement that she was the ""last person in the room"" -- a vice-presidential template to assert their inclusion when crucial decisions are made.""The media tried to make a story out of Trump showing up. The real story is that these families lost their loved ones because Kamala Harris is incompetent, and they're rightfully pissed off about it,"" Trump's running mate JD Vance tweeted.But there were also family members of other military personnel killed in Afghanistan who were critical of what they saw as Trump's grandstanding on the issue. ""You can’t stand on the graves of better men who fought and died for this country while you rip apart that country with your incompetence,"" Marine Widow Kait Wyatt, who lost her husband in Afghanistan, said on an emotive issue that is dividing the US service personnel.In a counteroffensive, the anti-Trump veteran's group VoteVets released an ad listing some of Trump's most offensive and egregious comments on the military, including calling fallen soldiers ""losers"" and ""suckers,"" which Trump denies even though he has publicly disparaged war heroes and service in the military, including flippantly claiming a civilian medal is better than a military honour because it did not involve sacrifice. White House officials also told NBC News that contrary to the claim of some Gold Star families , they had not invited President Biden or Vice-President Harris for what was a private event.","Several ""Gold Star"" military families ripped into Kamala Harris on Sunday, holding her administration responsible for the death of their beloved in the botched US withdrawal from Kabul three years ago.

Anti-terror op turns sinister: Pakistani netizens being 'walled off' as army raises spectre of 'digital terrorism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terror-op-turns-sinister-pakistani-netizens-being-walled-off-as-army-raises-spectre-of-digital-terrorism/articleshow/112898501.cms,"Munir's repeated attacks on social media

Imran's ouster & rise of digital activism

National internet firewall

NEW DELHI: Pakistan 's ""whole-of-system approach"" to countering militancy is evolving and may be taking a turn to the sinister as its army's new anti-terror operation ' Azm-e-Istehkam ' (Resolve for Stability) is increasingly focusing on what it calls "" digital terrorism "".Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has over the past few months repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.He described the activities of ""inimical"" forces as a form of ""digital terrorism"" aimed at creating discord between the military and the public by spreading ""lies and fake news"".Launched in June, Azm-e-Istehkam is tackling not only traditional militancy, particularly in light of increasing attacks attributed to groups like the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but the evolving nature of threats in the digital landscape.The shift has sparked widespread concern with some analysts suggesting that the military is carrying out ""prejudiced online surveillance"" and curbing internet speeds across the country to battle the new ""digital threat"".The characterisation of digital terrorism in Munir's speeches have been notably vague, with rights activists noting that the term lacks a clear legal definition and could be weaponised against individuals who express criticism of the military or government policies online.In recent months, Munir has repeatedly voiced ""concerns"" regarding the impact of social media on national security and public discourse.In May -- just months before launching Azm-e-Istehkam -- Munir highlighted the issue of ""negative propaganda"" on social media, asserting that it poses threats to the integrity and security of Pakistan. He emphasised the military's readiness to counter any conspiracies and condemned the spread of disinformation, urging adherence to constitutional limits on freedom of expression, particularly as outlined in Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which restricts incitement to violence and undermining national security.In August, Munir reiterated these concerns, stating that social media is being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"" and warned against campaigns targeting the military. His remarks came in the context of rising tensions and comparisons being drawn to political instability in neighboring countries.On August 14, he again criticised the misuse of social media for spreading chaos and false information, attributing ""digital terrorism"" to foreign elements. He stressed the state's responsibility to protect citizens from the adverse effects of social media-driven hysteria and urged the public to remain vigilant against misinformation.He also warned that social media was being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"". His remarks that ""anarchy is spread through social media"" followed a condemnation by the army of social media campaigns to target the Pakistan Armed Forces.""Just as terrorists use weapons to get their demands met, digital terrorists use negative propaganda and fake news on social media platforms, mobiles and computers to create despondency to get their demands met,"" Pakistani military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said.Chaudhry said the military had become the sole target of digital terrorists, and blamed a ""certain"" political party without naming ousted PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, which has a formidable social media presence.Imran Khan has repeatedly accused the military for orchestrating his removal from power in April 2022, and specifically named Munir as being responsible for his subsequent arrest in May 2023, claiming the Army chief harboured a ""personal grudge"" against him.Khan also alleged that Munir was behind the crackdown on his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), stating: ""It is personal. It's got nothing to do with national interest"". He also accused Munir of ""dismantling the future of this country [Pakistan] to protect himself"".Khan's arrest led to riots in May where protesters for the first time in the nation's history vented their anger on the military attacking several army installations.Digital activism in Pakistan spiked following Imran's ouster, whose party has relied heavily on social media to coordinate its activities. After TV channels were banned from covering PTI events, Khan gave several speeches online challenging the military's role in politics.These online events were often marred by internet blackouts or slowdown. Though authorities have said the drop in internet speed was due to technical issues, activists have claimed that the army is strategically using a national firewall and manipulating the country's internet infrastructure to curb any dissenting voices on the web.Pakistan has experienced a notable slowdown in internet speeds over the past few months, with reports indicating that up to 40% slower speeds have affected nearly half of the country's 241 million internet users.Users have reported difficulties in sending and receiving messages on platforms like WhatsApp and accessing social media sites, which are crucial for communication and information dissemination, especially among the youth and political activists.Information Technology minister Shiza Fatima Khawaja has confirmed that it was upgrading its ""web management system"" to cope with cybersecurity threats but did not link the development to slower internet speeds.TOI has reported that the Pakistan government tested its firewall on two occasions, once in July and a second time in mid-August. Pakistan has allocated more than $70 million for a Digital Infrastructure Development Initiative in the latest budget.The timing of these frequent slowdowns also coincides with the launch of operation Azm-e-Istehkam, raising questions about whether the internet disruptions are also linked to efforts to control information amid rising political tensions and protests against the military's actions.Technology experts have suggested that the newly implemented internet firewall could provide the government with enhanced capabilities to censor online content, drawing comparisons to China's stringent internet regulations.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.","Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.

Attacks in Balochistan bid to derail SCO summit in October: Pakistan govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/attacks-in-balochistan-bid-to-derail-sco-summit-in-october-pakistan-govt/articleshow/112974277.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A surge in daring militant attacks across Pakistan’s volatile provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has raised questions about the country’s internal security situation . Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.Amid heightened political polarisation in Pakistan, both Baloch separatists and Islamic militants, known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have intensified their attacks on security personnel and their facilities in the country’s southwest and northwest.The Baloch separatists also target people of Punjabi ethnicity in the province.On Aug 26, more than 70 people were killed in targeted killings and suicide bombings in different districts of Balochistan, while in Kulachi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In a separate incident, a senior army officer, Lt Col Khalid Ameer, and three of his relatives, were kidnapped by TTP fighters when they were meeting people on their father’s death in Dera Ismail Khan. The army’s media wing, however, said on Sunday they have been released due to the role played by tribal elders.When the separatist militant outfit, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), bombed a railway bridge linking Balochistan to the rest of Pakistan, attacked police and military posts, and targeted buses and trucks on a major highway, Pakistan’s Army chief General Asim Munir was meeting General Li Qiaoming, Commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. The bombings and shootings on August 25-26 were the deadliest in years in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.Former Balochistan chief minister, Abdul Malik Baloch, said disappointment is pushing people into insurgency. “Many Baloch are losing faith in Islamabad because of what they perceive to be its political intervention in the province. Political activists tell me that democracy here is a fraud. They feel we are wasting their time,” Baloch said.BLA’s coordinated attacks in Balochistan on Aug 25–26 demonstrated their growing strength. It is believed that US military hardware and weaponry have found their way into the hands of Pakistani militant organisations. Military equipment and weapons, worth billions of dollars, were left behind by the US and international forces following their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. BLA’s acquisition of modern weapons, security experts believe, has enhanced its combat capabilities.Majority of BLA’s sophisticated strikes are thought to have been executed by the group’s suicide squad, known as Majeed Brigade.Islamabad blames Kabul for patronising Baloch separatists and the TTP. Qari Fasihuddin Fitrat, the military chief of Afghan Taliban , denied the accusation saying the militants plan and execute attacks from within Pakistan.","Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16. Both Baloch separatists and Islamic militants, known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have intensified their attacks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112974272,imgsize-85962,width-400,resizemode-4/112974272.jpg"
"UNICEF: Malnutrition primary contributor to Pakistan's disease burden for years, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/malnutrition-primary-contributor-to-pakistans-disease-burden-for-years-says-report/articleshow/112967080.cms,"ISLAMABAD: As faltering economy remain a persistent cause of growing discontent among the country's people, and poor growth, another important subject--malnutrition--too remains a primary factor in Pakistan 's disease burden for many years, according to Dawn.The opinion piece in Dawn stated that Pakistan's lawmakers cannot escape the fact that malnutrition is a major socioeconomic determinant of maternal health, gender empowerment, child marriage and education.It, in fact, poses a grave threat to entire communities, as well as the economy.Together with representatives from Unicef and FAFEN, the Women's Parliamentary Caucus recently noted that malnutrition costs Pakistan roughly 3 per cent of its GDP and that the nation has the second-highest rate of diabetes patients.They also emphasised the importance of ""targeted intervention"" with child- and family-related laws and gender-specific social issues to advance meaningful policy changes.Citing data, Dawn reported that four out of 10 children under five years of age are stunted, 17.7 per cent suffer from wasting, 28.9 per cent are underweight and 9.5 per cent in the same age bracket are overweight.Dawn revealed an IPC analysis showing that a shocking 2.14 million children are acutely malnourished across Pakistan, which arose as a result of government apathy and reluctance to take up nutrition as a political programme.The need of the hour in Pakistan is to shift its focus on guided hygiene practices, healthcare, and food security. Moreover, a brief knowledge about sanitation, nutrition and feeding habits among women and children should form the core focus of government-driven campaigns and policies.It is impossible to attain even a minimal reduction in undernutrition and malnutrition indicators without consistent funding and healthcare system improvements to close the wealth and poverty divides between rich and poor communities, as well as between rural and urban areas, Dawn stated citing the opinion piece.Earlier this month, the Pakistan government and the IMF staff concluded the ninth review of the $6.5 billion bailout package without a staff-level agreement. The Pakistan government had hoped that they would be able to convince the IMF about implementing the conditions in a gradual manner.However, Islamabad's hopes were dashed during the IMF mission's 10-day visit to Pakistan.","Pakistan's lawmakers cannot escape the fact that malnutrition is a major socioeconomic determinant of maternal health, gender empowerment, child marriage and education. 4 out of 10 children under five years of age are stunted, 17.7 per cent suffer from wasting, 28.9 per cent are underweight and 9.5 per cent in same age bracket are overweight.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112967135,imgsize-23132,width-400,resizemode-4/112967135.jpg"

Jahangiri enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The university deemed the degree invalid , claiming that they issue only one enrolment number per degree programme, making it impossible for a candidate to have multiple enrolment numbers, Dawn reported.Jahangiri had earlier complained to the Supreme Judicial Council about the Chief Justice and said that the Inter-Services Intelligence interfered in judicial affairs. He also said that spy cameras were detected in the bedroom and entrance of a judge's house and the matter was reported to Chief Justice but no action was taken in response, Dawn stated.","The announcement came after the alleged ""illegal detention"" of a syndicate member Raiz Ahmed by three police stations on Saturday.

As Pakistan grapples with a surge in terrorist strikes in the past couple of years, its restive Balochistan province was rocked this week by a wave of attacks that have left more than 70 dead. The coordinated strikes, perhaps more widespread than any such assault in the past, by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army ( BLA ), have again foregrounded Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources as the soft underbelly of Pakistan.The attacks, which saw BLA targeting police stations and taking control of major highways, coincided with the death anniversary of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who was killed 18 years ago in one of then president Pervez Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations.","Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources.

They were human beings with families, aspirations, and communities that now mourn their loss. Their deaths highlight a broader, ongoing humanitarian crisis in Balochistan, where the state's disregard for human rights continues to persist unchecked.""Paank also condemned the Pakistani administration for turning a blind eye to the suffering of the people in Balochistan.Instead of addressing the root causes of unrest--such as political disenfranchisement, economic marginalization, and a lack of basic services--the government has resorted to illegal, inhumane, and repressive tactics.These actions not only violate the principles of justice and democracy but also undermine Pakistan's commitments to international human rights standards.They also urged the international community not to remain silent in the face of these grave human rights violations.
