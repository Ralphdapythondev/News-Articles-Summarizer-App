(With inputs from agencies)

As Hurricane Milton barrels toward Florida 's Gulf Coast, the storm has triggered mass evacuations , fuel shortages, and traffic jams across the state. The Category 5 hurricane, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, is expected to make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday. With over a million people ordered to flee, officials have issued urgent warnings, describing the storm as a potentially ""catastrophic"" event, especially for the Tampa Bay area.The storm comes just 12 days after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the state, further exacerbating Florida's vulnerability to Milton’s destruction. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and President Joe Biden have both urged residents in evacuation zones to leave immediately, warning that this could be a life-or-death situation.Officials have mandated the evacuation of over a million people living along Florida’s west coast. The hardest-hit areas are expected to be Tampa Bay and surrounding counties, with residents fleeing ahead of Hurricane Milton's anticipated landfall.Long lines at gas stations and bumper-to-bumper traffic clogged Florida’s roads as residents scrambled to evacuate. According to GasBuddy, around 17% of the state’s gas stations ran out of fuel by Tuesday evening, with some areas experiencing nearly 43% fuel shortages.After briefly weakening, Hurricane Milton regained Category 5 status, with sustained winds of 165 mph. The National Hurricane Center warned that the storm could cause widespread destruction, including a life-threateningstorm surge .Meteorologists are concerned about Milton’s rapid intensification and unusual path, making its potential impact difficult to predict. The Tampa Bay area hasn’t seen a direct hurricane hit since 1921, increasing worries about the storm’s devastating potential.Forecasters predict storm surges of 10 to 15 feet along Florida's coastline, threatening to inundate hundreds of miles of beachfront property. Such surges could level buildings, destroy infrastructure, and endanger lives, particularly in low-lying areas.President Joe Biden postponed international travel to oversee the federal response to Milton, urging Floridians to heed evacuation orders. ""It's a matter of life and death,"" he warned, stressing that staying behind in evacuation zones could be fatal.More than 5,000 members of the Florida National Guard have been deployed, with an additional 3,000 on standby to assist in the aftermath of the storm. These troops will help in search-and-rescue missions and provide essential services in affected areas.Hurricane Milton threatens to disrupt major industries across Florida. Approximately 2.8% of the U.S. gross domestic product is in the storm's direct path, with airlines, energy firms, and theme parks already halting operations in preparation for the hurricane’s landfall.Tampa Mayor Jane Castor urged residents not to underestimate the storm, recalling the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago. “If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you’re going to die,” Castor warned, underscoring the gravity of the situation.Florida’s west coast is still reeling from Hurricane Helene’s impact, which eroded beaches, destroyed dunes, and left infrastructure weakened. The aftermath of Helene has left the state particularly vulnerable to the destruction Milton is expected to bring.","Hurricane Milton is expected to make landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday or Thursday.

Diving Accident: Remains of American woman's body found inside Shark's stomach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/remains-of-american-womans-body-found-inside-sharks-stomach/articleshow/114061508.cms,"Colleen Monfore (Picture Credit: X)

The remains of an American woman , who disappeared on a vacation trip, have been discovered inside the stomach of a shark, according to the woman's friend.Colleen Monfore , 68, a retired mom of two from the US state of Michigan , was enjoying vacation — a seven-week diving tour with her husband, Mike — when tragedy struck on September 26. Asia Pacific Press reported that Monfore was diving near the Pulau Reong island off the coast of Indonesia ’s Southwest Maluku Regency when she did not resurface.Two weeks after Monfore disappeared in the tropical waters, a fisherman spotted a distressed shark and killed it, Fox News reported. After cutting open the shark’s stomach, the fisherman found what is believed to be Monfore’s remains along with her wet suit and bathing suit.Initial reports suggested that a shark had killed Monfore and eaten her, but according to Monfore’s friend Kim Sass, this story is likely false.Sass, who wrote on a Facebook post that Monfore was her “very good friend”, and shared what we know so far about the case, and how it is more likely that her friend died because of a medical issue during a dive.A fisherman captured the shark around October 4, near Timor-Leste, a southeast Asian country which is 70 miles away from the dive site where Monfore vanished, Monfore’s remains were identifiable, she added.""Colleen's body was identifiable. Her fingerprints (again identifiable) are being used by our US Embassy and the local government for proof of death,"" Sass wrote. ""This would not be possible if the shark had attacked her weeks ago.""While it can take days for sharks to fully digest a meal, the stomach of a shark ""produces an acid that is strong enough to dissolve metal,"" while ""large bones and other indigestible objects are prevented from going past the stomach due to the small size of the opening to the intestine,"" according to the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources.Sass believes that the nearly eight-day gap between Monfore's disappearance and the shark's capture indicates that the shark likely consumed Monfore after she had already died.""There was a down current at the turnaround site, but it was manageable,"" she wrote. ""I've easily done 1000+ dives with this gracious woman; she was an excellent diver. I don't believe it was the environment and certainly not a shark that ended her life.""It remains unclear how exactly Monfore died.","Colleen Monfore, 68, a retired mom of two from the US state of Michigan, was enjoying a seven-week diving tour with her husband, Mike.

US Vice President Kamala Harris sidestepped a direct answer when asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could still be considered a ""close ally"" of the United States, according to Al Jazeera.In an interview excerpt with CBS News's 60 Minutes, released on Sunday, Harris was questioned about the US response to Israel's ongoing attacks on Gaza and Lebanon amid growing criticism of Netanyahu's actions, despite calls from the US for de-escalation.Democratic candidate Harris in the upcoming November presidential election, responded by emphasising US efforts to pressure both Israel and Arab nations in the Middle East to agree to a ceasefire. ""The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel,"" she told 60 Minutes.When pressed on whether the US still considers Netanyahu a ""real, close ally,"" Harris deflected, saying, ""I think, with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people?

Supernova music festival, killing hundreds and abducting dozens



NEW DELHI: Israel on Tuesday shared a video commemorating the October 7 attack by Hamas , which claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people and saw over 100 individuals abducted by the militant group.In a post on X sharing a video, Israel said, ""One year ago, Iran-backed terrorists launched a war to wipe Israel off the map. They slaughtered more than a thousand innocents and took 251 hostage.Every day since, Israel has been working to bring all the hostages home while protecting its citizens and fighting a multi-front war for its very survival.""On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale, surprise assault on Israel, marking one of the deadliest escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in recent years. The attack coincided with the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and significantly intensified hostilities in the region, prompting a swift and aggressive response from the Israeli military.The assault began early in the morning when Hamas, which controlsGaza , fired thousands of rockets into Israeli territory. Cities including Tel Aviv, Ashkelon, and Jerusalem were targeted, triggering sirens and causing civilians to seek shelter.However, the rocket attacks were part of a broader, coordinated operation. Hamas militants breached the heavily fortified Gaza-Israel border, using bulldozers to break through barriers, motorcycles for rapid movement, and paragliders to bypass security checkpoints. The militants entered Israeli communities and military bases near the border, leading to numerous casualties.The attack resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis, both civilians and military personnel. In a shocking development, Hamas fighters took dozens of hostages, including women, children, and soldiers, transporting them back to Gaza. Videos circulated on social media showed hostages being paraded through Gaza’s streets, heightening tensions. The abductions added a layer of complexity to Israel's military response as the safety of the hostages became a critical concern.In a forceful response Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) launched extensive airstrikes targeting Hamas positions, command centers, and weapons storage facilities in Gaza. The Israeli government declared a state of war and mobilised hundreds of thousands of reservists.The IDF sought to regain control of the border areas and eliminate any Hamas militants still operating inside Israeli territory. In the ensuing hours, precision airstrikes aimed to disable Hamas’s military capabilities, though these operations also caused significant destruction in Gaza, leading to civilian casualties.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then addressed the nation and declared that Israel is at war and promised a decisive, prolonged response.He vowed that Hamas would ""pay a heavy price"" for the attack, calling it a ""day of infamy"" for Israel.What began as a night of celebration at Israel's Supernova music festival turned into horror when Hamas militants launched a deadly ambush, firing indiscriminately and abducting dozens of attendees. Organised by Osher and Michael Waknin, the event was intended to promote friendship, love, and freedom but became the site of the deadliest attack in Israel's 75-year history.The festival, which attracted around 3,500 electronic music enthusiasts from Israel and abroad, featured multiple stages, international DJs, and camping facilities. As dawn broke on October 7, the music abruptly stopped when rockets fired by Hamas targeted the venue, signalling the start of the tragic events.Ephraim Mordechayev, a 23-year-old soldier enjoying the festivities, recounted his experience. Initially, he and his friends, used to the occasional rocket launches from the Gaza Strip, did not comprehend the severity of the situation. However, as chaos spread, they realised that armed militants had infiltrated the event, arriving on foot, motorcycles, and even by air, firing automatic weapons at civilians.""There is someone that is 20, 10 metres from you with guns and trying to kill you,"" Mordechayev told AFP.","Israel on Tuesday shared a video commemorating the October 7 attack by Hamas.

He later settled in Normandy , France, in 2016, where he pursued a career as a painter.Retailleau, who recently took office as France’s new interior minister, said on X that Omar bin Laden had been residing in the Orne department of Normandy as the spouse of a British citizen.He added that Omar bin Laden “posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that advocated terrorism,” prompting the prefect of Orne to issue an expulsion order.Retailleau said, ""I am today issuing an administrative ban on Mr. Omar Bin Laden, the eldest son of the international terrorist Osama Bin Laden. Mr. Bin Laden, who has lived in Orne for several years as the spouse of a British national, posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that were an apology for terrorism. As a result, the Prefect of Orne issued an OQTF and obtained Mr. Bin Laden's departure. The courts have confirmed the regularity of this decision taken for national security. The administrative ban on the territory guarantees that Mr. Bin Laden will not be able to return to France for any reason whatsoever.""“The courts have confirmed the legality of this decision taken in the interests of national security,” Retailleau affirmed. Additionally, the minister signed a ban preventing Omar bin Laden from re-entering France “for any reason whatsoever.” No further details were provided, and it remains unclear whether he has already left the country.Omar bin Laden gained media attention in 2007 when he married British national Jane Felix-Browne, who later adopted the Muslim name Zaina Mohammed.The marriage, marked by the couple's significant age gap, sparked widespread interest. Omar's application to reside in the UK was previously denied by British authorities.Osama bin Laden, the son of a wealthy Saudi construction tycoon, reportedly fathered around two dozen children. He was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011.Retailleau has pledged to tackle issues related to immigration and crime and said that “the rule of law is neither intangible nor sacred.” His appointment as interior minister reflects the French government’s shift to the right under the leadership of new Prime Minister Michel Barnier, following a hung parliament result in this summer’s legislative elections.","Omar bin Laden, 43, was born in Saudi Arabia and has also lived in Sudan and Afghanistan.

The timing of the release comes just as Trump’s past ties with Putin are once again under scrutiny, with questions swirling about the nature of their communication both during and after Trump’s presidency.The video, likely aimed at raising eyebrows and concerns about Trump's foreign policy allegiances as the 2024 election heats up, showcases several key moments where Trump appears to laud his relationship with the Russian leader.In one of the clips, Trump is heard saying, “And I talked to Putin a lot. I got along with him well,” before he added in another, “I know Putin so well.”Another part of the compilation features Trump congratulating Putin, saying, “I'd like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal. Did you see the deal we've met?”The montage continues with Trump reaffirming his connection, saying, “Oh no, I had a very good relationship. That’s a good thing, not a bad thing. You know what I’m trying to tell people. No, it’s a good thing.”A particularly pointed moment shows Trump alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a visibly uncomfortable exchange. Trump can be seen remarking, ""And I also have very good relationship as you know with President Putin, and if we win, I think we are gonna get it resolved very quickly,"" supposedly referring to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Zelenskyy, caught in an awkward moment, responds, ""I hope we have more good relations,"" to which Trump replies, ""Oh, I see. But you know, it takes two to tango.""These clips, while not new, have gained fresh significance following revelations from veteran journalist Bob Woodward's forthcoming book War, which alleges secret conversations between Trump and Putin. Among the more controversial claims in the book is a reported exchange of Covid-19 testing machines between the US and Russia in 2020—a deal that could have sparked major backlash had it been publicized.Woodward’s book paints a picture of a behind-the-scenes rapport between Trump and Putin, raising the specter of potential Logan Act violations, which prohibits unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.As Trump prepares for the 2024 presidential race, his interactions with Putin could emerge as a major talking point. For many Americans, Trump's stance on Russia has long been a source of debate, especially in light of the 2016 election interference investigations. The Harris campaign appears to be positioning Trump’s past relationships as a central issue of concern for voters.","Kamala Harris' campaign released a compilation video featuring former President Donald Trump speaking warmly about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Although they were cooperative during questioning, they denied any knowledge of the allegations.On September 30, law enforcement conducted a search at a Wheatfield residence where Valle and Sebella were believed to have previously lived. During the search, police uncovered bone fragments from three locations on the property.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit , following India's refusal earlier. Last Friday, India confirmed that foreign minister S Jaishankar would lead a delegation to Pakistan for the summit in Islamabad.Responding to a question on Jaishankar's visit and India-Pakistan relations , the spokesperson said that Pakistan had ""officially received notification"" about the visit and is prepared to welcome all participating members.Further on the question of bilateral talks, the spokesperson cited Jaishnakar's refusal and assured to toe the same line.""Regarding your question about bilateral meetings, I would like you to refer to the remarks made by the Indian minister for external affairs on 5th of October, in which he maintained that his visit was meant for a multilateral event and not for discussing Pakistan-India relations. These remarks are self-explanatory,"" she said.The last time an Indian external affairs minister visited Pakistan was when Sushma Swaraj in December 2015 travelled for a forum on the Afghanistan issue. However, Jaishankar's upcoming visit is looked at as a significant move by New Delhi, given the strained bilateral relations between the two countries.Tensions escalated after India carried out airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot in February 2019, following the Pulwama terror attack. Relations worsened further after India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and reorganised the state into two union territories in August 2019, leading Pakistan to downgrade diplomatic ties.India has consistently stated its desire for normal relations with Pakistan, which New Delhi has said will depend on Islamabad creating an environment free of terrorism and hostility.In May 2023, Pakistan's then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India for an SCO foreign ministers' meeting in Goa, marking the first such visit by a Pakistani foreign minister in nearly 12 years.Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, confirmed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will chair the upcoming Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting of the SCO.""We expect high-level participation from SCO members; the observer state of Mongolia; Turkmenistan as a special guest; and representatives of the international organisations, including Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and European Economic Community (EEC),"" she said.The spokesperson stated that the CHG meeting will focus on discussions regarding cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, environment, and socio-cultural connections, while also reviewing the SCO's overall performance.","Pakistan has ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit.

The weather’s nice. Never too hot, and never cold, thanks to its geography, bang in the equatorial monsoon region of Southeast Asia.

Singapore’s prosperity is the stuff of global envy. At $141,500, its per capita income in PPP terms (a fairer measure than nominal dollar figures) ranks second after Luxembourg globally. In Asia, it’s the richest country.

in PPP terms (a fairer measure than nominal dollar figures) ranks second after Luxembourg globally. In Asia, it’s the richest country. It has the world’s highest concentration of millionaires, meaning the largest number of millionaires per square km.

It hosts a raft of global companies, who love Singapore’s low taxes, top class infra, hassle-free regulation (it takes a day to incorporate a company).

The city-state ranks 5th in the list of global startup hubs.

Poverty line, what’s that?

Same old story

Remember that movie,? It opens with a manager of a ritzy London hotel acting snooty to a Singaporean mom and her kids. Why don’t you try Chinatown, the manager tells them, in a fine example of British racist prejudice. Mighty cheesed off, mom calls her husband, who solves the problem – by buying the hotel his family was trying to check into.That scene tells you everything about Singapore’s wealth.It reinforced a certain image of the city-state. Singapore – everything’s shiny, everyone’s happy. This is a country where a popular slogan was built around the idea of material possessions. Called “5Cs”, it defined Singaporeans’ aspirations – cash, country club membership, car, credit card and condo. Plenty of people in other countries want/have these things, too. Only Singapore coined a slogan around this.Plus…This is by no means an exhaustive list of what makes Singapore tick.But…Singapore is not all shiny, happy.A well-heeled visitor driving down a beautiful road from Changi airport to a world class hotel, thence to dine at a world class restaurant (Singapore hosts five of the world’s top 100 restaurants) won’t probably see this, or even know about it – there’s poverty , some of it deep, in Singapore. And it’s a problem likely to sharpen because the city-state, like many rich countries, is ageing.Most countries define a poverty line, a level of income/expenditure that differentiates the poor from the non-poor. There's a good reason for this. A poverty line allows policymakers to better target those who need the most help. India has a poverty line, so does America, and so do most countries. Singapore doesn’t.Why? Singapore govt’s approach, as Arabella Woo wrote in a London School of Economics research paper (“Inequality in Singapore: The Hidden Poor”) is “to reward citizens in alignment with the work that is done”. As for economically vulnerable citizens, govt wants “citizens…to protect themselves…to do it themselves”.If that’s your take on poverty, obviously there’ll be no official poverty line. Naturally, there’s no official count of poor people either.With govt not defining poverty, researchers have had to work with other data. A superbly researched paper (“A handbook on inequality, poverty and unmet social needs in Singapore”), by Catherine J Smith, John A Donaldson, Sanushka Mudaliar, Mumtaz Md Kadir & Lam Keong Yeoh, quotes a separate study by one of the authors, who had used expenditure survey data. Per that study, “there are 110,000 to 140,000 households in Singapore who fit the definition of absolute poverty…these include the working poor, unemployed poor and poor retiree households”.Absolute poverty is defined as an economic situation where a person or a household doesn’t earn enough to cover basic needs.In a small country (population just over 6 million), 140,000 households, that is, around 560,000 people (reasonably assuming 4 people per household), is not a vanishingly small number. You wouldn’t think, visiting Singapore, there are more than 5.5 lakh people living in absolute poverty.Economists also use a concept called relative poverty – a measure that captures living standard relative to that enjoyed by those earning median wage (a median is defined as the middle value of a sequence of numbers, arranged in ascending or descending order).By this measure, per the handbook quoted above, 25% to 30% of Singaporeans live in relative poverty. The same research points out that many Singaporean middle-class families have faced “stagnating wages and an increased cost of living”. This double whammy hits middle-classes, and the poor, who are hit harder, in many countries, including India. But it’s also true for that island of gleaming high-rises.In a report on poverty and inequality in Singapore, BBC said this: “The city-state, which has some of the highest-paid ministers in the world, is a place of sometimes extreme contrasts, with glittering condominiums and towering facades just a stone's throw from one-room rental apartments inhabited by elderly and blue-collar families.”The same BBC report also quoted two local studies that concluded that in multiracial Singapore, it’s not race but class that’s become the deepest social faultline.Poverty, absolute or relative, and sharp income inequality in Singapore can be traced to pretty much the same set of reasons that’s produced similar outcomes in other countries. Policy attention on maintaining high GDP growth, low corporate taxes to attract investment, an emphasis on meritocracy, and the transition from old economy to knowledge economy. Implemented well, as Singapore govt has, this set of policies can produce shining economic performance – but it can also produce an underclass that gets caught in a deprivation trap. And the problem gets worse, as is the case in Singapore, when a society starts ageing. Elderly poor face the worst kind of poverty.None of this invalidates Singapore’s success story. But all of it tells us about a Singapore that most people don’t know exists.To saySingaporeans are crazy, rich is crazy, and full of rich irony.","At $141,500, its per capita income in PPP terms (a fairer measure than nominal dollar figures) ranks second after Luxembourg globally.
