"UK PM Rishi Sunak may lose his seat, Conservative Party heading for wipeout: Polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-may-lose-his-seat-conservative-party-heading-for-wipeout-polls/articleshow/111126228.cms,"Rishi Sunak ’s Conservative Party is heading for an electoral wipeout in the UK general election on July 4, according to three major polls on Wednesday, including one that projected even the premier will lose his seat.Seat-by-seat analysis by Savanta and Electoral Calculus for the Daily Telegraph found the Tories are on track to win just 53 seats in next month’s vote, an all-time low for the 190-year-old party. YouGov put them on 108 seats — which would also be a record — while a More in Common survey for the News Agents podcast projected the governing party slipping to 155 seats. That would be 10 lower than in 1997, when the Conservatives last lost power to the Labour Party .Any of those results would be devastating for the Conservatives, who like to style themselves as the UK’s natural party of government, likely ushering in a lengthy period in opposition. Even worse for Sunak, the Savanta survey shows him losing his own seat of Richmond and Northallerton — which would be unprecedented for a serving prime minister — though the Tory Arthur Balfour lost his seat in 1906, a month after resigning as premier.“The Conservative party is set for the largest defeat in its history,” YouGov said in a statement. It said the governing party is set for “significant losses” in the South West, South East and East of England.All three polls put Labour leader Keir Starmer easily on course to enter Downing Street as prime minister: More in Common said the opposition is heading for a 162-seat majority, which in itself is approaching the Labour’s best-ever election result, the 179-seat majority secured in 1997 by Tony Blair . YouGov projects a 200-seat Labour majority; Savanta has them with a 382-seat advantage.Such numbers would have seemed fanciful just five years ago, when Labour slipped to its biggest electoral defeat since 1935 under Starmer’s left-wing predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. More in Common sees Labour winning 406 seats, YouGov has them on 425 — a record — and Savanta sees them winning 516 seats — almost four in every five constituencies.The trio of surveys all project the Liberal Democrats will make significant gains, recovering their status as the UK’s third party, which they lost in 2015 after being punished by the electorate for serving five years in coalition with the Tories. More in Common put them on 49 seats — up 38 on 2019’s tally, while YouGov put them on 67 — which would be a record. Savanta puts them on 50, almost level with the Tories.YouGov sees Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party taking five seats, while the other two surveys have him winning none, despite recently overtaken the Tories in at least one national poll. A long fieldwork period may not have captured Reform’s recent rise in the polls, More in Common Director Luke Tryl said on the social media platform X.Separately, a constituency poll by Survation in Clacton, where Farage is standing as a candidate, showed him easily winning the seat with 42% of the vote, compared with 27% for the Tory incumbent, Giles Watling. Survation said it polled 506 adults in Clacton on behalf of Arron Banks, a long-time ally of Farage.While the More in Common survey projected a smaller Labour majority than other recent so-called multi-regression and post-stratification (MRP) modeling, a 162-seat majority would still be more than double that secured five years ago by former Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson .“The fact that this projection showing the Conservatives barely holding 150 seats is one of the most favorable to the Conservatives shows how deep a hole the party finds itself in — with barely two weeks to go for them to change the dial,” Tryl said in a statement.Savanta found that in Richmond and Northallerton, Sunak is heading for a 29% vote share, compared to 34% for his Labour rival Tom Wilson. Still, the other two surveys see the prime minister retaining his seat relatively comfortably.","Tories on track to win just 53 seats in next month’s vote, an all-time low for the 190-year-old party.

"Kim Jong Un: Kim Jong Un does not look healthy, says former CIA analyst",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/kim-jong-un-does-not-look-healthy-says-former-cia-analyst/articleshow/111120962.cms,"Limo, tea set, artwork: Exchange of gifts

Based on the footage of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday, former CIA North Korea analyst Sue Mi Terry said Kim does not look healthy. “My first reaction looking at Kim Jong Un was, ‘Oof, he doesn’t look too great to me,’” Terry told CNN. “There was a time when he lost a little weight and he looked better. So my initial reaction was that he didn’t look, in terms of being healthy, because his health is something that we always track anyway,"" Terry said.Another thing that the former CIA analyst noted was how Kim made a big deal about Putin's arrival. The red carpet welcome to Putin made North Korea look like a normal country, she argued.Putin enjoyed a red carpet welcome, a military ceremony and an embrace from North Korea's Kim Jong Un during a state visit Wednesday to Pyongyang where they both pledged to forge closer ties. Kim hailed a ""new era"" in relations as he began summit talks with Putin, who in turn thanked his host for backing Russia's war in Ukraine.""We very much appreciate your systematic and permanent support of Russian policy, including on the Ukrainian issue,"" Putin said, according to Russian state media.After a welcoming ceremony in Kim Il Sung square, featuring a military band and mass synchronized dancing, Putin also invited his host to visit Russia.Putin said at the start of Wednesday's talks a ""new foundation document"" was ready to be signed that would set the framework for relations in the long term, as Kim spoke glowingly of the allies' ties. ""Relations between our countries are entering a new era of blossoming, which cannot be compared even with the period of Korean-Soviet relations of the last century,"" Kim said, according to Russian news agencies.The summit is their second meeting in a year, after Kim took his bulletproof train to Russia's far east last September for a summit with Putin at a space port.A Russian-made limousine, tea set and artwork are among the gifts exchanged by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.Back in February, Putin gifted car-enthusiast Kim a Russian-made Auruses.","Putin enjoyed a red carpet welcome, a military ceremony and an embrace from North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

A Korean secret to keeping friendships strong: Savings groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/a-korean-secret-to-keeping-friendships-strong-savings-groups/articleshow/111121160.cms,"Last fall, Jina Kim and two of her friends splurged on a two-night stay at the Ananti at Busan Cove, a luxury resort in South Korea . The resort, where rooms start at $369 a night, features infinity pools, spas, restaurants, a private coastal walk and beach area, and a 4,600-meter Kim and her friends weren't worried about how they would pay for the trip because they had spent over a decade saving in a "" gyemoim "", a Korean term for people who form financial planning groups to save money for future expenses.Forming gyemoim groups can help friends or families split travel costs equally so everyone can participate, regardless of his or her personal budget. ""Honestly, if we didn't make the gyemoim, then it would have been too difficult for us to arrange that kind of trip,"" Kim said. ""It would have cost too much.""Collective financial planning has had a long history in many parts of the world. ""It's actually not unique to South Korea,"" said Euncheol Shin, a professor of economics in Seoul. ""This practice first developed because there was no financial market, and if you wanted to borrow some money, you had to do some self-financing.""Each member of a gyemoim contributes what are essentially ""club dues"" - often between $10 and $50 each month, with the amount decided by the group. As the balance increases, the members discuss how to spend it together. Kim first formed a gyemoim with two friends after they met at a social club in 2014. The three were attending different colleges and believed the gyemoim would allow them to regularly meet up.Initially, they each agreed to contribute 15,000 won (about $13) every month. Over the next decade, they saved more than 3,000,000 won ( $2,200) before deciding to spend the money on a trip to the Ananti, the resort. By then, the three friends had become busy with their own careers and families, but they remained close, in part, because of the gyemoim. ""It allowed us to keep in touch and have a good time together without worrying about the cost,"" Kim said.Gyemoim groups can work in South Korea because of the nature of the country's social interactions and culture of trust . You could walk into a coffee shop in Seoul and leave your bag without needing to worry.Forming a group to save is so common in South Korea that one bank is adapting to the custom. KakaoBank now offers a gyemoim group account where friends can share a bank account managed by one designated account holder. Some groups still prefer the ""old-fashioned"" method - entrusting funds to one member. Gyemoim groups don't last forever. Circumstances change, friends may've a falling-out, someone may no longer want to participate or a new person may want to join. When that happens, it's up to the collective to decide how to handle it. For a group to be successful, Kim said, members need to share similar interests.","Gyemoim is a Korean term for people who form financial planning groups to save money for future expenses.

"Videos targeting Biden's age go viral, White House calls them 'cheapfakes'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/videos-targeting-bidens-age-go-viral-white-house-calls-them-cheapfakes/articleshow/111121116.cms,"Republicans are flooding the internet with out-of-context videos of US Prez Biden, using what the White House has characterised as deceptive editing tactics to cast the 81-year-old as infirm less than five months from Nov's election. The specious posts claiming to show Biden lost or freezing up underscore how increasingly bitter and personal the campaign has become online in the wake of former prez Donald Trump's criminal conviction and as attack ads ramp up ahead of the first debates. They also come amid some voters' worries over Biden's physical and mental condition, with Trump making age a top rallying point - despite being, at 78, just three years younger.The White House has branded the videos - many of which originated with an X account run by the Republican National Committee , or RNC - as ""cheapfakes"", a term misinformation experts coined to describe content altered using basic and affordable technology. One short clip the ""RNC Research"" account shared this month shows the prez hunching over during a ceremony in France to commemorate the anniversary of the D-Day landings. Conservative influencers jumped on the 13-second footage, falsely accusing Biden of trying to sit when there was no chair behind him. Others insisted he had lost control of his bowels. Jake Schneider, who runs the ""RNC Research"" account as the committee's rapid response director, said the page has merely been posting clips that ""come straight from pool feeds"".Rolling the tape further, however, makes it clear there was a seat beneath the prez. AFP fact-checkers found the RNC's video was cut to omit the ensuing footage, which revealed that Biden started to sit as the music stopped, paused to wait for defence secretary Lloyd Austin's introduction and then fully sat as Austin rose to speak. In another video spread widely online, Biden appeared to stray from other world leaders and flash an errant thumbs-up gesture during a skydiving demonstration at the G7 summit in Italy. After the GOP account highlighted the footage on X, the New York Post tagged Biden on its front page as the ""Meander in Chief"". But the New York Post's cover photos - and a video the newspaper shared online - altered the clip's frame to crop out the parachutists Biden was congratulating.White House pushed back. ""It's telling that rightwing critics, including Rupert Murdoch's sad little super PAC, the New York Post, resort to misinformation,"" Andrew Bates, its senior deputy press secretary, said. ""Biden's record is so threatening to them that they feel a need to make things up.""",Republicans flood internet with out-of-context videos of US Prez Biden.

""Things have changed. The passage of this bill is a message to the Chinese govt that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet. This legislation would soon be signed by President Biden,"" she said.House foreign affairs committee chairman Michael McCaul affirmed that US would not allow China to interfere with the Dalai Lama's succession.

NEW DELHI: At least 550 pilgrims lost their lives during the Hajj this year due to heat related issues, according to Arab diplomats. The temperature at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit), according to the Saudi national meteorology centre.The majority of the dead were Egyptians, with 323 succumbing primarily to heat-related illnesses.""All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat,"" said a diplomat, except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush. The total figure was obtained from the hospital morgue in Mecca's Al-Muaisem neighbourhood.In addition to the Egyptian casualties, at least 60 Jordanians also perished during the pilgrimage, bringing the total reported deaths from various countries to 577, according to an AFP tally. The diplomats confirmed that the Al-Muaisem morgue, one of the largest in Mecca, recorded a total of 550 deaths.Saudi authorities reported treating over 2,000 pilgrims for heat stress but have not provided updated figures or information on fatalities since Sunday.Despite Saudi officials advising pilgrims to use umbrellas, stay hydrated, and avoid sun exposure during the hottest hours, many Hajj rituals require being outdoors for extended periods during the day. Some pilgrims reported seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and overwhelmed ambulance services.This year, around 1.8 million pilgrims participated in the Hajj, with 1.6 million coming from abroad. However, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the Hajj without securing official visas each year to save money, which is more dangerous as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the route.","The temperature at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) The majority of the dead were Egyptians, with 323 succumbing primarily to heat-related illnesses.

A collision between a Philippine ship and a Chinese vessel occurred on Monday near the Spratly Islands in the disputed South China Sea , according to Beijing's Coast Guard .Beijing claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, a vital waterway facilitating over $3 trillion in annual maritime trade which is subject to overlapping claims by several nations, including China, the Philippines , Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.China deploys various boats to patrol the waters and has transformed several reefs into militarised artificial islands. A series of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have occurred in disputed areas.New Chinese coast guard rules took effect on Saturday, June 15, which reinforce a 2021 law granting its coastguard the authority to use deadly force against foreign vessels in contested waters.Under these new rules, China's coastguard is empowered to apprehend suspected trespassers and detain them for up to 60 days without the need for a trial.In a statement, the Beijing's Coast Guard said, ""Philippine replenishment ship ignored many solemn warnings from the Chinese side"".It ""approached the... Chinese vessel in an unprofessional way, resulting in a collision"", the statement said.""The Chinese Coast Guard took control measures against the Philippine ship in accordance with the law,"" it added.Beijing accused the ship of having ""illegally broken into the sea near Ren'ai Reef in China's Nansha Islands"", using the Chinese name for the Spratly Islands.Manila has accused the Chinese coast guard of ""barbaric and inhumane behaviour"" against Philippine vessels, and President Ferdinand Marcos has called the new rules a ""very worrisome"" escalation.China has defended its new coast guard rules, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying last month that they were intended to ""better uphold order at sea"".The Group of Seven bloc criticised what it called ""dangerous"" incursions by China in the South China Sea on Friday.

He said the pier has so far allowed for a total of over 3,500 metric tons of aid to reach Gaza's shores.""With the caveat that this has always been intended to be a temporary pier, I'm not aware at this point of any established date of: This is when we're going to stop,"" he told reporters.""And again, taking a step back here, the big picture: Whether it be by land, sea or air, (the United States is) employing all avenues to get assistance into Gaza.""","The US military's on-again, off-again floating pier in Gaza is expected to resume operations on Thursday.

Louisiana: Louisiana becomes 1st state to make display of Ten Commandments must in public schools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/louisiana-becomes-1st-state-to-make-display-of-ten-commandments-must-in-public-schools/articleshow/111121243.cms,"Louisiana has become the first state to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public school classrooms under a bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. The law mandates a poster-sized display in “large, easily readable font” in classrooms from kindergarten through state-funded universities. Although Gov. Landry did not provide final approval, the time for gubernatorial action has lapsed, allowing the bill to become law.The legislation requires that the Ten Commandments be displayed alongside a four-paragraph context statement by the start of 2025. This statement will describe the historical presence of the Ten Commandments in American public education for almost three centuries. The posters will be funded through donations, as state funds will not be used to implement the mandate.Proponents of the law argue that the Ten Commandments are historically significant and describe them as “foundational documents of our state and national government.”“Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,” the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.The law also authorizes, but does not require, the display of other historical documents such as the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, and the Northwest Ordinance in K-12 public schools.Opponents have raised concerns about the law’s constitutionality, with civil rights groups and organizations that support the separation of church and state promising to file a lawsuit challenging it. These groups argue the law prevents students from receiving an equal education and could make students with different beliefs feel unsafe at school.Legal challenges over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that a similar law in Kentucky was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits Congress from making laws respecting an establishment of religion. The high court found that the Kentucky law had no secular purpose and served a plainly religious purpose.Louisiana’s law emerges in a period of conservative leadership under Gov. Landry, who took office in January, succeeding two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. The Republican Party currently holds a two-thirds supermajority in the Louisiana Legislature, and all statewide elected positions are filled by Republicans, facilitating the passage of a conservative agenda.The law specifies that the Ten Commandments be displayed in a “large, easily readable font” and includes a context statement highlighting their significance in American public education history. This statement must explain how the Ten Commandments played a significant role in education for almost three centuries.“Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,” the groups said in their joint statement.This new law, unique to Louisiana, reflects ongoing tensions over the separation of church and state. As civil rights groups prepare for legal challenges, the state prepares for the mandate’s implementation. The outcome of these legal battles will likely set a precedent for other states that have proposed similar bills, including Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah, but have yet to enact them due to constitutional concerns.(With agency inputs)","Louisiana has become the first state to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public school classrooms.

The storm was located about 185 miles (300 km) east of Tampico, Mexico, packing maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), the Miami-based forecaster said. Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico Thursday or Thursday night.The storm is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches (about 13 to 25 centimetres) across northeast Mexico into South Texas. Maximum totals around 20 inches (51 centimetres) are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Flash flooding is likely, and mudslides are possible in some areas, the centre said.The US National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. Eight inches (20 centimetres) of rain or more could fall by Saturday morning. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is ""a high probability"" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas.

Suhas, on the other hand, was born in Houston. He made history as the first Indian-American, South Asian, and Hindu elected to the Virginia General Assembly in 2019 and to the Virginia State Senate in 2023. His run for the US House of Representatives marks another significant milestone, especially given the sizable Indian-American population in Virginia's 10th Congressional District.Subramanyam's parents migrated to the US seeking a new life and career opportunities. ""My parents are from Bengaluru and Chennai and spent some time in Secunderabad as well. They came here because they wanted to start a new life here. They wanted to be physicians and you can make a great life in America as a physician,"" Suhas said. He appreciates the value of education and hard work, attributes that he believes were crucial in his parents' success.""They didn't have much when they came here, but they became successful through education and hard work,"" he added. Subramanyam is driven by a desire to ensure that everyone has the same opportunities his parents had. ""I want to make sure that everyone has a chance at that American dream. Everyone has a chance of creating a great business if that's what they want to do or being a part of a great business and that they can empower themselves economically,"" he said.Subramanyam's commitment to public service is evidenced by his previous tenure as a White House technology policy advisor, a role he was appointed to by then-President Barack Obama in 2015. The endorsement from the incumbent US Representative Jennifer Wexton boosted his campaign, signaling strong support from established lawmakers within the Democratic Party.In discussing his motivations for running for Congress, Suhas Subramanyam emphasized the long-term perspective he brings to the role. ""The Congress is here to solve problems and to be proactive about the future. We should not be legislating not just for the next two years, but for the next 20 or 30 years. I want my children -- I've got two girls who are two and three -- I want them to live in a better country and in a better world than what we found,” he said.He stressed the importance of education as an equalizer, enabling individuals to improve their circumstances through dedication and hard work. ""It really started with the fact that our community education is the great equalizer, and you can lift yourself up from any situation if you do well and study hard and work hard. I want to make sure that stays the same way,"" he concluded.Suhas Subramanyam's victory in the primary is a testament to his commitment to public service and his vision for a better America. As he moves towards the general election, his focus remains on creating opportunities for all and maintaining the educational pathways that empowered his own family.

Chomsky’s Political Views

The Devil’s Advocate (in Latin) was a formal position in the Catholic Church whose job was to argue against the canonization of a particular candidate. The candidate’s job was to find flaws in the beatification process, to prove that the miracles attributed to an aspiring saint were, in fact, fraudulent. It’s a testament to Christianity’s influence on the English language that the term is now commonplace in everyday usage, with the Devil’s Advocate being a position where one argues the negatives. On the other hand, Noam Chomsky , the person who has influenced global intellectualism for the last six decades was called the Devil’s accountant. Of all the epithets shoved on Chomsky’s shelf – including being labelled the Father of Modern Linguistics – the Devil’s accountant sticks because it most coherently explains his worldview, which albeit cold, has a modicum of Spock-like logic that can never be faulted.While reports of his passing, to quote Steven Pinker, were greatly exaggerated, a Chomsky 101 feels quite appropriate in the circumstances. Explaining Chomsky from scratch is an arduous task, much like explaining Shah Rukh Khan to someone who has never watched a Hindi film. But that doesn't matter one shouldn't try:The epithet was bestowed upon him by Israeli philosopher Avishai Margalit. As New Yorker profile writer Larissa MacFarquhar explains, the Devil’s accountant implies that he follows the mathematical logic of tort law. She wrote in the New Yorker: “His moral calculus is simple arithmetic. Nothing exculpates or complicates the sheer number of the dead.”For the uninitiated, tort law refers to a civil wrong where the price for compensation must be borne by the indicted (usually moral compensation), as opposed to criminal law, which is punishable by the state. In this argument, the tort law is based on the number of deaths (and subsequent impact) someone’s action has on other lives.The example MacFarquhar used was when Chomsky was universally panned for likening the 9/11 attacks to the Clinton Administration bombing of a factory in Khartoum (Sudan). In Chomsky’s worldview, the motive of the bombing was immaterial, but simply the count of total dead, due to the attack, an uncomplicated moral calculator doing basic math where all lives mattered equally.Chomsky’s clear-eyed sharp logic extended to critic ising all wars and berating those who considered them a moral necessity as he argued in an MIT lecture. Speaking about the Iraq War in 2003, he compared the arguments made in favour of the war with the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour. He argued: “If you follow the trail, it led to kicking Europeans out of Asia—that saved tens of millions of lives in India alone. Do we celebrate that every year?”Like Einstein or Marx, Chomsky is without a doubt one of the most revered intellectuals in the world right now, whose views have shaped public discourse for the last six decades, and whose voice has never wavered over the years. Interestingly, the only other American who has had such a deep influence over the same timeframe would be Bob Dylan, though Chomsky once argued that Dylan sounded like someone invented by a capitalist PR machine for their purpose.Born in Philadelphia, where the two documents (Declaration of Independence and Constitution) that made America the world’s most powerful centralised state, were written and signed, Chomsky remained a lifelong opponent of said centralisation. His views were shaped by numerous things, including his strict Jewish upbringing, early run-ins with anti-Semitics, his father’s work on Hebrew grammar, his mother’s activism, and the writings of Marx and Co. Of course, Chomsky, much like Marx, has often claimed that he is not Marxist.Noam Chomsky had the sort of academic career that would gladden a Bengali mother’s heart. Chomsky was only 10 when he wrote an editorial lamenting the fall of Barcelona (not Pep Guardiola leaving) in the Spanish Civil War in an editorial for his school newspaper. This early research actually would cement his views as a political commentator. He entered the University of Pennsylvania when he was 16 and almost quit before meeting Zellig S Harris, one of the founders of structural linguistics. He studied linguistics, philosophy, and mathematics and would clash with his mentors based on their understanding of how the mind learns language.While behaviourists have argued that the mind is a tabula rasa (blank slate) where children learn a language as a conditioned response, Chomsky believed they were innately present in the human mind. Like Descartes (I think therefore I am), Chomsky believed the use of proper language was a “creative principle,” not a result of rote learning or repeating. Chomsky earned a BA, MA, and PhD in Linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania.He started teaching at MIT in 1955 and formally retired in 1996, though he continued to be associated with the institute as an Emeritus Professor. Chomsky spent most of his career at MIT, where he taught generations of students and researchers. Chomsky also wrote over 150 books and is often called the world’s most cited author (he’s actually eighth in a list that includes the Bible, Plato, and Freud).Chomsky proposed that all human languages share an underlying structure called Universal Grammarthat acquiring the use of language is innate to humans, and all languages are essentially variations of this grammar. He argues that we possess a LAD (language acquisition device) that allows us (especially more as children) to rapidly learn and understand languages. He distinguished between deep structure and surface structure, how the syntax of a sentence was different from its spoken form. Like Einstein fundamentally changed how the Newtonian universe was understood, Chomsky’s theory of language acquisition challenged the preconceived notion of behaviourists that language was learned through imitation and copying.The bio-linguistics argued that the principles underpinning the structure of language are present in the human brain, while all behaviourists after BF Skinner argued that language was a condition of one’s nurturing, not nature. Chomsky, on the other hand, said nature is predominantly important. Chomsky’s hypothesis argued that the human brain simply didn’t copy (monkey see, monkey do) and was way more elegant than an information-processing system. He also helped set the theories of modularity of the mind that argued that our brain has special independent modules for different cognitive functions.Chomsky’s work is multi-disciplinary and has influenced various branches of Science, including linguistics, psychology, computer science, philosophy, and anthropology. His ideas have also impacted the fields of AI and computational linguistics, including natural language processing. Even at an advanced age, his hold on the subject remained superlative.A guest essay for the NYT titled, he co-wrote with Ian Roberts and Jeffrey Watumull, explained how the large-language models were different from the human brain. Arguing that ChatGPT and their ilk were a “lumbering statistical engine for pattern matching … that gave the most probable answer”, the essay called the human mind an “elegant system that doesn’t infer brute correlations among data points but creates explanations.”The essay further compares it to a child’s “genetically installed operating system that endows humans with the capacity to generate complex sentences and long trains of thought.” The essay argues: “Indeed, such programs are stuck in a prehuman or nonhuman phase of cognitive evolution. Their deepest flaw is the absence of the most critical capacity of any intelligence: to say not only what is the case, what was the case, and what will be the case — that’s description and prediction — but also what is not the case and what could and could not be the case. Those are the ingredients of explanation, the mark of true intelligence.”Chomsky’s reputation as a distinguished scientist helped cement his reputation, which made his criticism harder to dismiss as that of a wayward rabble-rouser. His stellar academic credentials gave credence to much of his political views which couldn’t be shut down by the state. To paraphrase Charle De Gaulle: “One can’t easily silence Voltaire.”One of his finest works iswritten along with Edward S Herman, which developed the Propaganda Model, which argues that mainstream media serves the interests of the elites and their power structures and is simply a tool to shape and control public opinion. Much like Amartya Sen argued that English media in India looks to serve only the top 20%, Chomsky argued the same about the USA, identifying mechanisms that the media uses, to favour the wealthy and powerful.The five filters of information are:1): Media outlets are owned by elites, who will align with other elites.2): Media’s reliance on ad revenue that will align with the views of the advertisers.3): Media’s reliance on information from those who represent elite interests, including Big Govt, Big Business, and “expert” sources.4): The fourth filter is flak, where anyone challenging power will be pushed to the margins, a perpetual flak machine that goes to discredit those who seek to challenge the established world order.5): And finally, the fifth filter that was identified is a “target”. A common enemy for everyone to hate like communists, terrorists, immigrants, or any other group that could be easily othered and vilified.Of course, one wonders ifwas written in 2024, whether it would have a sixth and more important filter that has become the norm in this day and age: Distraction: a modern-day version of the Juvenal Bread-Circus Duality (panem et circenses) that states that you can simply distract most of the population when you give it bread and circus. In modern media, that could apply to the proliferation of what’s called viral content.In a piece (that was erroneously tagged as an obituary) in Jacobin, Vivek Chibber argues that the closest parallel to exist with Chomsky was Marx, embodying the Marx notion that “nothing human was alien to him.” Of course, it’s a different matter that Marx found it rather alien when taken down a factory once where he could barely survive.Calling Chomsky a one-man think tank, Chibber argues: “Chomsky’s commentary is a kind of counter archive, an unofficial documentation of the course of events, which future historians can lean on to fact-check the official record as they try to reconstruct the past. His cataloguing of American criminality in Vietnam or Israel’s atrocities against the Palestinians will be no less important than Marx’s journalism about the Arrow War in 1856 or the Great Indian Rebellion of 1857.”Chomsky has spent the better part of his life vocally criticising a lot of things, almost like a perennial opposition politician, but near the top of the list will always be capitalism. He argued it prioritises profit over human welfare, leading to inequality and environmental degradation. The concentration of power in the hands of so few, he has constantly argued, would undermine democracy or social justice.A proponent of anarcho-syndicalism , he argues that workers should have direct control over means of production through decentralised organisations. A fierce critic of American foreign policy, Chomsky has always pointed out – dissing those who argued that America leads the rules-based-international order – that Uncle Sam’s interventions around the world are driven by a desire for strategic or economic desires, and not to promote democracy, social justice or any such quaint notions. He has argued that every single post-war US president can be considered a war criminal.Chomsky also frowns upon a centralised state, which he believes will always serve the powerful rather than the hoi polloi or the general populace.The remarkable thing about Chomsky’s long innings in academia and political commentary is that many of the views he holds are now considered mainstream, with many groups agreeing with his overall criticism of the government or the media.Earlier, this year, many wondered why Chomsky – who’s famously private – hadn’t commented on the Israel-Palestine conflict. In the past, Chomsky has been one of the most vocal critics of both Israel and the USA’s support for Jerusalem, so his silence was seen as eerie.Last week, a Brazilian newspaper reported (and the details were later confirmed by his wife) that he suffered a massive stroke in the US and now he was having difficulty speaking and the right side of his body was numb. After not getting a lot of hope from American doctors, Chomsky’s wife Valeria flew him to Sao Paulo, where he was first admitted to an ICU before moving to a regular room.While not able to speak much, the report stated that Chomsky would often raise his left arm in a “lament of anger” whenever he saw images from the conflict in Gaza. It could very well be the last sigh of the avowed anti-establishment critic.In some ways, Chomsky’s lifelong political advocacy feels a little like John Lennon’s Imagine: great on paper but largely impractical in the real world we live in as opposed to the perceived universe that academics and activists occupy. On the other hand, many will point out that Chomsky lived his life amplifying the sighs of the oppressed around the world.There’s an old African proverb that goes: “Until the lions have their historians, tales of the hunt shall always glorify the hunter.” For a long time, the proverbial lion could depend on Noam Chomsky to speak up for him.","Noam Chomsky is one of the most revered intellectuals in the world right now. His views have shaped public discourse for the last six decades, and his voice has never wavered. The Devil’s accountant sticks because it most coherently explains his worldview, which albeit cold, has a modicum of Spock-like logic.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111117807,imgsize-62748,width-400,resizemode-4/111117807.jpg"
H1B: H-1B and L-1 visa extension fees proposed: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h-1b-and-l-1-visa-extension-fees-proposed-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/111116739.cms,"What will change

What will be the impact?

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is likely introduce a new H-1B extension fee for employers of skilled international workers on the H-1B visa. The new ruling would mandate a $4,000 fee for all H-1B visa extensions -- a move aimed at reducing visa fraud and boosting national security. It will also impose a $4,500 fee for L-1 visa extensions, which allow companies to transfer managers and executives from foreign offices to the US. The new extension fees are likely to come into effect from July 8Currently, only companies with over 50 employees and more than half of them on H-1B or L-1 visas are obligated to pay these fees, as per the 911 Response and Biometric Entry-Exit Fee introduced in 2015. The new rule, however, would expand this fee requirement to all petitions for H-1B and L-1 visa extensions.The H-1B visa is a favored route for international business school students looking to work in the US. Upon obtaining sponsorship from an employer who petitions the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), successful applicants can work in the US for three years after completing a higher education degree.Similarly, the L-1 visa allows US companies to bring over managers and executives from their overseas offices.“These proposed changes aim to strengthen our immigration system and ensure the integrity of employment-based visa programs while also safeguarding national security,” said the DHS.The DHS has confirmed that the new fees for H-1B and L-1 visa extensions will not become mandatory until a final ruling is issued. This adjustment places an additional financial burden on businesses employing international talent but is touted as necessary for bolstering national security.Employers with 50 or more employees in the US where over 50% are on H-1B or L-1 visas have to pay the fee for initial petitions or when there is a change of employer. The fees are $4000 for H-1B petitions and $4,500 for L-1 petitions.Now these fees will have to be paid for visa extension petitions as well.If implemented, employers who rely heavily on H-1B and L-1B visas will have an increased financial burdens which may force them to reassess their hiring strategies.","The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is likely introduce a new H-1B extension fee for employers of skilled international workers.

I write in the book I don’t know whether it’s because two guys from New York, him from Queens, me from Brooklyn, that we kind of understood each other and we got along very, very well early on. It was only when what he was saying and began to say — because he wanted so much for this thing to go away that he was saying things that were incorrect,"" Fauci said. His confession that he was not comfortable speaking out against Trump also came during the show.“Although the people who attacked me think I did it to sort of tear him down, it was not,” Fauci said. “Because I have a great deal of respect for the presidency of the United States… I had to contradict him publicly because he was saying things that were not correct. Once that happened, then both he and mostly his staff, not so much the president but the staff, I became anathema. Persona non grata.”Fauci's autobiography “On Call: A Doctor’s Journey in Public Service” has the details of Fauci's last conversation with Donald Trump. It was for 15 minutes amid the raging pandemic soon after Fauci gave an interview in which he made some dire predictions. “Tony, I really like you … but what the f--- are you doing?

The sale includes 291 Altius-600M systems, which are unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, with warheads. It also includes 720 Switchblade drones known as ""extended-range loitering munitions,"" the State Department said.

It said the sale ""serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability."" It will ""help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,"" the department said.

Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te thanked the US for approving the latest arms sale to Taiwan during a press conference Wednesday in Taipei. He said such authorizations help to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

""In the future, we will continue to strengthen Taiwan's national defense strength, whether through ... military purchases or our own efforts,"" he said.

Hakimullah, a Shura member of the Pakistani Taliban's powerful Malakand faction, was killed in Chaghasarai, District Asadabad in the Kunar province, bordering Bajaur tribal district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan, officials said on Wednesday.His killing comes as the TTP is observing a three-day ceasefire with the Pakistani government during the Eid al-Adha, which was celebrated on Monday.Hakimullah, who was the right-hand man of TTP Malakand chief Azmat Ullah Mehsud alias Wali Malakand, played a key role in terrorist activities in Bajaur and carried out various acts of violence including target killings, landmine explosions, checkpoint attacks, and extortion, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.He also served as a cleric at a madrassa of TTP in Sarkano, Kunar province of Afghanistan, and trained some of the key TTP commanders including Tahir alias Waqar, Umar alias Ismail and others.His death is seen as a significant setback for the TTP and underscores the internal conflicts among various armed factions operating within Afghanistan, the paper said.Citing sources, the papers said that the terrorist had joined the TTP in 2007 and took part in several actions against security forces and innocent civilians.

Akhter, a resident, expresses the struggles faced by daily wage workers and labourers, highlighting the impact of soaring prices not only on milk but also on related products such as Ghee (clarified butter).""We can't sustain our households in such inflationary times,"" he laments, urging the government to consider the plight of its citizens amidst these challenging circumstances.Faizan echoes similar sentiments, explaining that milk prices have escalated due to the rising costs faced by dairy farm owners for essentials like fodder, high rents, and water.""They have no choice but to pass on these expenses to consumers,"" he observes, urging the government to prioritise the welfare of the common people regardless of how they came into power.In Karachi, and across Pakistan, the struggle against inflation is not just about economic numbers but about the daily realities faced by the citizens.According to local media reports, the cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers, in collaboration with commissioner Karachi , settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.The decision came after an extensive consultation session that lasted several hours, where the commissioner met with stakeholders from the dairy farming, wholesaling, and retail sectors to discuss and finalise the price adjustment.Following thorough deliberations, all parties reached a consensus to implement the PKR 20 per litre hike, setting the new price of milk at PKR 220 per litre, which represents a significant increase compared to previous rates.","The cost of milk in Karachi surged notably after dairy farmers and wholesalers settled on an agreement to raise prices by PKR 20 per litre.

The incident unfolded on May 25 in Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, where Nazir and other Christians were accused of blasphemy , sparking violent outrage among locals.After fighting for his life for eight days, Masih succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.The incident showed a troubling pattern in Pakistan where blasphemy accusations lead to violence against Christian communities.HRFP has expressed deep concern over the swift post-arrest bail granted to 52 attackers involved in the Sargodha incident.Despite the First Information Report (FIR) being filed against 44 identified and 400 unidentified suspects under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), progress in police investigations and court proceedings has been slow and inadequate.Compounding the community's apprehensions are threatening videos released by Islamic groups following the incident, exacerbating fears among the Christian community.Drawing parallels with the August 16, 2023, attack in Jaranwala, the HRFP report highlighted similar incidents of mob violence and property destruction against minorities. It underscores a recurring pattern involving provocation, and subsequent violence, often followed by the expedient release of perpetrators.HRFP has called for decisive action, citing intelligence reports linking extremist groups to multiple blasphemy allegations. The organization has also urged stringent measures to address these threats.The report also documented individual cases of violence and harassment against Christians across Pakistan.Farooq Masih's family in Jaranwala continues to face threats. Despite the FIR filed in February, the perpetrators are still at large.Similarly, the case of Saima Bibi, who suffered an assault in April, was downplayed as an 'accident' despite clear evidence of the attack.The plight of Rawal Masih, Romeo Masih, Waqas Masih, Rakhsana Bibi, Asifa Bibi, Shazia Zaulfiqar, and Ahsan Masih, who all were abducted and murdered, also underscores the ongoing oppression faced by PakistChristians.Naveed Walter, president of HRFP, emphasized the ""dire circumstances"" for minorities in Pakistan and urged increased protection and support for the Christian community.

Meanwhile, the federal government will present this as an 'achievement' in front of the IMF to ask for even more loans to keep a clearly failing system running for a few years longer, the editorial added.However, at the same time, the government has announced a PKR 10.69 per unit 'relief' for the industrial sector to 'make it competitive'. There can probably be no better example of crony capitalism.While the average salaried individual is finding it difficult to meet their ends on a shrinking real wage amidst month after month of unceasing, unchecked inflation, it is the big industries who get a break in the form of cheaper electricity so that they can pad up their profits while paying little back to the country in the form of taxes.""That the government is failing the people seems like an understatement. It is clearly least bothered by their plight. Its financial planning shows that it has no interest in going after those who dodge their dues; it just wants to take the easy route and enjoy the ride for however long it is in power,"" the Dawn editorial stated.","The average base tariff for a single unit of electricity, which was PakistRupees (PKR) 27.78 in the outgoing year, will be PKR 35.50 from July 1.

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching display of their persistent sorrow and discontent, families affected by enforced disappearances in the Balochistan region of Pakistan decided to abandon customary Eid festivities. Instead, they planned to stage a protest to voice their outrage against state agencies alleged to have perpetrated atrocities against the Baloch people.

Mama Qadir Baloch , a key member of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), declared the protest in a video statement, asserting, ""For the past 15 years, the atrocities committed by the Army and intelligence agencies of Pakistan have led the Baloch to boycott Eid celebrations. While Muslims across the world celebrate this occasion, the Baloch mourn.""

Coinciding with this, families of the missing persons organized a sit-in protest at Shaheed Fida Chowk on Eid day, following a similar demonstration in front of the DC office just days prior. The earlier protest concluded after the district administration provided assurances to the families.

The decision to protest on Eid emphasizes the profound impact of enforced disappearances on the Baloch community, who have been tirelessly seeking justice and answers regarding the fate of their loved ones, allegedly taken by state forces.

Pakistan: Tomato prices soar to PKR 200 per kg ahead of Eid festivities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tomato-prices-soar-to-pkr-200-per-kg-ahead-of-eid-festivities/articleshow/111049153.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha, despite the district government setting the price cap at PKR 100 per kilogram, as per reports.This annual occurrence during Ramadan and Eid al-Adha typically goes unnoticed by authorities, despite their assurances to the contrary.In response to the situation, the Peshawar Deputy Commissioner has taken action by imposing a ban, under Section 144, on transporting tomatoes out of the district.With Eid al-Adha merely two days away, local retail markets have seen tomato prices double, aligning with earlier predictions that tomatoes, along with onions, would once again be sold at inflated prices during this festive period.Residents of the area have expressed frustration, noting that prices have escalated by Rs100 per kilogram in just one day. Many believe that the district administration's efforts will likely be limited to verbal instructions, as has been the case in previous instances, as per reports.During the budget presentation, one of the standout assertions was the government's commitment to maintaining inflation at 12 per cent in the upcoming fiscal year. On the surface, this goal appears supported by various planned initiatives aimed at curbing inflation rates.However, the implementation of aggressive tax measures, highlighted as key revenue strategies, seems paradoxical as they could potentially escalate prices instead of stabilising them.Regardless of the method used to gauge inflation, the stark reality is that any figure exceeding the previous fiscal year's average monthly inflation rate of 24.9 per cent will inevitably lead to increased consumer prices.Abid Suleri, Executive Director of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), argues that the government ought to have adjusted the minimum taxable income thresholds to factor in inflation when outlining personal income tax brackets. He criticises the current monthly exemption of PKR 50,000 as insufficient and warns that doubling taxes on those falling within the initial tax slab could reduce their disposable income, thereby exacerbating economic hardships.Moreover, heightened fuel expenses stemming from amplified levies and augmented GST rates in specific sectors are anticipated to drive inflation even higher, intensifying the overall cost of living. Suleri emphasises the absence of any mention regarding the taxation of agricultural income, which he believes could substantially broaden the tax base, Dawn reported.","The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha.

Imran should stay in jail for 5 years: Pakistan minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-should-stay-in-jail-for-5-years-pakistan-minister/articleshow/111043178.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years to maintain the country’s “economic stability”, minister Ahsan Iqbal said Sunday. The five years coincide with the full term of the current govt led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) that took office earlier this year.“People come to us and tell us that if Pakistan has to progress, then Imran Khan will have to be kept in jail for five years,” Iqbal, the minister for planning and development as well as PML-N secretary-general, said.His comments came hours after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledged to rid the country of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying the next deal for a bailout package with the global lender would be the last in Pakistan’s history. IMF ties such loans to tough reform measures.According to Iqbal, if Imran came out of jail, “there would be sit-ins and fights again, which the country cannot afford”. “There is a voice of the people that Imran should remain in jail for five years,” Iqbal said. The minister added that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder was an “angry man” and it wasn’t known with whom he had a quarrel.The minister also made a subtle jab at the legal system by claiming Imran always relied on the “shoulder of the judiciary” for support during trying times. The allusion appeared to be to some court orders that went in favour of Imran in recent times.Asked about confrontation between the judiciary and the military establishment, Iqbal replied: “Both should think whether this is better for the country.”Iqbal recalled the past when politicians used to fight the military and vice versa. “Now we must cooperate for the benefit of the nation because fighting between institutions has put the country’s sovereignty at stake,” the minister said.","Ahsan Iqbal says Imran Khan will have to be kept behind bars for five years.
