US accuses Russia of using 'chemical weapon' in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-accuses-russia-of-using-chemical-weapon-in-ukraine/articleshow/109768376.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US State Department accused Russia Wednesday of having used a chemical weapon against Ukrainian forces in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, while also announcing fresh sanctions against Moscow.In addition to the chemical agent chloropicrin , Russia also used ""riot control agents (tear gas) as a method of warfare in Ukraine , also in violation of the CWC,"" the department said in a factsheet.""The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident, and is probably driven by Russian forces' desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,"" the State Department said.Meanwhile the US Treasury Department announced sweeping sanctions aimed at crippling Russia's military and industrial capabilities -- including targeting nearly 300 entities in Russia, China and other countries accused of supporting President Vladimir Putin's invasion.The sanctions are meant to punish companies that help Moscow acquire weapons for its war in Ukraine. They also target Russian government entities and companies involved in the country's chemical and biological weapons programs.Russia has said it no longer possesses a military chemical arsenal, but the country faces pressure for more transparency over the alleged use of toxic weapons.According to the US National Institutes of Health, the chemical chloropicrin is used both as a warfare agent and pesticide. If inhaled, it poses a health risk.- 'Sand in the gears' -""Today's actions will further disrupt and degrade Russia's war efforts by going after its military industrial base and the evasion networks that help supply it,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.The accusations and sanctions come a week after US President Joe Biden signed a much-delayed bill to provide new funding for Ukraine as Kyiv's military struggles to hold back Russian advances.""Even as we're throwing sand in the gears of Russia's war machine, President (Joe) Biden's recently-passed National Security Supplemental is providing badly-needed military, economic, and humanitarian support to bolster Ukraine's courageous resistance,"" Yellen said.""Combined, our support for Ukraine and our relentless targeting of Russia's military capacity is giving Ukraine a critical leg-up on the battlefield.""As part of the measures, the State Department blacklisted additional individuals and companies involved in Moscow's energy, mining and metals sectors.The sanctions also targeted individuals connected to the death of Russian opposition leader Aleksey Navalny who died in a Siberian prison in February.The almost 300 targets sanctioned included dozens of actors accused of enabling Russia to acquire desperately needed technology and equipment from abroad, the Treasury said.Some of those targeted were based in countries such as China that have faced increasing pressure from Washington over support for Russia during its 15-month invasion of Ukraine.""This support enables Russia to continue its war against Ukraine and poses a significant threat to international security,"" the Treasury Department said.Other than China, targeted non-Russian entities were located in Azerbaijan, Belgium, Slovakia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.These companies ""enable Russia to acquire desperately-needed technology and equipment from abroad,"" the statement said.","US State Department accuses Russia of using a chemical weapon against Ukrainian forces.

"Paul Auster, 'literary superstar' behind 'The New York Trilogy', dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/paul-auster-literary-superstar-behind-the-new-york-trilogy-dies/articleshow/109766077.cms,"NEW YORK: Paul Auster , a prolific novelist , memoirist , screenwriter and filmmaker who rose to fame in 1980s with his postmodern reanimation of the noir novel and who endured to become one of the signature New York writers of his generation, died of complications from lung cancer at his home on Tuesday. He was 77.With his hooded eyes, soulful air and leading-man looks, Auster was often described as a ""literary superstar"".Times Literary Supplement of Britain once called him ""one of America's most spectacularly inventive writers."" Though a New Jersey native, he became indelibly linked with the rhythms of his adopted city, which was a character of sorts in much of his work - particularly Brooklyn, where he settled in 1980.His reputation was anything but local, however. He took home several literary prizes in France alone. Auster, who had lived in Paris as a young man, became one of those rare American imports to be embraced by the French as a native son. ""Merely a bestselling author in these parts, Auster is a rock star in Paris,"" New York magazine observed in 2007. In Britain, his 2017 novel, ""4321"", which examined four parallel versions of the early life of its protagonist - as Auster was, a Jewish boy born in Newark in 1947 - was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.His career began to take flight in 1982, with his memoir ""The Invention of Solitude"", a haunting rumination on his distant relationship with his recently deceased father. His first novel, ""City of Glass"", was rejected by 17 publishers before it was published by a small press in California in 1985. The book became the first installment in his most celebrated work, ""The New York Trilogy "", three novels later packaged in a single volume. It was listed as one of the 25 most significant New York City novels of the last 100 years in T, NYT's style magazine. The trilogy, which included ""City of Glass,"" ""Ghosts"" and ""The Locked Room, was a postmodern detective saga in which names and identities blur and one protagonist is a private eye named Paul Auster.Writing six hours a day, often seven days a week, he pumped out a new book nearly annually for years. He ultimately published 34 books, accounting for shorter works that were later incorporated into larger books, including 18 novels and several acclaimed memoirs and assorted autobiographical works, along with plays, screenplays and collections of stories, essays and poems.By the 1990s, Auster had set his sights on Hollywood. He wrote several screenplays, some of which he directed. Auster co-directed 1995 ""Blue in the Face"", sprinkled with cameos by a host of stars, including Lou Reed musing on cigarettes, and Madonna delivering a saucy singing telegram. Auster would go on to write and direct ""Lulu on the Bridge"" (1998), about a jazz saxophonist whose life takes a turn when he's hit by a stray bullet at a New York club; and ""The Inner Life of Martin Frost"" (2007), about an author who retreats to a friend's country house for solitude, only to become entranced by a woman there.Auster at times expressed irritation that much of his career had been assessed in relation to ""The New York Trilogy"". ""Even so... I don't think in terms of 'best' or 'worst.' Making art isn't like competing in the Olympics, after all.""","Auster died of complications from lung cancer at his home on Tuesday.

Blinken meets Bibi to stave off Rafah op,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/blinken-meets-bibi-to-stave-off-rafah-op/articleshow/109764173.cms,"US secretary of state Antony Blinken met with PM Netanyahu in Israel on Wednesday, his latest stop on a West Asia tour undertaken as President Biden tries to stop Israel from invading Rafah , a city in southern Gaza where Palestinians have sought shelter during the war.Blinken and other top Biden administration aides are also calling for Hamas to agree to a deal to free some hostages taken in the Oct.7 attacks in exchange for a six-week ceasefire and the release of some Palestinian prisoners. US officials say they hope a temporary ceasefire would lead to a permanent one. On Tuesday, Netanyahu said that he plans a major assault on Rafah ""with or without"" a deal.The ceasefire talks have been stalled for months, and Israeli officials said Monday that they had agreed to lower their demands. They are now asking Hamas to free 33 civilians - women, older people and those who need urgent medical care - rather than 40.The proposed deal was one of the issues that Blinken discussed with President Isaac Herzog of Israel on Wednesday at a hotel in Tel Aviv.Before the meeting with Herzog started, Blinken told the president and reporters that discussions must focus on both a ceasefire that ""brings the hostages home"" and on getting more aid into Gaza. ""There is a proposal on the table, and as we've said, no delays, no excuses,"" Blinken said. Herzog said that the hostages' release should be a priority for the international community. After his talk with Herzog, Blinken met with a few family members of American hostages held in Gaza and then got into a motorcade to head to Jerusalem, where he entered a private meeting with Netanyahu. Blinken and other US officials say Hamas has a narrow window to take the deal since Netanyahu is pressing for the offensive in Rafah. When asked about Netanyahu's statements on Rafah, Blinken said that US efforts were focused on a hostage and ceasefire deal.","US secretary of state Antony Blinken met with PM Netanyahu in Israel on Wednesday.

Clashes in UCLA; 300 held on New York campuses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/clashes-in-ucla-300-held-on-new-york-campuses/articleshow/109763866.cms,"American universities were on edge Wednesday after police officers from New York to Los Angeles entered campuses where pro-Palestinian demonstrators had erected encampments and seized academic buildings.Mayor Eric Adams of New York said that about 300 protesters had been arrested Tuesday night at City College of New York and at Columbia University , where police officers in riot gear cleared a building that had been occupied for nearly a day to protest Israel's war in Gaza.At the University of California, Los Angeles, police officers intervened before dawn Wednesday to break up violent clashes between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and counter-protesters, hours after administrators declared an encampment on campus illegal.At Tulane University in New Orleans, 14 people had been arrested, administrators said, as state and local forces helped campus police disperse protesters. At the University of Arizona, campus police sprayed chemicals as they broke up a demonstration. Other protest encampments around the country were still standing. Some demonstrators have said that they will not back down, posing a challenge for university administrators who want to protect free speech rights while minimising campus disruption.The clashes at UCLA erupted as counter-protesters tried to pull down parade barricades, plywood and wooden pallets protecting a tent encampment built by pro-Palestinian protesters. Video showed fireworks exploding over and in the encampment. People threw chairs and other objects. Some screamed pro-Jewish comments as pro-Palestinian protesters tried to fight them off.After a couple of hours of scuffles between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators at UCLA, police wearing helmets and face shields slowly separated the groups and quelled the violence. The scene was calm as day broke. Authorities have not detailed injuries. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the violence ""absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable"".At Columbia, New York City police officers entered campus after the university requested help. They cleared a tent encampment, along with Hamilton Hall where a stream of officers used a ladder to climb through a second-floor window. Protesters had seized the Ivy League school building about 20 hours earlier. Police loaded dozens of detainees onto a bus, their hands bound behind their backs by zip-ties, the scene illuminated with the flashing red and blue lights of police vehicles. The police action happened on the 56th anniversary of a similar move to quash the occupation of Hamilton Hall by students protesting racism and Vietnam War.University Prez Minouche Shafik asked police to stay on campus until at least May 17 - two days after graduation. Shafik said the occupiers had vandalised property. Mayor Adams blamed the Columbia protest on outside agitators. Pressed, however, about identities of the ""outside agitators"" cited by the mayor, officials repeatedly declined to provide details.On Wednesday, over 100 people, most identifying themselves as Columbia faculty, marched near the campus, chanting slogans, including ""How many kids did you arrest today?""Blocks away from Columbia, at City College of New York, demonstrators were in a standoff with police outside the public college's main gate. Video posted online by reporters late Tuesday showed officers forcing some people to the ground and shoving others as they cleared the street and sidewalks.More than 1,300 protesters have been taken into custody on US campuses since 108 were arrested at Columbia on April 18, according to a tally by NYT.Officials at Portland State University in Oregon urged protesters to leave a library that they had occupied. The police also moved into an encampment at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, arresting 30 people, but protesters returned later in the day.(With inputs from NYT and AP)","Police officers from New York to Los Angeles entered campuses where pro- Palestinian demonstrators had erected encampments and seized academic buildings.

The militant group said in a statement posted on its Telegram website late on Tuesday that one of its members attacked a ""Shiite temple"" in Herat province with machine-gun fire.The attack, which took place on Monday night in the district of Guzara, also left one person wounded.The attacker fled the scene. The Taliban Interior Ministry has said that an investigation is underway.Local media reported that the mosque's imam was among those killed. The UN mission in Afghanistan condemned the attack, saying a child was among the victims. It called for urgent accountability for perpetrators and protection measures for Shiite communities.Afghanistan's former President Hamid Karzai said on the social media platform X that he considered""this terrorist act against all religious and human standards.""Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry said on Wednesday that ""the people and government of Pakistan extend their heartfelt condolences to the people of Afghanistan.""""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families in this hour of grief,"" it said.The statement added that Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms.The IS affiliate in Afghanistan is a major Taliban rival and frequently targets schools, hospitals, mosques and Shiite areas throughout the country.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, during the last weeks of the chaotic departure of US and Nato troops from the country after 20 years of war.Despite initial promises of a more moderate stance, the Taliban gradually reimposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, as they did during their previous rule of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.","Islamic State group claims responsibility for deadly shooting at mosque in Afghanistan.

"In jobless Canada, student dreams end in debt and drugs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/in-jobless-canada-student-dreams-end-in-debt-and-drugs/articleshow/109742538.cms,"When the going gets tough, the young and restless look for a high elsewhere, just to stay afloat. This is the case for numerous students from various regions of India who have gone to Canada in pursuit of education and jobs. The unemployment crisis in the land they once hoped would offer prosperity and success has plunged many students into a perilous spiral of drug and alcohol abuse, alongside heightened levels of depression and a surge in therapy sessions, according to Canada-based counsellors TOI spoke with.The counsellors said students are turning to marijuana and cocaine, hallucinogenic drugs like Ecstasy, and opioids like Fentanyl as a coping mechanism against unemployment-induced stress. They reported a monthly average of five to eight cases over the past few months.One student from Badlapur in Maharashtra, currently in British Columbia’s Burnaby city for a degree in environmental science, said the realisation that even degree-holding seniors were relegated to paid-by-the-hour gig workers drove him to depression.“In my second semester, I saw seniors around me doing ad hoc jobs to get by. It stressed me out, and I started to believe I’d meet a similar fate. I started smoking, then alcohol, and eventually marijuana,” the 25-year-old said.After failing a semester, he sought professional help from a psychologist and is currently undergoing treatment. However, therapy sessions are expensive — each session ranging from Canadian $70 to $150 (Rs 4,249 to Rs 9000-odd) or more.“Earlier, addiction cases were predominantly among students from Punjab, Haryana, and Jharkhand. Now, we see students from Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana reaching out for help,” said a counsellor of Indian origin practising in Richmond, British Columbia. The counsellors chose to stay anonymous to respect the patient confidentiality agreement.There are currently around 3 lakh Indian students , according to Canadian Bureau for International Education. Many of them take loans, ranging from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 40 lakh on average, to enrol in universities and colleges in Canada. But the transition from campus to corporate life appears bleak as Canada’s unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in March.Still, students find ways to fund their addiction, including deceiving family members back home or working multiple odd jobs. “My former roommate has moved in with four others in a crammed accommodation. He stopped eating either at home or outside, works multiple shifts, and rides a bicycle to faraway locations,” said a 27-year-old in Vancouver. “Drug dealers extend credit, knowing they’d come back for more.”A counsellor from Delta, British Columbia, shared the story of a patient who had moved to Richmond from a town near Kolkata in 2021.“He finished his master’s degree in June 2023. Following that, he worked at a restaurant and a convenience store to cover his expenses. The frustration of being unable to support his family back home led him to recreational drugs,” the counsellor said.His addiction swirled out of control last year. “He stopped eating, left his jobs, and began ingesting drugs regularly. His roommates reached out to his distant cousin, who brought him to me. Since Dec 2023, he has been undergoing rehab,” the counsellor said.Many students are left vulnerable to self-harm. “I’ve had suicidal thoughts over the prospect of being unable to repay my loan. I searched for a job for six months. I couldn’t get one. So, I have moved in with my distant aunt because I can’t afford rent,” said Mahima Chaudhary, a computer science student in Surrey, British Columbia. She has no addiction-related issues, but struggles with stress. “I don’t have the funds for it,” said Mahima on seeking professional help for her mental health. “So, I’m relying on therapy provided by my college counsellor.”",Many students from various regions of India have gone to Canada in pursuit of education and jobs.

Israel-Iran clash reinforces need for solid air defence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-iran-clash-reinforces-need-for-solid-air-defence/articleshow/109738444.cms,"Gaza: Al Qassam Brigades use unexploded Israeli missiles to kill several Netanyahu’s soldiers in Netzarim Corridor

NEW DELHI: Missile defence is technically complex, and very expensive. It’s virtually like firing a bullet to stop an incoming bullet. But with the sheer operational criticality of air and missile defence systems being reinforced by the tit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Iran, India needs to majorly crank up efforts to make its airspace as impregnable as possible.India has taken some strides in the arena but much more clearly needs to be done for an effective multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, reliable command and control posts, land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles.Unlike India, Israel of course has only a small territory to defend. And it did so effectively on April 13, thwarting Iran’s mass missile and kamikaze drone attack with its wide array of defence systems, from the short-range Iron Dome to long-range Arrow, as well as help from some others like the US.India’s air defence systems are geared towards protecting only some vital areas and installations. “India is simply too vast to be effectively protected from all kinds of aerial threats. But yes, apart from buying bullets, we need to invest much more in bulletproof jackets as well. Missile defence is now an overwhelming tactical necessity rather than a strategic one,” a senior officer said.For one, India needs to get cracking on operationally deploying its indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD) system, which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy nuclear and other ballistic missiles both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 15-25 km to 80-100 km for “a higher kill probability”.After “successfully completing” a series of tests for Phase-1 of the land-based BMD system quite a while ago, the DRDO also conducted the maiden flight-trial of a sea-based interceptor missile in April last year.The govt, however, has so far not sanctioned full-scale deployment of the BMD system at any vital location. This could be due to the exorbitant costs involved or a few technological gaps, or even strategic calculations that it may provoke Pakistan to go in for a larger nuclear arsenal and countermeasures to defeat the BMD system, as reported by TOI earlier.IAF, of course, now has three squadrons of Russian S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems, which can detect, track and destroy incoming strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, drones and even some intermediate-range ballistic missiles at a range of 380-km. They are deployed in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan.Delivery of the remaining two S-400 squadrons, under the $5.4 billion contract inked in 2018, has been delayed to 2025-26 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.Parallelly, India is developing its own long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system under the ambitious Project Kusha. With an interception range of around 350-km, this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29.Then, there is the Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile (MR-SAM) systems, with an over 70-km range, jointly developed with Israel. After the Navy and IAF, Army in Feb last year operationalised its first `Abhra’ MR-SAM regiment in the 33 Corps, which defends the frontier with China in Sikkim and the Siliguri Corridor.Army and IAF have also inducted in large numbers the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, with an interception range of 25-km, while a new-generation sleeker version is also now ready for user trials.The armed forces also have a variety of shorter range air defence weapons. These range from the older Russian Igla-1M (5 km), OSA-AK-M (10 km) and Pechora missiles and upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5 km) to the newer Israeli low-level Spyder quick-reaction anti-aircraft missiles (15 km range) and Russian man-portable Igla-S (6 km) systems. DRDO is also testing the indigenous very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS) missiles, which has a range of up to 6 km.","Israel thwarted Iran’s mass missile and kamikaze drone attack with its wide array of defence systems, from the short-range Iron Dome to long-range Arrow.

Police say two people have been detained during the investigation but no charges related to overdoses had been filed as of Wednesday.Fitzgerald said officers administered an overdose-reversing drug, naloxone, at the scene of several cases as they awaited emergency services. He added that citizen bystanders in some cases stepped in to administer the life-saving drug themselves, and thanked them for intervening.According to Travis County Judge Andy Brown, the county's top elected official, kits for administering overdose antidote drug naloxone during emergency situations were distributed to locals in affected areas and training was provided by emergency personnel for those willing to carry the medication.Brown said that the drug, which combats overdoses, had previously been proactively distributed across the area through city and county programs that attempt to fight increasing opioid overdoses. He said the efforts are conducted in coordination with local groups that often respond to overdose crisis.It is the largest overdose outbreak in Austin since a synthetic drug referred to as K2 was distributed locally in 2015, Brown said.",Health officials are calling the city's worst overdose outbreak in nearly a decade. The victims ranged in age from 30s to 50s and spanned diverse ethnic backgrounds.

Tensions are boiling over at college campuses across the country as police move in to break up protest encampments, clear out occupied buildings, and make arrests. The demonstrations have turned violent at some schools, with clashes erupting between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators.At campuses from New York to Dallas and Washington, DC, demonstrators are demanding schools sever financial ties to Israel and grant amnesty to students for rule breaking, among other goals.The showdowns have sparked recriminations and support from politicians, faculty and billionaire donors.With commencement quickly approaching, the pressure on administrators is on. Their strategies have varied from heavy handed to hands-off. Here’s a look at the latest developments at several institutions across the country.On Wednesday morning, dozens of protesters pushed their way into the Lincoln Center campus and set up tents. After repeated warnings, the NYPD arrested 15 people for trespassing and cleared out the encampment.Police arrested about 35 people, including students and professors, who had taken over two buildings. The school on Wednesday announced the campus will remain closed through at least the end of the semester and that a “modified” graduation ceremony will be held at an off-campus location.UCLA suspended classes on Wednesday after early morning unrest at a pro-Palestinian encampment, according to the Los Angeles Times. The newspaper said a group of counter-demonstrators tried to tear down the barricades surrounding the protest area. Pro-Palestinian protesters later used pepper spray on those demonstrators, it said.The college is moving to remote learning, after New York police descended on the campus late Tuesday night, clearing an encampment and arresting more than 160 people.Police officers entered the campus Tuesday, breaking up an escalating protest and arresting more than 100 demonstrators, some of whom had barricaded themselves in a building. Columbia President Minouche Shafik said she asked police to maintain a campus presence through at least May 17, two days after graduation.After the school issued a “no trespass order” to students at an encampment, President Sunil Kumar was scheduled to meet with protesters on Wednesday, the Tufts Daily newspaper reported.On Tuesday morning, officers from Yale and New Haven evacuated the pro-Palestine protest site at Campus Cross, according to Yale Daily News. Police were able to clear the encampment without arrests, though protesters vowed to return.Protesters at the Ivy League school agreed to dismantle their encampment after striking a deal that allows them to present their divestment proposal to the university’s governing body. The administration agreed that protesting students won’t be subject to suspension or expulsion.Thirteen people were arrested on Monday after hundreds of students took over a university building and erected barricades. Protesters surrounded the bus carrying the arrested students until they were released.One week into the campus demonstrations, lawmaker visited the site, including House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, who said Congress will do everything in its power to restore “law and order.”More than a dozen protesters were arrested on Wednesday afternoon after law enforcement broke up an encampment that pro-Palestinian students set up in the early morning hours, where hundreds of people had gathered, according to the Dallas Morning News.Administrators haven’t sought to clear out an encampment on Harvard Yard, instead threatening sanctions and restricting access, according to the Harvard Crimson. Final exams initially scheduled for Harvard Hall are being relocated outside Harvard Yard.","Protesters are demanding schools sever financial ties to Israel and grant amnesty to students for rule breaking.

"US: Active shooter ‘neutralized’ outside Wisconsin school, officials say amid reports of gunshots, panic",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-active-shooter-neutralized-outside-wisconsin-school-officials-say/articleshow/109763572.cms,"Witnesses described children fleeing after the sound of gunshots near a Wisconsin middle school where authorities said an active shooter was “neutralized” outside the building Wednesday. There were no reported injuries to those inside the school.But police remained on the scene hours later, and Mount Horeb Area School District had only announced plans to release younger students from a nearby elementary school.In a post on Facebook, the district said remaining students would stay in schools “while the police continue their investigation.”For panicked kids and their parents, the initial incident and the wait to be reunited was terrifying. Parents described children hiding in closets, afraid to communicate on cell phones, and one middle schooler said his class initially fled the school gym on in-line skates.The district used Facebook posts throughout the day to give updates, with the earliest coming around 11:30 a.m. and reporting that all district schools were on lockdown. Authorities in Mount Horeb said without giving details that the “alleged assailant” was harmed, and witnesses described hearing gunshots and seeing dozens of children running.More than four hours later, school buses remained lined up for blocks outside the middle school and authorities had used police tape to surround the middle school, the nearby high school and playing fields between the two buildings.“An initial search of the middle school has not yielded additional suspects,” a post around noon said. “As importantly, we have no reports of individuals being harmed, with the exception of the alleged assailant.”Earlier, the district posted that “the threat has been neutralized outside of the building” but didn’t elaborate on what had happened at the school in Mount Horeb, some 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the state capital of Madison.Jeanne Keller said she heard about five gunshots while in her shop The Quilting Jeanne, just down the block from the campus that includes the middle school.“It was maybe like pow-pow-pow-pow,” Keller told The Associated Press by phone. “I thought it was fireworks. I went outside and saw all the children running ... I probably saw 200 children.”One middle schooler said his class was in the school gym practicing in-line skating when they heard gunshots.Max Kelly, 12, said his teacher told the class to get out of the school. He said they skated to a street, ditched their in-line skates and ran to a nearby convenience store and gas station and hid in a bathroom.Kelly was reunited with his parents and sat on a hillside with them early Wednesday afternoon waiting for his younger siblings to be released from their own schools. He still wore socks, his shoes left behind.“I don’t think anywhere is safe anymore,” said his mother, 32-year-old Alison Kelly.Police in Mount Horeb said they could not immediately provide information. A person who answered the phone at the school district office declined comment. The Dane County Sheriff’s office directed reporters to a staging area but had not provided updates hours after the school district first alerted families about the incident.The district had begun releasing some students of other schools by early afternoon and anxious parents gathered at a bus depot waiting for their kids.Shannon Hurd, 44, and her former husband, Nathian Hurd, 39, sat in a car waiting for their 13-year-old son, Noah, who was still in the locked-down middle school.Shannon Hurd said she first heard what happened via a text from Noah saying he loved her. She said she nearly fell down the stairs at her work as she ran to get to the school.“I just want my kid,” she said. “They’re supposed to be safe at school.”Stacy Smith, 42, was at the bank Wednesday when she saw police cars rush by and soon got a school district text warning of an active shooter.She initially could not reach her two children — junior Abbi and seventh-grader Cole. Finally, she reached Abbi by phone but the girl whispered that she was hiding in a closet and couldn’t talk. She eventually connected with both children and learned they were OK.“Not here,” she said in disbelief. “You hear about this everywhere else but not here.”Schools nationwide have sought ways to prevent mass shootings inside their walls, from physical security measures and active shooter drills to technology including detailed digital maps. Many also rely on teachers and administrators working to detect early signs of student mental health struggles.The Mount Horeb Area School District’s security protocols were not immediately clear Wednesday and there was no information known about the alleged assailant’s identity or condition.The village is home to around 7,600 people and the central office of outdoor gear retailer Duluth Trading Company. Mount Horeb markets itself as the “troll capital of the world,” a reference to carvings of trolls stationed throughout its downtown district as a tribute to a Scandinavian gift shop that was a landmark for passing long-haul truckers in the 1970s.Heidy Lange, owner of Firefly Events Decor & Flowers, said she was in her florist shop about two blocks from the school when she looked out and saw children running and “probably 50 cop cars from everywhere.”“All of a sudden there was a whole bunch of parents running behind them,” Lange said. “All our phones were beeping with all the alerts. It would devastate the town if something happened to a child here.”","Parents describe children hiding in closets, afraid to communicate on cell phones.

"US job openings fall to 8.5 million in March, the lowest level in more than 3 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-job-openings-fall-to-8-5-million-in-march-the-lowest-level-in-more-than-3-years/articleshow/109758828.cms,"WASHINGTON: US jobs openings slid in March to the lowest level in more than three years, but stayed at historically high levels in a sign that the job market remains resilient in the face of higher interest rates.The Labor Department reported Wednesday that employers posted 8.5 million vacancies in March, down from 8.8 million in February and the fewest since February 2021.The number of Americans quitting their jobs fell to the lowest level since January 2021 — a sign of diminishing confidence in their ability to find something better. But layoffs fell.Monthly job openings are down sharply from a peak of 12.2 million in March 2022 but remain at a high level. Before 2021, they'd never exceeded 8 million — a threshold they have now reached for 37 straight months.The high level of job openings reflects a surprisingly strong US labor market. When the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in March 2022 to combat a resurgence in inflation, the higher borrowing costs were expected to tip the economy into recession and push up unemployment.Instead, even as the Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times, the economy kept growing, companies kept hiring and unemployment stayed low, coming in under 4% for 26 straight months — longest such streak since the 1960s. Employers have added a healthy average of 276,000 jobs a month this year — up from last year's 251,000 — and Friday's April jobs report is expected to show they tacked on another 230,000 last month, down but still solid, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.Inflation eased, too — decelerating from a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.5% in March. The combination of falling inflation and enduring economic strength has raised hopes the Fed can manage a so-called soft landing —slowing the economy enough to tame inflation without causing a recession. Some economists have suggested there need be no landing at all: The economy can keep growing steadily as inflation comes down.But progress on inflation has lately stalled. On a month-to-month basis, consumer price increases haven't fallen since October. And on a year-over-year basis, they remain well above the Fed's 2% target.The Fed had signaled that it expects to reverse course and cut rates three times this year. But, given the disappointing inflation numbers, the central bank appears to be in no hurry to start: It's expected to leave rates alone at its meeting Wednesday.","US employers posted 8.5 million vacancies in March, down from 8.8 million in February and the fewest since February 2021.

Columbia’s hall cleared of protesters; police asked to stay till May 17



'Not an example of peaceful protest': Whitehouse condemns violent protests



'Free, free Palestine!'



NEW DELHI: As Pro-Palestine, anti-war protests have gained momentum across universities in the US, New York City police officers entered Columbia University late Tuesday and arrested hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters.Over the previous two weeks, more than 1,000 protestors have been arrested on campuses in Texas, Utah, Virginia, North Carolina, New Mexico, Connecticut, Louisiana, California, and New Jersey, some following clashes with riot police.Columbia University has asked the police to remain on the campus until May 17.The White House had decried the standoffs at Columbia and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where demonstrators took two buildings before officers with batons intervened overnight and arrested 25 individuals. Officials projected that the total damage to the northern California school would be more than $1 million.Last week, pro-Palestinian student demonstrators set up a tent encampment at New York's Ivy League universities. Police attempted to evict the encampment on April 18, arresting over 100 demonstrators. However, the approach backfired, energizing students around the country and prompting demonstrators at Columbia to regroup.Hours after police entered Columbia University to clear out pro-Palestinian protestors, clashes broke out at California University with scores of protestors and counter-protestors engaged in a scuffle carrying sticks and metal barricades.The Los Angeles police department informed on X, ""We can confirm that LAPD officers have been deployed, and are currently on the UCLA campus, to assist in restoring order. We are working in partnership with UCLA PD and other law enforcement agencies.""New York City police officers entered Columbia University late Tuesday and arrested pro-Palestinian protesters. The law enforcement action came in response to a prolonged occupation by students who had taken over Hamilton Hall and maintained a tent encampment for nearly two weeks.This police intervention follows a direct call from Mayor Eric Adams earlier in the day, declaring that the ongoing protest ""must end now.""Columbia President Minouche Shafik wrote a letter to senior NYPD officials requesting that police remove demonstrators from the occupied building and a surrounding tent encampment ""with the utmost regret."" She also requested that officers remain on campus until May 17, which is after the university's commencement ceremonies.Calling it an ""absolutely the wrong approach"", Whitehouse condemned the standoffs at Columbia and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where demonstrators took two buildings before officers with batons intervened overnight and arrested 25 individuals.Officials said that the total damage to the northern California school would be more than $1 million.With chants of ""shame on you"" and ""free, free Palestine!"", the student protesters are calling for Columbia University and other institutions to divest from companies involved in the Israeli military operations in Gaza.Their occupation and demonstrations are part of a broader push to protest what they see as injustices in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, aligning with wider protests across the country following Israel’s offensive in Gaza triggered by a Hamas attack on southern Israel.","New York City police officers entered Columbia University late Tuesday and arrested hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters.

Einstein Probe X-ray telescope begins observations with breakthrough discoveries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/einstein-probe-x-ray-telescope-begins-observations-with-breakthrough-discoveries/articleshow/109753335.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Einstein Probe, a joint Chinese and European X-ray telescope mission, has commenced its journey into the cosmos, offering groundbreaking insights into the universe's most dynamic phenomena. Launched on January 9 aboard a Chinese Long March rocket, the Einstein Probe is currently stationed in orbit around Earth at an altitude of 600 kilometers (373 miles) and is undergoing a critical phase of testing and calibration.The telescope's innovative design, inspired by the eyes of lobsters, utilizes a Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) to capture X-rays across a vast expanse of the sky. This lobster-eye approach enables the telescope to observe a panoramic field of view spanning over 3,600 square degrees, or approximately one-eleventh of the sky, in a single shot. Remarkably, WXT can image the entire sky in X-rays within just three orbits, a report in Space.com said.The design, which mimics the way lobsters see, features hundreds of thousands of tiny square pores linked to tubes that focus light through reflection. This unique structure allows the telescope to efficiently capture high-energy X-rays that are difficult to detect with traditional methods due to their powerful nature and tendency to pass through most materials without interaction.Since its launch, the Einstein Probe has successfully detected numerous X-ray transients, which are brief and intense flashes of X-ray light typically associated with highly energetic and transient celestial events. The first such event was captured on February 19, linked to a long gamma-ray burst from the destruction of a massive star. To date, the telescope has discovered an impressive total of 141 transients, including 127 stars unleashing X-ray flares, the Space.com report said.Complementing the WXT is the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT), which provides more detailed views of specific areas or objects within WXT's broad surveillance range. FXT has been actively engaged in follow-up observations, further exploring phenomena detected by WXT. Among its notable observations are detailed images of the supernova remnant Puppis A and the giant globular cluster Omega Centauri, showcasing binary systems where material from a star is being pulled onto a neutron star or black hole.""I am delighted to see the first observations from Einstein Probe, which showcases the mission's ability to study wide expanses of the X-ray sky and quickly discover new celestial sources,"" said Carole Mundell, the European Space Agency’s Director of Science. She emphasized that the early data provide a tantalizing glimpse into the dynamic universe that the mission will further unveil.Erik Kuulkers, the Project Scientist for Einstein Probe at the European Space Agency, expressed his astonishment at the capabilities demonstrated by the instruments, even before full calibration. ""It is astounding that we could already perform a time-critical follow-up observation using the FXT instrument of a fast X-ray transient first spotted by WXT,"" he noted, highlighting the potential of the mission during its planned survey.The mission, set to officially commence its survey in June following the completion of its testing phase, marks a significant advance in X-ray astronomy. It is a collaboration involving the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the European Space Agency, the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, and the National Centre for Space Studies in France. The Einstein Probe's discoveries are expected to greatly enrich the catalog of celestial objects for Europe's forthcoming NewAthena mission, poised to be the most powerful X-ray telescope ever built, scheduled for launch in 2037.","The Einstein Probe, a joint Chinese and European X-ray telescope mission, has commenced its journey into the cosmos.

Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope maps exoplanet's weather 280 light years away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-maps-exoplanets-weather-280-light-years-away/articleshow/109753422.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nasa 's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has mapped the weather on WASP-43 b , a gas-giant exoplanet situated 280 light-years from Earth. This milestone achievement showcases Webb's unparalleled ability to study distant worlds, contributing significantly to our understanding of planetary atmospheres outside our solar system.WASP-43 b, characterized as a hot gas-giant, bears no resemblance to any planet within our own solar system.The data collected by JWST offers an in-depth look into the dynamic weather patterns and atmospheric properties of this distant exoplanet. This breakthrough is crucial for understanding the atmospheric physics and chemistry of exoplanets, especially those that differ greatly from Earth-like conditions.The visualization of WASP-43 b, an artist’s concept credited to Nasa, the European Space Agency (ESA), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), and Ralf Crawford of the Space Telescope Science Institute, provides a hypothetical representation based on the extensive data gathered by the telescope. This depiction helps scientists and the public alike visualize what such a remote world might look like.Through the Webb Telescope's sophisticated instruments, researchers have been able to observe and analyze atmospheric features that are pivotal for modeling the climate and weather of WASP-43 b. These observations are vital for the broader field of exoplanet research, paving the way for future studies that could assess the habitability of other planets.The insights gained from mapping the weather on WASP-43 b extend beyond this single exoplanet, offering potential methodologies for studying other similar planets across the galaxy. This could eventually lead to better predictive models of planetary atmospheres and, possibly, their capacity to host life.Nasa's ongoing mission with the James Webb Space Telescope continues to expand our cosmic horizons, bringing into focus the complexities of planets far beyond our own solar neighborhood. The scientific community awaits further results from Webb with anticipation, hopeful that each new discovery will provide deeper understanding of the universe's myriad worlds.","Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has mapped the weather on WASP-43 b, a gas-giant exoplanet situated 280 light-years from Earth.

Hillary Clinton: 'Don't vote for anyone you wouldn't trust with your dog',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hillary-clinton-dont-vote-for-anyone-you-wouldnt-trust-with-your-dog/articleshow/109753443.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has publicly criticized South Dakota governor Kristi Noem following Noem’s admission in her forthcoming book that she shot and killed her 14-month-old dog, Cricket. Clinton, using the platform X, remarked, ""Still true,"" referring to a tweet she made in February 2021: ""Don't vote for anyone you wouldn't trust with your dog."" This tweet was initially directed at Republican Senator Ted Cruz during a controversial incident but has resurfaced in light of Noem's actions.As per a Daily Mail report, in her book titled ""No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward,"" Noem reveals that she killed Cricket to demonstrate she could handle ""difficult, messy, and ugly"" situations.The decision has sparked widespread criticism and debate about her judgement and the appropriateness of her response to the dog's behavior, which she described as overly aggressive.Noem recounts in the book that Cricket had been a problem during a pheasant hunt and had killed chickens owned by a local family, behaving like ""a trained assassin."" After these incidents, Noem felt the dog was untrainable and dangerous, leading to her decision to euthanize Cricket. She wrote, ""I hated that dog,"" emphasizing that the animal was ""less than worthless as a hunting dog"" and posed a threat to people.The incident has had political repercussions , with one Trump ally telling The Hill, ""She's DOA,"" implying that the controversy has damaged Noem's prospects as a potential vice-presidential candidate for Donald Trump in 2024. The criticism hinges on the perception that Noem’s actions were extreme and not in line with responsible animal handling or public expectations of political leaders, the Daily Mail report said.In defense, Noem has reiterated on X that tough decisions are often necessary on farms, mentioning other animals her family has had to euthanize. She maintains that her actions were justified under South Dakota law, which allows for the euthanization of dogs that attack livestock, claiming Cricket had exhibited aggressive behavior towards people as well.The backlash continues as the public and political commentators debate the implications of Noem’s actions not only on her political future but also on broader ethical considerations regarding the treatment of animals by public officials.","Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has publicly criticized South Dakota governor Kristi Noem.

His refusal to clearly reject the possibility of violence if the election does not go his way reflects a continuation of his rhetoric around the legitimacy of election processes.Moreover, Trump doubled down on his intention to pardon individuals convicted of crimes related to the January 6 Capitol attack , stating, ""I would consider that, yes,"" when asked if he would pardon every one of them.On abortion, Trump dodged questions about his stance on a federal ban and potential state penalties for women who undergo abortions where it is banned, indicating that these decisions should be left to state legislatures.In the realm of foreign policy, Trump was critical of Netanyahu, suggesting that the Israeli Prime Minister should be scrutinized for his handling of security, especially in light of the Hamas attack on October 7. However, Trump was non-committal about supporting any changes in Israeli leadership.The former president also commented on the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in Russia, stating that he ""should be released"" after not having previously called for his release due to being preoccupied with other matters.Trump’s remarks underscore his continued influence over the Republican base, as well as the polarizing nature of his political and social stances heading into the 2024 presidential election .","Former US President Donald Trump has suggested that the potential for political violence from his supporters might hinge on the fairness of the upcoming election.

His refusal to clearly reject the possibility of violence if the election does not go his way reflects a continuation of his rhetoric around the legitimacy of election processes.Moreover, Trump doubled down on his intention to pardon individuals convicted of crimes related to the January 6 Capitol attack, stating, ""I would consider that, yes,"" when asked if he would pardon every one of them.On abortion, Trump dodged questions about his stance on a federal ban and potential state penalties for women who undergo abortions where it is banned, indicating that these decisions should be left to state legislatures.In the realm of foreign policy, Trump was critical of Netanyahu, suggesting that the Israeli Prime Minister should be scrutinized for his handling of security, especially in light of the Hamas attack on October 7. However, Trump was non-committal about supporting any changes in Israeli leadership.The former president also commented on the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in Russia, stating that he ""should be released"" after not having previously called for his release due to being preoccupied with other matters.Trump’s remarks underscore his continued influence over the Republican base, as well as the polarizing nature of his political and social stances heading into the 2024 presidential election.","Former US President Donald Trump has suggested that the potential for political violence from his supporters might hinge on the fairness of the upcoming election. In an interview with Time magazine, Trump expressed confidence in his victory but did not rule out the possibility of unrest similar to the events of January 6, 2021.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109753216,imgsize-797962,width-400,resizemode-4/109753216.jpg"
Pakistan to block over 5 lakh SIM cards of tax evaders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-block-over-5-lakh-sim-cards-of-tax-evaders/articleshow/109762651.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to enhance tax compliance , the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led govt has directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and other telecom companies to block the mobile phone SIMs of over 500,000 people who have not submitted their tax returns.The development came a day after Shehbaz Sharif pledged at the closing plenary session of the World Economic Forum (WEF) special conference in Riyadh to enact significant austerity measures and implement long-lasting reforms in order to steer his country out of its current economic crisis.On Tuesday, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) had directed the PTA and all telecom operators to ensure compliance with the Income Tax General Order (ITGO) with immediate effect. “The FBR has taken decisive action by issuing an order to disable mobile phone SIMs associated with 506,671 individuals ... who are not appearing on the active taxpayer list but are obligated to file income tax returns ,” the FBR said in a statement, adding that telecom operators are mandated to furnish a compliance report to the FBR by May 15 to provide transparency and accountability in the enforcement process.“Through enforcement measures and collaboration with relevant stakeholders, the FBR aims to strengthen the tax base and promote a fair and equitable tax system for the benefit of the nation,” the FBR handout read.“Until the FBR or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, whichever has jurisdiction over the individual, restores the mobile SIMs for the aforementioned individuals, they will remain blocked,” it added.For the tax year 2023, so far only 4.5 million people have filed their annual returns as against 5.9 million filers for tax year 2022.Sharif’s government had also launched a compulsory tax registration scheme to bring in about 3.2 million retailers who remain outside the tax net. It had given one month to these retailers to voluntarily register with the tax machinery, a deadline that lapsed Tuesday.Till the last date, only 75 retailers got registered with the FBR, officials said.

IMF approves last tranche of $3-billion loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-approves-last-tranche-of-3-billion-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/109738150.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism Tuesday regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country, saying it would bolster economic stability . Pakistan is now eyeing a new, longer and larger economic bailout package, but economists cautioned against the country’s continued reliance on overseas financial assistance, warning of potential dire consequences.IMF approved the immediate release of the tranche following a key meeting of the global lender’s executive board in Washington late Monday night.All board members favoured releasing the funds, except India, which abstained.Pakistan has been reeling from a severe economic crisis for more than two years, with its inflation at one point shooting up to nearly 38% and its foreign currency reserves depleted to $3bn in Feb 2023, enough to cover less than five weeks of imports.Last year, the global lender had approved a nine-month standby arrangement with Pakistan “to support its economic stabilisation programme”. The approval had allowed for an immediate disbursement of $1.2bn, with the rest phased over the programme’s duration — subject to two quarterly reviews.The IMF bailout proved important to save the country from default, the state broadcaster quoted PM Sharif as saying.Leading economist Qaiser Bengali expressed scepticism about the perceived stability, highlighting the temporary nature of the current situation and underscoring the necessity of meaningful reforms to address long-term economic challenges.“If the so-called stability was due to a rise in exports or better inflow of dollars, that would have been meaningful, but that is not happening,” Bengali said, adding that the economy cannot run on a policy of getting new loans to pay past loans.Pakistan’s external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.","PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country.

The pre-action letter sent on Monday outlines his civil claim for damages for harassment abroad, physical injury, trespass to the person, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.“While in office, Shahzad highlighted army and ISI interference with his accountability and anti-corruption objectives. Believing that he could not fix the rampant corruption in Pakistan, he resigned from Khan’s government in Jan 2022,” a spokesperson for UK law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Akbar, said. On April 17, 2022, he fled to London.“He continues to campaign against corruption in Pakistan and remains highly critical of the military establishment and govt officials,” the spokesperson added.Akbar said: “Compared to what was done to me, I believe a lot worse is being inflicted on dissidents in Pakistan by the current regime. They are targeting political workers, lawyers, judges andjournalists. However, what should be most alarming is that Pakistan is able to target its dissidents on British soil without any accountability.”A spokesperson for Hertfordshire constabulary confirmed to TOI it was investigating the acid attack and was appealing for witnesses and to trace the motorbike the suspects rode. No arrests have been made.The Pakistan high commission in London said: “The govt rejects all such attempts to malign the reputation of its institutions for motivated agendas.”A spokesperson for the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said last Dec, when asked about the attack: “We reject any insinuations of Pakistan's involvement and that of Pakistani agencies in such a heinous attack. It is not our policy to target our own nationals abroad. We hope that culprits in this case will be identified and treated as per UK law.”","Shahzad Akbar (46), a Pakistani citizen who fled to Britain after Khan was ousted, was nearly blinded in the attack in front of his young child at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire.

At the age of 73, Dar, a chartered accountant and experienced politician from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, was named deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday, with the appointment taking immediate effect and until further notice.Shehbaz Sharif and Dar are currently in Saudi Arabia for the World Economic Forum's (WEF) special meeting.According to the Dawn newspaper, Dar's new appointment ""took many by surprise, but drew hardly any criticism from its allies'.Dar being ""awarded' the ""rarely filled' slot of deputy prime minister has raised many questions, the report said.The main talking point is that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif wants to have his ""confidant' in a key position in the federal cabinet to ""compensate him for the loss of the finance portfolio', it said.The report mentioned that the action was also viewed in connection with Nawaz Sharif assuming leadership of the ruling PML-N party as its president, a position he had been deprived of after being convicted in the Panama Papers case.Dar is seen as having a close relationship with Nawaz Sharif because of the family connection through marriage, as his son is married to the elder Sharif's daughter.An insider claimed that the move to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister was ""pre-planned', the report said. During the formation of the coalition government, it was agreed that Dar would serve as the Deputy Prime Minister.However, based on a report from Geo News, the decision to appoint a four-time finance minister as the foreign minister indicates an increased focus on economics in the country's diplomacy as the financially struggling nation aims to obtain another deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and strengthen external financing from foreign capitals.Dar was the finance minister from 1998 to 1999 and then again from March to May 2008. He once more headed the finance ministry from 2013 to 2017 and later from 2022 to 2023. He additionally worked as the minister for industry and investment from February 1997 to July 1997, and also in commerce from December 1997 to October 1999.According to the report from Dawn, during Nawaz Sharif's tenure as the prime minister, Dar served as the de facto deputy prime minister, leading numerous government and parliamentary committees in the capacity of chairperson. Even though the Constitution does not include a provision for a deputy prime minister, Dar is the second legislator to assume this role.Chaudhry Parvez Elahi served as Deputy Prime Minister when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was in power from June 25, 2012, to June 29, 2013. During that period, his responsibilities were largely symbolic, and he was given recognition by then-President Asif Ali Zardari for his support of the government led by the PPP.Elahi is currently serving as the president of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party led by the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, and he is in prison due to corruption allegations.Interestingly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the main ally of the PML-N-led government, did not raise any objection to Dar's new appointment. The PPP Information Secretary, Faisal Karim Kundi, stated that his party had no objections to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister. ""It is the PM's prerogative to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister,"" he said, adding that the move was not meant as a ""message' to anyone.Meanwhile, Khan's PTI on Monday reacted strongly to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister, saying ""Sharifs are distributing key national posts within the family'.""The Sharif family is distributing important national posts among themselves,"" Special Assistant to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister For Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said.The PTI leader criticized the federal government for appointing individuals to high-ranking positions instead of addressing the problems faced by the people as the Constitution does not provide for the position of deputy PM.Reacting to Dar's appointment, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob termed the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led government's move ""an extra-constitutional step that carries no substantial value'.""This just indicates intra-party tensions and competition for influence.

Explosion in Cambodia that killed 20 at an army base was likely caused by mishandling of ammunition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/explosion-in-cambodia-that-killed-20-at-an-army-base-was-likely-caused-by-mishandling-of-ammunition/articleshow/109724952.cms,"PHNOM PENH: A huge explosion in southwestern Cambodia over the weekend that killed 20 soldiers at an army base appears to have been an accident caused by mishandling of ammunition by troops, a senior military official said Tuesday.The Saturday afternoon blast in Kampong Speu province also destroyed military vehicles and four buildings at the base, and damaged homes in a nearby village.Army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Mao Phalla said the soldiers were transferring ammunition from trucks into a storage facility when the blast occurred, killing them instantly. He said another 11 people, including soldiers and nearby villagers, were slightly injured, mostly from debris from the damaged buildings, not shrapnel.Cambodia held a mass funeral on Sunday for those killed in the explosion.The initial but still not official theory was that the soldiers were unloading ammunition from a truck and stacking it on the ground before moving it into the storage facility, causing one item to explode, he said. That set off a chain reaction, added Mao Phalla.However, he said it will be difficult to determine the exact chain of events as all those involved in the unloading were killed.Mao Phalla said the site has been sealed off and that deminers from theCambodian Mines Action Center were clearing the area any unexploded ordnance.In March 2005, a nighttime blast at an arms depot in the northwestern provincial town of Battambang triggered an hourslong spray of shells and bullets that killed at least six people and caused panic.A 2014 report by the Swiss-based group Small Arms Survey highlighted the dangers of poorly stored or mishandled munitions, calling it a ""global problem."" It noted that from 1979 through 2013 there were more than 500 incidents involving unplanned explosions at munitions sites.","The Saturday afternoon blast in Kampong Speu province also destroyed military vehicles and four buildings at the base.
