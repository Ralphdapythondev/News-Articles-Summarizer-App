Historic rainfall triggers severe flooding in North Carolina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/historic-rainfall-triggers-severe-flooding-in-coastal-north-carolina/articleshow/113407806.cms,"'There’s water inside the building...'

Floodwaters caused significant disruptions in coastal North Carolina on Monday, following a powerful storm system that unleashed historic rainfall within just a few hours. The heavy rains led to extensive flooding , submerging homes, stranding vehicles, and requiring numerous water rescues.According to town manager Bruce Oakley, Carolina Beach was heavily impacted by the rainfall.“It’s likely the worst flooding we’ve ever seen in Carolina Beach,” he told CNN. “We’ve had to rescue individuals from both vehicles and buildings, including houses and businesses.”Carolina Beach was declared a state of emergency after the National Weather Service in Wilmington recorded a historic 18 inches of rain in just 12 hours at one location, marking a once-in-1,000-year event. Other areas in the region received over a foot of rain within 12 hours, a once-in-200-year event.Oakley noted that emergency services were busy responding to numerous rescue calls.The storm, identified as Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight , was not organized enough to be classified as a tropical or subtropical storm. It is expected to subside by early Wednesday.Due to the flooding, Carolina Beach Elementary School closed early. Law enforcement and fire crews assisted in transporting children home as routes were blocked by up to 3 feet of water.Brunswick County also encountered heavy rain, with rates exceeding 4 to 5 inches per hour. In just three hours, Sunny Point received over 9 inches of rain. “Our deputies are assisting multiple individuals who are stranded in their cars and homes,” the Brunswick County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post. Southport city officials issued a shelter-in-place order and a nighttime curfew.By Monday evening, conditions in Carolina Beach improved, and tropical storm warnings for the coastal Carolinas were lifted. However, many abandoned vehicles remained on the roads, according to town mayor Lynn Barbee.North Carolina remained under a flood watch until Tuesday despite the system weakening. The National Weather Service warned that “excessive runoff could result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone areas.”Forecasters predict that the system will continue to weaken over the next day or so, with the low expected to dissipate over the Carolinas by early Wednesday. They also noted that while less than an inch of additional rainfall is expected Monday night, there is only a 20% chance of rain on Tuesday.Michael McLaughlin , the owner of The Fat Pelican, shared his challenges with the flooding, as quoted by CNN: “There’s water inside the building. I’m trying to recover items that floated away.” Despite the damage, McLaughlin remained hopeful about getting the business back up and running.Lisa and Gary Hollon, who have owned a home in Kure Beach for nearly 15 years, experienced flooding for the first time. “We were caught off guard and had never flooded before,” Lisa Hollon said, adding that their home’s first floor was suddenly covered with 4 to 6 inches of water.In Supply, North Carolina, Timothy Turner used his surfboard to help neighbors navigate the floodwaters. Turner described rescuing a neighbor’s dog using his board. “I’ve performed 25 rescues from rip currents over the last eight years, but this was the first time I used a surfboard for a dog rescue,” he said, according to CNN.Earlier in August, Tropical Storm Debby had already drenched the Carolinas with 6 to 12 inches of rain, resulting in flash floods near Charleston, South Carolina.","Floodwaters caused significant disruptions in coastal North Carolina on Monday.

Russians urged to have sex during work breaks to boost birth rate: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russians-urged-to-have-sex-during-work-breaks-to-boost-birth-rate-report/articleshow/113407962.cms,"Putin moves to expand Russian army to 2nd largest in the world

Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to Russia ’s declining birth rate , has launched an unusual initiative: encouraging Russians to have sex during their work breaks, Metro.co.uk reported. The move aims to address the country's fertility rate, which is currently at about 1.5 children per woman, falling short of the 2.1 rate needed for population stability.'The preservation of the Russian people is our highest national priority,' Putin said, as reported by Metro.'The fate of Russia….depends on how many of us there will be. It is a question of national importance,' the Russian president added.This push comes as Russia faces a population decline, worsened by the emigration of over one million younger citizens due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Putin has made clear that reversing the population decline is a top national priority, declaring that the country's future depends on how many people remain.Russian health minister Dr. Yevgeny Shestopalov supports the new policy, dismissing busy work schedules as a reason for not having children. “You can have children during breaks,” he said. When questioned about how those with long hours could manage, he simply replied, “During break times,” Metro.co.uk reported.This policy is part of a wider Kremlin effort to increase the birth rate. Women in Moscow are now offered free fertility checks to assess their reproductive health. Additionally, MP Tatyana Butskaya has proposed that employers track and report their employees’ birth rates, aiming to boost the number of births each year.In the Chelyabinsk region, young women are being offered £8,500 for the birth of their first child as an incentive. The government is also making it harder to access abortions and increasing divorce fees, with public figures and church leaders advocating for higher birth rates as a national duty.Politicians like Anna Kuznetsova and Zhanna Ryabtseva are calling for women to start having children at a younger age, suggesting that early childbearing could lead to larger families.President Putin also ordered a major expansion of the Russian military. The plan calls for increasing the number of troops by 180,000, raising the total force to 2.38 million, with 1.5 million being active personnel. This would make Russia’s army the second largest in the world, following China.This expansion follows previous increases in military personnel since the start of the Ukraine invasion in 2022. With ongoing conflict and heavy losses, the expansion is part of a strategy to adapt to current global conditions and strengthen national security.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has launched an unusual initiative: encouraging Russians to have sex during their work breaks.

"Trump blames Biden, Harris’ 'inflammatory language' for second assassination attempt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-blames-biden-harris-inflammatory-language-for-second-assassination-attempt/articleshow/113406907.cms,"'They are a real threat'

Former US President Donald Trump accused President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of inciting violence through their rhetoric , which he claims led to a second assassination attempt on him on Sunday. The Republican presidential candidate alleged that the suspect was influenced by the Democrats ' ""highly inflammatory language.""Trump was swiftly evacuated from the golf course at Trump International in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday, when the Secret Service discovered a gunman hiding in the bushes.The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh , was found armed with an AK-47-style rifle, a GoPro camera, and two backpacks. Routh fled but was later arrested on I-95. This incident marks the second assassination attempt on Trump since July.In his interview with Fox News Digital, Trump said, ""He (the gunman) believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,"" blaming their comments for fueling violence against him. ""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country—both from the inside and out,"" he added.Trump also criticised Biden and Harris for labeling him a ""threat to democracy"" while presenting themselves as ""unity"" leaders. He said, ""These are people who want to destroy our country. It is called the enemy from within"". ""They are the real threat,"" he added.Trump reiterated his belief that Democrats use inflammatory language, but he refrains from doing so himself. Trump warned Democrats about their rhetoric, stating, ""They use highly inflammatory language. I could use it too—and much better than they can—but I choose not to.""Democrats have accused Trump of escalating tensions and labeled him a ""threat to democracy,"" especially due to his role in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. President Biden recently said at an event that Trump incites hate, referring to his comments about Haitian immigrants. Trump also argued that Biden and Harris' policies are weakening the US and diminishing its global respect.Trump also reflected on his recent presidential debate with Harris, criticising the media for its biased coverage and calling David Muir ""a sleaze like the rest."" He described media figures as ""fools"" who propagate Democratic ""garbage"" and ""sick philosophies,"" and accused them of shielding Democrats. Trump said, ""The media is made up of fools who will spew [Democrats’] garbage and their sick philosophies and will protect them at all costs, and they can’t believe they get away with it.""After the shooting incident, Trump assured his supporters of his safety in a fundraising email, writing, ""There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham also confirmed that Trump was in ""good spirits.""The second assassination attempt on Trump follows an earlier attack in July, when he was shot in the ear during a rally in Pennsylvania.

"Paraguay loves Mickey, its very own cartoon mouse. Disney doesn't",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/paraguay-loves-mickey-its-very-own-cartoon-mouse-disney-doesnt/articleshow/113407123.cms,"One is a colossus that spans theme parks, merchandise and movies, with 150 Academy Awards, 225,000 employees and annual revenue of nearly $90 billion.The other is a third-generation family firm with 280 workers that packages hot sauce, soy beans, multicoloured sprinkles, an herb called horsetail, six varieties of panettone and seven kinds of salt for sale in Paraguayan supermarkets.Yet, Mickey is a household name to rival Disney across the little-touristed South American nation of 6.1 million. There's the cartoon mouse too - also called Mickey, and indistinguishable from Mickey Mouse - whose iconic ears adorn the gates of the company's factory, its trucks and a mascot in heavy demand at Paraguayan weddings.""But don't get it twisted. There's the Disney Mickey,"" said Viviana Blasco , 51, one of five siblings who run the business, and ""the Paraguayan Mickey, our Mickey."" Still, if the Paraguayan Mickey seems remarkably similar to the Disney one, it may not be entirely a coincidence. Paraguayans are notoriously creative - some would say light-fingered - when it comes to intellectual property . Factories churn out knockoff Nike, Lacoste and Adidas clothing. Paraguay's educational authorities warned last year that Harvard University Paraguay was awarding bogus medical degrees. (The school has no connection to the more famous Harvard University.)Paraguay ranks 86th out of 125 countries in an index compiled by the Property Rights Alliance, a research institute based in Washington, D.C., scoring 1.7 out of 10 for copyright protection. But Mickey, the Blasco family enterprise, has survived multiple legal challenges levelled by Disney. Viviana Blasco denied that her family had appropriated Disney's property. ""We didn't take it. We built a brand over many years. Mickey grew in parallel to Walt Disney.""The Mickey saga began, Blasco said, in 1935. Blasco's grandfather, Pascual, the son of Italian immigrants, saw an opportunity to spread some joy - and turn a profit. He opened a tiny shop selling fruit and homemade gelato. It was called Mickey. Exactly where the idea came from, said Blasco, remains ""something of a mystery."" But Pascual, she said, often vacationed in Buenos Aires - Argentina's cosmopolitan capital, known for movie theaters. Mickey Mouse was making his silver-screen debut, including in ""The Gallopin' Gaucho"" (1928). Whatever its origins, Mickey was a hit.By now, a ""peaceful coexistence"" reigns between Mickey and its ""US doppelganger"", said the smaller company's lawyer. This truce was hard-won. In 1998, Paraguay's Supreme Court issued its final ruling: Through decades of uninterrupted use, Mickey had acquired the right to be Mickey. The Mickey trademark had been registered in Paraguay since at least 1956 - and Pascual's descendants had since renewed it. However, Mickey's legal immunity in Paraguay, Blasco said, might not extend to selling its products abroad. ""We've never tried.""","Mickey is a household name to rival Disney across the little-touristed South American nation.

But it will take another week to gauge the complete impact of any post-debate bounce. The second assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Sunday will act as an unpredictable element with the focus going away from the debate,According to NYT's polling average, Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump by three percentage points nationwide.""The contest is even tighter in the critical battleground states, where no candidate leads by even a single percentage point in enough states to win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency,"" the NYT report said.The current leader in the poll average in five of the seven swing states — Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona — is ahead by just one point or less.According to NYT average, Kamala Harris gained about one point nationwide rising from a 1.7-point lead on Wednesday morning to a 2.7-point lead as of Monday morning. This is being attributed to the debate gains though Donald Trump claimed he won the debate.The gains for Kamala Harris might be more as most of the post-debate polls have come from online panels. They tend to shift less than other polls, as they poll highly engaged voters. Also, many people do not watch the debate on the television but they hear the post-debate coverage.

Gisele Pelicot case explained

What is going on in court?

Hundreds of people, mostly women, came out in the street in support of Gisele Pelicot, a woman who was allegedly drugged by her ex-husband (who was her husband at that time) for a decade and he recruited dozens of strangers to rape her which has shocked the nation.The feminist associations have called for some 30 gatherings on Saturday in cities ranging from Marseille to Paris, where on the Place de la Republique banners read “Support to Gisele” or “Shame Must Change Camp” or “Victims We believe you”.Pelicot has become France ’s symbol of the fight against sexual violence , AP New reported.A 72-year-old woman caught the attention of headlines when she filed a case against her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot of repeatedly raping her and enlisting strangers to abuse his heavily sedated wife in the couple’s home over the course of a decade.Since the beginning of the case Pelicot has to go through a rough path. She chose to go for a public trial to alert the public to sexual abuse and drug-induced blackouts.During this trial, she had to face 51 of her alleged rapists which is due to run until December. People are praised for her courage and composure.She also allowed journalists to use her full name in their articles or the other platforms and even gave a nod to the court to exhibit explicit videos recorded by her husband showing men engaging in sexual intercourse with her naked, inert body.Her bold and courageous behaviour is praised by the entire France nation and even foreign countries.In an open letter translated into English and published in the French newspaper Le Monde, journalist and author Helene Devynck thanked Pelicot for her bravery, echoing the feelings of many other French people.“You entered our lives like you entered the Avignon court, through the front door,” wrote Devynck, a figure of the French #MeToo movement. “It’s not just you, Gisele, that they’ve treated like a thing. They were telling us, all of us women, how insignificant we are. Your strength restores ours. Thank you for this immense gift.”According to the police, the abuse began in 2011 when the couple lived near Paris and continued after their move to Mazan. Dominique routinely drugged his wife and invited strangers to join him in assaulting her, often filming the encounters. Pelicot has no memory of the attacks but will see many of them played in court as dozens of defendants go on trial in Avignon, France, between now and December. The revelation of his abuse has destroyed a formerly tight-knit family, and the reason behind his actions remains unclear.Pelicot came to know about this horrifying act through the police who gave her the information.Dominique’s crimes came to light in 2020 when he was caught filming women up their skirts in a supermarket. Upon investigation, authorities uncovered the scale of the abuse. He and 50 other men are now on trial for aggravated rape, with the proceedings expected to last four months. The victims of these attacks included various individuals, from a fire brigade officer to a journalist, and while most participated only once, some returned multiple times.Pelicot will face the man with whom she shared her life for over 50 years and the father of their three children on Monday. Her lawyer has said she is planning on attending his testimony.Her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, for health reasons, has been exempted from attending the trial since last week. He is expected to testify on Monday or Tuesday, his lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, has said.Dominique has previously confessed to the crimes to investigators, but his court hearing will be crucial for the panel of judges to decide on the fate of the 50 other men accused of rape, reported AP news agency.Some defendants have claimed they believed a husband's consent for sexual intercourse was sufficient, while others said they were tricked by Dominique Pelicot into believing his wife was consenting.One lawyer representing six defendants has shocked the nation by arguing that ""there is rape and rape, and without intention, there is no rape.""","Gisele Pelicot, 72, has been accused of repeatedly raping her ex-husband Dominique.

The man did not fire at Trump, who was about 500 yards away golfing with a friend.Soon after the incident, Trump assured his followers that he was safe and well. “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” he posted on his platform ""Truth Social.""He later thanked the Secret Service and law enforcement for keeping him safe on what he called “an interesting day."" One lawmaker who spoke to Trump after the incident said he had joked about not being able to complete his round of gold.In an oblique reference to an earlier assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania, Trump later wrote, ""When you’re “hot” the lowlifes really shoot at you... and they try hitting from every angle! Never let the bastards get you down.""In separate statements, President Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris expressed relief that Trump was unharmed and said the was no place for political violence in the country, as activists on both sides accused the other of engendering the atmosphere conducive to such violence.Social media posts matching Routh's name showed him strongly supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia, and urging the US Congress to allow Americans to fight in the conflict.He had also been in the public eye a few times after encounters with the media and law enforcement. In an NYT interview in 2023, he said he was trying to recruit Afghan solders who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine. He had also been arrested in 2002 in Greensboro, North Carolina, after barricading himself inside a building with an automatic weapon.Tracked down by a tabloid, his estranged son Oran Routh told the Daily Mail that his father was a ""great dad"" and a ""nice guy"" and he hates Trump -- like “all reasonable people.”Although Trump praised the Secret Service and law enforcement for acting quickly to protect him, questions raged about how a potential assassin managed to get so close to the former president again.“There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened in Florida,” Republican lawmaker Elise Stefanik said in a statement.""Two assassination attempts in 60 days on a former President & the Republican nominee is unacceptable. The Secret Service must come to Congress tomorrow, tell us what resources are needed to expand the protective perimeter, & lets allocate it in a bipartisan vote the same day,"" California Democrat Ro Khanna tweeted.The Trump campaign responded by promoting the Republican candidate's message of unity and peace, while simultaneously directing supporters to a fundraising page.On the other hand, Democrats focused on gun control issues, questioning how a potential assassin with a criminal record was able to acquire an AK-47.","Man with a gun was lying in ambush at a Florida resort where the MAGA supremo was golfing.

Miami to Las Vegas: Which are the rudest cities in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/miami-to-las-vegas-which-are-the-rudest-cities-in-us/articleshow/113408612.cms,"Cities with the rudest people:

A new survey has pinpointed the rudest cities in America, highlighting which urban areas have earned reputations for the least polite behaviour. The survey interviewed residents in major cities across the United States, asking about various social behaviours such as rudeness in public spaces, lack of courtesy towards service staff, and general manners.By analysing these responses, the survey assigned a ""rudeness score"" to each city, revealing how they compare to others in terms of perceived impoliteness.On the flip side, the survey identified Omaha, NE, Minneapolis, MN, and San Diego, CA, as having the least rude residents in 2024. These cities were praised for their courteous behaviour and considerate public interactions.The survey also highlighted some notable trends. Older Americans are more likely to view newcomers as less polite than long-term residents. Additionally, about one in two Americans believe that rudeness in their city has increased. With heightened social tensions and the upcoming election, a significant number of residents are considering relocating due to the behaviour of their neighbours.Perceptions of rudeness can also be influenced by how long someone has lived in a city. Long-term residents often regard newcomers as less polite, and this sentiment tends to strengthen with age. Older individuals are particularly inclined to believe that recent arrivals are ruder than those who have lived in the city longer.Many people report that frequent encounters with rude behaviour lead them to believe their city has the rudest residents in the state. This frustration has led nearly 25% of people to consider relocating to escape ongoing negative interactions.1) Miami , FL2) Philadelphia , PA3) Tampa, FL4) Louisville, KY5) Oakland, CA6) Boston, MA7) Memphis, TN8) Las Vegas, NV9) Long Beach, CA10) Charlotte, NC","Miami, Philadelphia, Tampa and Louisville are the rudest cities in the U.S. Older Americans are more likely to view newcomers as less polite than long-term residents.

Rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs arrested: What are the cases against him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rapper-sean-diddy-combs-arrested-what-are-the-cases-against-him/articleshow/113409153.cms,"The Love Album

Rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was taken into custody in New York City on Monday night as part of a federal investigation into sex trafficking allegations. Although specific details of the charges have not been released, Combs’ legal team, led by Marc Agnifilo, has expressed disappointment in what they call an “unjust prosecution.”The arrest comes after a series of high-profile raids by Homeland Security Investigations agents on March 25.These raids targeted Combs’ properties in Los Angeles and Miami, raising questions about the nature of the federal investigation.Over the past year, Combs has faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and assault. The most recent lawsuit, filed on February 27, 2024, by producer Rodney ""Lil Rod"" Jones, claims that Combs sexually assaulted him repeatedly during the production of his album,. Jones alleges that Combs groped him without consent and attempted to coerce him into a homosexual relationship, asserting that Combs also owes him $50,000 for his work on the album.Earlier, on November 16, 2023, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend, filed a federal lawsuit accusing him of years of abuse, including rape, physical violence, and coercion into sexual acts with male escorts. The suit also alleged that Combs had destroyed Kid Cudi’s car to prevent him from seeing Cassie romantically. Combs has denied these claims, asserting that Cassie attempted to blackmail him for $30 million. The case was settled the following day, though Combs' attorney said that the settlement did not imply any admission of guilt.Five days after settling with Cassie, another lawsuit emerged from a former Syracuse University student who accused Combs of drugging, raping, and recording her in 1991. This lawsuit also claims that Combs showed the footage to others. Combs’ representatives have dismissed this as a “money grab.”Additionally, on November 23, 2023, an anonymous accuser filed a lawsuit under New York’s Adult Survivors Act, alleging that Combs and singer Aaron Hall raped her and a friend in the early 1990s, with Combs later assaulting her again.","Rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was taken into custody in New York City on Monday night as part of a federal investigation into sex trafficking allegations.

Agents sometimes warn people from getting too close to Trump, but the ex-prez has usually embraced a laid-back atmosphere, inviting people to pose for pictures or talk with him.

Hello and welcome back to US Presidential Election Top 10 – your daily guide to the American election season.The term "" Florida Man "" is a popular internet meme based on the notion that the state is home to people prone to irrational or outrageous behaviour. A CNN article on the meme suggested that the large number of bizarre incidents in Florida can be attributed to several factors: public records laws that allow journalists easy access to police reports, the state’s sizeable population, its wildly unpredictable weather, and, frankly, inadequate mental health funding.Here are a few recent examples:In fact, there’s even an internet game called the Florida Man Birthday Challenge, where you type your birthday followed by ""Florida Man"" to discover the wild adventure of a Florida resident on that day.Going forward, 15th September will read: “Florida Man tries to assassinate Donald Trump.”Of course, some pedants might point out that ""Florida Man"" doesn’t apply here, as Ryan Routh was most recently in Hawaii and spent much of his life in North Carolina, but you know what they say about Rome...While assassination attempts on US Presidents (and presidential candidates) are very much part of the nation’s history, a second attempt during a single election cycle is quite rare. This second attempt on Trump took place in his natural habitat – the golf course – where a man named Ryan Routh, armed with an AK-47 rifle, managed to get within 300-500 yards of where Trump was golfing.The last time Trump was shot at, it became an iconic image, after which Trump, in his usual humble style, boasted: “A lot of people say it’s the most iconic photo they’ve ever seen. They’re right, and I didn’t die. Usually, you have to die to have an iconic picture.”This time, he joked with his doctor that he was glad he “didn’t need his services today” and told Sean Hannity of Fox News that he was “disappointed not to be able to finish his putt,” noting that he was “even and had a birdie putt.”Interestingly, Routh has been in the news before. In 2023, he appeared in a New York Times profile about Americans who had travelled to Ukraine after Russia’s 2022 invasion. He claimed to have tried to recruit Afghan soldiers – who had fled the Taliban – to fight against Russia, and his social media profile makes it hard to pinpoint his exact political ideology.In 2016, he voted for Trump before becoming infuriated with him. By 2020, Routh was quite infatuated with Tulsi Gabbard , and more recently appeared to support a Ramaswamy-Haley Republican ticket. He wrote on X (formerly Twitter) when Ramaswamy dropped out: “You cannot quit. Why? You must stay on the ballot until the end. You must fight. You must keep giving speeches and push all the way to Election Day, no matter the results. Do not give in. Join Nikki and keep working. Never give up.”The first assassination attempt on Trump prompted the Democratic establishment to pull the plug on Joe Biden’s presidency.To be fair, we’re in completely uncharted waters here, with a second assassination attempt on a presidential nominee during one election cycle. America’s current broken kulturkampf makes it difficult to predict the outcome, especially as MAGA has fundamentally transformed the Republican Party. What was once a party of fiscal conservatism, respect for institutions, and commitment to free markets has shifted to a personality-driven populist movement centred around Trump. This shift has alienated many traditional Republicans, created deep internal divisions, and left the GOP grappling with an identity crisis. Before the assassination attempt, the Republican Party 's major attack was based on the false rumour that Haitians were eating cats in Springfield, Ohio.Here are the ten big developments for the day:","""Florida Man"" is a popular internet meme based on the notion that the state is home to people prone to irrational or outrageous behaviour.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) chief Imran Khan blamed the establishment, a euphemism for the military in Pakistan, for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur , from Islamabad.Speaking to journalists at Rawalpindi prison on Friday, Khan claimed that Gandapur “was disappeared” by elements within the establishment and everyone knows who is responsible for such actions, an indirect reference to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.He accused the military establishment of undermining the country’s institutions.According to Khan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM has remained silent over his disappearance out of loyalty and respect for the establishment. Khan warned the current situation in the country is reminiscent of “Yahya Khan Part II”.Imran also spoke on the current state of governance, claiming that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif required approval (from the military) for every decision and could soon face a similar fate — disappearance.Gandapur went missing from Islamabad during a crackdown on PTI last Monday, a day after he had delivered a hard-hitting speech at a rally demanding the release of Imran Khan. He later turned up in Peshawar. Gandapur, according to PTI, was invited by the military authorities to discuss law and order matters, but he was allegedly detained without consent. His statement that he would personally secure Khan’s release in the next two weeks triggered a sharp backlash in a country where the powerful military has directly ruled the country for three decades and wielded enormous political influence even when civilian governments were in office.","Imran Khan blames the establishment for the disappearance of his party’s chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Ali Amin Gandapur.

According to sources of Geo News, the chief minister was ""busy in various meetings"" in the federal capital following the party's power display.After his return, the opposition party maintained that Gandapur had a lengthy meeting with government representatives to discuss the state of law and order in the province and that he was not reachable because of cell phone jammers at the meeting site.Speaking to the members of the bar council today, the KP CM urged the organisations to change their ways, claiming that doing so would benefit the populace, the nation, and each individual.""Sit with the incarcerated PTI founder and resolve issues"" was another request he made.

Pakistani policeman kills blasphemy suspect inside police station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-policeman-kills-blasphemy-suspect-inside-police-station/articleshow/113288514.cms,"A police officer in Quetta , Pakistan, shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday. Khan had been arrested on Wednesday after being taken from an angry mob that accused him of insulting the Prophet Muhammad.The police officer responsible for the shooting has been arrested, according to police official Mohammad Khurram , who did not provide additional information.In Pakistan, accusations of blasphemy are common and can lead to mob violence and lynching, even if they are just rumors. The country's controversial blasphemy laws allow for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or Islamic religious figures, although no executions have been carried out.Before his arrest, local residents claimed Khan had used derogatory remarks against the prophet and went after him. After his arrest, a mob surrounded the police station, demanding that Khan be handed over to them for execution. One person threw a grenade at the station on Wednesday, and a group of Islamists briefly blocked a key road in the city, demanding punishment for Khan. The crowd eventually dispersed after officials managed to calm them down.Pakistan has seen an increase in attacks on blasphemy suspects in recent years. In June, a mob in Madyan lynched a tourist accused of desecrating the holy Quran, and in 2022, a mob in Punjab province attacked churches and homes of Christians after claiming they saw a local Christian and his friend desecrating pages from a Quran. The attack in Jaranwala drew nationwide condemnation, but Christians say the men linked to the violence have not yet been put on trial.In 2011, a policeman killed a former governor of Punjab province after accusing him of blasphemy. The officer, Mumtaz Qadri , was later sentenced to death and hanged, but support for him grew after his execution, with tens of thousands attending his funeral in Rawalpindi. Many in Punjab still consider him a martyr today.Quetta, a conservative city in southwestern Pakistan, is also the capital of the restive Balochistan province, where militant groups stage near-daily attacks and separatists have waged a decades-long insurgency against the government in Islamabad.","A police officer shot and killed a blasphemy suspect named Syed Khan inside a police station on Thursday.

The other is Pakistan.News of the suspension was relayed to UN agencies right before the September immunization campaign was due to start. No reason was given for the suspension, and no one from the Taliban-controlled government was immediately available for comment.A top official from the World Health Organization said it was aware of discussions to move away from house-to-house vaccinations and instead have immunizations in places like mosques.The WHO has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year, all but two in the south of the country. That’s up from six cases in 2023.“The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is aware of the recent policy discussions on shifting from house-to-house polio vaccination campaigns to site-to-site vaccination in parts of Afghanistan,” said Dr Hamid Jafari from the WHO. “Partners are in the process of discussing and understanding the scope and impact of any change in current policy.”Anti-polio campaigns in neighboring Pakistan are regularly marred by violence. Militants target vaccination teams and police assigned to protect them, falsely claiming that the campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.","Afghanistan is one of two countries in which the spread of the potentially fatal, paralyzing disease has never been stopped.

'Rough patches' in ties resolved after India's troop pullout: Male,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/rough-patches-in-ties-resolved-after-indias-troop-pullout-male/articleshow/113374037.cms,"NEW DELHI: Misunderstandings with India have been resolved through the latter's withdrawal of troops from the Maldives , the Indian Ocean neighbour said as India prepares to host President Mohamed Muizzu for his first official visit this month.Ties between the two nations have seen dramatic improvement since India replaced its military personnel, who manned Indian govt's relief choppers and aircraft, with civilian staff, leading to resumption of high-level visits.Muizzu had insisted on Indian troop withdrawal saying he would not allow any country to interfere with or undermine the Maldives' sovereignty.However, the thaw in ties with India has not come at the expense of the archipelago nation's reorientation towards China, as obvious from the agreement it signed last week to boost trade and investment ties with Beijing and also continued talks to strengthen defence cooperation between the two countries.Speaking about Maldives' ties with India and China, while on a visit to Sri Lanka, foreign minister Moosa Zameer admitted relations with India had faced challenges, following Muizzu's efforts to expel Indian military personnel. ""At the start of our govt, we did have some rough patches (with India), you know,"" Zameer was quoted as saying by a Maldivian newspaper. He added these ""misunderstandings"" had been resolved following the repatriation of Indian troops. Interestingly, the day Muizzu's office announced his visit to India, the Maldivian media also reported that two junior ministers who had made derogatory remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year had resigned from the govt.""We have good relations with both China and India, and both countries continue to support Maldives,"" he said, while thanking both countries for their support at a time international credit agencies were warning about the country's financial health.Zameer said that the Maldives has no plans to seek an IMF bailout , dismissing the current economic challenges faced by his country as ""temporary."" He said, ""We have bilateral partners who are very sensitive to our needs and our situation. I seriously don't think it is a time where we will be right now engaging with the IMF. The issue that we have is very temporary because currently, we are having a dip in reserves.""China was reported this week to have pulled the Maldives from the brink of a financial crisis with a bilateral agreement that will apparently act a framework for cooperation in ""promoting the settlement of current account transactions and direct investments in local currencies"".""China will, as always, provide support and assistance to the economic and social development of the Maldives within its capability,"" said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson.","Ties between the two nations have seen dramatic improvement since India replaced its military personnel, who manned Indian govt's relief choppers and aircraft, with civilian staff.
