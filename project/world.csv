"'Tough, capable ...': How US President Joe Biden describes Kamala Harris as he says 'time for younger voices’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shes-experienced-tough-capable-how-president-joe-biden-describes-kamala-harris-as-he-says-time-for-younger-voices/articleshow/112001735.cms,"In a heartfelt Oval Office address on Wednesday, President Joe Biden praised Vice President Kamala Harris , the presumptive Democratic nominee for the upcoming presidential election , calling her “tough” and “capable.” This address marked Biden’s first public comments since his decision to withdraw from the 2024 race and endorse Harris.“She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable.She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now, the choice is up to you, the American people,” Biden said, emphasizing his confidence in Harris as she steps into the role of the Democratic frontrunner.Biden went on to recognize, “there’s a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes — younger voices.”Biden's speech focused on the future of the country, with the president expressing gratitude for Harris’s contributions and urging voters to support her in the upcoming election. “In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America’s future. I made my choice. I made my views known. I would like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris,” Biden said, reiterating his endorsement.The president’s address came after a period of internal party pressure and scrutiny over his age and health, particularly following a less-than-stellar debate performance. Biden chose to sidestep discussions of these concerns, instead pledging to continue advancing his policy agenda during his remaining term.“I’ll be working on foreign and domestic policy,” Biden confirmed, highlighting his commitment to driving his administration’s goals forward despite his impending departure from the presidential race.In closing, Biden urged voters to consider Harris’s strengths and capabilities as they make their choice between her and former President Donald Trump.Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election — which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent — was “ridiculous.”Jean-Pierre said Biden has “no regrets” about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.Trump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president “was barely understandable, and sooo bad!”",President Joe Biden praised Vice President Kamala Harris in an Oval Office address on Wednesday.

'Miracle': Gaza baby saved from dead mother's womb after Israeli airstrike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/miracle-gaza-baby-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-after-israeli-airstrike/articleshow/112001389.cms,"Women and children suffer the most in the wars men start. A heart-wrenching incident in Gaza has once again highlighted this, where a baby boy survived after his mother died in an Israeli air strike.Ola Al-Kurd, nine months pregnant, eagerly waited for the arrival of her baby, hoping to bring new life to Gaza amidst a war that has claimed the lives of over 39,000 Palestinians and devastated much of the enclave.""She wanted to hold her child and fill our home with his presence,"" Ola's father Adnan Al-Kurd said. Tragically, Ola never experienced that precious moment. On July 19, an Israeli airstrike hit the family home in Al-Nuseirat, central Gaza, according to her father Adnan Al-Kurd. The explosion threw Ola several floors down, causing her death in the house that sheltered women, children, and the elderly.Miraculously, her baby and husband survived, with the latter being hospitalized. ""It's a miracle that the fetus stayed alive inside of her when she was martyred (died),"" Adnan Al-Kurd remarked, reflecting on a photo of his daughter's graduation.The explosion, like countless others, claimed the lives of multiple family members, a daily occurrence in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in response to a cross-border attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on October 7 last year.Despite numerous attempts by mediators from the United States, Qatar, and Egypt, a ceasefire remains difficult to achieve, making it highly improbable that Israeli airstrikesand shelling will stop in the near future.Against all odds, surgeons at Al Awda hospital in Nuseirat, where Ola was initially taken after the strike, successfully delivered the newborn, Malek Yassin. The baby was then transferred to Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where an aunt gently touched his face as he rested in an incubator.""Thank God, this baby's life was saved and he is now alive and well,"" news agency Reuters reported doctor Khalil Al-Dakran as saying at the hospital, where many medical facilities have been destroyed during the nine-month war.Al-Kurd looks at photos of his three late children killed in the Gaza war , noting that baby Yassin shares the same blond hair as his deceased uncle Omar. ""I go visit him everyday. He is a part of me,"" he said.Infants who survive the relentless Israeli bombardment find no respite as the conflict continues to wreak havoc in the densely populated Gaza Strip.""We are in fact facing very great difficulties in the nursery department,"" said Al-Dakran, citing a shortage of essential medication and supplies, as well as concerns that the hospital generator could fail at any moment due to fuel scarcity.Throughout impoverished Gaza, hospitals have been demolished or severely damaged during the war, which erupted when Hamas-led fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages, according to Israeli accounts.Israel countered with an air and ground offensive that has claimed the lives of more than 39,000 Palestinians, as reported by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and has flattened much of the coastal territory.""What is the fault of this child to start his life under difficult and very bad circumstances, deprived of the most basic necessities of life?"" Dakran questioned.At least 16,000 children of Gaza have lost their lives in the Israel-Hamas conflict so far.","Ola Al-Kurd, nine months pregnant, was killed in an Israeli air strike on July 19.

'Our nation needs your leadership once again': Kamala Harris at a historically Black sorority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/our-nation-needs-your-leadership-once-again-kamala-harris-at-a-historically-black-sorority/articleshow/112001538.cms,"NEW DELHI: Vice president Kamala Harris addressed members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta on Wednesday, emphasising the need for their support in her bid for the presidency in November. Speaking three days after launching her campaign, Harris contrasted two visions for America and emphasised her commitment to the future with the support of the sorority.""In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,"" Harris said.""And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.""Indiana has not supported a Democratic presidential candidate for nearly 16 years. However, Harris, who is of Black and South Asian descent, spoke to a group already motivated by her historic candidacy. Her campaign aims to broaden its coalition through this support.Harris expressed her gratitude to the women present for their role in electing her vice president and Joe Biden as President. ""And now, in this moment, our nation needs your leadership once again,"" she said.Challenges remain for Democrats, as the nation faces frustration over high prices following a spike in inflation. Additionally, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, survived a recent assassination attempt, further energising his base. The memo expressed more optimism compared to the outlook after the 81-year-old Biden's poor debate performance in June. Biden withdrew from the race on Sunday.Harris mentioned that Biden would address the nation on Wednesday regarding his decision to step aside and praised him as a 'leader with a bold vision.""We are all deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation,"" she said before contrasting the current administration's agenda with Trump's.""These extremists want to take us back, but we are not going back,"" she stated. ""All across our nation we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights.""She listed the rights in question, including the freedom to vote, to be safe from gun violence, to love openly, to 'learn and acknowledge our true and full history,' and the freedom 'of a woman to make decisions about her body and not have her government telling her what to do.'Trump delivered a series of attacks on Harris during a rally in Charlotte, labelling her his 'new victim to defeat.' He accused her of misleading the public about Biden's health and called her ""Lyin' Kamala,"" while mispronouncing her first name. He further described her as 'the most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.'Harris later traveled to Houston on Wednesday, where she visited the city's emergency operations center to discuss recovery efforts following Hurricane Beryl and to thank emergency personnel. She watched Biden’s Oval Office speech from Houston.On Thursday, she will address the national convention of the American Federation of Teachers, which has endorsed her candidacy.The campaign plans to focus on key states known as the Blue Wall – Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania – to secure the needed 270 electoral votes. Harris also aims to be competitive in other states, including North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.For Democrats, the support of Black women could be crucial in November, and Harris has shown signs of galvanizing their support.During the 2020 election, AP VoteCast found that Black women made up just 7% of the electorate. However, 93% of them voted for Biden, contributing to his narrow victories in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.Following Harris's campaign announcement, around 90,000 Black women joined a campaign video call on Sunday night. This show of support highlights their enthusiasm for Harris, an alumnus of Howard University and sister of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She has made Beyonce's song ""Freedom"" her walk-on music at events.","Kamala Harris addressed members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta on Wednesday.

""Kamala Harris and the Biden administration are destroying our country,"" Lace argued. ""The last thing I’m concerned about is whether my comments about Kamala’s rise to power are controversial.""The reaction to Lace’s comments has been swift and harsh, with widespread condemnation from both the public and media. Critics have voiced their disapproval across social media platforms, prompting Lace to respond with a sarcastic post on X (formerly Twitter), questioning whether his remarks were ""going too far"" or ""right over the target.""As the debate continues, Lace remains resolute in his stance, while the video clip of his Fox Business appearance continues to fuel controversy and discussion.","Conservative commentator Alec Lace has ignited a firestorm of controversy with his recent remarks about Vice President Kamala Harris.

STAROKOSTIANTYNIV: With its castle, medieval tower and river-side beach, the western Ukrainian tourist town of Starokostiantyniv doesn't seem an obvious target for Russian missile and drone strikes.But a major airbase across the Sluch river has put the town firmly in Russia 's sights -- and locals fear the imminent arrival of F-16 fighter jets in Ukraine will only intensify the bombardments .""We're super nervous about the arrival of the F-16s. If they park them here, the number of attacks will only go up,"" said Olena Shpachenko, a guide at the town's history museum, located inside the 17th-century castle.Kyiv says the advanced US-made fighters, some already being transferred to Ukraine, will help it better protect its skies and compete with Russia for air superiority.Russia has intensified its bombing of Ukrainian air bases -- including Starokostiantyniv, home to the seventh tactical aviation bridge -- and pledged to target F-16s.In a show of force earlier this month, Moscow hit three Ukrainian airfields in as many days.""From here we have a good view of the explosions,"" said Shpachenko, gesturing out of the castle window.""We hear them as if we were right there,"" she told AFP.For more than two years, she has watched the enemy's explosive drones and supersonic missiles pepper the sky at night.Pointing to a row of partially damaged ancient religions icons hanging over her desk, she said the air base was ""so close, the missiles can make it all the way over here.""Ukraine and its Western partners have not given any official indication of where the F-16s will be based.A Western defence industry source told AFP the Starokostiantyniv airfield -- equipped with Soviet-era partially underground shelters -- is an ideal candidate.Residents, used to the roar of jets even before the war , say tensions in the city are ratcheting up.""The authorities held a large-scale exercise in the event of a nuclear strike. They believe the base is a prime target for Moscow,"" said Shpachenko.""We pray that the F-16s don't wind up here,"" she added, looking anxiously outside once more.Even if Ukraine's air defences intercept Russian missiles targeting the base, ""debris will rain down on the city,"" she feared.She has forbidden her daughters from playing outside.Despite being hundreds of kilometres from the front lines, the war literally hangs over the town that locals call ""Starkon"".The smell of powder and kerosene punctuate the air and the sky is strewn with black contrails left behind by the jets.Large tanks of jet fuel are hidden in the surrounding woods, where groups of soldiers were playing cards in a moment of respite.The town's lights are turned off at night and the troops scour the sky, ready to shoot down drones with machine guns.Anatoliy, the commander of a mobile anti-aircraft unit, said Russia had stepped up attacks over the past month.""The Russians are now using cluster munitions with the aim of damaging the jets on the ground,"" he said, puffing on a cigarette.The explosives can target areas covering thousands of square metres with a single drop.Asked if he thought the escalation was due to the possible arrival of the F-16s, Anatoliy hesitated, before smiling: ""The Russians, those fools, will never guess where they are.""The war has also taken its toll on the town's previously vibrant tourism industry.""The soldiers, the attacks... it discourages people from coming. We've even had drone debris fall on the beach, Shpachenko said.One family of vacationers ""heard a plane flying close to the ground, dropped their stuff and ran to the castle,"" she said.Many of the Ukrainians who came to Starokostiantyniv after fleeing their homes in the east left as soon as they heard the first roar of a fighter plane.""The desire to survive is stronger than the need for rest,"" said Shpachenko.Despite the danger, some locals were outside, relaxing in the shade of the weeping willows or on the small beach.Valery, in his 70s, has been here so long he knows the engine noises of the different planes by heart.He still goes for a morning swim in the river at the foot of the castle every day.""I'm afraid of the arrival of the F-16s.

Murdoch's youngest daughters, Chloe and Grace, from his third wife, Wendi Deng, do not have voting rights in the trust.In court, Murdoch is arguing that having Lachlan Murdoch run the company without interference from his more politically moderate siblings - James, Elisabeth and Prudence Murdoch - will help preserve its conservative editorial stance, thus protecting the commercial value for all his heirs, the report said.Fox Corp, News Corp, and Murdoch's lawyer did not respond to Reuters requests for comment while the lawyer for the three children involved in the legal battle could not immediately be reached.Fox News continues to be the number one US cable news network, playing an influential role in US politics, particularly among Republicans who prize Fox's conservative-leaning audience.Murdoch was that worried that a ""lack of consensus"" among his four children ""would impact the strategic direction at both companies including a potential reorientation of editorial policy and content,"" the report said, adding that he also wishes to hand Lachlan Murdoch ""permanent"" and ""exclusive"" control over the company, citing the court's decision.","Murdoch is trying to expand Lachlan Murdoch's voting power in the Murdoch Family Trust to secure a majority and ensure that he cannot be challenged by the siblings.

US election: Kamala Harris’ Indian heritage is deeply felt if little advertised,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-kamala-harris-indian-heritage-is-deeply-felt-if-little-advertised/articleshow/112001982.cms,"To most who saw the quotation being circulated this week as a meme, it was just something funny that Kamala Harris said in a speech in 2023: “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?”But for many Indians and Indian Americans , the line, which Harris attributed to her mother, is layered with extra meaning. Tamil Nadu, the South Indian state where her mother’s family is from, is one of India’s largest growers of coconut palms.It’s also the kind of thing an Indian parent might say.Harris, the vice president and Democratic candidate for president, neither advertises nor shies away from her Indian heritage . She slips in references to it. She also deploys it strategically.Last year, Harris spoke of her deep personal connection to India at a luncheon in Washington for Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, whom the United States has been courting. Harris’ introduction to the concepts of equality, freedom and democracy came from her Indian grandfather, she said, with whom she went on long walks during her visits to Chennai, India.“It is these lessons I learned at a very young age that first inspired my interest in public service,” she said.Harris grew up in California, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, and she identifies as Black and South Asian.In India, her sudden elevation to likely presidential nominee after President Joe Biden’s exit from the race has added to a general sense of pride in the country’s rise in global stature. But Indian news coverage has not focused much on her Indian heritage. While Harris maintains family ties in Tamil Nadu and has talked about her visits every other year to India as a child, she has not made any official trips to India as vice president, and before that had not visited since 2009.Her candidacy resonates more in the Indian American community, even if Harris is seen as identifying more as Black than as Indian. Many Indian Americans see Harris as another example of the diaspora’s success and influence, including in politics, with growing numbers of Indian American lawmakers and candidates at the highest levels. (The five members of the House with Indian roots sometimes use the nickname “samosa caucus.”)When Biden chose Harris as his running mate in 2020, “there was something other than pride,” said Shoba Viswanathan, who oversees civic engagement for Indiaspora, a nonprofit. “She normalizes us, in a way; she is a visible representation of Indians in public service.”If she wins the White House, Harris seems unlikely to vastly reshape American ties to India. She does not share the same personal relationship with Modi that he was widely seen to have with her opponent in the presidential race, Donald Trump. But she would be likely to continue the Biden administration’s broad effort to bring India closer as a counterweight to China, foreign policy experts said.Domestically, her expected nomination would be unlikely to significantly alter the voting pattern of Indian Americans, who already overwhelmingly lean Democratic, said Sanjoy Chakravorty, an author of a 2016 book on the rise of Indian Americans.“Indian Americans are one of the most consistent Democratic voters of any ethnic group,” said Chakravorty, a professor at Temple University. “Will they be proud of Kamala Harris? For sure. Will they look to Trump with fear? For sure. Will they vote for the Democratic Party? Guaranteed.”While many Indian Americans support Modi, a conservative Hindu nationalist, as a driver of India’s ascent, they are more politically liberal in the American context. Many of them worry about gun violence and immigration policy as well as racist or religious attacks, and they tend to view the Democratic Party as better on those issues, Chakravorty said.Harris’ campaign could benefit financially from Indian Americans, who represent a little over 1% of the U.S. population but are among the wealthiest and most influential diaspora communities. In 2020, the community poured millions of dollars into the Biden Victory Fund, galvanized by Harris’ selection as Biden’s vice presidential pick.In India, much of the focus on Harris’ candidacy has been about where she might take American foreign policy. If she is elected, it could do a lot to ease India’s long-standing suspicions of U.S. intentions in the region, said Gautam Mukunda, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership.The idea that “if the Americans are willing to put an Indian American in the White House, they can’t be that bad” could bring the countries closer and alter a relationship that has been more transactional and less about shared values, Mukunda said.Modi, a consummate politician with a flair for showmanship who is determined to transform India into a superpower, did not hesitate to advertise his relationship with Trump when he was in the White House.In 2020, Modi laid out a grand welcome for Trump’s presidential visit to India, arranging for a massive crowd to greet him. The previous year, the two leaders shared the stage at an event in Texas called “Howdy, Modi!” Thousands of Indian Americans had gathered to cheer Modi’s election win that year.Harris and Modi have displayed no such chemistry. In 2019, Harris supported an Indian American House member, Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., when Jayapal urged the Indian government to restore phone lines and internet connections in the disputed territory of Kashmir after Modi abruptly revoked its special status.The resolution angered the Modi government. India’s external affairs minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, refused to attend a meeting with the House Foreign Affairs Committee because Jayapal would be present.If she wins in November, Harris will face a delicate task in navigating the relationship with Modi, said Shubhajit Roy, diplomatic editor of the newspaper The Indian Express.She will have to balance “India’s record on human rights, her thinking on which has been pretty pronounced, and its growing role as a regional and aspirational power that provides an important counterweight to the common China threat,” Roy said. So far, American leaders have tilted much more toward wooing Modi, remaining largely silent as he has demonized India’s 200 million Muslims.For now, though, Harris is focused on her presidential campaign. Her supporters, including Indian Americans, have taken up a social media chant: “In Sanskrit, Kamala means ‘lotus.’ In America, it means POTUS” — president of the United States.They have also embraced the “coconut tree” quote, which Harris used while speaking at an event in May 2023. In making the point that people don’t exist in silos, she borrowed an idiom from her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who was a breast cancer researcher and died in 2009 at age 71.“My mother used to — she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’” She added, “You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”Initially used by Republicans to mock and exoticize Harris, the line has since become a rallying cry for her supporters, who have gleefully embraced coconut memes, coconut emojis and piña coladas.To Mukunda, the Harvard research fellow, the memes show a growing acceptance of diversity by many Americans that goes beyond the color of a person’s skin to include cultural references and idioms.Coconuts have played another role in Harris’ life. When she was running for California attorney general, Harris asked an aunt who lived in Chennai to break coconuts at a Hindu temple for luck. Coconuts are considered auspicious in Hinduism and are regularly offered to the gods at religious ceremonies.","Kamala Harris is the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father.

Full text: Joe Biden's speech explaining why he withdrew from 2024 US presidential race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/full-text-joe-bidens-speech-explaining-why-he-withdrew-from-2024-us-presidential-race/articleshow/112001726.cms,"""Americans are going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division,"" Biden said.

I revere this office, but I love my country more.

It’s been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of

democracy

, which is at stake, I think it’s more important than any title.

I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people, but this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It’s about you, your families, your futures. It’s about we the people, and we can never forget that. And I never have.

I’ve made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come.

America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy? In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. Can we do that? Does character in public life still matter?

I believe you know the answer to these questions because I know you, the American people, and I know this, we are a great nation because we are a good people.

When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. And the truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us, and those of us who cherish that cause cherish it so much, a cause of American democracy itself must unite to protect it.

You know, in recent weeks it’s become clear to me that I needed to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America’s future all merited a second term, but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy, and that includes personal ambition.

So I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That’s the best way to unite our nation. I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life, but there’s also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices, and that time and place is now.

Over the next six months, I’ll be focused on doing my job as president. That means I’ll continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I’ll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose. I’ll keep calling out hate and extremism, make it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I’m going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis, is the existential threat.

And I will keep fighting for my for my cancer moonshot, so we can end cancer as we know it because we can do it. And I’m going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy, Supreme Court reform. You know, I will keep working to ensure America remains strong and secure and the leader of the free world.

I’m the first president in this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world. We’ll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We’ll keep NATO stronger, and I’ll make it more powerful and more united than at any time in all of our history. I’ll keep doing the same for allies in the Pacific.

You know, when I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. That’s not the case anymore. And I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war.

We’re also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world. You know, we’ve come so far since my inauguration. On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter — we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities, peril and possibilities. We were in the grip of the worst pandemic in the century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War, but we came together as Americans, and we got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.

Today, we have the strongest economy in the world, creating nearly 16 million new jobs — a record. Wages are up, inflation continues to come down, the racial wealth gap is the lowest it’s been in 20 years. We’re literally rebuilding our entire nation, urban, suburban, rural and tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America.

We’re leading the world again in chips and science and innovation. We finally beat Big Pharma after all these years, to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, and I’m going to keep fighting to make sure we lower the cost for everyone, not just seniors.

More people have health care today in America than ever before. And I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who were exposed to toxic materials. You know, the most significant climate law ever, ever in the history of the world, the first major gun safety law in 30 years. And today, violent crime rate is at a 50-year low.

We’re also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office. And I’ve kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I also kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and be a president for all Americans.

That’s what I’ve done. I ran for president four years ago because I believed, and still do, that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake and that’s still the case. America is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.

It’s the most powerful idea in the history of the world. That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident. We’re all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. We’ve never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we’ve never walked away from it either and I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.

In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America’s future. I made my choice. I made my views known. I would like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris. She’s experienced, she’s tough, she’s capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.

When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin. It’s hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the bust of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez. When Ben Franklin was asked as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or republic, Franklin’s response was “a republic, if you can keep it.” A republic if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.

My fellow Americans, it’s been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States, but here I am. That’s what’s so special about America.

We are a nation of promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. I’ve given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others. I’ve been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.

The great thing about America is here kings and dictators do not rule, the people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep faith, keep the faith and remember who we are. We’re the United States of America and there’s simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.

So let’s act together, preserve our democracy. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

Transcript of President Joe Biden ’s address to the nation on July 24, 2024:My fellow Americans, I’m speaking to you tonight from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. In this sacred space, I’m surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents. Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation.

Kamala rakes in over $250 million in 3 days since Biden's exit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-rakes-in-over-250-million-in-3-days-since-bidens-exit/articleshow/112001194.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Kamala Harris presidential campaign has raked in more than $250 million in political contributions in the three days since Prez Joe Biden bowed out of the race, a staggering spike that is confounding pundits who thought she would be a weak candidate and Trump would trump her on the money front.Explanations for the windfall in political funding, including over $100 million in the 24 hours since Biden bequeathed the nomination to her, include pent-up energy and money from donors who wanted Biden to bow out.Many Democrat donors dismayed with Biden's debate debacle had held back contributions - in what was dubbed a ""Dembargo"" - to pressure the prez into quitting the race. His exit appears to have uncorked the money spigot.While big donors from Hollywood and Silicon Valley account for a large portion of the windfall, the Harris campaign is also thrilled that 60% of the contributions have come from first-time donors, an indication that a new cohort of voters who did not give to Biden have emerged from the political base. The Harris campaign also reported a surge in volunteer sign-ups, enrolling 58,000 since she replaced the prez at the top of the ticket, a sign-up rate that one report said is 232 times larger than Biden campaign's daily average. This would suggest that many youngsters who had distanced themselves from the battle of geriatrics are now enthused by the much younger Harris, who is 59, and are ""drivin' up the jiving"".Harris also appears to have staunched the money flow to the Trump campaign from Silicon Valley, previously a Democratic redoubt where some principals like Elon Musk decamped to the Republican side expressing dismay over liberal wokism. On Tuesday, Musk dialed back Trump's claim that he (Musk) was going to contribute $45 million a month to his campaign, saying, he doesn't subscribe to ""a cult of personality"". Other Silicon Valley honchos said they are now opening their chequebooks after holding back for weeks because of the uncertainty over whether Biden would continue.One Google executive who plans to hold a fundraiser for Harris - who was born in and grew up in Oakland in California's Bay Area - told Washington Post that a lot of people in the tech world were ""paralysed in the last few weeks"" and ""now we are seeing the floodgates have opened"". But Trump campaign officials maintain it is just a brief bump arising from Harris' elevation, and the industry's mistrust of govt and regulations will be hard to overcome.Incidentally, while California and New York fork out much of the campaign lolly, most of it will be spend - on ads, maintaining campaign offices, voter outreach etc. - in the so-called battleground states that will determine the poll outcome. They include ""Blue Wall"" states - Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - and the ""Sun Belt"" stretch - Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina, all of which Trump and Harris will be traversing soon.","Kamala Harris campaign has raked in more than $250 million in political contributions in the three days since Prez Joe Biden bowed out of the race.

Salman Rushdie's attacker faces federal terrorism charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/salman-rushdies-attacker-faces-federal-terrorism-charges/articleshow/112001216.cms,"Hadi Matar , the 26-year-old American of Lebanese descent accused of attempting to kill author Salman Rushdie , has been charged with terrorism for allegedly acting on behalf of Hezbollah , according to recently unsealed documents on Wednesday, news agency AFP reported.The indictment, dated July 17, was only unsealed this week. Rushdie, 77, suffered severe injuries, including the loss of sight in his right eye, after being stabbed about ten times by a knife-wielding assailant at an arts event in New York in August 2022.Attorney General Merrick Garland said, ""We allege that in attempting to murder Salman Rushdie in New York in 2022, Hadi Matar committed an act of terrorism in the name of Hezbollah.""Matar could be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted on the federal terrorism charges brought against him.FBI Director Christopher Wray emphasized that Matar tried to execute a fatwa endorsed by Hezbollah calling for Rushdie's death. Hezbollah is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, Britain, and most members of the Arab League.In addition to the previous charges brought by the state of New York for the 2022 stabbing attack, Matar has now been indicted by a grand jury on three counts, including attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The Indian-born author, now a naturalized American, had faced death threats since his 1988 novel ""The Satanic Verses"" was declared blasphemous by Iran's supreme leader. In 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for Muslims to kill Rushdie.

'Laffin Kamala' lights up Gen Z & social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/laffin-kamala-lights-up-gen-z-social-media/articleshow/112001197.cms,"WASHINGTON: Long geared towards attacking Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee for the 2024 prez elections, the Trump campaign is having to retool its ammunition against Kamala Harris . It's proving to be tough, with several duds having to be discarded. The age issue has gone out of the window now that Donald Trump is seen as the doddering old man. They've to be careful with the gender issue lest it upset female voters, who incidentally are greater in number than male voters in US.East Coast elite doesn't work because she is from California, and Trump himself is one - a Newyorker when he is not in New Jersey or Florida, milking Middle America's discontent. Nor is she a Washington insider or ""swamp creature"" that Trump pledged to defeat but couldn't in four years in the White House. That leaves personal attacks and racist dog whistles, and even that is not going well.Trump's efforts to disparage the vibrant laughter of ""laffin' Kamala"" as he calls her - some of his supporters dubbed her Kackala - has backfired spectacularly after her young supporters made celebratory mash-ups of her hearty laugh and dance moves set to music viral. One of the more popular memes showed a video cut of Harris laughing and dancing to British singer Charli XCX song from the album ""Brat"", a nightclub favorite that underscores the aspiration of Gen-Z (those in the age group of 12- 27), which sees the term as an embrace of authenticity and self-confidence, not a badly behaved child.The Harris campaign quickly co-opted the ""brat"" colour - the very specific shade of chartreuse or lime green - adding it to the coconut emoji that has already become part of the Kamala iconography. Kamala herself is aware of the Trump flock's effort to deride her hearty laughter, explaining in one interview that she has inherited it from her mother Shyamala. ""I grew up with a bunch of women who laughed from the belly. I'm never gonna be...tee hee hee"" she said, imitating a snicker.MAGA radicals efforts to stir up Kamala's relationship with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown nearly 30 years ago has misfired, not that it was ever potent given Trump's own peccadilloes. Brown, who is now 90, wrote a short comment when she ran for prez in 2019 under the headline: Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what? ""It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker. And I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco. I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians,"" Brown said.Then came the clincher which elevated Kamala in the eyes of many: ""The difference is that Harris is the only one who, after I helped her, sent word that I would be indicted if I ""so much as jaywalked"" while she was DA"" Brown wrote, adding, ""That's politics for ya.""","The age issue has gone out of the window now that Donald Trump is seen as the doddering old man.

It stated that while the authorities can ensure that the kanwariyas are served vegetarian food that meets their preferences and hygienic standards, potentially through orders under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the Street Vendors Act, 2014, the police cannot usurp the legal powers vested in the competent authority without a legal foundation.(With agency inputs)","US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, addressed the issue of ""nameplates in Kanwar Yatra "" on Thursday, alleging that the Supreme Court's order was not currently in effect.

'Tough and capable' Kamala Harris

In a solemn address from the Oval Office on Thursday, President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race , marking the end of his political career. Framing the upcoming election as a critical juncture for the nation, Biden in his speech said that his choice was driven by a profound commitment to democracy .'Pass the torch ...“I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,” Biden said. He made his decision after days of soul-searching and agonizing over internal polling that predicted he could lose against Republican Donald Trump in November and drag down fellow Democrats with him.“I revere this office, but I love my country more. It’s been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in defense of democracy, which is at stake – and is more important than any title – I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people,” Biden declared.Biden's speech began with a heartfelt expression of his love for America and the honor he felt in serving as its president. “This sacred task of perfecting our union – it’s not about me. It’s about you, your families, your future. It’s about we the people,” he said, emphasizing that the work of the nation transcends any individual leader.This address marked Biden’s first public appearance since the announcement of his decision not to seek reelection . He highlighted the importance of the upcoming election, portraying it as a choice between progress and regression, unity and division.""America’s going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide: Do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect? Freedom, justice and democracy?” Biden posed these questions to the nation, expressing confidence in the American people's inherent goodness and their ability to make the right choices.Biden reiterated his commitment to honesty and truth, qualities he vowed to uphold when he took office. “We are a great nation because we are good people. When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. The truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us. We must unite to protect it,” he urged.Biden praised his Vice President Kamala Harris — the presumptive nominee for the Democratic presidential ticket — as ""tough"" and ""capable"" in his address to the nation from the Oval Office.""She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now, the choice is up to you, the American people,"" Biden said, just days after withdrawing from the election race and endorsing Harris.The speech was the president’s first public comments since passing the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee . He did not dwell on the concerns about his age or health that caused him to relent to pressure from within his own party after a listless and halting debate performance.Instead, he pledged to continue working on foreign and domestic policy, seeking to advance his agenda even as a lame duck president for the next 180 days. He said of Harris that she is “experienced, she’s tough; she’s capable” and urged voters to pick her over former President Donald Trump.","Biden made his decision after days of soul-searching and agonizing over internal polling that predicted he could lose against Republican Donald Trump in November. “I revere this office, but I love my country more.

This camp will continue till the release of the PTI founder,"" he said.Khan has been imprisoned at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for almost a year upon his conviction in three cases - the Toshakhana corruption case, the cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case -- in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.Though Khan had secured bail or his conviction was set aside, he has not been released.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan.

Despite dozens of cases against Khan, he has refused to soften his tone and instead routinely criticise the Army leadership.PTI leaders have also kept up the pressure on the government by calling it illegal which allegedly came to power through fraudulent elections.","Pakistani authorities sealed the central office of Imran Khan's party here over violation of safety standards.

She claimed that Khan's residence in Lahore, Zaman Park, had become a ""training hub for terrorists "", where petrol bombs were made and attacks on the state were planned.The May 9 riots erupted across Pakistan after Khan was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a corruption case. Hundreds of PTI workers and senior leaders were arrested for their involvement in the violence and attacks on military installations, including the Jinnah House, ISI building in Faisalabad, and General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.Maryam also accused the PTI of conspiring to default the country, writing letters to the International Monetary Fund, waving cipher messages, and disrespecting memorials as part of a larger plot. She called for strict action against the PTI under the Constitution and law, citing national security and interests.The chief minister further criticized the PTI for alienating friendly countries, making baseless accusations against the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and disrupting Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit in 2014 by staging a sit-in. She recounted PTI's previous attacks on Parliament, PTV, and the Prime Minister's house, and accused them of violence against police officers and desecrating the Supreme Court's walls.In March, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Ataullah Tarar said that a handful of ""miscreants"" associated with the PTI were bent upon sabotaging Pakistan's deal with the IMF, which he said was crucial for economic stability.He said that at the protest, activists belonging to PTI were urging the IMF to give funds to Pakistan only if their jailed leader was released, regretting that activists of an ""anti-national"" party continued to hold sit-ins and protests outside the IMF offices.

"Anti-terrorism efforts being made controversial by illegal, political mafias, says Pak army",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terrorism-efforts-being-made-controversial-by-illegal-political-mafias-says-pak-army/articleshow/111937180.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan armyaccused its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts , including a new military operation, to the detriment of the country’s national interests following the arrest on Monday of Raoof Hasan, information secretary of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), headed by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. The army said the party information secretary was in charge of PTI ’s digital media cell which, it alleged, was involved in running anti-state propaganda.Last month PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved a military offensive to counter aspikein terrorist attacks across Pakistan, particularly in volatile northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, but the idea was widely criticised by opposition parties, particularly PTI and the rights group Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). They termed it a ploy against Pashtuns to earn dollars from major powers and exploit their resources.Addressing a presser in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, asked, “Why did a mafia, a political mafia , and an illegal mafia say that they would not let this campaign (OperationAzm-e-Istehkam, or Resolve for Stability) happen?” He added that opponents of the offensive had tried to make it “controversial” and paint it as a purely military operation in which thousands of people would be displaced.He did not name any party or group butcalled the army’s critics “politicalandillegal mafias”,an apparent reference to PTI and PTM.Lt Gen Chaudhry said they were using “fake news and propaganda” to spread lies about the army and its intentions.“This is digital terrorism,” he said. “The physical terrorist also attacks law enforcement agencies and the army, and the digital terrorist also attacks the army. They are doing the same thing.”“Digital terrorists”, the spokesman said, would be deterred through laws, regulation and monitoring.He, however, questioned the lack of action against such individuals despite their activities against the leadership of the state and other institutions. “Instead of the courts and regulations moving forward against them, they’re given further space and they’re made heroes in the name of freedom of expression,” he said.Ahead of Sharif’s press conference, security forces had raided PTI’s offices and arrested Raoof Hasan from the party’s central secretariat. The raid came a week after the govt had said it planned to ban the party.“The PTI digital media centre had become a centre of international disinformation, from where anti-Pakistan propaganda is run throughout the world,” Islamabad police said, adding that those directly involved in anti-national propaganda were arrested and all evidence from PTI’s digital media cell wasconfiscated.The party issued a statement on X, saying: “It’s absolutely shameful how Islamabad police continues to completely mock and disregard every law in this country. Law of the jungle is reigning over Pakistan!”The crackdown on PTI follows several court rulings in its favour this month that threaten PM Sharif’s govt, which came to power in Feb this year with the military’s backing.","Pakistan army accuses its criticsof “politicising” its anti-terrorism efforts.

The Pakistan army on Monday accused an "" illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation, codenamed "" Azm-i-Istehkam "" (Resolve for Stability), against rising terrorism in the country.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif, in a press conference in Rawalpindi, stated that a ""massive, illegal political mafia"" has risen to undermine the operation due to ""vested interests"".Sharif clarified that Azm-i-Istehkam is not just a military operation but a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign launched through national consensus to reinvigorate the already in-place National Action Plan (NAP).He stressed that the purpose of the operation is to eliminate terrorism, which will eventually lead to ""societal and national uplift"".However, the DG ISPR accused a ""very strong lobby"" of having a vested interest in sabotaging the operation, as it does not want the NAP to succeed.He alleged that this entity is receiving a lot of money to subvert the operation.""The stakes in [sabotaging] this operation are very high, and it's not based on any ideology but involves a lot of money,"" he said.Lt Gen Sharif stated that the ""illegal political mafia"" made the first move to make the operations controversial through false and fake arguments.He pointed out that the problem lies in the implementation of the NAP's other points, such as the regularisation and registration of religious seminaries, where only a bit over 16,000 out of about 32,000 seminaries have been registered so far. He questioned whether the army should be responsible for these tasks.The DG ISPR also mentioned the issue of the ""illegal spectrum"", which hides a major illegal economy through which the criminal system and terrorism operate. He said the requirement of the illegal spectrum is a ""soft state"" and the solution to it is the National Action Plan.While the DG ISPR's statements highlight the challenges faced by the government in implementing its counter-terrorism strategy, it is essential to note that the army's involvement in political matters can be a sensitive issue.The military has historically played a significant role in the country's politics, and its direct intervention in political affairs has often been a subject of controversy.It remains to be seen whether the army will take a more active role in the country's affairs in response to the alleged sabotage of the counter-terrorism campaign by the ""illegal political mafia"".","Pakistan army accuses an ""illegal political mafia "" of trying to sabotage its renewed military operation.

Exporters are also dissatisfied with the new taxes on their income.The annual inflation rate for FY24 stood at 23.4%, leaving the real interest rate negative by three per cent.""How can we expect any big cut in the interest rate in the future to stimulate the economy?"" the banker questioned.The sources said that the IMF has asked the State Bank to maintain fiscal discipline, implying no substantial relief in interest rates soon.The high cost of doing business has already led to economic contraction in FY23, with a mere 2.4 per cent growth in FY24.""If the political situation remains unstable, significant growth in FY25 is unlikely, which will increase unemployment and deepen political uncertainties,"" noted an analyst. The IMF projects 3.5% growth for FY25, while Fitch Ratings estimates 3.2%.Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, showed optimism and said that the IMF deal will unlock additional funding sources, stabilise the rupee and bolster foreign exchange reserves.However, he expressed concerns about the political and social challenges in the country, which could complicate the successful implementation of IMF conditions, as reported by Dawn.""Moody's points out that Pakistan has historically struggled with implementing the structural reforms required by IMF programmes, which casts doubt on the current deal's effectiveness,"" he said.Despite campaigns for deals with Saudi Arabia, UAE and China, no substantial progress has been made, nor has privatisation of any government entity gone through, Mamsa said, adding that the anti-poor budget may not be sustainable in the long term.","The current fiscal year's tax-laden budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on reserved seats have shifted the focus of politics to the economy.

It said rescue operations were initiated immediately and fire was brought under control. “One injured person (Captain Manish Ratna Shakya) was rescued and taken to the hospital, and 18 people were found dead,” it added.The deceased were identified as co-pilot S Katuwal, the employees of Saurya Airlines and a Yemeni national (Aref Reda).Manu Raj Sharma, a technician of the airline, his wife Priza Khatiwada and their four-year-old son Adhi Raj Sharma were among the deceased. Priza worked as an assistant computer operator at the ministry of energy, water resources and irrigation.A statement issued by the airline said that Priza and her son were initially identified as employees of the company, but it was later revealed that they were passengers.Videos posted online showed the plane being enveloped in fire and smoke. Fire engines and ambulances were rushed to the spot after the incident.“I came out and saw a plane had crashed and there was smoke and fire coming out,” said Ram Kumar Khatri Chetri, who own a car parts store barely 100 metres from the crash site. “There was chaos and confusion. There was no way that anyone could go near the plane and help out,” he said.It is monsoon season in Kathmandu but was not raining at the time of the crash. Visibility was low across the capital, however.Of the deceased, 15 died on the spot while three died during treatment at a local hospital, authorities said.The bodies of the deceased have been shifted to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital for post-mortem.

He had just received a visa to go to Germany for further training and was excited about that, Khadka said.Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and home minister Ramesh Lekh separately visited the accident site to gather details about the incident and provide necessary directives. Oli said he was deeply saddened by the tragic deaths in the crash and was at the site to enquire about the cause of the air crash with the civil aviation authority's officials. He urged all for patience at this hour of grief.According to Tribhuvan International Airport chief Jagannath Niraula, the plane flying from Kathmandu to Pokhara turned in the wrong direction.“As soon as it took off, it turned right instead of turning left,” Niraula was quoted as saying by the BBC News Nepali. However, “the cause of the accident has not been revealed yet”, he said. The accident happened less than a minute after the plane took off, Niraula said.Nepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record , where many airlines fly to small airports in remote hills and near peaks shrouded in clouds. The country is home to eight of the world's 14 tallest mountain peaks.A cabinet meeting held in Singhadurbar decided to form a five-member committee led by former director general of the civil aviation authority, Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, to investigate the crash. The committee has been given 45 days to submit a report.The aircraft, manufactured by the Canadian company Bombardier in April 2003, was the sixth of its kind purchased for use in Nepal, according to information from planesspotters.com.

DHAKA: Rush-hour traffic returned to the streets of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Wednesday, as a curfew was eased after four days of nationwide shutdown that followed deadly protests led by university students against quotas in government jobs .Offices reopened and broadband internet was largely restored, although social media continued to be suspended, days after the clashes between protesters and security forces killed almost 150 people.The country has been relatively calm since Sunday after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of an appeal from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government and directed that 93% of jobs should be open to candidates on merit.Bangladesh 's mainstay garment and textiles industries, which supply to major Western brands, also began reopening some factories after a pause in production during the curfew.""All our factories are open today. Everything is going smoothly,"" said S.M. Mannan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.The stock exchange opened too, as well as banks, after remaining shut the past two days.Residents of Dhaka were out on the streets, some making their way to offices as public buses also began running in some places.""It was a hassle to reach the office on time,"" said Shamima Akhter, who works at a private firm in the capital. ""Some roads are still blocked for security reasons. Don't know when everything will get normal.""Local news websites, which had stopped updating since Friday, were back online too.Bangladesh authorities had shut mobile internet and deployed the army on the streets during the curfew that was imposed from midnight on Saturday.The government said curfew restrictions would be relaxed for seven hours on Wednesday and Thursday, and offices would also be open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.Analysts say the student action has given fresh impetus to Hasina's critics, months after she won a fourth-straight term in power in January in a national election boycotted by the main opposition party.""The informal federation of government critics appears deeper and wider than before the election, which presents a serious challenge to the ruling party,"" said Geoffrey Macdonald at the United States Institute of Peace.Hasina, 76, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, who led the country's movement for independence from Pakistan.The earlier 56% job quotas included a 30% reservation for families of veterans of the 1971 independence war, which critics said favoured supporters of Hasina's Awami League.Hasina's government had scrapped the quotas in 2018, but a high court ruling reinstated the them last month.Students were furious because quotas left fewer than half of state jobs open on merit amid an unemployment crisis, particularly in the private sector, making government sector jobs with their regular wage hikes and perks especially prized.Hasina has blamed her political opponents for the violence and her government said on Tuesday that it would heed the Supreme Court ruling.The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has denied any involvement in the violence and accused Hasina of authoritarianism and a crackdown on her critics, charges denied by her government.Protesting students have given the government a fresh 48-hour ultimatum to fulfil four other conditions of an eight-point list of demands, and said they would announce their next steps on Thursday.""We want the government to meet our four-point demand, including restoration of internet, withdrawal of police from campuses, and opening universities (which have been closed for a week),"" protest coordinator Nahid Islam said.",Bangladesh's mainstay garment and textiles industries also began reopening some factories after a pause in production during the curfew.
