Asheville 's historic Biltmore Village , situated in western North Carolina , is now submerged due to severe flooding after Hurricane Helene hit the state. The village, known for its arts scene and unique ownership, is located where the Swannanoa River joins the French Broad River.In Asheville, home to approximately 94,000 residents, floodwaters have risen several feet, covering street signs and inundating buildings and small businesses after heavy rain, strong winds, and mudslides.Asheville also faced widespread cellular service outages, with no estimated time for restoration.A curfew was imposed by Asheville police from 7:30 pm Friday to 7:30 am Saturday for public safety, effective until further notice. Transit services in the village were suspended, and residents were advised to boil water due to a major water line break and possible water shortages or low pressure.Historically, Biltmore Village was designed to look like a small English village and had the region’s first railroad station. It served as an entrance to George Vanderbilt’s Biltmore Estate and aimed to be a self-sustaining community. From its inception, it was called a “model village” and “A Millionaire’s Village.”An eyewitness told NBC News, ""We knew the flooding was coming, but we didn’t know it was going to be this catastrophic.""The North Carolina Department of Transportation said that most routes into Asheville and throughout the mountains were affected. According to the Department of Transportation, over 400 roads have been closed, hindering travel and rescue efforts, which are ongoing. The state transportation department also warned on social media, ""All roads in Western North Carolina should be considered closed.""Many gas stations in North Carolina closed early Saturday due to power outages, while those that remained open saw long lines. Over 700,000 power customers across North Carolina lost electricity, including 160,000 in Buncombe County. Major highways, including Interstates 40 and 26, were blocked at multiple locations.Governor Roy Cooper ’s office confirmed that more than 200 people have been rescued from floodwaters across North Carolina.President Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for several states, including Georgia, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, and South Carolina. Biden has deployed over 1,500 federal personnel to assist with search and rescue, medical needs, and power restoration in the affected areas.The storm reached Georgia on Thursday night, causing widespread damage throughout the southern US. Over 64 fatalities have been reported as a result of Hurricane Helene, according to an AP report.","Asheville's historic Biltmore Village is now submerged due to severe flooding after Hurricane Helene hit the state.

Donald Trump: Donald Trump attacks Kamala Harris over immigration and US border policy at Wisconsin rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-attacks-kamala-harris-over-immigration-and-us-border-policy-at-wisconsin-rally/articleshow/113777924.cms,"File photo: Former US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

Former US President Donald Trump attacked Vice President Kamala Harris during his speech in Wisconsin on Saturday, targeting her immigration issues and her role in border policy , reported CBS News .Speaking in Prairie du Chien, Trump accused Harris of allowing illegal border crossings and blamed her for crimes committed by migrants, claiming she had effectively “erased” the US border.Trump also promised to ""liberate Wisconsin from the mass migrant invasion "" and extend that to the entire country if re-elected. He also escalated personal attacks on Harris, calling her “mentally impaired” and a “disaster,” stating, ""Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way.""""Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country. Anybody would know this."", he said.Trump's criticism of Harris has been ongoing since she entered the race. Earlier this year, he controversially questioned her racial identity, falsely claiming she ""turned Black"" for political gain.""I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,"" Trump said at the time. ""So I don't know, is she Indian, or is she Black?"", Trump had asked.When asked if such personal attacks could hurt his standing with voters, Trump confidently responded that he didn’t believe so.In addition to criticising Harris, Trump reiterated his hardline stance on immigration, vowing to carry out the largest deportation operation in US history if elected. He claimed that Americans trust him more than Harris to handle border issues, and polls reflect his advantage on this topic in key swing states like Wisconsin.However, Trump's rally saw him jumping rapidly between various topics, from alleged assassination attempts to climate change and even comparing his physique to President Biden’s.He also mocked Harris’ event in Arizona the previous day, where she outlined new plans to tighten asylum rules. Harris had criticised Trump's border policies, accusing him of preferring to campaign on problems rather than fix them.Trump denied responsibility for separating children from their parents at the border during his presidency, despite this policy being implemented under his administration. In response, Harris addressed her supporters in San Francisco, describing Trump as ""a very unserious man"" with outdated rhetoric, but warning that his return to the White House would have severe consequences for the nation.The Harris campaign challenged Trump to another debate in a football-themed advert aired during the Alabama-Georgia game, which Trump attended after his rally. The ad teased Trump, calling him a “loser” for avoiding a second debate.","Former US President Donald Trump attacked Vice President Kamala Harris during his speech in Wisconsin on Saturday.

TOKYO: Thousands of Japanese fans bid tearful farewell to their beloved panda couple that made their final public appearance at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo on Saturday before returning to China for medical treatment.The pair, Ri Ri and Shin Shin, are the parents of Xiang Xiang , the park-born idol that had returned home last year.More than 2,000 visitors, many wearing T-shirts and carrying items decorated by panda motifs, queued outside the zoo hours before the opening.Some said they camped out overnight to secure their chance.The pandas, both 19 years old, arrived at the Ueno Zoo in 2011. Although their lease is good through 2026, Japan and China agreed to their return home as the aging couple need treatment for high blood pressure, according to the zoo.Hirono Sasaki, who waited to enter the zoo since 5 a.m., was crying. ""They were always my source of comfort, so I'm feel extremely sad,"" she said. ""I loved seeing Ri Ri climbing trees in her old enclosure. I hope she can climb trees again when she is back in China.""After their hours long wait, visitors were given only a few minutes inside their hut to view the black-and-white animals. Lucky ones could get a glimpse of them nibbling on bamboo branches, but others could only catch them during their naps.China sends pandas abroad as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over the animals and any cubs they produce. The animals are native to southwestern China and are an unofficial national mascot.Pandas, which reproduce rarely in the wild and rely on a diet of bamboo, remain among the world's most threatened species. An estimated 1,800 pandas live in the wild, while another 500 are in zoos or reserves, mostly in Sichuan.","Ri Ri and Shin Shin are the parents of Xiang Xiang, the park-born idol that had returned home last year.

China is striking deals to cement its role as Asia's trade hub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-is-striking-deals-to-cement-its-role-as-asias-trade-hub/articleshow/113778078.cms,"Ping thy neighbours (NYT photo)

HUNCHUN: China has made several moves in recent months to advance its ambitious aim to become the trade and transportation hub of Asia.To its west, China has agreed to build a rail line across Central Asia. Beijing also said it would help Vietnam plan three rail lines leading to the countries' shared border. And China is trying to persuade Russia and North Korea to let it reopen a long-closed port on the Sea of Japan.If successful, the plans would give China closer ties to the economies of Northeast and Southeast Asia , the Mideast and even the Arctic, the latest steps in its 11-year-old Belt and Road Initiative to create a more China-centered global order.Each of the efforts, in varying ways, faces obstacles. The nation's top leader, Xi Jinping, will need close cooperation from border countries, some of which are politically volatile, like Kyrgyzstan, or internationally isolated, like North Korea. Neighboring countries that have long been wary of China, like Vietnam, will need to be reassured.A similar venture, a 3-year-old rail line that China has forged into landlocked Laos in Southeast Asia, has been welcomed by some there for bringing an influx of Chinese mining investments and tourism to the country. But others have warned of Chinese domination of the Laotian economy.""They ended up owning a lot of the land, or at least using a lot of the land, and squeezing out some of the locals,"" said Ja Ian Chong, a professor at the National University of Singapore.The new initiatives would also be expensive, and China has begun emphasizing smaller Belt and Road projects elsewhere.A central factor in the country's moves is its geopolitical relationship with Russia, whose invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has both helped and hurt China's effort to build regional transport links.Russia now depends on China for trucks, drones and other supplies for the war, and has become less of a counterweight to China in struggles for regional influence. As ties have warmed between the two countries, even including many joint military exercises lately in the Sea of Japan and elsewhere, Moscow has been giving more diplomatic support to Chinese projects, notably on the short Russian border with North Korea.Yet the war in Ukraine has produced a severe labor shortage in Russia, drawing workers in from Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan, in particular, has been left with too few skilled workers to construct the rail line that China wants to build across its mountains toward Afghanistan and Iran.""The problem is not just having enough engineers and workers, but enough with the right technical training and background to stay and work in Kyrgyzstan,"" said Niva Yau, a specialist on the country at the Atlantic Council, a research group in Washington.But the collective scope of the projects shows how Xi is wielding infrastructure to cement China's role as the trade and geopolitical center of Asia.The toughest project for China, but one with a potentially big payoff, lies in trying to secure access to the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean via the Tumen River .In the mid-19th century, Russia seized from China a large area of Siberia, including a coastal strip of land that runs south to North Korea and obstructs northeastern China's access to the ocean. The Tumen River flows along more than 300 miles of China's border with North Korea, but the last 9 miles of it lie between Russia and North Korea. A low railroad bridge across the river, which the Soviet Union hurriedly built during the Korean War to haul supplies, has blocked all but fairly small boats ever since.Replacing that bridge with a taller one that would allow oceangoing ships to use the river has long been the dream of Chinese leaders. The goal is to link the Pacific Ocean with a port in Hunchun, an otherwise landlocked Chinese city a few miles up the river. Some residents of Hunchun, like Zhao Hongwei, a real estate investor, share that dream.""If there is a port, there can be trade, and we can become prosperous,"" Zhao, 49, said.For Beijing, opening Tumen River traffic would ease trade to Russia, northern Japan and the northeast coast of the Korean Peninsula and even create new shipping lanes to Europe as climate change shrinks the Arctic ice cap.""The Tumen River, as the only direct passage into the Sea of Japan, has extremely high strategic value,"" said Li Lifan, executive director of Russian and Central Asian studies at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.With Russia expressing a new willingness in recent months to replace the bridge, the big question now is North Korea's stance. Russian and North Korean officials signed their own agreement June 20 to build a highway bridge over the Tumen River.Some analysts are skeptical that North Korea will agree to removing the low bridge. The country has long tried to pit China against Russia when it has suited its geopolitical needs. North Korea, which already faces China along almost its entire northern border, may not want to see Chinese influence on the last segment with Russia.""Even if China and Russia reach agreement, they still have to persuade North Korea,"" said Hoo Chiew Ping, a Korea specialist at the East Asian International Relations Caucus in Malaysia.",China has agreed to build a rail line across Central Asia.

MANILA: The armed forces of five countries conducted joint maritime exercises in a portion of the South China Sea on Saturday as China carried out its own military drills in the disputed waterway.The exercises involving the Philippines , United States, Australia , Japan and - for the first time - New Zealand took place in Manila's exclusive economic zone and sought to improve the militaries' interoperability, the Philippine armed forces said in a statement.Saturday's exercises included a Philippine warship, the United States' USS Howard, Japan's JS Sazanami, and New Zealand's HMNZS Aotearoa, it added.Australia's Department of Defence said the drills demonstrated ""our collective commitment to strengthen regional and international cooperation in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific "".The exercises follow a series of air and sea encounters between the Philippines and China, which have sparred over disputed areas of the South China Sea, including the Scarborough Shoal, one of Asia's most contested features. The shoal has been occupied by China's coast guard for more than a decade.On Wednesday, naval vessels from New Zealand and Australia sailed through the Taiwan Strait , part of the South China Sea.China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own, says it alone exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait. Both the U.S. and Taiwan say the strait - a major trade route through which about half of global container ships pass - is an international waterway.Australia has ""consistently pressed China on peace and stability in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait"", Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.""We have welcomed the resumption of leader and military level dialogue between the U.S. and China,"" Wong said, according to a transcript.Chinese air and naval forces conducted manoeuvres in a disputed area of the sea hours after the country's top diplomat discussed ways of reducing regional tension with his U.S. counterpart.China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, despite overlapping maritime claims by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, angering its neighbours.","The exercises involve the Philippines, United States, Australia, Japan and - for the first time - New Zealand.

Malcolm Gladwell , the best-selling author ofone of the most important non-fiction books of the 21st century, is back with its dark sequelWhile discussing the new book with the Guardian, Gladwell calls out what he calls Harvard’s admission officers’ “bias towards affluent white students”.Pointing out the disparity between Harvard and an institution with a merit-based admissions process like Caltech compared to Harvard, he writes: “My suspicion is that for many people it’s unconscious, but there must be a point at which [Harvard admissions tutors] are confronting the fact that they have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their campus hasn’t become dominated by Asians and Indians.”In the book, Gladwell notes that Caltech, a highly competitive university with a merit-based admissions system, saw the proportion of Asian American students rise from 25% to 43% between 1992 and 2013.In contrast, at Harvard, where the admissions process is influenced by factors such as legacy, donor contributions, and athletic scholarships, the percentage of Asian American students has remained consistently between 15-20% during the same period. Indian applicants are even more likely to be excluded by Harvard’s application process.Gladwell goes on to argue: ""Meritocracy is one of the most beautiful inventions of the 20th century – it is a foundation of a free society.""Here are 10 other key points aboutand Malcolm Gladwell:Malcolm Gladwell was initially reluctant to revisit his debut work but ultimately chose to create an entirely new version, one that reflects today's more anxious world rather than simply updating the original.The foundational idea that social trends behave like epidemics, initially growing slowly before suddenly taking off, still holds true. However, some of Gladwell's original examples have not aged well.Gladwell now finds his earlier chapter on crime ""embarrassing,"" as he once credited New York City's crime reduction to 'broken windows' policing. He has since acknowledged that this approach led to over-policing in minority neighbourhoods and wasn't actually responsible for the drop in crime rates.Gladwell values the process of learning from errors, a trait he respects in his father. He proposes that authors should periodically reassess their original works every 25 years to stay aligned with new insights.The new book is darker and more nuanced than the original. It delves into how a small number of individuals can disproportionately influence significant events, such as the opioid crisis, where a minority of doctors were responsible for nearly half of all prescriptions.While The Tipping Point became a cultural phenomenon, Gladwell’s latest book explores how individuals with substantial influence can shape societal changes, both positively and negatively.Gladwell reflects on how male leadership failures over the past eight years make a strong case for female leaders, particularly in the current political climate.Gladwell has expressed his support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election, noting a personal connection through his mother, who shares Jamaican heritage with Harris's father.He argues that recent examples of male leadership failures have made it increasingly difficult to justify misogynistic attitudes and believes that America is ready for a female president.Now living with his partner and two young daughters, Gladwell views parenting as a journey of intellectual humility. He continuously adapts his understanding of his children as they grow and sees this phase of his life as a ""productivity mechanism"" that shapes his evolving perspective.","Malcolm Gladwell's new book, Revenge of the Tipping Point, is darker and more nuanced than the original.

The situation was dire for Hezbollah, with the Israeli Defense Forces asserting that their strikes resulted in the deaths of several Hezbollah commanders, including their leader Hassan Nasrallah .The death was confirmed by Hezbollah hours later.Iran too reported the death of Abbas Nilforushan, a deputy commander in Iran Revolutionary Guard , who was also killed in the airstrike that claimed Nasrallah's life. The Iranian state-run news agency IRNA confirmed this loss, indicating the far-reaching implications of the Israeli operations.The Israeli Air Force said, “The IDF continues to attack terrorist targets of Hezbollah in Lebanese territory” while sharing videos of airstrikes. The videos captured the explosions as they rocked various targets in Lebanon.The operation to eliminate Nasrallah was codenamed “New Order,” a clear indication of its strategic importance to Israeli military planners.The video, also released by the Israeli Air Force, showed chilling moments from the command center, where the chief of the General Staff directed the operation to take out the Hezbollah leader.Hezbollah, which has been a formidable adversary of Israel for decades, vowed to persist in its “holy war” against what it termed the enemy and in support of Palestine.This incident marks a turning point, as Nasrallah has been a significant figure in Lebanese and regional politics, leading Hezbollah for over three decades.In the broader context of this conflict, the week has been marked as one of the deadliest for Lebanon since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.

The ICC prosecutor, who said he would visit Bangladesh by the end of this year, praised Yunus' three-point proposal to bring a new momentum to resolve the Rohingya crisis . Yunus proposed this at a meeting at the UN headquarters on Wednesday, when the ICC chief prosecutor also spoke.The proposal included an urgent conference hosted by the UN chief to review the overall situation and suggest ways out of it, an energised joint response plan for the Rohingya humanitarian crisis, and serious international efforts to support justice and accountability to address the genocidal crimes committed in Rakhine in 2017.""The three points are perfect,"" Khan said.","Interim govt and opponents of Hasina have charged her with in connection with the 700 deaths in the violent protests leading to her escape to India in Aug.

In a statement following the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike, US President Joe Biden , in a statement, called it ""a measure of justice"" on Saturday.""Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror. His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians,"" said Biden.Nasrallah’s death comes amid an intensifying conflict that erupted after Hamas ’s deadly October 7, 2023, assault on Israel , which claimed the lives of over a thousand people.The day following that attack, Nasrallah announced Hezbollah’s decision to join the conflict, opening a ""northern front"" against Israel.Biden reaffirmed the US's unwavering support for Israel’s right to defend itself against groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and other Iranian-backed militant organizations. ""The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups,"" he said.The president also revealed that he had ordered US military forces in the region to enhance their defense posture in an effort to deter further aggression and prevent a broader war.Despite the heightened tensions, Biden stressed that the ultimate goal remains de-escalation through diplomatic efforts. He said that the US is working with the United Nations Security Council to broker a deal ""for a ceasefire and the release of hostages"" in Gaza. ""In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon. It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,"" Biden added.The US State Department had earlier cautioned American citizens and the families of embassy personnel in Beirut to leave the country while authorising the departure of some staff to leave Lebanon and restated its advisory against any travel to the nation.In a statement released on Saturday, the department said, ""Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the US Embassy urges US citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available.""Meanwhile, US vice president Kamala Harris, who was attending two campaign fundraisers in California, released a separate statement that aligned with Biden's stance on Nasrallah's death.

Kamala Harris' team said she would be willing to attend the fundraiser as president if she's elected but on Oct 17, she will be busy campaigning.Kamala Harris' absence will make her the second major-party candidate to decline an invitation in over six decades and the first since Walter Mondale did not attend the event in 1984.Laura Loomer raised a storm after she attacked Kamala Harris' ethnicity and said if she wins the presidential election, the White House will smell of curry -- a jibe at Kamala Harris' Indian ethnicity. The attack did not get approval from the Republican party and Donald Trump distanced himself from Laura Loomer's vile comment. Several Republican veterans opposed Laura Loomer and said Loomer does not represent the GOP.Loomer herself said her allegiance is not to the GOP but only to Donald Trump. The former president called Laura Loomer a private citizen, a supporter who does not work for him or for his campaign but Loomer's closeness with Trump certainly raised eyebrows.As far as Kamala Harris' religion is concerned, Harris earlier said that as a child she was introduced to both Hinduism and Christianity and now she's married to Jewish Doug Emhoff.“She has a unique and interesting religious identity. ... She’s been part of both mainline American Baptist churches and Hindu fellowships, and she’s married to a Jewish man,” said Nathan Finn, senior fellow on religious liberty with the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.A Texas-based evangelist Lance Wallnau recently accused Kamala Harris of practicing witchcraft. ""She can look presidential. That’s the seduction of what I would say is witchcraft.

I thought I was okay. I wasn’t okay. They still knocked my house down.”Attorney Christie Herbert claimed that the county fast-tracked the demolition despite Arnold’s requests to remove the house from the list. “While he still had work to do, the yard was neat, the exterior was clean, the house was locked up, and, most importantly, it was in a vastly improved state of repair compared to when he purchased it,” Herbert said, as quoted by the New York Post.“Eric’s lawsuit isn’t just about one man’s house; it’s about protecting the constitutional rights of all property owners in Macon-Bibb County,” Herbert said during a press conference.Arnold has sought compensation for the house’s purchase and renovation costs.Macon-Bibb County officials said that they are aware of the demolition on Sunnyvale Drive.

Its leadership has often threatened to cross the line of control and take over Azad Kashmir,"" Shehbaz Sharif claimed.Soon after his remarks, the first secretary of India’s permanent mission to the UN Bhavika Mangalanandan also responded sharply in UNGA and, in turn, highligted Pakistan's usage of cross-border terrorism as a key strategy against India, citing numerous incidents, including the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001 and the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.""The list is long,"" Mangalanandan said in retort to Islamabad's unfounded assertions. She further said that there can be ""no compact with terrorism"" and that Pakistan's cross-border terrorism against India will ""inevitably invite consequences"". ""We are talking about a nation that for long hosted Osama bin Laden. A country whose fingerprints are on so many terrorist incidents across the world, whose policies attract the dregs of many societies to make it their home,"" Mangalanandan said during India’s right of reply.Mangalanandan in her response called Pakistan a ""country run by the military"" with a ""global reputation for terrorism, narcotics, and transnational crime.""She expressed disbelief that Pakistan, a nation known for these issues, would attack India, the world’s largest democracy, in such a forum.""It is even more extraordinary for a country with a history of rigged elections to talk about political choices in a democracy,"" Mangalanandan said.","India's External affairs minister S Jaishankar tore into Pakistan at the United Nations.

ISLAMABAD: At least 64 people have been killed this week in a fresh outbreak of violence involving the Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan 's militancy-prone Kurram district along the Afghanistan border in the northwest, where a ceasefire had been signed just over a month ago.Governor Faisal Karim Kundi of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said dozens on either side were wounded in the fighting, which continued Friday amid reports of higher casualties than the official figure.Police said the clashes started after the Boshehra Shias of upper Kurram started setting up bunkers on land belonging to the Sunni Ahmadzai community last week. The dispute quickly engulfed other areas and became a full-blown sectarian conflict , they said.In Aug, the warring sides signed a truce after clashes resulted in 50 deaths and injuries to over 200 people.Security officials said the renewed fighting led to closure of roads, triggering a shortage of food, medicines and fuel. Educational institutions have also remained shut for a week.Kurram, a mountainous area that shares a long border with Afghanistan, is home to about 700,000 people, of which more than 42% belong to the Shia community. The district's Parachinar town is one of the few Shia-dominated areas in largely Sunni Pakistan. The region has seen frequent tribal and sectarian clashes in recent years.","At least 64 people killed in fresh outbreak of violence involving Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan's militancy-prone Kurram district.

The International Monetary Fund ( IMF )'s executive board has given the green light for a fresh $7 billion loan to Pakistan , a country grappling with financial challenges.The announcement was made on Wednesday, over two months after the two parties had initially reached a consensus. Authorities stated that the loan, which will be disbursed to Islamabad over a period of 37 months, is intended to provide a much-needed boost to Pakistan's wilting economy.In a statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the agreement, which his team had been working on with the IMF since June.He expressed gratitude to Kristalina Georgieva , the head of the IMF and her team, for the approval.(This is a top story on Google Trends)According to the IMF, the first tranche of the loan, amounting to approximately $1 billion, will be released immediately.Financially relegated to the margin given the dwindling economic figures, revenue-starved Pakistan will get monetary respite to bring back its economy on track.Earlier this month, Shehbaz Sharif said that ""friendly"" nations have helped Islamabad to meet the requirements necessary to secure the IMF bailout package -- necessary for the nuclear-armed nation to end its chronic economic distress.(This is a top story on Google Trends)Last July, Sharif's administration had secured a $7-billion loan from IMF on the condition that it would introduce stringent reforms to strengthen tax collection and increase revenue.On the global lender's demand, Islamabad had unveiled a tax-heavy budget last June to raise 13 trillion rupees by next year - a 40% increase from the current financial year.There has also been a 20-30% tariff increase on electricity and other energy products, hitting the common man hard. Pakistan's external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.Since joining the multilateral lender in 1950, Pakistan has secured 24 IMF bailouts, the latest being approved by the lender's executive board and confirmed by necessary financing assurances from the country's development and bilateral partners.","The International Monetary Fund ( IMF )'s executive board has given the green light for a fresh $7 billion loan to Pakistan.

DHAKA: Hindu community leaders in Bangladesh are advocating the formation of a dedicated political party, reflecting a call for political representation to protect their rights and ensure their safety. Hindu leaders from the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council ( BHBCOP ) and other groups are now discussing the possibility of establishing a separate political party or demanding reserved parliamentary seats.""There are currently three opinions that are being discussed in detail: first, going back to the separate electorate system from 1954; second, establishing a separate political party for Hindus; and third, reserving seats in Parliament for minorities,"" BHBCOP presidium member Kajal Debnath told PTI.The discussions came after the violence against the Hindu community following the resignation of the Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina as prime minister on August 5 following a student movement.Debnath said the data collected by the BHBCOP points to 2,010 incidents of attacks on the Hindu community, ranging from murder and physical assaults to sexual assaults, attacks on temples, and destruction of property.There are no official figures from the Bangladesh government on the number of attacks.""The discussions and exchanges of opinions regarding forming a political party are at the top of our priority. Although nothing has been finalised, let's see how it pans out,"" said Ranjan Karmakar, a leader from the Hindu community.""The proposed political party could serve as a critical vehicle for change, ensuring their concerns are represented and addressed,"" he pointed out.Historically, Hindus made up about 22 per cent of Bangladesh's population during the 1971 Liberation War, but today they represent only approximately 8 per cent.The community members attributed this decrease in the Hindu population to socio-political marginalisation and sporadic violence, intensifying the urgency for political mobilisation.However, Debnath said that forming a party for Hindus may not work in favour of minorities, as it might divide the secular votes and not result in victory.""The Hindu population is scattered across Bangladesh. In some areas, it comprises 35 per cent of the voters, while in most places it is 6-8 per cent of the voters. Those Hindu leaders from the Awami League who won in the last election garnered both Hindu votes and votes from Awami League supporters of other communities.""""But if the same person contests as a candidate of a Hindu party, he or she may not be able to garner votes from other communities. So, the goal of sending representatives to Parliament won't be served,"" he said.There are different opinions within the community on whether to form a separate political party or to collaborate with existing secular parties.""We must focus on our common goals. Only by standing united can we make a significant impact. This is our moment to rise and reclaim our place in the political landscape. But as a large section of Hindus are identified with the Awami League, we too are facing attacks,"" said Gobinda Chandra Pramanik, also general secretary of the Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajote.Debnath said that reserving parliamentary seats similar to how it is done for women could be a solution.The demand for reservations is not new, as the government has previously allocated seats for women in both national and local politics, and Hindu community leaders argue that similar reservations for Hindus would give them a platform to influence policies that directly impact their safety and rights.""If we have representatives in Parliament, they can actively advocate for our safety, security, and cultural preservation. Without representation, we risk being forgotten in political discussions, left to navigate a hostile environment alone,"" he said.Another BHBCOP presidium member, who did not wish to be named, said that the political parties - whether the Awami League, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), or the Jatiya Party - have failed the Hindu minorities in the country since its birth following the Liberation War of 1971.""Since 1971, minorities have failed to feature in the political discourse of the country. This is mainly because minorities have depended on mainstream political parties, who have time and again failed us, except when reaching out to us during elections,"" he said.Historically, the Awami League, recognised for its secular stance, received substantial support from Hindus, but the sudden power vacuum after Hasina's ouster resulted in a wave of violence in which businesses of the minority community were vandalised, properties destroyed and temples desecrated, leaving many in the community feeling vulnerable and disenfranchised.Muhammad Yunus, the interim government's Chief Adviser, downplayed the severity of the violence against Hindus, characterising it as politically motivated rather than communal and suggesting that the attacks stemmed from political upheaval due to the perception that most Hindus supported the now-deposed Awami League regime.""This issue has several dimensions. When the country went through an upheaval following the atrocities by (Sheikh) Hasina and the Awami League, those who were with them also faced attacks,"" the Nobel laureate told PTI during an interview earlier this month.Yunus had described the attacks as ""political in nature and not communal.""Leaders of BHBCOP had met Yunus after he took charge on August 8 and submitted a memorandum requesting him to ensure the stopping of attacks on Hindus.Political analyst Zillur Rehman expressed doubts about the number of attacks on Hindus given by the BHBCOP but asserted that the proposal of reservation of seats in parliament can be discussed.""Right now a process is on to relook at our Constitution so this idea of allocation of parliamentary seats for the minorities can be discussed and debated. But the idea of forming a new political party won't be feasible in the binary of BNP and Awami League,"" he said.","Hindu community leaders in Bangladesh are advocating the formation of a dedicated political party.
