Leaders of the Nihon Hidankyo , a group representing survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings, issued a stark warning on Saturday, saying that the threat of nuclear war is growing.This comes as they renew their decades-long campaign to abolish nuclear weapons .""The global situation is deteriorating, with wars now being fought under the looming threat of nuclear strikes,"" said Shigemitsu Tanaka , co-leader of the group and a survivor of the 1945 Nagasaki bombing.""I fear we are on a path toward self-destruction. The only way to prevent this is the complete abolition of nuclear weapons,"" he further added.The warning came shortly after the group was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , with the Norwegian Nobel Committee acknowledging their long-standing efforts to rid the world of nuclear arms. The committee highlighted the continued relevance of their work, given the current global tensions.While no specific nations were named, the award and renewed calls for disarmament follow recent remarks by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who suggested Moscow might resort to nuclear weapons if Western powers allow Ukraine to strike Russian territory with long-range missiles.","Leaders of the Nihon Hidankyo, a group representing survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings, issued a stark warning on Saturday.

Pakistan prepares for SCO Summit amidst security concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-prepares-for-sco-summit-amidst-security-concerns/articleshow/114180796.cms,"Representative image.

Pakistan is gearing up to secure its capital, Islamabad, ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The event, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will see the attendance of key regional leaders, including India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and China's Premier Li Qiang.In preparation for the summit, Pakistan's government has implemented strict measures.These include strict enforcement against movements protesting ethnic nationalism and new laws that limit demonstrations in the capital. Authorities have also detained hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Imran Khan , who is currently jailed, following their attempt to march in Islamabad.Security concerns have been heightened by a recent attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers in Karachi, raising fears for the safety of foreign nationals amid ongoing separatist violence. The government has responded by authorizing troop deployments in the capital throughout the summit's duration.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst, emphasized the importance of the summit for Pakistan, stating, ""The government claims to have made elaborate security arrangements and understandably so because it has to make sure that the event passes off peacefully without any untoward incident.""The SCO, which includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and six other member states, is viewed by some as an alternative to Western alliances such as NATO. The agenda for the Islamabad summit focuses on trade, humanitarian, and cultural issues, though domestic issues in Pakistan may loom large.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, has threatened protests during the summit. Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhary, Pakistan's minister for planning, accused the PTI of trying to disrupt the event, stating, ""The PTI doesn't want to showcase the positive side of Pakistan to the world. Instead, they aim to present a picture of the country filled with tear gas and unrest.""To facilitate the summit, Islamabad and the neighboring city of Rawalpindi will observe a public holiday starting Monday, accompanied by road closures to reduce movement. The government quarter hosting the summit has been fortified and prepared for the visiting dignitaries.Pakistan, heavily reliant on Chinese investment for infrastructure projects, is keen to ensure the safety of its citizens and foreign guests, especially considering the broader uptick in militancy linked to the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan.The authorities aim for a peaceful summit to enhance the country's image amidst various internal and external challenges.","Pakistan is hosting a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.

Catholic leaders in Michigan, including all seven diocesan bishops, have expressed strong disapproval of governor Gretchen Whitmer 's recent viral video, which has been widely viewed as ridiculing the Christian sacrament of Holy Communion , as reported by Fox News.The clip, shared on feminist author Liz Plank ’s Instagram page, features Whitmer wearing a Harris-Walz hat and placing a Doritos chip into Plank’s mouth while she kneels on the floor.""It is not just distasteful or ‘strange;’ it is an all-too-familiar example of an elected official mocking religious persons and their practices,"" said Paul A Long, president and CEO of the Michigan Catholic Conference (MCC), in a statement representing the views of the state’s Catholic leaders.The video was intended to promote US vice president Kamala Harris ’ policies ahead of the presidential election , emerging from Whitmer’s appearance on Plank’s "" Chip Chat "" podcast published on YouTube. Plank’s caption read, ""If he won’t, Gretchen Whitmer will. Chips aren’t just delicious, the CHIPS Act is a game-changer for US tech and manufacturing, boosting domestic production of semiconductors to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers! Donald Trump would put that at risk.""In their statement, the Catholic conference expressed ""profound disappointment and offense"" regarding Whitmer's actions. They noted that the skit features Whitmer mimicking the gesture of administering Communion, saying, ""The governor then stares expressionless into the camera.""Conservatives on social media have also accused Whitmer and Plank of mocking the Christian sacrament. Former Trump advisor Tim Murtaugh commented, ""Let’s be clear what’s happening in this video. gov. Whitmer of Michigan is pretending to give communion to a leftist podcaster on her knees, using a Dorito as the Eucharist while wearing a Harris-Walz hat. Do they want ZERO Catholic votes for Harris?""A political aide for Whitmer defended the video as a blend of pop culture in her communications. Long argued that Whitmer's video ""goes further than the viral online trend that inspired it"" and called for a return to respect and civility towards religious beliefs.","Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer's viral video has been widely viewed as ridiculing the Christian sacrament of Holy Communion.

A US army soldier has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempting to aid ISIS in planning attacks on American troops, the Department of Justice revealed. Cole Bridges, from Stow, Ohio, was found guilty of trying to support the terrorist group and conspiring to murder US soldiers, as reported by ABC News.24-year-old Bridges, who joined the Army in 2019, was a cavalry scout in the Third Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia.Before enlisting, he had started exploring jihadist propaganda online, expressing his support for ISIS on social media. By October 2020, he was communicating with an FBI undercover agent posing as an ISIS supporter in contact with fighters in the Middle East.“Bridges provided training and guidance to purported ISIS fighters who were planning attacks, including advice about potential targets in New York City,” the DOJ said. He also sent the FBI agent portions of a US Army training manual, believing it would assist ISIS in their operations.In December 2020, Bridges increased his involvement by supplying instructions on how to ambush US forces in the Middle East. He shared diagrams and tactics intended to help ISIS maximise the effectiveness of their attacks. Bridges even advised on how to rig buildings with explosives to target US Special Forces.In January 2021, Bridges recorded a video of himself in his US Army uniform, standing before an ISIS flag and making a gesture of support for the terrorist group. A week later, he sent another video in which he delivered a speech, using voice manipulation to conceal his identity.The FBI, along with several other military and intelligence agencies, was involved in the investigation. ""Our troops risk their lives for our country,” said Acting US attorney Audrey Strauss. “They should never face such peril at the hands of one of their own.""","Cole Bridges, 24, was a cavalry scout in the Third Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia.

As Hurricane Milton struck Florida, a fishing boat captain was stranded for 8 hours in the Gulf of Mexico . The captain faced extreme conditions in the sea before finally being rescued by the US Coast Guard .The captain, whose name was not released, went out early at around 3 am on Wednesday to repair his broken boat ‘Captain Dave,’ as reported by the Washington Post.Around noon, the boat’s owner reported to the Coast Guard that the captain hadn’t checked in. “Watchstanders were able to make radio contact with the captain who reported the rudder was fouled with a line and became disabled during his transit back to port,” the US Coast Guard agency said in the release.The fishing vessel earlier in the week had broken down some 20 miles off John’s Pass in Pinellas County, and the captain and another crew member were rescued from it on Monday, but the vessel was left with salvage arrangements to be made.At that time, the Coast Guard reported winds of around 30 mph and waves reaching 6-8 feet. As conditions worsened with Hurricane Milton approaching, Coast Guard officials instructed the captain to wear alife jacket and keep the boat's emergency beacon close to ensure he could be located.However, by 6:45 pm, roughly two hours before Milton made landfall 20 miles south of John’s Pass, the Coast Guard lost contact with him. The Coast Guard launched a tedious search and rescue operation at around 5:30 am on Thursday, deploying airplane and helicopter crews.After a harrowing night of survival, the captain was found clinging to a cooler 30 miles off Longboat Key, around 1:30 pm on Thursday, more than 8 hours later after contact was lost.“This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,” Lt. Cmdr. Dana Grady, the Coast Guard’s command center chief in St. Petersburg, Fla., said in a news release.The unnamed captain survived the extreme conditions in an incredibly dangerous situation. “He experienced the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds, 20-25 foot waves, for an extended period of time to include overnight,” Grady said in the release.“He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler,” Grady said.","A fishing boat captain was stranded for 8 hours in the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricane Milton struck Florida.

Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared.

Painted in 1889 from the window of a mental asylum, it reflects his battle with mental illness. The painting’s vibrant brushstrokes and dreamlike quality make it one of the most iconic artworks ever.Painted between 1495 and 1498, The Last Supper portrays Jesus and his disciples during the moment of betrayal. Located in Milan’s Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, it showcases Da Vinci’s innovative use of perspective and human emotion. Restoration efforts over the centuries have struggled to preserve its original grandeur.Shakuntala depicts the beautiful heroine from Kalidasa’s epic, Abhijñānaśākuntalam. Raja Ravi Varma captures her essence with delicate brushwork, showcasing her deep emotional connection with nature and the divine. The painting conveys a poignant moment of longing, emphasising the themes of love, fate, and the transient nature of beauty.Created in 1931, The Persistence of Memory is known for its melting clocks, symbolising the fluidity of time. Dalí’s surrealist masterpiece explores themes of dreams and the subconscious. Its bizarre yet captivating imagery has made it one of the most recognizable works in modern art history.Often referred to as the ""Mona Lisa of the North,"" Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665) features a young girl in a turban with a luminous pearl earring. Painted by Dutch artist Vermeer, its simplicity, use of light, and the subject's gaze evoke intrigue and mystery, capturing timeless beauty.Guernica (1937) is Picasso's powerful anti-war statement, depicting the horrors of the Spanish Civil War. The monochromatic, chaotic composition was inspired by the bombing of the town of Guernica.

This painting became a powerful symbol of the Indian independence movement.The Night Watch (1642) is Rembrandt’s grand depiction of a militia company, praised for its dynamic composition and use of light. Once considered a night scene due to dark varnish, later restorations revealed it as a daytime setting. Its scale and intricate details showcase Rembrandt’s mastery of portraiture.Bride’s Toilet portrays the intimate moment of an Indian bride’s preparation, capturing the beauty and vulnerability of the ritual. Painted in 1937, Sher-Gil’s uses rich colours and expressive forms to depict the emotions of anticipation and femininity.American Gothic (1930) by Grant Wood depicts a stern farmer and his daughter, set against a rural backdrop.

Botticelli's delicate use of colour and graceful figures evoke beauty and myth. Commissioned by the powerful Medici family, this Renaissance masterpiece has become an enduring symbol of classical beauty and humanism.Horses showcases M.F. Husain’s fascination with these majestic animals, which he often used as metaphors for freedom and energy. The vibrant colours and dynamic brushstrokes convey a sense of movement and vitality. This artwork reflects Husain's modernist approach, blending traditional Indian themes with contemporary artistic expression.Three Pujarins exemplifies Jamini Roy's unique style, blending traditional Indian folk art with modern aesthetics.

Conservative commentator Benny Johnson led the charge, calling Obama’s comments “pure racist identity politics.” Johnson accused Obama of abandoning his previous message of unity, stating, “The magic is gone.This is the same guy who said, ‘There is not a white or Black America—there is only the United States of America!’ Now he’s running on racial supremacy? It’s grotesque.”Johnson's remarks were echoed by other conservative figures, including activist CJ Pearson, who took to social media to reaffirm his support for Trump. Pearson tweeted, “In 25 days, I’ll be joining millions of other young Black men and voting for Donald J. Trump! We don’t care what Barack Obama has to say about it.”Democratic Ohio state senator and former Bernie Sanders campaign advisor Nina Turner also criticized Obama, expressing her disappointment in his decision to single out Black men. Speaking on CNN, Turner said, “Why are Black men being lectured to? Why are Black men being belittled?” While she acknowledged her “love” for Obama, she emphasized that many Black men have valid reasons for voting differently, and those choices should be respected, even if others disagree. Turner urged Democrats not to lay the blame for lower support for Harris solely on Black men, stressing the importance of appealing to all voters and addressing their concerns.Obama's comments have sparked widespread debate, with many Black voters doubling down on their support for Trump. The controversy has also fueled further attacks from Trump himself, who mocked Obama and Harris on Truth Social. Trump claimed that Obama ""lacked enthusiasm"" for Harris and suggested the former president might even vote for him, stating, “Obama can’t stand Low IQ Kamala Harris, so he’ll be voting for President Trump in 2024!”As the 2024 election approaches, this backlash reflects broader concerns within the Democratic Party about energizing voters, particularly among Black men, a crucial demographic that could influence the election outcome.","Obama's comments have sparked widespread debate, with many Black voters doubling down on their support for Trump.

Former US President Donald Trump is leading over Vice President Kamala Harris when it comes to the question that who would better steer the country through the Ukraine and Middle East wars, according to a Wall Street Journal opinion poll of seven battleground states.According to a poll published on Friday, Harris and Trump witnessed neck-to-neck battle in the seven states that could decide the November presidential polls.Harris holds a narrow 2-point lead in Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan. Trump has a 6-point lead in Nevada and a 1-point lead in Pennsylvania. The candidates are tied in North Carolina and Wisconsin.The poll surveyed 600 registered voters in each state between September 28 and October 8. The margin of error is 4 percentage points for each state.A recent poll shows a very close race between the two candidates leading up to the Nov. 5 election. Americans are considering key issues, such as the economy, immigration, women's rights, and democratic values, as they decide whom to support.The tight results of the poll reflect similar findings in other surveys, indicating that the election could go either way. The country is deeply focused on these core issues while making their choice for the next leader.A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll revealed that former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a close national race. The poll shows Harris slightly ahead with 46% support, compared to Trump's 43%.Kamala Harris could secure a narrow majority in the Electoral College if she wins in states where she currently holds an advantage, according to a recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) poll.The poll indicates that Donald Trump leads Harris in key areas. In seven swing states, 50% of respondents believe Trump is better equipped to manage Russia's war in Ukraine, compared to 39% for Harris. Similarly, Trump holds a lead over Harris, 48% to 33%, on handling the Israel-Hamas conflict.On economic issues and immigration, more voters support Trump. Conversely, Harris is favored over Trump on matters related to housing, healthcare, and empathy. The WSJ poll noted that more individuals feel Harris would do a better job when it comes to ""caring about people like them.""","Wall Street Journal poll shows Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck-to-neck in seven battleground states.

Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance has revealed he feels bad about bringing his wife, Usha Vance , to church every week, saying that ""she didn't sign up for this."" Vance said that Usha was raised in a Hindu household, has not converted to Catholicism despite attending Mass regularly.In an interview with the, Vance, admitted to feeling uncomfortable about how his religious journey has affected his wife.“I feel — felt — kind of bad,” he explained. “Like, ‘Oh, you didn’t sign up to marry a weekly churchgoer, and are you OK with this?’ And she was sort of more than OK with it, and that was a big part of the confirmation that this was the right thing for me.”Vance revealed that Usha encouraged him to explore Catholicism even though she did not follow the faith herself. “She thought that they were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” he said. “I don’t think I would have ever done it without her support, because I felt kind of bad about it, right?”Reflecting on his spiritual growth, Vance shared his deeper motivations. “When I started to think about the big things, like, what do I actually care about in my life? I really want to be a good husband. I really want to be a good father. I really want to be a good member of the community. I wanted to be a virtuous human being, in other words.”Despite Usha's support, Vance acknowledged the pressures she faces. “I feel terrible for my wife because we go to church almost every Sunday, unless we’re on the road,” he said. He explained that although he helps with their children, Usha tends to feel the burden of keeping them quiet during the service. “Obviously, I help with the kids, but because I’m kind of the one going to church, she feels more responsibility to keep the kids quiet in the church.”Usha and JD Vance met at Yale Law School and married in Kentucky in 2014, with a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. They have three children. Usha has been pivotal in JD’s political career, helping him shape his thoughts on rural America’s social decline, which inspired his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. The book was adapted into a 2020 film by Ron Howard.","Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance has revealed he feels bad about bringing his wife, Usha Vance, to church every week.

American musician Landon Barker has come under fire for attending a party that mocked the serious sexual assault allegations against Sean “Diddy” Combs. The backlash follows Barker’s 21st birthday celebration at Nobu Malibu, after which he headed to a friend's birthday bash at a Los Angeles club.Clips from the event surfaced online, showing servers delivering bottles of baby oil adorned with flashing lights—a reference to the thousands of bottles seized from Diddy ’s homes earlier this year.While some partygoers laughed at the reference, the “bottle girls” serving the drinks appeared uncomfortable with the situation. One attendee captioned a video, “Baby oil show for the bday boy loolololol.”Although guests began passing the bottles around, Barker was not seen participating and seemed somewhat uneasy about the entire affair. In another clip, a DJ announced, “We’re getting really freaky tonight. We’re getting Diddy freaky tonight"", as quoted by PageSixDiddy is currently under investigation for his alleged “Freak Off” parties, where he reportedly subjected victims to physical, emotional, and verbal abuse during substance-fuelled sex parties.Videos from the party quickly went viral, sparking outrage among viewers who called the theme “insensitive and gross.” One user said, “Does anyone think it’s weird af for rich/famous people to make a potential sex trafficking party ring (idk the deets sorry) an ongoing joke at their own parties?” Another user commented, “I’ve never seen something so uncouth and unclassy in all my days.” A third added, “this is disrespectful to the victims.”Numerous accusations of sexual assault against Diddy have emerged in recent months. In one upcoming lawsuit, a woman alleges that Combs doused her with drug-infused oil before raping her alongside his bodyguard. Ariel Mitchell-Kidd, an attorney for several accusers, shared “graphic” details of her client’s alleged assault, claiming Diddy threatened her with a knife and used an oil-like substance believed to contain a date rape drug.54-year-old rapper Diddy was arrested last month on multiple charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty to these charges, and his bail requests have been denied several times. He is expected to remain in custody in Brooklyn , NY, until his trial, which is scheduled to begin on May 5, 2025.","Landon Barker attended a party that mocked the serious sexual assault allegations against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.

"Donald Trump: 'An aggressive, offensive play': Why is Trump campaigning in California, a Democratic stronghold?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/an-aggressive-offensive-play-why-is-trump-campaigning-in-california-a-democratic-stronghold/articleshow/114175377.cms,"Former US President Donald Trump

With important battleground states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in play, Donald Trump 's choice to visit California—a Democratic stronghold—just weeks before Election Day may seem questionable. However, despite his likely loss in the state, the former US president has strategic reasons for going to Coachella, a city east of Los Angeles.Trump, who lost California by a big margin in 2020, still secured over 6 million votes—more than any previous GOP candidate.His visit connects with a large group of supporters, which could help gather volunteers for phone banks and campaign efforts in key states.Tim Lineberger, former communications director for Trump’s 2016 Michigan campaign, explained the logic behind Trump’s move. “He’s coming here and activating this big population of Trump supporters,” said Lineberger, calling it “an aggressive, offensive play"", as quoted by the Associated Press.California is also a major source of campaign funds. Trump will be fundraising at the Coachella event, where photos with him are priced at $25,000, offering special seating for two. A “VIP Experience” is priced at $5,000.While Trump is unlikely to change the state’s outcome on November 5, the visit serves other purposes. California boasts the country’s second-largest media market in Los Angeles which will ensure extensive coverage. The rally is also seen as a “get-out-the-vote” effort for congressional races in the state, which could determine control of the House. Republican consultant Tim Rosales noted, “It’s a get-out-the-vote type of thing that motivates and energises Republicans in California.”Trump’s long-standing feud with California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom is expected to take centre stage. Newsom, who has frequently clashed with Trump, predicted the former president would denigrate the state while ignoring its strengths. “You know, that’s not what Trump is going to say,” Newsom said.Republican Party chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson wants to hear Trump explain how his agenda is different from that of the Democratic White House. She said, “The Democratic White House has left Californians less safe and with less money in their pockets.”While some believe Trump’s visit won't change California's strong Democratic support, others think he has bigger goals. Jim Brulte, former chairman of the state GOP, said Trump aims to achieve winning the popular vote. “There are more registered voters in California than there are residents in 46 of the other 49 states,” Brulte said.","Former US President Donald Trump will visit Coachella, a city east of Los Angeles.

Trump says he will use Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport illegal immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-use-alien-enemies-act-of-1798-to-deport-illegal-immigrants/articleshow/114175380.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington: Former US President and MAGA supremo Donald Trump on Friday said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport illegal immigrants if he is elected to the White House. The rarely used law was last applied to corral immigrants of Japanese descent -- mostly US citizens -- in internment camps during World War Two.Ratcheting up his anti-immigrant rhetoric with falsehoods and hyperbole during a campaign event in Colorado, Trump directly blamed his opponent Kamala Harris , who is of Jamaican and Indian descent, for what he characterized as an ""invasion"" of the US by migrants resulting in rampart crimes, an allegation not borne out by government data at the federal or local level.“Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the Third World,” Trump told raucous supporters in Aurora, a town he alleges has been overrun by Venezuelan gang members, a claim refuted by local officials, including Republicans. “I will rescue Aurora and every town that has been invaded and conquered,” added, pledging that his administration will “get them the hell out of our country.”He followed up his pledge with a social media post saying, ""We are now known, all throughout the world, as OCCUPIED AMERICA... But to everyone here in Colorado and all across our nation, I make you this vow: November 5th, 2024 will be LIBERATION DAY in America.""Standing before signs that read “deport illegals now” and “end migrant crime,” at the rally, Trump said invoked the names of Americans who have been killed or mortally wounded ""at the hands of migrants who should never have been allowed into our Country,"" to announce that upon taking office, he will launch ""OPERATION AURORA at the Federal Level...to dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American Soil.""""No person who has inflicted the violence and terror that Kamala Harris has inflicted on this community can EVER be allowed to become President of the United States!"" he said.Colorado is a Democrat-leaning state where Trump has little change of winning. But he is expanding his outreach to blue states -- including New York and California -- ostensibly to rile up his base with bigger crowds in more populous states even as supporters in battleground states tire of his rhetoric. Polls suggest he has expanded his appeal in blue states among voters upset by Democrat misgovernance and radical left policies although he is well short of winning these states.Trump is now consistently distorting and misrepresenting data to make his case of an illegal immigrant ""invasion"" and migrant crime problem in America. While the US undoubtedly has a illegal immigration issue, the border crossing statistics that he cites, including claiming more than 21 million illegals coming in and 13,000 murderers on the loose, cover several administrations including his own.In some speeches he has suggested a Kamala presidency would let in 25 million illegal immigrants a year, fantastic numbers which would increase US population by 100 million, or 30 per cent in four years. ""You won't have a country left,"" he tells his supporters. Most recent data suggests that the US has around 12 million illegal immigrants -- a still considerable number even without exaggeration. They have come into the US over several administrations.In rallies on Friday, Trump said he would implement a 10-year prison sentence for migrants who re-enter the US after being deported and impose the death penalty on illegal migrants who kill American citizens, on top of “the largest deportation in American history” on his first day in office.Trump's hyper focus on illegal immigration comes amid polls showing he is losing his lead on the economy, with cooling inflation and a booming stock market helping Harris bridge the gap. “I know they do all these polls, and the polls say it’s the economy... and I can understand it a little bit. To me, it’s the horrible people that we’re allowing into our country that are destroying our country,” he said at a recent rally in Wisconsin.",Former US President and MAGA supremo Donald Trump on Friday said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport illegal immigrants if he is elected to the White House.

US Republican vice-presidential nominee and Donald Trump 's running mate, JD Vance , has once again refused to acknowledge that President Joe Biden won the 2020 election, dodging the question five times during an interview with the New York Times .In his conversation with Lulu Garcia-Navarro for 'The Interview' podcast, Ohio senator Vance repeated the response he used during his recent debate with Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz , saying, “There’s an obsession here with focusing on 2020.I’m much more worried about what happened after 2020, which is a wide-open border, groceries that are unaffordable.”Vance's hesitation to say whether former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election matches the stance of his running mate. Trump, facing multiple charges related to his false claims of voter fraud, has consistently argued that the election was “stolen” from him. However, election officials, judges, and even Trump’s former attorney general have all debunked these allegations.During the hour-long interview, Garcia-Navarro pressed Vance repeatedly on the issue, asking whether Trump lost the 2020 election. Each time, Vance avoided the question, shifting the focus to his concerns about censorship by technology companies. He suggested that the suppression of stories related to Hunter Biden’s laptop on social media platforms had influenced the election outcome, costing Trump “millions of votes.”“I’ve answered your question with another question,” Vance responded when challenged. “You answer my question and I’ll answer yours.” When Garcia-Navarro pointed out that there was “no proof, legal or otherwise,” of election fraud, Vance dismissed the statement as “a slogan"", as quoted by the Associated Press.The vice-presidential nominee’s evasive responses during the interview were consistent with his debate performance earlier this month, where Walz criticised Vance for what he termed “a damning non-answer.”Vance later acknowledged that he wouldn't have certified the 2020 election results but assured that he would support a peaceful transfer of power in 2024 if any disputes arise.With the US Presidential election just a month away, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump are gearing up and making final preparations for the race ahead.","US Republican vice-presidential nominee and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance, has once again refused to acknowledge that President Joe Biden won the 2020 election.

Although both live together largely peacefully in the country, tensions have existed for decades between them in some areas, especially in Kurram, where Shiites dominate in parts of the district.Also Saturday, a separatist group in the southwest claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 21 people.The Baloch Liberation Army said its fighters targeted a coal mine in Duki district with heavy weapons, rocket launchers and grenades late Thursday night.It gave higher casualty figures of 30 dead and 18 injured. It also said that Pakistani security personnel were disguised as workers, without giving evidence.It threatened more assaults unless the military withdrew from the province.Balochistan is home to several groups that demand independence from the federal government, accusing it of exploiting the oil- and mineral-rich province at the expense of locals.","Tensions rose in Kurram district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government on Saturday warned to use force if jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's party went ahead to hold a protest in Islamabad on the occasion of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) politic committee, comprising of its key members, decided to hold a protest at D-Chowk in the capital on Tuesday if the government failed to meet its demand to give the 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician access to his legal team and a physician, spokesman Zulfiqar Bukhari said.The authorities due to security concerns stopped all meetings with Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail , after the protest by the party over the last weekend.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that the government would use ""full force"" to stop the PTI's planned protest on the occasion of the SCO summit .""The call for protest on October 15 is an attack on the integrity of the country. We will not allow [anyone] to damage the honour and reputation of the country. The state will use all of its power and resources to prevent the invasion of Islamabad,"" said Asif while speaking to the media in Sialkot.The politician also called for the courts to intervene and take notice of the matter. ""Do the courts not see what the PTI founder is doing with the integrity of the country? The actions of the judiciary today will determine their role in history,"" he said.Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal condemned the protest call by terming it "" political terrorism "" which is aimed at maligning the country. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, he expressed disappointment at the timing of the protest.""Now there is no doubt that terrorism in Karachi and political terrorism protest calls are similar,"" the minister said, adding that both aimed to destabilise the country.Iqbal said the PTI was destroying the economy of the country and urged the party supporters to see the harm caused by their actions.""The PTI is attempting to undermine the government's economic recovery efforts. It's crucial to acknowledge the damage caused by these actions and consider the consequences of supporting policies that hinder Pakistan's growth and development,"" he said.The minister also stated that the country cannot afford destructive politics. ""Just because the PTI's leader is jailed, doesn't justify chaos,"" he said.Separately, federal minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Amir Muqam also strongly rejected the PTI's protest call. ""It is proof of anti-nationalism. There is no doubt that PTI's agenda seems to be anti-Pakistan because the party has declared the protest on this important occasion,"" he said.However, the PTI was in no mood to back off and Bukhari said the party was not against any foreign visit but ""this illegitimate government"" was trying to create a false case of normality when ""a former prime minister and leader of the largest party is illegally in prison (according to the UN) along with his wife"".""And to top it off, he has been banned to meet his legal team, doctor or family, which is against all human rights conventions and our constitution.

The major event is expected to see high-level Chinese representation and will also be attended by Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Incessant violent incidents in Pakistan’s northwest and southwest have raised serious questions about the ability of its forces to protect high-profile events and foreigners in the country.The assailants, according to police, broke into the miners’ quarters in Balochistan’s Dukki district, gathered the workers together and opened indiscriminate fire. “A group of armed men attacked the Junaid coal company mines in Dukki area in the early hours using heavy weapons,” said Humayun Khan Nasir, in charge of Dukki police station. The victims belonged to various regions of Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan. “Most of the victims were from Pashtun-speaking regions within Balochistan.

He added the attackers also set fire to “10 coal engines and machinery”.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which often targets civilians and security forces, accusing them of robbing Balochistan of its resources, including minerals and gas.The BLA had carried out multiple attacks in Aug that resulted in more than 50 killings, including that of 23 passengers, mostly from Punjab province, who were shot dead after being taken out of their vehicles. On Monday the group had claimed responsibility for a suicide bomber attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers near Karachi airport. Two Chinese citizens were killed in that attack.There are hundreds of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in projects linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

In response, the Pakistan Army launched a strong counterattack on the Afghan checkpoints, resulting in significant casualties for the Afghan Taliban.The Pakistani newspaper's sources suggested that Pakistan would continue to take robust measures to defend its borders, and its security forces reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the country's territorial integrity, delivering a decisive response to this aggression from Afghanistan.This incident was not an isolated case of unprovoked aggression from Afghan forces. In the previous month, the Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing using heavy weapons, targeting Pakistani check posts from the Afghan region of Plosin. The fighting that took place during the night between September 8 and 9 resulted in the death of at least 16 Afghan Taliban fighters and the injury of 27 others.The Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021, allegedly with the support of Pakistan, which had hoped that they would eliminate the threat of militancy emanating from their soil.

The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has claimed that the decision to table the 'Constitutional Package' in Parliament had been postponed by the government at its request, The Dawn newspaper reported.The paper quoted sources in the party as saying that the stance regarding opposition to the amendment had not changed, calling the matter ""disputed"".According to a JUI-F source, the government agreed to postpone the amendment at the demand of Maulana Rehman. ""Now…this matter will be taken up after the SCO summit,"" said a party office-bearer.On Monday, the Maulana attended a multi-party moot on Palestine at the invitation of the president and the prime minister and also held a meeting with the bigwigs of the ruling coalition, giving rise to speculations that he had agreed to support the government.However, according to the party spokesperson, there was no truth to these reports while insiders termed the amendment disputed which the JUI-F chief would not agree to ""under the current circumstances"".Sources said the JUI-F endorsed a separate constitutional court but expressed reservations over the constitutional amendment.""Our concern was based on common sense - we demanded the document that we were supposed to vote for, but the government negotiating teams failed to do so,"" a senior party official remarked on the dialogue between the government and the JUI-F last month.The JUI-F still expects the government to share the draft with the party. The JUI-F leader said they would also share their draft on the constitutional court with the government and expected the government to do the same. In order to take everyone on board, the JUI-F leaders have suggested a separate constitutional bench instead of an independent court.On the other hand, the government is almost ready to table the constitutional amendment, and sources in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) believe that this time, it would not be rushed through Parliament.""There will be separate sessions of the National Assembly and Senate and it is likely to be held on October 18,"" they added.It is likely that the National Assembly and Senate sessions will separately be convened on the same day and after getting it cleared from one house, the amendment would be introduced in the other the same day.In order to achieve a two-thirds majority, the ruling alliance has been trying to win over Maulana Rehman as well as some Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-linked lawmakers whose votes against the party line would not be annulled following a review of Article 63A of the Constitution.The Pakistan Peoples Party and PML-N are in contact with Akhtar Mengal, the head of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) as well, hoping to secure the support of two BNP senators.Sardar Mengal, who recently resigned from the National Assembly, is still a member of the house as his resignation hasn't been accepted by the NA speaker, Dawn reported.",The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition.

These acts are part of a troubling pattern of desecration and violence against Hindu temples and deities that has intensified during the Durga Puja festival.The attack on the Puja mandap in Tantibazar has been described as part of a broader trend of violence against Hindus, particularly during significant religious events like Durga Puja. Reports indicate that this year alone, idols have been damaged in numerous districts across Bangladesh, with 19 incidents reported in just the last two weeks.The attacks follow a series of violent incidents that have plagued religious minorities in Bangladesh. Over recent years, there have been numerous reports documenting attacks on temples, vandalism of idols, and threats against worshippers. In 2022 alone, there were 12 recorded attacks on religious minorities, leading to significant injuries and damage to property. The situation has reportedly worsened since the political upheaval following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government, with many Hindus feeling increasingly unsafe during their religious observances.In response to these incidents, there have been calls for heightened security measures from Bangladesh government officials. The Bangladeshi army has announced plans to enhance security for Durga Puja celebrations, deploying police and other forces to protect worshippers.","India has raised ""serious concerns"" with Bangladesh over the attack on a Puja mandap in Tantibazar, Dhaka, as well as the theft of a crown gifted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the revered Jeshoreshwari Kali temple at Satkhira.
