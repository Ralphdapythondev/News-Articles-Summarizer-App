"Nearly 500 dead as Israel strikes 1,300 targets in Lebanon",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/nearly-500-dead-as-israel-strikes-1300-targets-in-lebanon/articleshow/113615935.cms,"Israel launched airstrikes on targets across southern Lebanon, killing nearly 500 people in one of the deadliest days of fighting in nearly two decades and fanning fears of all-out war.Some 1,650 people were wounded in the strikes and about 100 women and children were among the dead, the Lebanese health ministry said. Israeli officials said many of those killed were members of the Lebanese militia Hezbollah , and argued that the group had placed rocket launchers in private homes.The strikes were a major escalation just days after an attack in which pagers and walkie-talkies owned by Hezbollah members exploded. Israel didn’t take credit for that campaign but the group blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s government.“I want to clarify Israel’s policy: we do not wait for the threat, we are ahead of it,” Netanyahu said Monday. He predicted “complicated days” ahead.One Israeli military official said the country is focused on an aerial campaign to degrade Hezbollah’s military capabilities, suggesting a major ground invasion was not imminent.Israel Intensifies Strikes Into Lebanon | Israeli air campaign in Lebanon on Sept. 21–22But a senior US official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said it’s important to take seriously Israel’s preparations for an invasion and that the US is focused on breaking the escalatory cycle.In any event, it was the deadliest day of strikes since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The strikes occurred as world leaders including Netanyahu were descending upon New York for the annual high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip was set to be a focus.The US is urging restraint and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has spoken to Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant several times in recent days, stressing the need for a diplomatic solution.The two sides have been exchanging cross-border rocket fire almost daily since Israel’s war with Hamas erupted last October, but the conflict has stepped up in the past week.The US will send a “small number” of additional troops to the Middle East, Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said without elaborating. NBC News reported the military personnel may be ready to help Americans evacuate from Lebanon, adding the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier group could be sent to the region to augment the American military presence.The State Department warned Americans in an updated advisory dated Sept. 21 against traveling to Lebanon and said its embassy “may not be able to assist US citizens who choose to remain.” The department also urged US citizens to depart Lebanon via commercial options while they are still available.Netanyahu has said he would prefer using diplomacy to stop Hezbollah’s attacks, but such efforts are failing. His cabinet made the return of tens of thousands of civilians displaced from Israel’s north by the threat of attacks a primary war objective last week, while Gallant has said the military’s focus should shift from Gaza and Hamas to the northern front and Hezbollah.Both Hezbollah and Hamas are sponsored by Iran and considered terrorist organizations by the US.In a video message to the Lebanese people, Netanyahu added: “The IDF has warned you to get out of harm’s way. I urge you – take this warning seriously.”In northern Israel, hundreds of thousands of people rushed to bomb shelters after 250 projectiles were fired early Monday. Hezbollah has access to a new type of rocket that can reach as far as 100 kilometers (62 miles) and carry 170 kilograms of explosives in its warhead, the organization said on its Telegram channel over the weekend.Hezbollah said it had targeted Israeli army sites north of Haifa as sirens sounded, including in civilian areas. Israeli medics said eight people were wounded in northern Israel as a result of the Hezbollah assault. Israeli police reported a house being hit and rockets falling in several places in the Lower Galilee.In New York, Danny Danon, Israel’s UN ambassador, said in an interview that “Hezbollah has placed rocket launchers in private homes and other civilian facilities” and Israel had urged those nearby “to move away from those locations.”Netanyahu is scheduled to address the General Assembly this week, though his travel itinerary hasn’t yet been finalized.Danon said Netanyahu was scheduled to land in the US on Thursday morning, “speak at the UN on Friday morning and to head back to Israel Saturday night. Now, it can change, because we will follow the events in Israel.”Until last week, Israel and Hezbollah largely focused their strikes on areas near the border. Yet Israel has grown increasingly frustrated with its inability to stop Hezbollah’s missile and drone attacks.On Tuesday and Wednesday, Hezbollah and Lebanon blamed Israel for blowing up thousands of pagers and walkie talkies mostly used by members of the group. The two-day operation in Lebanon killed at least 39 people, including civilians and children, and injured thousands.Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the UN and world powers to act quickly to stop Israel and Hezbollah “falling into the unknown.”Hezbollah is a Shiite militant organization that, like Hamas, Iran has trained and funded. It is considered the most powerful non-state force in the Middle East, with tens of thousands of missiles and fighters at its disposal. It’s also a political party with substantial support in Lebanon.Also on Monday, an Israeli military spokesperson said it’s possible Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has been wounded or killed in air strikes on Gaza, after local media reported he has been incommunicado.“Regarding what has surfaced over the last day about Sinwar, I do not rule it out nor do I confirm it,” added the spokesperson, Daniel Hagari.The Israeli government says Sinwar masterminded the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza. Last month, he was promoted to succeed the group’s political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran, and is now the point-man for long-deadlocked talks mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt.The US has said that a cease-fire in Gaza will help calm regional tensions. Israel’s government says it cannot wait for a truce in the Palestinian territory before neutering the threat of Hezbollah.Hamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostage with its assault last Oct. 7. Israel’s subsequent air and ground offensive has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between combatants and civilians.","The US will send a “small number” of additional troops to the Middle East, Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said.

California Smartphone Restrictions: California mandates smartphone restrictions in schools to boost focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-mandates-smartphone-restrictions-in-schools-to-boost-focus/articleshow/113614123.cms,"California school districts will now be required to create rules limiting student smartphone use under a new law signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday.This legislation aims to curb distractions in classrooms and address the negative impact of social media on students' mental health . Several states, including Florida and Indiana, have already enacted similar laws, reported the news agency AP.Governor Newsom highlighted the importance of the law, stating, “This new law will help students focus on academics, social development, and the world in front of them, not their screens when they’re in school.”However, the law has drawn criticism.Some argue that enforcing the policy should not fall on teachers and that it could hinder students in emergencies. Troy Flint from the California School Boards Association expressed concern over the mandate, supporting districts that have independently restricted phone use after assessing community needs.The law mandates that by July 1, 2026, all districts must implement policies to limit or ban student smartphone use, updating these rules every five years. This follows a 2019 law that authorised districts to restrict student phone access. Recent pushes for such restrictions gained momentum after the US surgeon general urged Congress to warn the public about social media’s harmful effects on children.Some school districts, like Los Angeles Unified, have already voted to ban student phone use during the school day, effective from January 2024. Assemblymember Josh Hoover, who introduced the bill, emphasised that although students may struggle with phone restrictions, these policies help them focus and engage more socially.While some parents have expressed concerns about communication during emergencies as they may not be able to contact their children during such situations. However, the law allows exceptions for such situations. Proponents argue that silencing phones during emergencies, like active shooter incidents, may prevent phones from revealing students' locations.Schools implementing phone bans, such as Santa Barbara Unified, report improved student engagement . At Folsom’s Sutter Middle School, principal Tarik McFall noted that banning phones had transformed the school’s culture, encouraging more student interaction.Despite this, challenges remain. Teachers like Mara Harvey from Discovery High School in Sacramento point out that smartphones often serve as backup tools for students who forget their Chromebooks, which are essential for accessing online learning platforms.As California schools prepare to enforce these new rules, balancing technology’s role in education and minimising distractions will remain a focal point.",California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law limiting student phone use on Monday.

Among the deceased were Jonathan Bloomer, Chris Morvillo, Neda Morvillo, Charlotte Golunski, Ayla Ronald and Angela Bacares.TISG has stated that it will not seek damages from the crew or Lynch’s widow. Giovanni Costantino, TISG's CEO, had previously branded the yacht “unsinkable” and indicated that human error was to blame for the disaster. However, he has faced backlash for his handling of the situation, with critics saying he is trying to shift blame amid a growing public relations crisis.","Lawyer representing the builder of the Bayesian superyacht has filed a lawsuit against the widow of tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch.

It's just that he's a fictional insurance fraud detective who's been on the case since 1949. ""Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar "", a radio programme created by CBS that later found a devoted listenership in Iran for a Farsi-language version under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the 1960s, has returned to Iranian radio.It's not clear why exactly the network controlled by hard-liners have decided to bring back ""the man with the action-packed expense account"", but his reappearance harkens back to an era when Iran and the US enjoyed incredibly close ties.And the newly produced episodes introduce younger generations to a character that many older Iranians still have a decades-old fondness for.

The serial relied on the investigator's expenses account entries - like ""$10 deposit on the car I rented"" or ""one dollar, one drink for me"" - to propel the story forward as Dollar interviewed witnesses and suspects in the transatlantic accent common to detective stories of the era.Iran's version of ""Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar"" dropped the expense account format but kept the noir-light vibe, dramatic music and US location. Instead, the shows would end with Iranian state radio inviting the public to write in to explain what clue gave away the guilty party, with those getting it right having a chance to win a prize.After Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, the state radio and TV broadcaster found itself controlled by hardliners.

Election outcome:

Opposition results

Concession status:

Inauguration details:

Here are the key updates from Sri Lanka elections.

Economic focus

Campaign context: Economic hardships, stemming from a severe financial crisis, dominated the election campaign. Public anger was prevalent due to the ongoing austerity measures.

IMF agreement: Dissanayaka intends to modify the IMF deal rather than cancel it, with plans to reduce income taxes and sales taxes on essentials like food and medicine.

Historical context

Party background: Dissanayaka's party previously had marginal influence, winning less than 4% in the last parliamentary elections (2020). It led two failed uprisings in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in significant casualties.

Political shift: The current crisis has enabled a shift in public support toward Dissanayaka, who advocates for a new political culture to combat corruption.

Voter turnout

Participation: Approximately 76% of Sri Lanka's 17.1 million eligible voters participated in the election.

Geopolitical considerations

India-Sri Lanka relations: Dissanayaka's party assured India that Sri Lanka's territory would not be used against any nation, amid concerns about China's growing influence in the region.

Austerity measures and public sentiment

Wickremesinghe's tenure: The outgoing president's strict austerity measures stabilized the economy but led to increased poverty, with rates doubling to 25% between 2021 and 2022.

Public discontent: Widespread dissatisfaction with the previous government's policies was a key factor in Dissanayaka's rise.

Security and voting conditions

Election security: Thousands of police were deployed to ensure safety during the election, with a temporary curfew imposed post-voting despite no reported violence.

Celebration restrictions: No victory celebrations are allowed until a week after the final results are officially announced.

Sri Lanka's election commission formally announced on Sunday that Marxist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake won the presidential election, defeating incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe .

Princess Diana 's ballet teacher Anne Allan has written a book ' Dancing with Diana ' explaining an early sign of a doomed marriage that she picked up from an incident -- among many other recollections. In December 1985, Diana danced to Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" at the Royal Opera House in London. It was meant to be a surprise for Charles but it became a shock for him as Charles, according to the writer, did not approve of the princess dancing in a slinky gown with no stockings.""She wanted Charles to approve of it,"" Anne told Fox News. Charles' three-word reaction was ""well done, darling"". That's it. Charles immediately went on to doing something else. ""And when you’ve come offstage and your adrenaline is pumping … you just want somebody to tell you that you’re doing all right.""The episode is not unknown. The Season 4 of the Crown on Netflix showed the dance routine and its aftermath.Anne Allan explained that there might be two reasons for Charles' displeasure. One, he's probably not a man who likes surprises; and two, probably he did not like his wife wearing a slinky dress, showing her body.

Trump called for the state of Florida to take control of the investigation.Former US President and Republican Presidential candidate, Donald Trump, is competing against Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election scheduled for November 5th.The incident occurred on September 15 at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old from Hawaii, was detained in connection with the event.Trump claimed, ""The Kamala Harris/Joe Biden Department of Justice and FBI are mishandling and downplaying the second assassination attempt on my life since July.""Trump criticised the charges brought against the suspect, describing them as minor. He linked this to what he calls ongoing legal actions against him, stating, ""The charges brought against the maniac assassin are a slap on the wrist. It's no wonder since the DOJ and FBI have been coming after me nonstop with Weaponised Lawfare since I announced my first Historic Campaign for the Presidency"".He also expressed concerns about the neutrality of the federal agencies investigating these incidents. ""It's very difficult to trust the Biden/Harris DOJ/FBI to investigate the assassination attempts, due to Election Interference and the fake cases brought against me,"" Trump stated.Referring to a previous incident, Trump said, ""Shockingly, after the bullet went through my ear on that fateful day in Butler, Pennsylvania, the FBI Director went before Congress and falsely said that it may not have been a bullet, 'It was just glass or shrapnel' - a lie condemned by even my worst enemies.""The first assassination attempt occurred on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a bullet reportedly grazed Trump's ear during a rally.Trump requested that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis take over the investigation, arguing, ""If the DOJ and FBI cannot do their job honestly and without bias, and hold the aspiring assassin responsible to the full extent of the Law, Governor Ron DeSantis and the State of Florida have already agreed to take the lead on the investigation and prosecution.""He emphasized that Florida would handle the case more rigorously than federal authorities, stating, ""The TRUTH would be followed, wherever it leads. Our justice system is corrupt and discredited, especially as it pertains to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J Trump. Let Florida handle the case!""The incident has also sparked concerns about the effectiveness of the Secret Service in protecting high-profile targets such as Trump.","Former President Donald Trump has accused the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI of failing to properly handle an alleged assassination attempt on his life.

Federal Election Commission (FEC) records show that her campaign, alongside the Democratic Party , raised $361 million in August, giving her $404 million in funds for the important months before the November election.Trump’s campaign raised $130 million during the same period, receiving support from figures like Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman and businessman Timothy Mellon. His Make America Great Again (MAGA) PAC added $25 million, leaving him with $295 million in funds as of the end of August.Harris’ financial advantage has enabled her to dominate TV advertising, though she continues to avoid high-profile sit-down interviews as per the New York Post.Tesla founder Elon Musk made a significant contribution of $289,100 to Republican efforts and endorsed Trump, to secure congressional seats, according to FEC filings.Trump has claimed that if he loses the upcoming presidential election on November 5, he may not run again in 2028. “I think … that will be it"", he said.","US Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is outspending her Republican rival and former US President Donald Trump by nearly $5 million a day.

Suicide: 'I want to have some dignity': Terminally ill US woman plans assisted death in Switzerland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-want-to-have-some-dignity-terminally-ill-us-woman-plans-assisted-death-in-switzerland/articleshow/113609990.cms,"A terminally ill woman from Missouri, US is preparing to travel to Switzerland for a physician-assisted death . Gayle Hendrix has been battling lupus and interstitial lung disease for four years and says her lung capacity is steadily worsening, leaving her eager to maintain control over her final moments.“I’ve had a great life, and I want to have some dignity when I’m going to the next phase,” Hendrix told 12 KFVS.She plans to make the journey with her daughter, Charlene Foeste, and end her life on September 26.Hendrix led an active lifestyle filled with hiking and travel but now struggles to breathe and must rely on an oxygen machine. She explains that her decision to travel to Switzerland stems from not wanting to wait until she is no longer physically able to make the journey.“I don’t want to get to the point of, ‘This is existing, not living,’” she said.The 79-year-old's decision has sparked difficult conversations within her family. Her daughter, Charlene, admits she doesn’t agree with her mother’s choice but feels it’s not her place to interfere. “It’s not my choice. I do love her and support her,” Foeste said. “There’s no way on the planet my mum is going to do this alone, no way.”Physician-assisted death is legal in 10 US states and Washington DC, but Hendrix chose Switzerland due to restrictive US regulations , which require patients to have less than six months to live. Hendrix believes waiting until she’s closer to death would rob her of control. “I don’t want to wait that long,” she said. “I don’t want to get that sick.”Hendrix has long been an advocate for assisted suicide . Her journey to Switzerland was delayed due to a lack of available appointments, but the process was eventually set in motion.Although some of Hendrix’s friends and family disagree with her decision, she remains determined. “I just am peaceful about my decision, and it’s the right thing for me and my body,” she said, as per Fox News.","Gayle Hendrix, 79, has been battling lupus and interstitial lung disease for four years.

Donald Trump: 'Is Kamala Harris a Marxist?': Fake videos and AI images fuel communist claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-kamala-harris-a-marxist-fake-videos-and-ai-images-fuel-communist-claims/articleshow/113609651.cms,"US vice president Kamala Harris has faced numerous misleading claims linking her to socialism or communism since she became the Democratic presidential candidate, according to Factchequeado, US's largest Spanish-language fact-checking organisation. Experts believe these allegations exploit fears among voters who fled repressive regimes in countries like Cuba and Venezuela, according to BBC News .A viral video showed Harris and her running mate Tim Walz appearing to pose for a selfie in front of a sign for a far-left group, Revolutionary Communists of America. However, the video was manipulated by supporters of Donald Trump , known as the Dilley Meme Team. Despite revealing that the video was fake, it had amassed over 420,000 views and was widely shared among Spanish-speaking people.“It’s everywhere, this doubt: ‘Is this person a communist?’” said Evelyn Pérez-Verdía, a cultural strategist from south Florida. She recalled hearing discussions about the meme on the Spanish-language radio station La Nueva Poderosa in Miami. While the station clarified the story was “not true,” the hosts maintained their belief that “Kamala is a Marxist .”Samantha Barrios, a Venezuelan-American in Miami, accused right-leaning Spanish media of frightening immigrants, saying, “the main reason that we left our countries was to escape these regimes.”Some immigrants express frustration with the Democrats for not properly addressing their concerns about political repression in their home countries. However, Barrios warned against the way these legitimate fears are weaponised through false claims about Harris. Pérez-Verdía criticised the Democratic campaign for not taking these fears seriously. “Don’t laugh off people’s fears. It’s really disrespectful,” she said.The Digital Democracy Institute of the Americas (DDIA) has reported that notable right-wing figures have propagated a “fear of socialism” since 2020. The volume of AI-generated and doctored images related to Harris has reportedly surged to unprecedented levels.Elon Musk shared an altered image of Harris in a red uniform featuring the communist hammer and sickle on X, which received over 83.9 million views. Former US President Donald Trump further intensified the narrative during a presidential debate by branding Harris a “Marxist” and warning that she would turn the US into “Venezuela on steroids.” Following the debate, the term “Marxista” trended on social media, with Google searches for ""Marxist"" surging by 1000% in just 17 hours.","US vice president Kamala Harris has faced numerous misleading claims linking her to socialism or communism.

US is sending more troops to the Middle East as violence rises between Israel and Hezbollah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-is-sending-more-troops-to-the-middle-east-as-violence-rises-between-israel-and-hezbollah/articleshow/113608087.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US is sending additional troops to the Middle East in response to a sharp spike in violence between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon that has raised the risk of a greater regional war, the Pentagon said Monday.Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder would provide no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do.The US currently has about 40,000 troops in the region.On Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Truman , two destroyers and a cruiser set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, headed to the Mediterranean on a regularly scheduled deployment, opening the possibility that the US could keep both the Truman and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is in the Gulf of Oman, nearby in case further violence breaks out.“In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region. But for operational security reasons, I’m not going to comment on or provide specifics.”The new deployments come after significant strikes by Israeli forces against targets inside Lebanon that have killed hundreds and as Israel is preparing to conduct further operations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday warned Lebanese civilians in a videotaped message to evacuate their homes ahead of a widening air campaign. He spoke as Israeli warplanes continued to strike alleged Hezbollah targets in southern and eastern Lebanon.The State Department is warning Americans to leave Lebanon as the risk of a regional war increases.“Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, the US Embassy urges US citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,” the State Department cautioned Saturday. Ryder would not say if those additional forces might support the evacuation of those citizens if needed.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held back-to-back calls with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over the weekend as he pressed for a cease-fire and a reduction of tensions in the region, Ryder said.“Given the tensions, given the escalation, as I highlighted, there is the potential for a wider regional conflict. I don’t think we’re there yet, but it’s a dangerous situation,” Ryder said.The US presence in the Middle East is designed both to help defend Israel and protect US and allied personnel and assets. Navy warships are scattered across the region, from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Oman, and both Air Force and Navy fighter jets are strategically based at several locations to be better prepared to respond to any attacks.","Pentagon would provide no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do.

Mark Robinson: US Presidential Election Top 10: How Trump is making Martin Luther King Jr’s ‘dream’ come true with Mark Robinson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-election-top-10-how-trump-is-making-martin-luther-king-jrs-dream-come-true-with-mark-robinson/articleshow/113607473.cms,"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character.

Little did Martin Luther King Jr know that one day, America would become so ""DEIfied"" that even a black man, judged by the content of his character and the content he produced, would be openly embraced by white supremacists.Three-and-a-half decades ago, a footballer named Mark Robins was credited with saving Sir Alex Ferguson’s career as manager, after which Manchester United became the dominant force in English football. Now, a man named Mark Robinson might just cause Donald Trump’s downfall in the crucial swing state of North Carolina , even if he brings Martin Luther King Jr’s dream of racial equity to life in a perverse way. And, of course, Donald Trump has called him “Martin Luther King Jr on steroids.”Robinson’s bona fides as a racist are quite remarkable, even for a conservative politician, irrespective of his skin colour.Under his online persona ‘mindsoldr,’ Robinson posted extensively on a porn site called Nude Africa, which is rather disturbing, as who posts their racist thoughts on a porn website? The web page’s comments forum became Robinson’s canvas for his observations on race, sex, gender, and slavery. Most of his comments are the exact opposite of his public persona, reminiscent of the old joke that the Republican National Convention is the Super Bowl for Grindr.For example, Robinson, who is rather vocal in the bathroom debate, admitted to being a “peeping Tom” as a 14-year-old. He also claimed to be a connoisseur of ‘tranny-on-girl porn’ and added that it took the “man out while leaving the man in.”He said he wasn’t in the KKK because they didn’t let black people join, but if he was, he would call MLK Jr “Martin Lucifer Koon.” Describing himself as a black Nazi, he said slavery wasn’t all that bad and wished he could bring it back so he could own a few.During Obama’s presidency, he said he’d prefer Adolf Hitler and, like any true equal-opportunity racist, he was equally bigoted towards black, Jewish, and Muslim individuals. He called MLK Jr a “commie bastard” who was “worse than a maggot” and a ‘huckster.’ He also referred to Muslims as “little rag-headed bastards” and wrote that if “Muslims took over, liberals would be the first ones to be beheaded.”While Trump was reportedly warned about Robinson and his gubernatorial candidacy, including his remarks disparaging the civil rights movement and mocking victims of school shootings, Trump didn’t particularly care even when Robinson called child survivors who advocated for gun control “media prosti-tots,” accused Michelle Obama of being a man, liberally used the slur ‘hebe,’ a common pejorative term for Jews, and suggested it was acceptable to send violent protesters to the Elysian Fields.Trump seems to have learned his lesson, given that he recently held an event in North Carolina where Robinson was neither mentioned nor invited. Meanwhile, several top operatives of Robinson’s gubernatorial campaign have quit, and Trump’s former acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admits that he is “weighed down by a very unpopular Republican candidate for governor.”Trump currently holds a narrow lead over Harris (49% to 47%), and while North Carolina leans Republican, there’s always the danger of reverse coattails. It’s worth noting that the poll was conducted before the Mark Robinson allegations surfaced, and the state is absolutely crucial to Trump’s chances of returning to the White House.Everything is usually measured with the benefit of hindsight, and we are in an election where Nancy Pelosi, Dick Cheney, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are on the same page. Time will tell if Robinson’s deeply disturbing Uncle Peeping Tom act and his desire to “kiss and post” will cost Trump. Many years ago, Simon and Garfunkel sang: “And here's to you, Mrs Robinson. Jesus loves you more than you will know.” Given Mr Robinson’s stellar racist credentials, it’s a tough task for Jesus as well.","Mark Robinson, a Republican candidate for North Carolina governor, has been accused of being a racist.

Although the bench rejected the request to completely halt the legal proceedings, it granted relief by restraining the accountability court from issuing a final verdict.Khan and Bibi's lawyers argued that recent amendments in anti-corruption laws make the charges against the former prime minister and his wife invalid.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.
