"Taiwan: Taiwan detects 43 Chinese military aircraft, 8 navy ships around island",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/taiwan-detects-43-chinese-military-aircraft-8-navy-ships-around-island/articleshow/113684054.cms,"Representative Image (Picture credit: ANI)

Taiwan's defence ministry has reported a significant rise in Chinese military activity around the island, with 43 Chinese warplanes and eight naval vessels detected on Thursday over a 24-hour period. This surge in military presence comes as Taiwan faces growing pressure from Beijing , which views the democratically governed island as part of its territory.The Chinese aircraft were observed flying off Taiwan's east, west, and south coasts, with at least 11 crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait , which had previously served as an unofficial boundary between the two, Reuters reported.Additionally, 23 aircraft flew through the Bashi Channel , separating Taiwan from the Philippines, and then proceeded along Taiwan’s east coast. None of the aircraft entered Taiwan's territorial airspace.The People's Liberation Army ( PLA ) also practised air refuelling in the waters around the Bashi Channel as part of these manoeuvres. Taiwan's defence ministry noted that these drills are part of a broader pattern of increasing Chinese military activity, a trend that has intensified over the past five years.A security source, speaking anonymously, confirmed that these flights were part of China's annual military drills and involved simulated attacks aimed at preventing foreign forces from intervening during a potential conflict. The drills, which took place in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea , focused on denying foreign assistance and seizing air dominance.The increased Chinese military pressure follows full-scale war games conducted by China around Taiwan earlier in the year, coinciding with the inauguration of Taiwan's new president,Lai Ching-te , whom Beijing views as a ""separatist."" Despite offering talks, Lai has been rebuffed by Beijing, which continues to assert its claim over Taiwan and maintains the option of using force to achieve reunification.Meanwhile, Japanese media reported that a Japanese warship passed through the Taiwan Strait, marking a rare navigation in the region. This comes after similar passages by US and European navies asserting freedom of navigation in these contested waters.The situation remains tense as Taiwan monitors the movements and responds to the growing military presence, with no immediate response from China’s defence ministry.","43 Chinese warplanes and eight naval vessels detected on Thursday over a 24-hour period.

Russia has secret war drones project in China to bolster Ukraine war efforts: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-has-secret-war-drones-project-in-china-to-bolster-ukraine-war-efforts-report/articleshow/113683591.cms,"This is an AI-generated image (Pic credit: Copilot)

US expresses deep concern

China claims it maintains neutral stance

Chinese experts redesigned

G3 drone

Russia has established a weapons programme in China to develop and produce long-range attack drones for use in the war against Ukraine, Reuters reported citing two sources from a European intelligence agency. A subsidiary of Russian state-owned arms company Almaz-Antey , known as IEMZ Kupol, has developed and flight-tested a new drone model called Garpiya-3 (G3) in China with the help of local specialists, as outlined in a report sent by Kupol to the Russian defence ministry earlier this year, according to an exclusive report from Reuters.In a subsequent update, Kupol informed the defence ministry that it was capable of producing drones, including the G3, at scale at a factory in China, enabling the weapons to be deployed in the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, the term used by Moscow to refer to the war.Kupol, Almaz-Antey, and the Russian defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while China's foreign ministry said that it was not aware of such a project and that Beijing had strict control measures on the export of drones.Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based defence think-tank, said that the delivery of UAVs from China to Russia if confirmed, would be a significant development, as previous reports have mainly focused on the delivery of dual-use goods and components.However, Samuel Bendett, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), a Washington-based think-tank, suggested that Beijing would be hesitant to open itself up to international sanctions for assisting Moscow's war machine and that more information was needed to establish China's role in hosting the production of Russian military drones.The White House National Security Council expressed deep concern over the Reuters report, viewing it as an instance of a Chinese company providing lethal assistance to a US-sanctioned Russian firm, although there was no evidence to suggest theChinese government was aware of the transactions involved.Britain's foreign office called on China to stop providing diplomatic and material support to Russia's war effort, saying that the supply of weapons would directly contradict China's statements that it would not provide weapons to relevant parties of the conflict.According to the reports from Kupol to the Russian defence ministry, the G3 can travel approximately 2,000 km with a payload of 50 kg. Samples of the G3 and other drone models made in China have been delivered to Kupol in Russia for further testing, with the involvement of Chinese experts.The documents reviewed by Reuters, which are invoices sent to Kupol in the summer by a Russian firm serving as an intermediary with Chinese suppliers, indicate that Kupol has taken delivery of seven military drones made in China, including two G3s, at its headquarters in the Russian city of Izhevsk.The two intelligence sources said that the delivery of the sample drones to Kupol was the first concrete evidence their agency had found of whole UAVs manufactured in China being delivered to Russia since the Ukraine war began in February 2022.According to the documents reviewed by Reuters, Kupol has been working on a project to manufacture drones in China for use in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The reports and invoices provided by the sources suggest that Kupol has been communicating with the Russian defence ministry about this initiative, although the exact locations of the related sites were not specified.China has consistently denied supplying weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine, maintaining a neutral stance. The Chinese foreign ministry highlighted the contrasting behaviour of other countries with ""double standards on arms sales"" that have contributed to escalating the Ukrainian crisis. The ministry also said that there are no international restrictions on China's trade with Russia, in response to a previous Reuters report about Kupol producing the Garpiya-A1 long-range military drone in Russia using Chinese components.The documents indicate that Kupol has gone beyond sourcing parts and is now procuring complete UAVs from China.Both Russia and Ukraine are working to increase their drone production , as these weapons have proven to be highly effective in the conflict.David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector, suggests that Kupol could circumvent Western sanctions on Russia by establishing a production facility in China, where it would have access to advanced chips and expertise. However, Bendett from CNAS points out that China may be cautious about officially hosting a factory that builds UAVs for Russia, as it could expose the country to more severe sanctions.The G3, a drone developed by Kupol, is an enhanced version of the Garpiya-A1, based on reports sent to the Russian defence ministry. Chinese experts redesigned the G3 using the Garpiya-A1's blueprints, according to the Reuters report.Within eight months, Kupol said that the project in China would be ready to manufacture a Chinese-designed REM 1 attack UAV capable of carrying a 400kg payload. Two European intelligence sources compared this system to the US Reaper drone.The sources revealed that TSK Vektor, another Russian defence company, served as the intermediary between Kupol and Chinese suppliers in the project. They mentioned that the Russian companies collaborated with Redlepus TSK Vector Industrial, a Chinese company based in Shenzhen, without providing details on Redlepus' specific role.A separate document reviewed by Reuters outlines plans for Kupol, TSK Vektor, and Redlepus to establish a joint Russian-Chinese drone research and production centre in the Kashgar special economic zone in China's Xinjiang province. The document, which bore the logos of the three companies, did not specify the intended recipient or a timeline for the centre's operation.The proposed ""Advanced UAV Research and Manufacturing Base"" would span 80 hectares and have the capacity to produce 800 drones annually, according to the document.In a recent meeting in St Petersburg about drone production, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that his military had received around 140,000 drones in 2023 and aimed to increase this number tenfold within the year. He emphasised, ""Whoever reacts faster to demands on the battlefield wins.""","Russia has established a weapons programme in China to develop and produce long- range attack drones for use in the war against Ukraine.

Eric Adams: New York City Mayor Eric Adams indicted in federal corruption probe: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams-indicted-in-federal-corruption-probe-report/articleshow/113682958.cms,"New York City mayor Eric Adams indicted in federal corruption probe. (Picture credit: AP)

New York City Mayor Eric L Adams, who was elected nearly three years ago on promises to tackle crime, has been indicted following a federal corruption investigation, reported the New York Times citing sources familiar with the case.The indictment, which remained sealed as of Wednesday, is expected to bring criminal charges against Adams, marking the first time a sitting NYC mayor faces such charges.Details of the charges have not been made public, but Adams’ indictment is expected to shake New York City’s political landscape , coming just months before a competitive mayoral primary . Representatives for Adams and his legal team, including Brendan R McGuire and Boyd M Johnson III of WilmerHale , have declined to comment as of now.In a statement, Adams, 64, maintained his innocence: ""If I am charged, I am innocent and I will fight this with every ounce of my strength and spirit."" He acknowledged the scrutiny he faced as mayor, saying he became a target for standing his ground for New Yorkers.Adams is a former police captain and state senator who rose to prominence by advocating for police reform, particularly for Black officers. His career shift to politics culminated in his election as mayor, a dream he pursued for years. As mayor, Adams vowed to restore ""swagger"" to New York City and embraced various communities, but his administration has faced scrutiny for involving friends and associates with checkered pasts.Federal investigations have been looking into Adams’ inner circle, with some close aides under scrutiny by the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan. It remains unclear when Adams will surrender to authorities, as is common practice for white-collar defendants.Adams' indictment raises serious concerns about his future in office and his chances of securing a second term. Political figures such as Brad Lander, the city comptroller, have called for Adams to step down, saying, ""The most appropriate path forward is for him to step down so that New York City can get the full focus its leadership demands.""Maya Wiley, who ran against Adams in the 2021 mayoral race, expressed her disappointment at the federal probe: ""I can’t say how devastating I think it is where our city is today.""With New York City facing numerous challenges, Adams’ legal troubles are likely to become a significant issue as the city grapples with leadership uncertainties.","New York City Mayor Eric L Adams indicted in federal corruption probe.

Princess Diana 's ballet teacher Anne Allan has written a book ' Dancing with Diana ' explaining an early sign of a doomed marriage that she picked up from an incident -- among many other recollections. In December 1985, Diana danced to Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" at the Royal Opera House in London. It was meant to be a surprise for Charles but it became a shock for him as Charles, according to the writer, did not approve of the princess dancing in a slinky gown with no stockings.""She wanted Charles to approve of it,"" Anne told Fox News. Charles' three-word reaction was ""well done, darling"". That's it. Charles immediately went on to doing something else. ""And when you’ve come offstage and your adrenaline is pumping … you just want somebody to tell you that you’re doing all right.""The episode is not unknown. The Season 4 of the Crown on Netflix showed the dance routine and its aftermath.Anne Allan explained that there might be two reasons for Charles' displeasure. One, he's probably not a man who likes surprises; and two, probably he did not like his wife wearing a slinky dress, showing her body. "" I’m not quite sure whether he thought it was the appropriate thing for Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales.""But all that Diana was hoping was to light spark in their marriage.""She just wanted to bring romance into her life, because that’s what she thought it should be. And I know that they had many, many happy times together. . . . She would arrange a nice night . . . and Charles occasionally would do that, too. But he was probably a bit more pragmatic as a person.""""I think she was much more able to see possibility of how romance should be. I’m not sure if that was how Charles was. She loved holding hands, she loved having a cuddle. She was a very affectionate person. It meant a lot to her to have that in her life.""The performance was kept under the wrap till the last moment.""She just thought it would be great fun not telling Charles,"" said Allan. ""She would just appear, and it would be hugely entertaining, and everybody would maybe have a nice time.""""More than anything, she wanted to support her husband,"" said Allan. ""That’s what mattered to her. She loved him dearly, and she just wanted him to shine. . . . When articles became more and more about her, she just said, ‘I do wish they would spend more time photographing Charles than I. I don’t want to make things difficult.’""Princess Diana and Anne became friends later. And as a friend, the princess often asked Anne for her advice. ""I know he is seeing Camilla again,"" said Diana about her husband’s mistress, as quoted in the book. ""Why does he not love me? I really don’t understand.""I have tried everything, tried to conform to his wishes even though I don’t always agree. There’s no affection between us, and I am always on my own. I just want to be loved. I can’t keep going on like this. They are really expecting me to just say nothing and keep going. How do I do that?""""Anne, he runs off to Camilla whenever he can. It’s not at all what I want. I’d like the marriage to work, but it just isn’t for now. Do I just put up with it, hoping he will change?""","Princess Diana's ballet teacher Anne Allan has written a book'Dancing with Diana'In December 1985, Diana danced to Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" at the Royal Opera House in London.

Eric Kilburn Jr. , a 16-year-old football star from Goodrich High School in Michigan, has made headlines by setting two Guinness World Records for having the largest feet and hands of any living teenager. Standing tall at 6'10"", Eric wears size 23 shoes, which measure an astonishing 13.5 inches, while his hands span 9.13 inches—significantly larger than the average size.""People are usually amazed and feel comfortable starting conversations with me about the size of my feet and hands,” Kilburn shared with Guinness.This unique characteristic has not only made him a standout on the football field but has also allowed him to connect with many interesting individuals.Eric's extraordinary height has presented its fair share of challenges. Since fifth grade, he struggled to find shoes that fit, as typical stores didn't carry his size. Custom-made footwear, which can cost over $1,500, was often out of reach for him and his family. In Michigan's harsh winters, he faced painful foot issues from wearing ill-fitting Crocs.Eric's story captured the attention of major brands like Under Armour and Reebok, as well as NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal, who stepped in to provide him with properly fitting shoes. ""I was deeply moved by the outpouring of support and kindness from strangers. It was truly inspiring to see how many people genuinely care about helping others,"" he remarked.In response to the kindness he received, Eric and his mother launched theBig Shoe Network . ""I want to pay it forward and help those struggling to find clothes and shoes that fit, just like I was helped when I needed it most,"" he explained.In an exclusive interview with Guinness World Records, Kilburn expressed his gratitude for being part of the 2025 edition.

Dubai, renowned for its opulent skyscrapers like the Burj Khalifa and Princess Tower, epitomises luxury and a high quality of life. Each year, countless individuals flock to this vibrant desert metropolis in search of better opportunities and brighter futures. Yet, the story behind Dubai’s impressive skyline often overlooks the lives of the many labourers who work tirelessly to construct it.A significant portion of these workers come from India, earning daily wages as construction labourers in this bustling city.Recently, a viral video has shed light on the harsh living conditions faced by Dubai’s labourers, igniting widespread outrage. This heartbreaking reality was brought to the forefront by Instagram user Md Rafique, whose video revealed a seldom-seen aspect of Dubai: the overcrowded and inadequate living spaces many workers endure. The viral video reveals the living conditions of many migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, providing internet users with a stark glimpse into their struggles. The footage, which is circulating widely online, has ignited significant debate about the inhumane conditions these workers face.The footage shows a large hall with a tin roof, packed with shabby dormitories stacked closely together. Rows of bunk beds stretch on, illustrating the cramped quarters that thousands of workers call home after long, gruelling days on construction sites.The makeshift accommodations house workers from various countries, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, China, and India. After labouring under the relentless sun, these men return each night to rest in conditions that offer little comfort.The video has struck a chord with viewers, amassing over two million views and sparking discussions about the plight of these labourers. Comments reflect a mix of sympathy and outrage. One viewer lamented, “This is heartbreaking! They deserve so much better for all their hard work.” Another emphasised the need for advocacy for change, while some shared personal experiences, with one recalling, “I worked in Dubai years ago and witnessed this firsthand. It’s time the world knows.”Many have likened the situation to an animal farm. Pranav Roy remarked, “It’s no different than a chicken farm .” Tushar Jalavadiya advised, “You might as well stay in India with your family; no one should have to earn money under such conditions.” Radhika commented, “They claim to earn well in Dubai, but the reality is revealed online.” Ashwani Atwal stated, “It’s nothing more than a jail.”However, not all feedback was negative. Adil Chaudhary pointed out that workers receive a three-hour break during the summer, and that there are air-conditioned rooms and toilets available. He also noted that buses transport workers to and from their living quarters, with a rule that no room can house more than six people in Dubai.Many are calling for greater accountability from the companies employing these workers, with one comment stating, “These companies need to be held responsible for the living conditions of their workers!”","A viral video has shed light on the harsh living conditions faced by Dubai’s labourers.

Donald Trump on Wednesday urged Apple to aid FBI probe by decrypting the phones of the two accused of plotting assassination attempts on the former US president.

LOS ANGELES: A passenger was killed after a gunman hijacked a city bus in Los Angeles early Wednesday, leading to a slow police chase through downtown before the suspect was eventually arrested, authorities said.The armed man boarded the Metro bus with the driver and two passengers aboard shortly before 1 a.m. in South Los Angeles, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.Officers approached the bus as it slowly rolled away. A cavalcade of police vehicles followed it as the driver drove at gunpoint for the next hour. A flashing sign on the front of the bus read: ""Emergency. 911 Call Police.""Police deployed spike strips, which punctured one of the tires. After traveling more than 7 miles (11 kilometers), the bus eventually came to a stop at a downtown intersection near the city's Arts District, and the suspect surrendered, officials said.TV news footage showed a series of small explosions around the bus stopped in the neighborhood of lofts and warehouses, then police storming aboard with shields. The bus driver climbed out of window and ran to safety behind an armored vehicle while officers moved in.A man was found inside the bus with gunshot wounds, but details about what led up to the shooting were not immediately available. The victim was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, officials said.The driver and the second passenger were treated by paramedics at the scene and released. In a statement, Metro said the bus driver was OK and receiving the support he needs.Police praised the driver for keeping calm.""This operator continued to operate the bus in as safe a manner as he could under the circumstances, with the police trailing him for an hour before the spike strips finally took effect,"" Deputy Chief Donald Graham told reporters.The killing is the latest in a series of violent incidents, including stabbings and shootings on buses and trains as Los Angeles seeks to expand the transit system ahead of hosting the Olympics in 2028. In May, Mayor Karen Bass called for increased security on transit routes - a message she reiterated on Wednesday.""Every Angeleno has the right to go about their lives safely - especially on our public transportation systems and I will be urgently working with the members of the Metro Board as well as our Chair and Metro CEO to enhance the safety strategies that we implemented earlier this year,"" the mayor said in a statement.Janice Hahn, an LA County supervisor and chair of the Metro board, said transit officials must figure out how to prevent people from bringing weapons onto buses and trains.In March, a man who indicated he had a gun hijacked a Metro bus in downtown LA and then grabbed the wheel, causing the bus to collide with several vehicles and crash into a hotel.","A gunman hijacked a city bus in Los Angeles early Wednesday, leading to a slow police chase through downtown before the suspect was eventually arrested.

Former US President Donald Trump will hold a rally on October 5 in Butler, Pennsylvania, returning to the very location where he narrowly survived an assassination attempt on July 13, his campaign confirmed on Wednesday, according to the New York Post .The rally marks Trump’s first visit to the site since the attempt on his life by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks , who fired eight shots at the former president from a nearby building.One of the bullets struck Trump in the right ear, grazing him as he turned to look at a chart of immigration statistics. Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper moments later.Trump’s campaign pointed out the importance of the upcoming rally saying, “During his visit, President Trump will honour the memory of Corey Comperatore, who heroically sacrificed his life to shield his wife and daughters from the bullets on that terrible day.”Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter, was one of the casualties in the attack. Trump will also recognise two other individuals wounded in the shooting, David Dutch and James Copenhaver, and express gratitude to law enforcement and first responders for their swift actions.The former president's survival was attributed to divine intervention , remarked that he was “spared by God” to continue his mission to regain the presidency. The campaign further claimed, ""President Trump was saved in what the world has recognised as an act of divine providence.”The July assassination attempt was followed by a second in September, where Trump was targeted at his West Palm Beach golf course by a sniper identified as Ryan Routh . Both attempts have spurred investigations into security failures, leading to the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle.“After not one, but two attempts on his life in the past nine weeks, President Trump is more determined than ever to see his mission through to the end. In that Butler field on July 13, he took a bullet for democracy—and on November 5, he is going to save our democracy,” his campaign stressed Wednesday.","Trump will hold a rally on October 5 in Butler, Pennsylvania, returning to the very location where he narrowly survived an assassination attempt on July 13.

A video showing a Coca-Cola machine refusing to print the name “Jesus” on a custom soda can has sparked outrage among some Christian consumers , leading to calls for a boycott of the beverage giant. According to Daily Dot , the online drama began with a Facebook post by Antwoine Hill, who demonstrated at a Coca-Cola store how he could write the names of various religious figures, including “Allah” and “Satan,” but not “Jesus.” When attempting to print “Jesus,” Hill received an error message showing, “Sadly, we cannot automatically allow this text on the can!”.Hill's video prompted hundreds of comments, with many users vowing to stop purchasing Coca-Cola products. One woman declared, “We need to STOP buying coke!!! I’m done,” while another urged fellow Christians to avoid Coke products, stating, “The only language corporations understand is money.”The controversy also gained traction on X, where influencers encouraged Christians to withdraw their support for Coca-Cola.When the Daily Dot attempted to create a custom can with the name “Jesus” on the Coca-Cola website, they received a similar error message. According to the company, phrases may be rejected for various reasons, including being trademarked or potentially offensive.Despite the backlash, Hill expressed mixed feelings about the situation, saying, “This isn’t real persecution. I’m pointing out the obvious.” He supports the boycott to convey the importance of the name Jesus but acknowledges larger societal issues, saying, “I’m in the streets daily seeing the much bigger issues, drugs, violence, homelessness.”","A video showing a Coca-Cola machine refusing to print the name ""Jesus"" has sparked outrage among some Christian consumers.

American political strategist Scott Jennings has raised concerns over vice president Kamala Harris 's polling numbers, claiming they are “not good.” A recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS shows Harris holding a 12-point lead over former President Donald Trump among voters under 35, with 52% supporting her against Trump’s 40%. However, Jennings points out that Harris struggles to connect with key demographics, including young voters , voters of colour , and working-class individuals, falling short of the levels achieved by the Biden administration in 2020.“Trump's base is immovable, and right now, his administration and him personally are more powerful and more popular than they have ever been,” Jennings remarked, underscoring the challenges the Biden administration faces in garnering support among these crucial groups. While Harris maintains a lead among younger voters, with female voters preferring her over Trump 53% to 39%, only about half of young registered voters feel extremely motivated to vote.As both parties gear up for the race for the 47th US President, Harris’s approval ratings among young voters are raising questions about the Democratic Party ’s prospects in the upcoming elections. Both Democrats and Republicans are ramping up efforts to undermine their opponents while praising their strengths. With the election approaching, the engagement of young voters could prove decisive in shaping the electoral outcome.","A recent CNN poll shows Harris holding a 12-point lead over former President Donald Trump among voters under 35, with 52% supporting her against Trump’s 40%.

They are not above the law,"" the firm's founder Subodh Chandra told TNN.Chandra, a former federal prosecutor who has handled several high-profile cases including the police-shooting death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by Cleveland police, said he was fighting the case pro bono after inaction by the local prosecutor despite Trump-Vance claims about pet-eating Haitians being refuted the Ohio Governor and Springfield Mayor, both Republicans.Chandra is closely allied with the Democratic Party but he said his personal political affiliation had nothing to do with taking up the case. ""Trump and Vance must be held accountable to the rule of law in the same way any of the rest of us would be,"" he said, outlining the distress they had caused Springfield residents, including Haitian immigrants , many of whom came there at the invitation of city businesses to take up jobs locals would not.The Trump-Vance allegations of Haitian refugees eating dogs and cats now stands discredited following the discovery that the woman who first reported her cat (Sassy) missing and suspected her Haitian neighbors of taking it, later finding Sassy hiding in her own basement. She subsequently apologized to the neighbors, but by then MAGA activists, seizing on other unrelated events, had transported the vile ""Haitians eating pets"" narrative into the Trump campaign.Despite city officials debunking the rumors, Trump and Vance doubled down on the canard to vilify Haitians, vastly inflating their numbers in Springfield and accusing them of various crimes. In a rambling press conference in Los Angeles last week, Trump said ""I actually heard today it’s 32,000” Haitians in Springfield, while threatening, mistakenly, to deport them to Venezuela.Ignoring the charges of denigrating Haitians and causing unrest and threats to their lives in Springfield, the Trump campaign, responding to the criminal campaign, asserted that Trump and Vance are ""rightfully highlighting"" Kamala Harris's ""failed immigration system,"" which has allowed ""thousands of illegal immigrants"" into communities like Springfield and many others across the country.According to city estimates, there are 10000-12000 Haitians in Clark county which includes Springfield. While many are legal immigrants, others were granted temporary protective status (TPS) under a US law that was enacted in 1990 during the Presidency of George Bush sr to shelter victims of extreme natural calamities and civil war. Haiti is one of 16 countries eligible for TPS, a list that includes Afghanistan, Burma, and Nepal from the subcontinent.The US has granted TPS to 800,000 refugees going back to 1990, with the Haitian influx starting with the devastating earthquake in 2010 and subsequent civil conflicts.","Indian-American attorney Subodh Chandra's law firm representing a Haitian community group in Ohio has filed a criminal complaint against Donald Trump and JD Vance.

In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.
