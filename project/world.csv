WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange pleads guilty in deal with US securing his freedom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wikileaks-julian-assange-plea-deal-hearing-begins-in-saipan-part-of-deal-with-us-to-secure-his-freedom/articleshow/111270411.cms,"WikiLeaks says Assange to fly to Canberra within hours

What did WikiLeaks publish that sparked controversy?

NEW DELHI: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , admitted to one felony count related to the publication of classified US military information. The plea agreement, reached with prosecutors from the Justice Department, ensures his release and brings an end to a prolonged legal battle that sparked contentious debates surrounding press freedom and national security concerns.""Guilty to the information,"" Assange said, later joking to the judge during the proceedings that whether he is satisfied ""depends on the outcome of the hearing"".Assange, dressed in a black suit and ochre-colored tie with his hair slicked back, was present at the hearing in the Northern Mariana Islands, a Pacific US territory.The deal, disclosed Monday night in court papers, represents the conclusion of a more than decade-long legal journey for Assange, whose popular secret-sharing website made him a champion among press freedom advocates who believed he acted as a journalist to expose US military wrongdoing. However, US prosecutors have argued that his actions recklessly endangered the country's national security.Although the deal with prosecutors requires Assange to admit guilt to a single felony count, it also allows him to avoid serving any time in an American prison. He will receive credit for the five years he has already spent in a high-security British prison while fighting extradition to the US to face charges. Prior to his imprisonment in London, Assange spent years hiding out in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault, which he has denied.Assange, is set to fly to Canberra, Australia, in the coming hours, according to a statement released by WikiLeaks on Wednesday.According to the social media post by WikiLeaks, Assange is ""Expected to depart in 2 hours, 58 minutes. To Canberra, Australia."" The plea deal is anticipated to pave the way for his release and subsequent journey to the Australian capital.In April 2010, WikiLeaks published a video depicting a US helicopter attack in Baghdad from 2007, which resulted in the deaths of twelve individuals, including two journalists from Reuters. The release of the classified video led to the arrest of Bradley Manning, a US military specialist, in June.Subsequently, in July, WikiLeaks disclosed over 91,000 documents, primarily consisting of confidential US military reports pertaining to the war in Afghanistan. This was followed by the release of approximately 400,000 classified US military files in October, which detailed the Iraq war from 2004 to 2009.These disclosures constituted the most extensive leaks of their kind in the history of the US military. Later in the same year, WikiLeaks released thousands of US diplomatic cables, which contained frank assessments of foreign leaders and candid evaluations of security threats. Among these cables were messages from the former king of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah, ""repeatedly urging the United States to attack Iran's nuclear program"" and others concerning China orchestrating cyberattacks against the United States.","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange admitted to one felony count related to the publication of classified US military information.

Trump's attorneys accused of 'hijacking' classified documents hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-attorneys-accused-of-hijacking-classified-documents-hearing/articleshow/111271475.cms,"NEW DELHI: Donald Trump 's classified documents case reached a heated conclusion after prosecutor for special counsel Jack Smith accused former President's lawyers of hijacking the hearing with far-fetched allegations about the case.On the third and final day of the hearing, the prosecutor accused Trump's legal team of ""hijacking"" the proceedings with far-fetched allegations unrelated to the matters before the court. US District Judge Aileen Cannon quickly intervened, stating, ""There is no hijacking going on -- it's about to end.""According to ABC news, Judge Cannon convened the hearings to consider the defense's requests for case dismissal and limitations on prosecutors' use of selected evidence. Trump, who pleaded not guilty last year to 40 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials after leaving the White House, has denied all charges and called the probe a political witch hunt.During the 90-minute hearing, Cannon appeared skeptical of the defense's arguments that the evidence seized from Mar-a-Lago should be tossed due to a lack of specificity in the search warrant. She repeatedly told Trump's lawyers that their arguments seemed ""far afield"" and that she was ""unclear"" about how they believed the warrant and search should have been conducted.Trump's lawyers argued that the FBI agents were given vague instructions, the search warrant affidavit omitted key details, and the raid went too far by including searches of the bedrooms of Trump's wife and youngest son. However, Cannon questioned the relevance of the property's size and pushed the prosecutor to explain why the search extended to the bedrooms, ABC news reported.The prosecutor, David Harbach, admitted there was no direct evidence of boxes being moved to the child's room but argued that it would have been irresponsible not to search there given the belief that Trump stored boxes in odd locations. He insisted that there was no rummaging during the search.Cannon appeared unconvinced by the defense's argument that prosecutors made significant omissions in the search warrant application, remarking that she was ""failing to see why adding into the affidavit the undisputed and obvious point"" would make a difference. She emphasized that the key issue was Trump's post-presidency handling of classified documents.according to the report, despite Cannon's previous rulings supporting the defense, she signaled a willingness to side with prosecutors on the issue of the search, stating that she had a ""hard time"" buying the defense's argument. The hearing grew tense as both sides made their arguments, with Cannon urging them to stay focused on the motion at hand.The admissibility of notes by Trump's former lead attorney, Evan Corcoran, was not addressed during the public portion of the hearing, but Cannon noted that the topic of ""presumptively privileged material"" was discussed under seal during the morning session.Judge Cannon concluded the hearing without issuing any ruling from the bench, leaving the outcome of the defense's requests uncertain.","Donald Trump's classified documents case reached a heated conclusion after prosecutor accused former President's lawyers of hijacking the hearing.

"Assange to plead guilty to be free, ending standoff with US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/assange-to-plead-guilty-to-be-free-ending-standoff-with-us/articleshow/111270048.cms,"Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange is on a plane to Saipan where he will plead guilty to leaking US national security data as part of a deal that will allow him to return to his home Australia.The flight took off from Bangkok for the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, a US commonwealth in the Pacific, where in a district court he is expected to be sentenced to the more than five years he already served in a UK prison. Under the plea deal, the 52-year-old will escape a potentially lengthy sentence in the US. If he had been convicted, Assange could have faced a maximum of 170 years in a federal prison.The plea deal brings an abrupt conclusion to a criminal case of international intrigue and to the US govt's yearslong pursuit of a publisher whose hugely popular secret-sharing website made him a cause celebre among many press freedom advocates who said he acted as a journalist to expose US military wrongdoing. US prosecutors, in contrast, have asserted that his actions broke law and put the nation's security at risk.WikiLeaks came to prominence in 2010 after it released hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq along with swaths of diplomatic cables. The trove of more than 700,000 documents included battlefield accounts such as a 2007 video of a US Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff. That video was released in 2010.Negotiations toward a plea agreement heated up in recent months after Prez Biden said he was considering a request from the Australian govt to strike a deal. However, a White House National Security Council spokesman said the move was an independent decision made by the justice department. Allies of Assange celebrated the plea deal, including former Australian deputy PM Barnaby Joyce who said the result was the work of international lobbying from across the political spectrum in Washington.","Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange is on a plane to Saipan where he will plead guilty to leaking US national security data.

"Anti-tax protesters storm Kenya's parliament, drawing police fire as president vows to quash unrest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/anti-tax-protesters-storm-kenyas-parliament-drawing-police-fire-as-president-vows-to-quash-unrest/articleshow/111270492.cms,"NAIROBI: Thousands of protesters stormed Kenya's parliament Tuesday to protest tax proposals , burning part of the building, sending lawmakers fleeing and drawing fire from police in unrest that the president vowed to quash. Several people were killed.It was the most direct assault on the government in decades. Journalists saw at least three bodies outside the complex where police had opened fire, and medical workers reported five people killed. Clashes spread to other cities. There was no immediate word on arrests.""Today's events mark a critical turning point on how we respond to threats to our national security,"" President William Ruto said, calling the events ""treasonous"" and vowing to quash the unrest ""at whatever cost.""Kenya's defense minister said the military had been deployed to support police during the ""security emergency"" and ""breaching of critical infrastructure.""Protesters had demanded that legislators vote against a finance bill imposing new taxes on East Africa's economic hub, where frustrations over the high cost of living have simmered. Youth who had voted Ruto into power with cheers for his promises of economic relief have taken to the streets to object to the pain of reforms.Lawmakers managed to pass the bill before fleeing through a tunnel as protesters outmaneuvered police and poured in. The fire at the building was later put out.The Kenya Medical Association said in a statement that at least five people were fatally shot while trying to treat wounded people at the scene. It said more than 30 people were wounded, at least 13 with live bullets. Police fired live ammunition and threw tear gas canisters at protesters who sought treatment at a medical tent at a nearby church. Elsewhere in town, Kenyatta National Hospital said it received 45 casualties.One person shot dead was wrapped in a Kenyan flag and carried away. Another lay on the sidewalk, their head in the gutter.Internet service in the country noticeably slowed in what NetBlocks called a ""major disruption,"" and at least one broadcaster issued a statement saying that ""we have received threats from the authorities to shut us down.""Ruto had been outside Nairobi attending an African Union retreat. He was expected to sign the finance bill into law this week. He has two weeks to act but faces calls from religious and other leaders to think again.The nearby office of the Nairobi governor, a member of the ruling party, also was briefly on fire Tuesday, smoke pouring from its white facade. Police water cannons were used to extinguish the fire.Protesters could be heard shouting, ""We're coming for every politician.""The Kenya Human Rights Commission shared a video of officers shooting at protesters, and it urged Ruto to issue an immediate order to ""stop the killings.""The president instead said the government had ""mobilized all resources"" to ensure order.On Sunday, Ruto tried to calm the rising public tensions, saying he was proud of the young Kenyans who came out to exercise their democratic duty in earlier protests. The politician who had promoted himself as a ""hustler"" from humble beginnings said he would engage them on their concerns.Youth had announced they were uniting to keep the government in check as prices for fuel, food and other necessities have soared. In Nairobi, a regional hub for expatriates and home to a United Nations complex, the inequality among Kenyans has sharpened along with long-held frustrations over state corruption.Opposition to the finance bill has united a large part of the country, with some explicitly rejecting the tribal divisions that have torn Kenya apart in the past. Some who had passionately supported Ruto felt betrayed.""I fell for his lies. Now I'm out here regretting why I voted for him,"" youth Oscar Saina told The Associated Press last weekAs throngs of protesters rushed through the streets Tuesday, defiance emerged elsewhere in the country - including in the town where the president was, Naivasha, as protesters chanted ""Ruto must go.""Protesters tried to storm the State House in the western city of Nakuru, a witness said. There were clashes in the western lakeside city of Kisumu. The governor of Mombasa, Kenya's second largest city, joined protesters outside his office and expressed his support for them.Protesters burned ruling party offices in Embu in central Kenya, the Nation newspaper reported. Citizen TV showed footage from Nyeri in central Kenya with police confronting protesters in the smoking streets.A national gathering of Catholic bishops urged police not to attack protesters and pleaded with the government to listen to citizens' pain over the ""unwarranted"" taxes, saying ""the country is bleeding ... families are immensely suffering.""Two people died in similar protests last week, and civil society groups have raised the alarm about a crackdown.The Kenya Law Society President Faith Odhiambo said earlier Tuesday that 50 Kenyans, including her personal assistant, had been ""abducted"" by people believed to be police officers. Some had been vocal in the demonstrations and were taken from homes, workplaces and public spaces ahead of Tuesday's protests, according to civil society groups.A statement by diplomats from 13 Western countries including the United States said they were ""shocked"" by the scenes outside parliament and expressed concern about the violence and abductions of protesters.Police officials did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Parliament Speaker Moses Wetangula had directed the inspector general of police to provide information on the whereabouts of those missing.Also Tuesday, hundreds of Kenya's police officers, long accused of abuses by human rights watchdogs and others, arrived in Haiti to lead a United Nations-backed multinational force against the powerful gangs who have the country in its grip. The deployment faces a legal challenge in Kenya but Ruto's government has gone ahead, with the thanks of US President Joe Biden.","President William Ruto calls the events ""treasonous"" and vows to quash the unrest ""at whatever cost"" The military is deployed to support police during the ""security emergency,"" the defense minister says.

It will commence with actions against terrorists. The operation has no political motive, its sole purpose is to counter the surge in terrorism,” the minister said.“We fought two wars under the Zia-ul-Haq and Musharraf regimes for US interests. This operation, however, is being conducted on our own terms, not at the behest of China or anyone else,” he said.The defence minister assured that there would be no evacuations during this operation.","PM Shehbaz Sharif had announced plans to launch a full-scale offensive, named “Azm-e-Istehkam (Resolve for Stability)”, to eliminate terrorism and extremism.

Two Nasa astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are still orbiting the earth aboard the International Space Station , nearly two weeks past their scheduled return date.Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which faced numerous postponements prior to its launch on June 5, encountered thruster problems during its journey to the ISS.The delay is due to a series of helium leaks detected on the Boeing Starliner spacecraft , which transported them to the ISS on its inaugural crewed mission.Boeing and Nasa engineers are diligently working to resolve the issue and ensure the safe return of the astronauts. According to Nasa, the spacecraft is ""performing well in orbit while docked to the space station.""Nasa said that astronauts Wilmore and Williams have the ability to undock from the space station and return to Earth whenever necessary they are not ""stranded"", they are just being kept in orbit passed their planned return to ""allow mission teams time to review propulsion system data.""""We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,"" Nasa's Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said in a statement reported by Newsweek.""We are letting the data drive our decision making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance,"" he added.Sunita Williams is an accomplished Nasa astronaut and a distinguished US Navy officer, and has been selected to serve as the co-pilot alongside Wilmore on the Starliner mission.In 1987, Williams began her career as a junior commissioned officer in the Navy. Following a six-month assignment at the Naval Coastal System Command, she successfully completed her training and earned the designation of Basic Diving Officer.Sunita Williams became the first woman to pilot a test spacecraft on its maiden flight to space. Williams, an astronaut who previously held the record for the highest number of spacewalks completed by a woman.She achieved a total of seven spacewalks throughout her career. In addition, Williams set another record by accumulating 50 hours and 40 minutes of spacewalk time, the most ever recorded by a female astronaut.Williams has participated in multiple missions to the International Space Station (ISS), in 2012 she was named the commander of the space station, becoming only the second woman to do so.The 58-year-old has earlier spent 322 days in space, and held a record for maximum hours of spacewalk by a woman. This is her third space flight, others being in 2006 and 2012.In a candid talk, Sunita also shared her journey of becoming an astronaut. ""I did not dream of becoming an astronaut. I loved animals and wanted to be a veterinarian. I was a good swimmer, too, and my brother talked me into going to the Naval Academy. I was a helicopter pilot and until my mid-twenties didn't realize that I could become an astronaut.""Sunita's voice filled up with emotion when she was asked about her close friend and colleague Kalpana Chawla. Her death in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster did not make Sunita nervous.""We had trained a lot and I had confidence in the team that was rebuilding the system. I had to continue Kalpana's dream,"" she said.Sunita's passion for adventure and the outdoors finally got her thinking about a career as astronaut. As students listened in awe, she gave them a piece of advice. ""Find something that you like doing and you will do it well. Put your mind to it.""Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore is an experienced Nasa astronaut and former US Navy test pilot. Nasa selected Wilmore aged 61, to join their astronaut program back in 2000.Originally from Tennessee, Wilmore currently resides in Houston.He has participated in two prior space missions, one of which involved piloting the Space Shuttle to the ISS in 2009, during the final stages of the shuttle program before its retirement.In 2000, Barry was picked to join Nasa's astronaut corps. Over the course of his two prior space missions, he has spent a combined total of 167 days in orbit.The initial plan for Wilmore and Williams was to make their way back to Earth aboard the Starliner on June 22. However, this date was later postponed to June 26, and then pushed back on Friday to a date that has not yet been determined.Mark Nappi, who serves as the vice president and program manager of the Commercial Crew Program for Boeing said that despite the setbacks, ""Wilmore and Williams remain 'overwhelmingly positive.""The Starliner spacecraft has the capability to stay connected to the space station for a maximum duration of 45 days.","Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are still orbiting the earth aboard the International Space Station.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been released from Belmarsh high-security prison in southeast London after five years in British custody. His wife, Stella Assange, expressed her gratitude to campaigners for their support, sharing the news on the social media platform X. ""Julian is free!!!!"" she wrote, adding, ""Words cannot express our immense gratitude"" to everyone who supported the global push for his release.Assange's release marks a significant turn in a prolonged legal battle that began with his detention for skipping bail related to Swedish sexual assault charges, which were later dropped. Assange, who was accused of disclosing US military secrets, had been fighting extradition to the United States.Assange's mother said his ""ordeal is finally coming to an end"", in a statement to Australian media following news of a plea deal for his release.""I am grateful that my son's ordeal is finally coming to an end. This shows the importance and power of quiet diplomacy,"" Christine Assange said in a statementHere is all you need to know Assange, his impriosnment and release:Assange was released after the UK High Court granted him bail. WikiLeaks announced, ""Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of June 24, after having spent 1,901 days there."" This decision followed a successful appeal against his extradition to the US.Assange was granted bail by the UK High Court and left Belmarsh prison on the morning of June 24. He was released at Stansted airport in the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK.WikiLeaks emphasized the impact of sustained global campaigns: ""This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations."" These efforts created the space for negotiations with the US Department of Justice, leading to a deal.While the deal has not been formally finalized, it allows Assange to plead guilty to a single count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defense documents. He is expected to be sentenced to 62 months of time already served.In 2010, WikiLeaks published a vast collection of classified US military documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, marking the most significant security breaches in US military history. The release also included a substantial number of diplomatic cables.The indictment against Assange was brought forth during the administration of former President Donald Trump, stemming from WikiLeaks' extensive disclosure of confidential US documents. These documents were originally leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. military intelligence analyst who faced prosecution under the Espionage Act.The released documents, numbering over 700,000, encompassed diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts. Among them was a 2007 video depicting a U.S. Apache helicopter opening fire on suspected insurgents in Iraq, resulting in the deaths of twelve individuals, including two Reuters news staff. The video was made public in 2010.Assange is due to plead guilty to violating US espionage law, specifically conspiring to obtain and disseminate classified national defense information. The charges stem from WikiLeaks' 2010 release of classified US military documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Assange spent 1,901 days in Belmarsh prison. He married his wife Stella while in custody and will now be reunited with her and their two children. Stella Assange thanked supporters, saying, ""Julian paid severely for these principles, and for the people's right to know.""Assange will appear in US federal court in the Northern Mariana Islands to plead guilty. Following his plea and sentencing, he is expected to return to Australia.WikiLeaks has expressed immense gratitude for the support from various quarters, including grassroots organizers, press freedom advocates, and political leaders. The Australian government, which has been advocating for Assange's release, had no immediate comment. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has previously stated, ""Mr. Assange’s case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration.""Assange's family and supporters have noted that his physical and mental health have suffered during his legal battles and years in confinement.

Emmanuel Macron: Extreme opposition parties would cause civil war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-extreme-opposition-parties-would-cause-civil-war/articleshow/111246771.cms,"President Emmanuel Macron said the agendas of the far-right and far-left blocs in France’s upcoming legislative elections pit the country’s people against each other, going so far as to say that “extreme” parties could spark a “civil war.”The far-right National Rally ’s plan to deal with crime and insecurity “refers to people of a religion or an origin — it divides and it leads to civil war,” Macron said in an interview with a Génération Do It Yourself podcast aired Monday evening. The far-left France Unbowed that’s part of a hastily cobbled alliance is also peddling sectarian politics that would provoke similar hostilities, he said.The increasingly strident comments from Macron’s camp reflect a last-ditch attempt to woo voters as his centrist party trails behind the National Rally and the leftist New Popular Front in the polls with less than a week before the first round of voting. One pollster even suggested the far-right party could clinch an absolute majority in the National Assembly, though France’s two-round voting system makes forecasting tricky.In the days after Macron’s surprise call for an election to renew the National Assembly two weeks ago, his allies have taken to the air waves to speak of the dangers of the far right or the far left coming into power. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has said a government by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally would harm “civil peace,” without providing any evidence to support his claim. He has also warned that both the far-right and the left would be disastrous for the economy.Opposition parties have accused Macron and his allies of fear mongering to spook voters. The head of the French Unbowed party, Jean-Luc Melenchon, on Monday rejected Macron’s “civil war” comment, saying it’s the president who tends to divide the French.“He’s always around when it comes to setting fires,” he said, alluding to recent political tensions in France’s overseas territory of New Caledonia.Comments from Macron’s party have done little to halt the rise of the National Rally and the alliance of the left in the polls. Le Pen’s party would win the first round of the French legislative election with 36%, according to latest Ifop-Fiducial poll of voting intentions published Monday. The alliance of left-wing parties would get 29.5%, while Macron’s group would get 20.5%.Investors dumped French assets in the days after Macron’s call for the vote, fretting over how a new government could further stretch the country’s budget deficit. The turmoil pushed the risk premium on French bonds versus German ones to the highest since 2012 last week, though that spread narrowed slightly on Monday.Le Pen's Party Is Still in Front, With Leftist Alliance Second | French far right leads ahead of first round of voting June 30The first round of the election is set for June 30, with the second round slated for July 7. Macron, who called for the vote after his party was crushed in the European Parliament election, seemed to acknowledge in the podcast that his group may face a loss in the ballot.National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has been working to assuage voters that he can be trusted overseeing the country’s economy.On Monday, he outlined the party’s plan to pay for a reduction in sales tax on energy and fuel — – which would cost €7 billion ($7.5 billion) a year – by cutting France’s contribution to the EU budget, closing tax advantages for shipping firms and boosting levies on the profits of energy companies.The National Rally “is the only movement to implement immediately and reasonably the expectations of French people. In three words: we are ready,” he said. “We aim to bring the country back to budgetary reason.”Le Pen’s Party Seen Winning Biggest Share of Seats | Projected number of lawmakers in French National AssemblyMost pollsters predict that the National Rally will form the largest group in the National Assembly but fall short of the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority. The latest survey by Odoxa predicts the party will get between 250 to 300 seats.This scenario — where National Rally wins the most seats in the legislature but falls short of an absolute majority — would likely inflict gridlock on the lower house, meaning any ambitious legislation or reform would be difficult to pass.Get Bloomberg’s coverage of the French election in your inbox by signing up to our newsletter, The Paris Edition.

Sheri Biggs wins republican nod for US house in South Carolina over Trump-backed candidate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sheri-biggs-wins-republican-nod-for-us-house-in-south-carolina-over-trump-backed-candidate/articleshow/111272014.cms,"COLUMBIA: Sheri Biggs , a nurse practitioner and air national guard officer, won the republican nomination for the US house in South Carolina 's 3rd district on Tuesday, defeating a challenger who called himself former president Donald Trump 's pastor.In November, Biggs will be a heavy favorite in the most republican district in GOP-dominated South Carolina. She was backed by republican gov Henry McMaster, who she and her husband have been longtime friends and financial backers.Biggs defeated Mark Burns, a black pastor who has been by Trump's side for nearly a decade and has unsuccessfully run for Congress twice before.This was Biggs' first run for political office and if she wins in November, she will be only the second republican woman South Carolina has sent to Congress. US rep Nancy Mace is still serving for the 1st district.The seat is open after republican rep Jeff Duncan decided not to run again after seven terms. Duncan's wife of 35 years filed for divorce in 2023, accusing him of several affairs.Biggs will face the democratic nominee, Sherwin-Williams paint store manager Byron Best from Greenwood, and Michael Bedenbaugh, of the Alliance Party, in November.The district in the northwest corner of the state contains several small population centers.While longtime friends Trump and McMaster were on opposite sides, there was no apparent animosity between the endorsers. McMaster did campaign in person for Biggs, while Trump didn't make a visit to South Carolina for Burns.McMaster and Trump go back a long way. McMaster was the nation's first statewide elected official to back Trump in early 2016. Trump said when he became president he asked then-South Carolina governer Nikki Haley to become UN ambassador so McMaster could move from lieutenant governor to the state's top job.Biggs and Burns had similar, popular views for republicans, like ending nearly all abortions, closing the border and fighting inflation, as well as a total disdain for ideas from democrats.Burns won the June 11 primary with 33% of the vote, but Biggs was just a few points behind.With similar agendas, the two-week sprint to the runoff was more about style. Burns called Biggs a ""swamp creature"" who wouldn't fight the establishmentBiggs, who is a lieutenant colonel in the air national guard, said Burns misconstrued his academic and military background and voted for former democratic president Barack Obama . Biggs has promoted pictures of her taken with Trump and said she is the candidate who can bring people together.She said Tuesday evening that she will help heal the nation's mental, fiscal, and spiritual problems and promised to defend conservative values.""I stand here ready to not only win this seat in November but also to help President Trump win back the White House ,"" Biggs said in a statement on social media.Both candidates have invested heavily from their own money. Biggs loaned her campaign nearly $350,000 while raising an additional $182,000 from individual donors.Burns has taken out $500,000 in loans for the 2024 campaign and raised a little over $16,000 from individuals. He still owes a $100,000 loan from an unsuccessful 2022 run in the neighboring 4th district. And unlike Biggs, Burns has not filed a required ethics disclosure form detailing his personal finances, which would give a glimpse into his personal worth and ability to pay the loans back.In Lexington County, just west of Columbia, voters rejected the last of the three republican ""Sister Senators,"" who helped defeat a near-total abortion ban in South Carolina.Attorney Carlisle Kennedy defeated state sen Katrina Shealy in a runoff, ending her 12-year career in the senate. Kennedy has no opposition in the November general election.Kennedy finished second in the June 11 primary with 36% of the vote to Shealy's 40%, but was able to consolidate votes from those who didn't want to return Shealy to the statehouse.Shealy, along with fellow republican sens Sandy Senn and Penry Gustafson, were given the John F Kennedy profile in courage award for people who risk their careers for the greater good after they joined with democratic lawmakers last year over the abortion measure. The general assembly eventually passed a measure that would ban most abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy before most people know they are pregnant.The Sister Senators said a pregnant woman shouldn't lose control of her body as soon as an egg is fertilized.Senn lost her primary by 33 votes, while Gustafson got only 18% of the vote. They both were in Lexington County campaigning Tuesday for Shealy.Outside of a democratic senator mostly drawn out of his district due to redistricting, the women are the only ones in the 46-seat South Carolina senate to lose their reelection bids.Shealy told reporters Tuesday night she doesn't think her political career is over. She said she plans to spend the next four years going after the chief backers of the total abortion ban in the state house and senate who she thinks unfairly attacked her.""I'm going after them with all I've got,"" Shealy said.","Sheri Biggs, a nurse practitioner and air national guard officer, won the republican nomination for the US house in South Carolina's 3rd district on Tuesday.

Going after Biden

WASHINGTON: Mass expulsions? Political revenge? World peace? A new golden age? As Donald Trump vies for another term in the White House, America is abuzz with speculation over how life might look with the ex-president back at the helm.In a series of interviews and campaign rallies, the republican has offered some clues.Here are Trump's plans for the United States and the world, as set out by the candidate himself.President Joe Biden 's rival in November's election has pledged to launch the biggest deportation operation of illegal migrants in US history on his first day in office.""We're going to get them out as fast as we can,"" he has said, accusing undocumented migrants of ""poisoning the blood of our country.""The 78-year-old, known for his unfinished border wall project, has said he would be happy to ""use the military"" as part of the effort and would open detention camps to process targets for expulsion.""On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic US citizenship,"" he said in a campaign video.He has confirmed he also plans to reinstate his ban on entries from several Muslim-majority countries, as a means of ""keeping terrorists the hell out of our country.""Trump has been saying for months he could end the war in Ukraine in ""24 hours,"" without explaining how.Critics suggest his plan would involve pressuring Kyiv to cede territory illegally occupied by Russia in both 2014 and 2022.""I will have that settled prior to taking the White House,"" he told a rally in the midwestern city of Detroit recently. ""As president-elect, I will have that settled.""The ex-president is highly critical of Washington's shipments of weapons worth billions of dollars to Kyiv, and of the funding requests from Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy .""It never stops"", he told the Michigan crowd.Asked in a town hall with Fox News whether he would remain committed to Nato during a second term, he replied: ""Depends if they treat us properly.""Trump envisages tariffs of ""more than 10 percent"" on all imports.US companies and eventually their customers pay for import tariffs, not the companies exporting the goods.Trump insists that the revenue collected will finance a ""middle class, upper class, lower class, business class big tax cut.""Having waged a fierce trade war with China during his first term, he also plans to revoke the Asian giant's ""most favored nation"" status, granted to promote trade.Trump claims he will ""stop inflation by stopping the invasion,"" arguing that his immigration crackdown will reduce housing costs and other expenses.Trump never misses an opportunity to point out that it is partly thanks to him and his three conservative supreme court appointments that abortion rights have been considerably weakened in the United States.But he is more ambiguous about the future of access to reproductive health care.Insisting it should be an issue for the individual states, the republican has balked at pushing a nationwide abortion ban, a commitment that would win him support from the religious right.""You must follow your heart on this issue but remember, you must also win elections,"" he said in April.Trump slammed the door on the 2015 Paris climate accords during his first term.If reelected, he said at a rally earlier this month, he ""will stop Biden's wasteful spending and rapidly terminate the green new scam"" a reference to the funding committed by his successor to mitigating climate change.""I will repeal crooked Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will 'drill, baby, drill,'"" Trump told supporters in Wisconsin, using an old republican slogan.""Energy costs will come down very quickly,"" he vowed. ""In many cases we'll be cutting your energy costs in half.""Trump, who was convicted in May of felony business fraud and faces three further indictments, has baselessly and repeatedly claimed his various prosecutions are a political witch hunt by democrats.The republican has pledged to ""appoint a real special 'prosecutor' to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the USA, Joe Biden.""No investigation has produced evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden.He also said he was ""absolutely"" ready to pardon all the Trump supporters convicted of storming the US capitol in Washington to prevent Congress from certifying the republican's 2020 presidential election defeat to Biden.","President Joe Biden's rival in November's election has pledged to launch the biggest deportation operation of illegal migrants in US history.

US rep Lauren Boebert wins republican house primary after switching districts in Colorado,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-rep-lauren-boebert-wins-republican-house-primary-after-switching-districts-in-colorado/articleshow/111271480.cms,"DENVER: US rep Lauren Boebert won the republican primary in a US house race that she jumped into last year, surviving a scandal over a video of her at a Denver theater and accusations of carpetbagging after fleeing what could have been a tough reelection bid in her current district.Boebert built national hard-line conservative stardom through a take-no-prisoners political style in the House. That clout likely made it easier for her to weather the scandals of the last year, which included the video of her vaping and causing a disturbance at a musical production of ""Beetlejuice.""Boebert beat a group of homegrown primary candidates who had far less name recognition and generally less combative political styles.She is expected to win the November general election in the 4th district, which is a dark shade of red and tilted heavily toward former president Donald Trump in the 2020 election.Boebert said she made the switch to ensure another republican could win her old district, which she nearly lost in 2022, and she blamed outside groups for targeting her. But she had already become a fundraising magnet for the district's likely democratic candidate, who has pulled in millions that may help him flip a seat that has leaned Republican in recent years.Boebert entered her election night party in the evening toting a pair of reflective gold sneakers sold by former president Donald Trump and a white ""Make America Great Again"" hat with Trump's signature etched across the bill.Her opponents in the primary were more traditional rivals including former state sen Jerry Sonnenberg; current state reps Mike Lynch and Richard Holtorf; and parental rights advocate Deborah Flora.While the theater incident and Boebert's district jump rattled some republicans, Gilbert Kendzior, 68, a voter in Boebert's new district, shrugged them off, asking ""who's perfect?""Kendzior said he voted for the congresswoman because she shakes things up. ""It's gotten too staid. Same promises, nothing happens,"" he said. ""We need to get rid of the old farts.""Boebert is expected to also win the November general election in the 4th congressional district, which sweeps across a wide expanse of ranches, ghost towns and conservative parts of the Denver metro area that make up much of the plains of eastern Colorado. Its voters overwhelmingly backed Trump in the 2020 election.The seat opened up after former republican rep Ken Buck resigned from Congress. A special election was also being held Tuesday to fill the remaining months of Buck's term, with republican Greg Lopez, a former mayor of the city of Parker, favored to beat a democrat and third-party candidates.Buck cited the divisiveness of today's politics and his party's devotion to Trump in explaining his decision to resign. That division remains a factor in the race and is also on display in another republican house primary in Colorado Springs, about an hour's drive south of Denver.In the 5th congressional district, republican Dave Williams faced condemnation from his own ranks and demands for his resignation as GOP party chair, accused of using his position and state party resources to boost his own campaign.The final straw for some Republicans was a recent email calling people celebrating Gay Pride Month ""godless groomers."" The state party's account on the social platform X also posted: ""Burn all the #pride flags this June.""Williams' opponent in the primary was Jeff Crank, a conservative commentator who has a similar political platform but breaks in style and disposition. Both are vying to fill the seat of republican rep Doug Lamborn, who is not seeking reelection.Williams is a hard-line Trump acolyte who has parroted the former president's lies about the 2020 election and attacked fellow Republicans who don't align. Crank is molded in an older, more pragmatic GOP tradition.As in the 4th district, the winner of the republican-friendly 5th district will be favored in the general election.Another house race watched closely on the national level was the 8th district, newly minted after redistricting in 2021 and hotly contested with voters roughly split between the two major parties.The district, which stretches north of Denver, is currently represented by democrat Yadira Caraveo, who won by less than 2,000 votes in 2022. Republican state rep Gabe Evans and former state rep Janak Joshi, a retired physician, were vying to challenge Caraveo, with Evans a former police officer, considered the front-runner.The primary winner will likely benefit from a windfall of support from the national republican campaign committee, which is intent on defending the party's thin house majority.Farther to the west, among the rocky mountains and high desert mesas, a half-dozen republicans were looking to replace Boebert as the nominee in the 3rd district.The contenders include attorney Jeff Hurd and former republican state rep Ron Hanks, whose differences largely follow the contours of Cranks' and Williams', respectively. Other candidates include Stephen Varela, a former democrat who switched parties, businessman Lew Webb and financial advisor Russ Andrews.The winner will be up against Adam Frisch, the businessman and democratic candidate who lost to Boebert by only 546 votes in 2022, garnering name recognition from that close race in the conservative district. Frisch raised at least $13 million for his 2024 campaign.","Boebert beat a group of homegrown primary candidates who had far less name recognition and generally less combative political styles.

""Other issues were also discussed.""Pentagon spokesman major general Pat Ryder also reported the phone call took place, saying in a statement that Austin had ""emphasised the importance of maintaining lines of communication amid Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine"".He added it was Austin's first call with Belousov, who was appointed in May.Russia has slammed the United States for its ongoing military support for Ukraine, and Washington recently gave Kyiv the green light to use long-range US weapons on parts of Russia near the beleaguered city of Kharkiv.On Monday, the Kremlin warned the United States of ""consequences"" and summoned its ambassador after Moscow said a Ukrainian strike with a US missile in Crimea killed four people.Ryder said at the time that the Ukrainians ""make their own decisions"".State department spokesman Matthew Miller, meanwhile, blamed Russia for the fighting and reiterated the stance of most of the world, that Crimea, unilaterally annexed by Moscow in 2014, remains part of Ukraine.Western weapons shipments to Ukraine have been an increasingly sore point for Moscow.At a meeting with international news agencies this month, Russian president Vladimir Putin questioned why Moscow couldn't do the same for foes of the West.""Why don't we have the right to supply weapons of the same class to regions of the world where there will be strikes on sensitive facilities of those (Western) countries?"" Putin said.He said last week that he ""does not rule out"" sending weapons to North Korea, after he visited the reclusive country and signed a mutual defence pact.

US surgeon general declares gun violence a public health emergency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-surgeon-general-declares-gun-violence-a-public-health-emergency/articleshow/111271005.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US surgeon general on Tuesday declared gun violence a public health crisis, driven by the fast-growing number of injuries and deaths involving firearms in the country.The advisory issued by Dr. Vivek Murthy , the nation's top doctor, came as the US grappled with another summer weekend marked by mass shootings that left dozens of people dead or wounded.""People want to be able to walk through their neighborhoods and be safe,"" Murthy told The Associated Press in a phone interview. ""America should be a place where all of us can go to school, go to work, go to the supermarket, go to our house of worship, without having to worry that that's going to put our life at risk.""To drive down gun deaths, Murthy calls on the US to ban automatic rifles, introduce universal background checks for purchasing guns, regulate the industry, pass laws that would restrict their use in public spaces and penalize people who fail to safely store their weapons.None of those suggestions can be implemented nationwide without legislation passed by Congress, which typically recoils at gun control measures. Some state legislatures, however, have enacted or may consider some of the surgeon general's proposals.Surgeon General Murthy said there is ""broad agreement"" that gun violence is a problem, citing a poll last year that found most Americans worry at least sometimes that a loved one might be injured by a firearm. More than 48,000 Americans died from gun injuries in 2022.Doctors quickly praised Murthy's advisory. The American Academy of Family Physicians, for example, has considered gun violence a public health epidemic for over a decade.""Family physicians have long understood, and have seen first hand, the devastating impact firearm violence has on our patients and the communities we serve,"" the group's president, Steven Furr, said in a statement.Murthy's advisory, however, promises to be controversial with the gun lobby and will certainly incense Republican lawmakers, most of whom opposed his confirmation - twice - to the job over his statements on gun violence.The National Rifle Association promptly rebuked Murthy's advisory.""This is an extension of the Biden Administration's war on law-abiding gun owners,"" Randy Kozuch, the organization's president, said in a statement on X.It was the NRA, and Republicans who enjoy the powerful gun lobby's support, that almost derailed Murthy's confirmation as surgeon general a decade ago. Murthy became quieter on the issue of gun violence after his past statements almost cost him the job. He ended up promising the Senate that he did ""not intend to use my office as surgeon general as a bully pulpit on gun control.""Then-President Donald Trump dismissed Murthy in 2017, but President Joe Biden nominated him again to the position in 2021.Murthy has published warnings about troubling health trends in American life, including loneliness and social media use. In an opinion piece in The New York Times this month, he said social media has contributed to a mental health crisis among the country's young people and asked Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms similar to those on cigarette boxes.But he also has faced mounting pressure from some doctors and Democratic advocacy groups to speak out more. A group of four former surgeon generals asked the Biden administration to produce a report on the problem in 2022.""It is now time for us to take this issue out of the realm of politics and put it in the realm of public health, the way we did with smoking more than a half century ago,"" Murthy told the AP.It was a 1964 report from the surgeon general that raised awareness about the dangers of smoking is largely credited with reducing tobacco use and precipitating regulations on the industry.Murthy now hopes his advisory on guns will shift the conversation, too, on this issue. He has been encouraged by some developments in Congress, including the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022 that enhanced background checks for firearms.A White House report obtained by The Associated Press says that more thorough background checks have stopped roughly 800 sales of firearms to people under age 21. Additionally, more than 500 people, including some linked to transnational cartels and organized crime rings, have been charged with gun trafficking and other crimes under the landmark gun safety legislation.Children and younger Americans, in particular, are suffering from gun violence, Murthy notes in his advisory called ""Firearm Violence: A Public Health Crisis in America."" Suicide by gun rates have increased by nearly 70% for those between the ages of 10 to 14. Children in the US are far more likely to die from gun wounds than children in other countries, the research he gathered shows.For pediatricians, talking with families about locking up their guns away from their children has become a routine part of well visits, said Benjamin Hoffman, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. When children can't get access to a gun, it prevents a large chunk of gun deaths and injuries - accidental shootings and suicides.""Having access to a firearm for a child who is experiencing a behavioral health crisis is an absolute recipe for the most tragic things you can imagine,"" Hoffman said.Even when children are not direct victims of a gun shooting, they may suffer from mental health blowback of gun violence, the report says. About half of teens in the US worry about a school shooting. And in areas that have been exposed to a fatal shooting at a school, youth antidepressant use jumps by more than 20%.In addition to new regulations, Murthy calls for an increase in gun violence research and for the health system to promote and educate patients about gun safety and proper storage during checkups.","Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declares gun violence a public health crisis.

The suspect, identified as Eric Adams , 47, was later found by police and had taken his own life.The North Las Vegas Police Department reported that Adams was responsible for two separate shootings on Monday night at different apartment complexes.

Azm-e-Istehkam: Pakistan's new military operation to take on TTP and other militant groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/what-is-azm-e-istehkam-pakistans-new-military-operation-against-militants/articleshow/111255323.cms,"China has pressured Pakistan to crack down on the armed violence against CPEC targets.

What they're saying

“A soft state can never gain the trust of investors,” PM Shehbaz remarked. “The responsibility of the fight against terrorism is the collective duty and the primary obligation of all state institutions. It’s not about you and me, it’s about us, we have to trample it together.”

""The campaign will be complemented by socioeconomic measures aimed at addressing genuine concerns of the people and creating an environment that discourages extremist tendencies,"" said a statement from Sharif's office.

Ihsanullah Tipu, a security analyst, noted, ""Pakistan views the use of active military force as the most effective approach to counter armed violence.""

Some analysts suggest that the operation's timing may also be influenced by domestic political and economic considerations. Asfandyar Mir of the US Institute of Peace said, ""With the election done and a government in place, and the economic situation stabilizing, Pakistani leadership probably feels confident to pursue a vigorous campaign.""

What is the main objective of

Operation Azm-e-Istehkam

?

The primary objective of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam is to curb the surge in violence and armed attacks within Pakistan. This includes addressing domestic security threats and dealing with armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan. The operation also aims to implement socioeconomic measures to create an environment that discourages extremist tendencies.

Why now?

The timing of the operation is linked to a dramatic increase in violent incidents over the last 18 months. Most of these attacks have been claimed by the TTP , which ended a ceasefire in November 2022.

, which ended a ceasefire in November 2022. Additionally, recent attacks targeting Chinese interests in Pakistan have further underscored the urgency of a robust military response.

Pakistan has seen nearly 1,000 casualties from almost 700 incidents of violence in 2023. Attacks targeting Chinese installations and personnel have increased, highlighting the stakes for Pakistan's key ally, China, which has invested $62 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ).

). Senior Chinese officials have also emphasized the need for improved security for Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan.

How will the operation be different from previous military campaigns?

Unlike previous large-scale military operations that required mass displacement of local populations, Azm-e-Istehkam is not intended to be a kinetic large-scale military campaign. The focus will be on augmenting the efforts of armed forces with intelligence-based operations and legal measures to address terrorism-related cases. The operation is described as a “multi-domain, multi-agency, whole of the system national vision” for enduring stability.

What are the potential challenges to the success of this operation?

Security analysts highlight several challenges, including the transient nature of TTP bases in Pakistan and the risk of escalating tensions with Afghanistan if cross-border operations are conducted. Additionally, the lack of public support for security forces in provinces heavily affected by violence could hinder the operation’s effectiveness. There is also the issue of diverging approaches between Pakistan and China regarding the Taliban in Afghanistan, a report in AlJazeera said.

What has been the reaction of opposition parties to this operation?

Opposition parties, including the PTI, JUI-F, and ANP, have expressed significant criticism of the operation. They argue that it could worsen the volatile situation in border regions and have questioned the government's decision-making process, claiming it lacked sufficient consultation with parliament and local stakeholders.

How has China reacted to recent attacks targeting its nationals and investments in Pakistan?

China has expressed strong concerns over the security of its nationals and investments in Pakistan, urging the Pakistani government to take effective measures to protect them. Following attacks on Chinese engineers and installations, Chinese officials have reiterated the importance of security and the need to protect Chinese interests in the country.

Will the operation affect Pakistan’s relationship with Afghanistan?

The operation could strain already tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly if cross-border military actions are taken. The Taliban government in Kabul has consistently denied harboring TTP militants, and any escalation of military activities could complicate diplomatic relations further.

Since 2001, Pakistan's military has conducted many high-profile operations like ""Zarb-e-Azb"", ""Rah-e-Nijat"", ""Rah-e-Rast"" and many more against homegrown militants in border areas. It seems it's time for another military operation against militants in Pakistan. But the Pakistan military has failed to root out these militant groups time and again.However, under pressure from China, the Pakistan government has again approved a new military campaign named Azm-e-Istehkam, meaning ""Resolve for Stability."" This initiative, announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after a review of the country's counterterrorism efforts, aims to address domestic security threats and the activities of armed fighters crossing over from Afghanistan.

Instead, a significant portion of tax revenues is earmarked for debt servicing, a trend expected to escalate in the upcoming fiscal year, as reported by Dawn.""The government would spend PKR 7.21 trillion on domestic debt servicing and an additional PKR 1.04 trillion on foreign debt servicing, taking the total to PKR 8.25 trillion,"" according to the budget document for FY2023-24.

Indus Water Treaty Talks: Pakistani Delegation Visits Jammu for Bilateral Discussions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-delegation-arrives-in-jammu-for-indus-water-treaty-talks/articleshow/111211635.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Pakistani delegation arrived in Jammu on Sunday evening as part of ongoing discussions concerning the 1960 Indus Water Treaty (IWT). The team is scheduled to visit various dam sites in the region over the next few days. This visit marks is a step towards bilateral efforts to address and manage water resources shared by India and Pakistan under the treaty, which governs the use of the Indus River and its tributaries. The delegation's itinerary includes inspections of key dam projects to facilitate discussions on water management and treaty compliance.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed by then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and former Pakistan President Ayub Khan in 1960, establishes a framework for cooperation and information exchange on the use of the Indus River system. The treaty is overseen by the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), a bilateral body with commissioners from both countries tasked with implementing and managing treaty provisions, and resolving any questions, differences, or disputes that may arise.The PIC, which includes Indus Commissioners from India and Pakistan, has been a crucial platform for technical discussions and treaty compliance. Despite the treaty's framework, India and Pakistan have faced ongoing disagreements over hydroelectric projects. Pakistan has raised objections to India's construction of the Kishanganga (330 megawatts) and Ratle (850 megawatts) hydroelectric plants, arguing they violate treaty provisions. India, however, maintains that the projects are compliant with the treaty's guidelines and asserts its right to develop them.Efforts to resolve these disputes have been ongoing, with the World Bank encouraging both nations to explore alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In 2015, Pakistan requested the appointment of a Neutral Expert to review its technical objections to India's projects but later sought arbitration in 2016. Despite five meetings of the PIC from 2017 to 2022, Pakistan has refrained from discussing the issue, complicating efforts to reach a consensus.The arrival of the Pakistani delegation signals a continued commitment to dialogue and cooperation under the Indus Waters Treaty, with the upcoming site visits expected to further discussions on water management and treaty implementation.",Pakistani delegation arrives in Jammu as part of ongoing discussions concerning Indus Water Treaty.

Chinese 'ultra set' telecom gear devices used by Pakistan's army seized from terrorists in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/chinese-ultra-set-telecom-gear-devices-used-by-pakistans-army-seized-from-terrorists-in-jk/articleshow/111206076.cms,"NEW DELHI: Encounters with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir led to the seizure of highly encrypted Chinese telecom equipment , known as ' Ultra Set ,' which were used by terror groups, officials said. This sophisticated gear, initially meant for the Pakistan army, has found its way into the hands of terrorists, raising serious concerns over undetected infiltrations from across the Line of Control (LoC). Authorities believe these terrorists might be residing in the outskirts of cities and villages in the region.The 'Ultra Set' devices, found during a gunfight in the Sindarah top area of Surankote in Poonch district and in Sopore's Check Mohalla Nowpora in Baramulla district, were seized after confrontations last year and earlier this year. Four foreign terrorists were killed in Surankote, while two were eliminated in Sopore. These specialized handsets, customized by Chinese companies for the Pakistan army, combine cell-phone capabilities with unique radio equipment that bypasses traditional mobile technologies like GSM or CDMA.Officials indicated that the 'Ultra Set' devices operate on radio waves for message transmission and reception, each linked to a control station across the border. The messages are compressed and transmitted via Chinese satellites to a master server in Pakistan. The discovery of such advanced communication tools has heightened fears of state-sponsored support for terrorism.“This is yet another help being extended by China to its key ally Pakistan,” officials said, noting that China has been actively enhancing Pakistan's defense capabilities along the LoC. This support includes the construction of steelhead bunkers, the provision of unmanned aerial vehicles, and the installation of encrypted communication towers, alongside laying underground fiber cables.Additionally, Chinese radar systems, such as those of the ""JY"" and ""HGR"" series, have been deployed to improve target detection along the LoC. Advanced weaponry like the SH-15 truck-mounted howitzer has also been observed in the region. These developments are seen as part of China’s strategic interests in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), particularly in connection with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).While there has been no direct sighting of senior People's Liberation Army (PLA) officials at forward posts, intercepted communications suggest that Chinese troops and engineers have been involved in infrastructure development in PoK. This includes the construction of underground bunkers and tunnels in the Leepa Valley, supporting a direct route between Gwadar Port in Pakistan and China's Xinjiang province through the Karakoram Highway.(With agency inputs)","Encounters with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir led to the seizure of highly encrypted Chinese telecom equipment.

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives - spanning across areas like connectivity, health, trade, energy, defence and maritime cooperation - as PM Narendra Modi hosted his counterpart Sheikh Hasina for the first state visit after the formation of the new NDA government. Among the new initiatives was an announcement by Modi after the meeting that India will soon send a technical team to Bangladesh for management and conservation of the Teesta river inside Bangladesh.The announcement is significant as it comes amid efforts by China to convince Dhaka to allow it to develop the Teesta basin. Aware of India’s reservations about China’s role, Bangladesh has maintained it will consider “geopolitical issues” before going ahead with the project, which will apparently cost $ 1 billion.Hasina is expected to soon visit China, a country Dhaka - in a fine balancing act - continues to have strong economic ties with for its development needs. “As part of our development cooperation, we will also undertake conservation and management of Teesta River inside Bangladesh with Indian assistance within a mutually agreed timeframe,” said a joint statement, in which the leaders announced a shared vision for commerce, connectivity and collaboration.Sharing of Teesta waters has remained a long outstanding issue between the countries, after opposition from West Bengal prevented them from signing a water-sharing agreement finalised during the UPA government. India’s technical team is expected to first examine if there’s any need for a reservoir to be built, something which the Chinese have reportedly suggested. For India, it’s important that Bangladesh remains mindful of Indian security concerns while pursuing economic projects with Beijing.The leaders also welcomed formation of a Joint Technical Committee to initiate discussions for the renewal of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty of 1996. They pledged to intensify cooperation in border management, counterterrorism and against radicalisation, while agreeing to start talks for a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA).“We have prepared a futuristic vision for cooperation in new areas. We have managed to restore in the past 10 years connectivity that was there before 1965. We will now focus on energy and digital connectivity. We will soon launch CEPA negotiations to take our economic cooperation to new heights,” said Modi.There was focus on long-term defence cooperation as well as India and Bangladesh signed an MoU for cooperation concerning military education in the field of strategic and operational studies. For modernization of the Bangladesh Armed Forces, the leaders said they will explore defence industrial cooperation, while ramping up military engagements in the form of exercises, training and capability development.The 2 countries announced signing of agreements for digital and green partnerships, as also a significant initiative by India to provide e- visa for medical patients from Bangladesh. “To facilitate easier cross-border travel and as a supportive gesture to the friendly people of Bangladesh, India will extend e-Medical Visa facility to people from Bangladesh travelling to India for medical treatment,” said the joint statement, adding India will also help Dhaka with supply of essential commodities.Other major announcements included new Assistant High Commission of India in Rangpur in Bangladesh, train service between Rajshahi and Kolkata and bus service between Chittagong and Kolkata. To promote sub-regional connectivity, government said India will extend transit facilities for movement of Bangladesh goods to Nepal and Bhutan through railway network.India is also looking at early operationalization of two Special Economic Zones (SEZs) offered by Bangladesh to India in Mongla and Mirsharai and to opening of new border-haats. The 2 countries also signed an MoU to enhance railway connectivity. The joint statement also said they will pursue collaboration in frontier technologies, including civil nuclear, oceanography and space technology. “To this end, we will partner in joint development of a small satellite for Bangladesh and its launch using Indian launch vehicle,” it said.",India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives.
