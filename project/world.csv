"JD Vance slams media over Trump’s Arlington incident: 'There’s no story'; Veterans call VP candidate 'spineless, gutless fraud'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-slams-media-over-trumps-arlington-incident-theres-no-story-veterans-call-vp-candidate-spineless-gutless-fraud/articleshow/112882020.cms,"In a fiery response at a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Ohio Senator JD Vance dismissed media reports about a contentious incident involving Donald Trump ’s campaign at Arlington National Cemetery. Vance claimed the media is exaggerating the situation, which reportedly involved a physical altercation and unauthorized filming at a gravesite.“The altercation at Arlington Cemetery is the media creating a story where I really don’t think there is one,” Vance said.Vance defended the Trump campaign, asserting they had proper authorization to have a photographer at the cemetery. “There is verifiable evidence that the campaign was allowed to have a photographer there. They were invited to have a photographer there.”He emphasized that families of the 13 service members who died at Abbey Gate during the Kabul evacuation wanted Trump’s presence as a show of support. “They wanted Donald Trump there, and thank God we have a president who stands with our veterans instead of one who runs away from them,” he added.Despite Vance’s defense, he avoided addressing the specifics of the incident, particularly the prohibition on filming in Section 60 of the cemetery.Progressive veterans' group VoteVets responded sharply, labeling Vance as “a spineless, gutless fraud” and accusing him of betraying the solemnity of the graves. “Political activity is and was always illegal at Arlington,” VoteVets said. “Trump’s campaign got physical with cemetery staff who were upholding the law and protecting the solemnity of all the graves. Rather than stand up for them, JD Vance betrays them to make Trump happy. Pathetic.”The Trump campaign has denied claims of a physical confrontation and has yet to release footage that could corroborate their side of the story. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung claimed a private photographer was allowed on-site and blamed an unnamed individual for blocking Trump’s team.Vance also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her “disgraceful” for her role in the US military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. He further attacked Harris for her response to Trump’s visit, saying, “She can go to hell.”","Ohio Senator JD Vance dismissed media reports about a contentious incident involving Donald Trump ’s campaign at Arlington National Cemetery.

Typhoon Shanshan: 'Highest-level warnings' issued as Typhoon Shanshan makes landfall in Japan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/highest-level-warnings-issued-as-typhoon-shanshan-makes-landfall-in-japan/articleshow/112882219.cms,"Typhoon Shanshan on Thursday made landfall in the southern island of Kyushu in Japan , bringing torrential rain and strong winds , causing widespread disruption and raising alarms over potential flooding and landslides , leaving three dead and several injured.The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its highest-level warnings, urging residents in affected areas to seek refuge in community centres and other public facilities.In Kyushu, rainfall could reach up to 60 cm (23.6 inches) within 24 hours, raising further concerns, the Associated Press reported.The storm slowly advanced northwards at 15 kph (9 mph), with sustained winds of 144 kph (89 mph). The heavy downpour caused a landslide that buried a house in the central city of Gamagori, resulting in the deaths of three residents and injuring two others.On the southern island of Amami, where the storm had already passed, a person was knocked down by a wind gust while riding a motorcycle, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.Footage from Japan Broadcasting Corporation showed walls torn and window glass of buildings broken in Miyazaki with objects scattered on the street or hanging from utility poles.Authorities warned the storm could be one of the strongest ever to hit the region, and local governments have issued evacuation orders for millions of residents in several prefectures, as reported by Reuters news agency.More than 250,000 households in seven prefectures are experiencing power outages, according to Kyushu Electric Power Co.Yoshifumi Matsumura, Japan's Disaster Management Minister, warned that the typhoon could bring ""unprecedented"" levels of violent winds, high waves, storm surges, and heavy rain. He urged people, particularly older adults, to prioritise safety and seek shelter promptly.The storm's impact has led to widespread disruption, with hundreds of domestic flights cancelled and train services suspended across southwestern Japan. Postal and delivery services have also been halted in Kyushu, and many supermarkets and stores have closed as a precaution.Weather and government officials are concerned about extensive damage as the typhoon slowly sweeps up the Japanese archipelago over the next few days.","Typhoon Shanshan made landfall in the southern island of Kyushu in Japan on Thursday, bringing torrential rain and strong winds.

"JD Vance’s donut shop disaster: 'Felt terrible ...', Trump's running mate breaks silence on viral cringe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vances-donut-shop-disaster-felt-terrible-trumps-running-mate-breaks-silence-on-viral-cringe/articleshow/112881543.cms,"Ohio Senator JD Vance broke his silence on the cringeworthy donut shop incident in Valdosta , Georgia that has sent shockwaves across social media . The campaign stop , which was meant to showcase Vance’s down-to-earth charm, instead became an internet sensation for all the wrong reasons.The now-infamous video captured Vance attempting to engage in small talk with a visibly uncomfortable clerk.With 20 Secret Service agents and 15 cameras in the shop, the woman appeared more like a deer caught in headlights than a willing participant in Vance's photo op. In his recent interview, Vance tried to put a positive spin on the fiasco, attributing the awkwardness to the clerk’s nervousness rather than any campaign misstep.“I just felt terrible for that woman,” Vance confessed, reported the NBC. “We walked in, and there’s 20 Secret Service agents, and there’s 15 cameras, and she clearly had not been properly warned, and she was terrified, right? I just felt awful for her.”Vance claimed the incident prompted him to reassess his campaign strategy, suggesting that future stops would include a more considerate approach. “I like to get out there and talk to people, and we want to make sure we’re doing it, but definitely make sure that people are at least OK with being on camera,” he added.Despite Vance’s attempts to downplay the situation, the internet was far from forgiving. Memes and TikTok parodies exploded online, with users ridiculing his clumsy interaction and speculating about his campaign team's alleged sabotage. The viral backlash intensified following Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's smooth, untroubled visit to a Nebraska sandwich shop just a day earlier. Walz's effortless rapport with the staff and his confident order contrasted sharply with Vance’s blunders, fueling comparisons and adding fuel to the fire.In his interview, Vance also took a swipe at the Harris-Walz campaign, referencing their recent Sheetz gas station stop where Walz handed Harris a bag of Doritos. Vance dismissed the staged nature of such events, saying, “We don’t want to have these scripted events—I don’t want to go and do three takes of buying Doritos at a Sheetz.”While Vance’s donut shop disaster has dominated headlines and memes, it remains to be seen how this embarrassing episode will impact his campaign’s fortunes as he battles to secure his place on the national stage.","Ohio Senator JD Vance broke his silence on the cringeworthy donut shop incident that has sent shockwaves across social media.

WHO raises concern over 'worrying' decline in condom use among European teens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-raises-concern-over-worrying-decline-in-condom-use-among-european-teens/articleshow/112881395.cms,"Condom use among sexually active teens has majorly declined in Europe over the past decade, with a notable drop in the rates of protected sex, according to a recent report by the World Health Organisation (WHO).""This is putting young people at significant risk of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) and unplanned pregnancies ,"" WHO Europe said in a statement.The WHO stresses the importance of comprehensive sexuality education and warns that the situation could worsen without immediate action from governments, health authorities, and educators.A survey conducted among more than 242,000 15-year-olds across 42 of the 53 countries in the WHO European region, which includes Central Asia, revealed a worrying trend.The proportion of sexually active teenage boys who used a condom during their last sexual encounter dropped from 70 percent in 2014 to 61 percent in 2022. For girls, the figure fell from 63 to 57 percent over the same period.Moreover, almost one-third of adolescents reported using neither a condom or contraceptive pills during their last intercourse, a figure largely unchanged since 2018.The use of contraceptive pills remained relatively stable between 2014 and 2022, with 26 per cent of 15-year-olds indicating that they or their partner had used the pill the last time they had sex.The report highlighted socioeconomic disparities in contraceptive use. Teens from low-income families were more likely to forgo using either a condom or a contraceptive pill , with 33 percent reporting using neither during their last intercourse, compared to 25 percent from more affluent families.""Age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education remains neglected in many countries, and where it is available, it has increasingly come under attack in recent years on the false premise that it encourages sexual behaviour,"" WHO Europe director Hans Kluge said.""The truth is that equipping young persons with the right knowledge at the right time leads to optimal health outcomes linked to responsible behavior and choices,"" he added.The WHO warned that inadequate sexuality education could lead to higher rates of STIs and unplanned pregnancies, which in turn result in increased healthcare costs and disrupted education and career paths for young people.""We are reaping the bitter fruit of these reactionary efforts, with worse to come unless governments, health authorities, the education sector and other essential stakeholders truly recognize the root causes of the current situation and take steps to rectify it,"" the agency stated.The WHO has urged policymakers, educators, and healthcare providers to invest in comprehensive sexuality education, improve access to sexual health services, promote dialogue, and better train educators.",Condom use among sexually active teens has majorly declined in Europe over the past decade.

The world's least populated countries offer fascinating insights into how geography, history, and economics shape human settlement. These nations, often marked by remote locations, limited land areas, and unique political statuses, host populations that are only a fraction of what might be expected in other parts of the world.From the spiritual hub of Vatican City to the isolated atolls of Tokelau, each of these countries tells a story of survival and adaptation in the face of natural and man-made challenges.Explore the ten least populated countries, highlighting the factors that contribute to their small populations.As the smallest internationally recognized independent state, Vatican City has a population of just 764 as of 2023–24. This is largely due to its tiny land area of only 49 hectares, strict citizenship requirements that limit the number of new residents, and its unique role as the spiritual and administrative centre of the Catholic Church rather than a typical country.Tokelau, a group of three remote atolls in the South Pacific, has a population of around 1,915 people. Its isolated location and limited land area of just 26 square kilometers naturally constrain its population. The absence of airports and accessibility only by boat from Samoa further contribute to its small population size.Niue, a self-governing island country in free association with New Zealand, has a population of about 1,935 people. Its remote Pacific location, coupled with a tiny land area of just 260 square kilometers and limited economic opportunities, restrict population growth.The Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic, has a population of approximately 3,803 people. Its isolated position and harsh sub-Antarctic climate make it an unattractive destination for large-scale settlement. The islands’ economy is primarily dependent on fishing and tourism.Montserrat, a Caribbean island nation, has an estimated population of 4,372 people. A devastating volcanic eruption in the 1990s destroyed much of the island and forced many residents to flee, resulting in its small population size. Ongoing volcanic activity and limited land area continue to constrain population growth.Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a French territorial collectivity in the North Atlantic, has a population of around 5,815 people. Its remote location off the coast of Canada and limited economic opportunities, mainly centered on fishing and tourism, contribute to its small population size.Saint Barthélemy, a French overseas collectivity in the Caribbean, has a population of approximately 11,019 people. The island’s tiny land area of just 25 square kilometers and focus on luxury tourism, rather than large-scale industry or agriculture, limit its population growth.Wallis and Futuna, a French overseas territory in the South Pacific, consists of three small volcanic islands with a total land area of just 142 square kilometers. Its remote location and lack of major economic activities contribute to its small population of around 11,439 people.Tuvalu, a Pacific island nation comprising nine small atolls, has a population of about 11,478 people. Its tiny land area of 26 square kilometers and isolation from major trade routes and economic centres contribute to its status as one of the least populated countries in the world.Nauru, the world’s smallest republic, has a population of roughly 12,884 people. Its total land area of just 21 square kilometers and remote location in Micronesia limit population growth. Economic challenges and a lack of natural resources further hinder the country’s development and population expansion.","The world's least populated countries offer fascinating insights into how geography, history, and economics shape human settlement.

The downward spiral

The regret that never faded

The tragic death of Matthew Perry in 2021 from a ketamine overdose shocked fans worldwide. But recent revelations have suggested that his struggles may have been deeply tied to regrets about his love life . One of Perry's ex-girlfriends has come forward with startling insights into the actor's emotional state leading up to his death, painting a picture of a man haunted by what could have been.Kayti Edwards, who dated Perry in 2006 and worked as his assistant years earlier, has revealed that despite his relationships with Hollywood's elite, Perry often spoke of Rachel Dunn as ""the love of his life"", reported the Mirror US.Rachel, who was 14 years younger than Perry, represented a time in his life when he felt genuinely happy and grounded—a stark contrast to the turbulent years that followed their breakup .According to the Mirror US, Edwards described Perry's deep regret over ending his relationship with Rachel. ""He was happy, content, and most importantly, sober when he was with her,"" Edwards said. ""But after they broke up, everything seemed to unravel for him.""Edwards believes that Perry's breakup with Rachel was a turning point in his life—one that marked the beginning of his downward spiral into addiction . ""I noticed a significant change in him after they split,"" she recalled. ""He started using drugs more heavily, and it was like he just gave up. He lived with a lot of regret, and I think that haunted him.""Perry's relationship with Rachel, although lasting only two years, left a lasting impact on him. According to Edwards, it wasn't just about losing Rachel but also about losing the simple, genuine love they shared. ""Rachel loved him before he became a huge star. It was a pure kind of love, and I think that's why it affected him so deeply when it ended,"" Edwards explained.In a candid moment, Perry had once confided in Edwards that he regretted not marrying Rachel. ""He wanted kids, a family , and I think he struggled with the fact that time was slipping away, and he hadn't achieved those things,"" Edwards said. Despite other relationships after Rachel, Perry never seemed to move on. ""He loved her so much, and I don't think he ever found that kind of love again.""Perry's feelings for Rachel were so profound that, according to RadarOnline, he even named her as one of the beneficiaries in a will he drafted in 2009.

In 2024, notable countries with free healthcare systems include Canada , Australia , and the UK . These nations foster healthier, more motivated, and productive workforces by reducing the burden on employers related to healthcare costs and sick leave.With rising interest in countries offering free healthcare and its positive effects on businesses and employees, here are the top 9 countries providing free healthcare in 2024, guiding expats looking to live and work abroad.Countries like the UK, Australia, and Canada are among those that offer free healthcare. While entirely free healthcare is rare, most developed nations provide government-funded universal health care to their citizens and residents.The UK’s National Healthcare Service (NHS) offers free, universal healthcare, known for its accessibility and efficient primary care. The NHS is regionally structured and funded by government taxation, ensuring that all citizens and residents have access to free healthcare, including hospital care, doctor visits, medical consultations, maternity care, prescriptions, mental health services, and more.Canada's universal healthcare system , Medicare, is publicly funded and managed by individual provinces and territories. Free healthcare services are available to Canadian citizens and residents, covering doctor visits, lab tests, hospital care, and prescription medications.Australia’s Medicare, funded through general taxation, provides free healthcare to local citizens and permanent residents. Services include basic medical care, hospital services, doctor appointments, prescriptions, and diagnostic tests. Expats may need to pay out-of-pocket for specialised care, so securing private health insurance is advisable.France’s universal healthcare system is recognized for its accessibility, quality care, and efficiency. Both French citizens and legal residents have access to free healthcare services such as hospital care, doctor visits, and prescription medications. Visitors staying in France for over three months can also benefit from these services.Germany’s universal healthcare is based on a government-run “sickness fund,” requiring all citizens to have health insurance.

Neutron Rocket: Is Elon Musk’s SpaceX reign over? Rocket Lab’s Neutron set to rival Falcon 9 in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-elon-musks-spacex-reign-over-rocket-labs-neutron-set-to-rival-falcon-9-in-2025/articleshow/112850570.cms,"Peter Beck’s vision for Neutron

The growing rivalry in the space industry

As Elon Musk ’s SpaceX continues to dominate the space industry, a new contender is gearing up to challenge that supremacy. Peter Beck , CEO of Rocket Lab USA, Inc., is set to launch the Neutron rocket in mid-2025, a move that could potentially shake up the market. Designed to directly compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9 , the Neutron rocket promises partially reusable transportation of cargo into orbit at a lower cost, aiming to provide a viable alternative in an industry where SpaceX has long held the upper hand, reported Business Insider.Peter Beck shared his strategic vision for the Neutron rocket, emphasizing its dual importance. He was quoted by Business Insider as saying, “Neutron is really important for two reasons. One, we need to bring some balance to the market with the Falcon 9, but we also need a vehicle of our own to launch our own satellites and put our own stuff in orbit,” Beck stated. He believes that offering an alternative to Falcon 9 is crucial, particularly for businesses developing competitors to SpaceX’s satellite internet service, Starlink.Beck’s path to becoming a formidable rival to Musk is unconventional. Without a college education and a background that includes working at a dishwasher manufacturer, Beck has transformed Rocket Lab into one of the top space companies globally, second only to SpaceX in commercial rocket launches. The recent celebration of the 50th launch of Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket marks a significant milestone, with the upcoming Neutron launch expected to propel the company’s capabilities even further.As Beck prepares for Neutron’s launch, Elon Musk’s SpaceX continues to push forward, with plans to ramp up its operations by executing missions every two days in 2025. Musk’s ambitions extend far beyond Earth’s orbit, as he remains focused on colonizing Mars using SpaceX’s Starship rocket.In the face of growing competition, Musk recently dismissed the idea that traditional aircraft companies like Boeing could dominate the space industry. He likened it to how car manufacturers cannot dominate the aircraft business, emphasizing SpaceX's unique position.His comments followed NASA's decision to return astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore from space via a SpaceX vehicle, despite their launch on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft. Technical issues during docking delayed their return, leading NASA to opt for a SpaceX vehicle for their safe return in February.With the Neutron rocket on the horizon, Rocket Lab’s challenge to SpaceX’s market dominance is becoming increasingly apparent. As the space industry evolves, Beck’s Rocket Lab is poised to offer a competitive alternative, providing businesses with more choices for satellite deployment and other space missions. The rivalry between Rocket Lab and SpaceX is set to intensify, marking a new chapter in the race for space exploration.","Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck is set to launch the Neutron rocket in mid-2025.

Abandoned airports , once bustling hubs of activity, now stand as silent reminders of a bygone era in aviation history. These deserted airfields, scattered across the globe, offer a fascinating glimpse into the past, where the roar of jet engines has given way to eerie silence and nature's slow reclamation.From the iconic Tempelhof Airport in Berlin to the haunting remains of Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, each of these locations tells a unique story of changing times, economic shifts, and the evolution of air travel.Explore ten of the most intriguing abandoned airports around the world.Berlin Tempelhof Airport was one of Europe’s oldest airports and a symbol of Germany’s aviation history. It played a significant role during the Berlin Airlift in 1948-49. Despite its historical significance, Tempelhof was closed in 2008 due to financial losses and is now a public park and events venue.Once the main airport of Cyprus, Nicosia International was abandoned in 1974 after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. The airport is now located in a United Nations Buffer Zone and remains a time capsule of 1970s airport design, frozen in time and off-limits to the public.Ellinikon International Airport served as Athens' primary airport for six decades before it was closed in 2001 to make way for the new Athens International Airport. The site, which also hosted events during the 2004 Olympics, is now slated for redevelopment but remains largely abandoned.Johnston Atoll, a remote military base and chemical weapons disposal site in the Pacific, included an airport that was closed in 2005. The island, now part of a National Wildlife Refuge, is off-limits to the public, and the airstrip is slowly being reclaimed by nature.Built with the hope of boosting the Palestinian economy, Yasser Arafat International opened in 1998 but was severely damaged by Israeli forces in 2001 during the Second Intifada. The airport has been abandoned since, a stark reminder of the ongoing conflict in the region.Famous for its challenging approach over Hong Kong’s skyscrapers, Kai Tak Airport was one of the world’s most iconic airports until it was closed in 1998. The airport was replaced by the modern Hong Kong International Airport, and the site of Kai Tak is now being redeveloped into a new urban area.Once the primary airport serving Denver, Colorado, Stapleton International was replaced by Denver International Airport in 1995. The site of the former airport has been redeveloped into a residential area, but remnants of the old runways and control towers remain.Located in New York, Galeville Airport was originally built as a military airfield during World War II. It was later used by the New York Air National Guard but was closed in the 1990s. The site is now part of a wildlife refuge, with the runways serving as paths for birdwatchers.Ciudad Real Central Airport was one of Spain’s most ambitious projects, built in the hopes of becoming a major hub. However, the airport fell into bankruptcy shortly after opening in 2009 due to low demand and high debt. It remains abandoned, with only occasional flights landing for maintenance purposes.Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York, was the city’s first municipal airport, opening in 1931. It later became a naval air station and was decommissioned in 1971. The site is now part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, where visitors can explore the historic hangars and runways.","Explore ten of the most intriguing abandoned airports around the world.

Pavel Durov: Telegram CEO Pavel Durov’s arrest linked to missing video game streamer Juli Vavilova,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/telegram-ceo-pavel-durovs-arrest-linked-to-missing-video-game-streamer-juli-vavilova-social-media-trail-or-honey-trap/articleshow/112855792.cms,"The arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov at a Parisian airport has ignited a firestorm of intrigue and conspiracy theories . But as the dust begins to settle, an even darker mystery has emerged — a 24-year-old video game streamer, Juli Vavilova , who was last seen traveling with Durov, has vanished without a trace, reported the New York Post.Vavilova’s sudden disappearance has left the internet abuzz with speculation, drawing comparisons to the spy thrillers and conspiracies that Durov himself might appreciate.But this isn’t fiction; this is a real-life drama playing out in the shadowy world of international law enforcement, cryptic social media trails, and high-stakes accusations.Durov, the enigmatic tech mogul who famously fled Russia in 2014 after defying Kremlin demands to share encrypted user data, was detained this past weekend at Le Bourget airport near Paris. His arrest came as part of a sweeping investigation by French authorities into alleged crimes involving minors—an investigation that has seen Durov accused of complicity in global drug trafficking and paedophilia, facilitated by the perceived lax moderation on his platform and its use of cryptocurrencies, reported the New York Post.Yet, as the world watched the takedown of one of tech’s most elusive figures, another story began to unfold—one involving Vavilova, the young woman whose social media presence, once vibrant and carefree, has now become a focal point of a growing mystery.Vavilova was last seen alongside Durov, with whom she appeared to share a close, yet undefined, relationship. Her social media posts painted a picture of their journey together, with stops in Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and beyond. In one post, she’s seen in the passenger seat of Durov’s car, their faces half-hidden by the shadows of the setting sun. In another, they stand side by side at a shooting range in Baku. The images, innocent at first glance, have taken on a new, ominous significance as questions arise about their connection—and her role in Durov’s arrest.Baptiste Robert, a French privacy researcher, has fueled these speculations by pointing out the curious timing of Vavilova’s posts. “It’s difficult to say if her posts directly led to his arrest, but if you followed her on social media, you could track Durov’s movements,” Robert was quoted as saying. On X, Robert shared a compilation of Vavilova’s posts, drawing a chilling line between her digital breadcrumbs and Durov’s eventual capture.What makes this story even more perplexing is the fact that Vavilova has not been heard from since Durov’s detention. Her family, desperate for answers, has been met with silence, their attempts to reach her going unanswered. The timing of her disappearance has led to wild theories, the most provocative being that she might have been used as a ‘honey-trap’ to lure the tech billionaire into the hands of law enforcement. But like all good spy tales, this theory, too, remains shrouded in ambiguity, with no solid evidence to back it up.Durov’s company, for its part, has denied that he was in hiding or on the run, asserting that the 39-year-old frequently traveled to Europe as a dual French citizen. But the eerie coincidence of Vavilova’s vanishing act and Durov’s arrest has left the world questioning the true nature of their relationship—and what secrets may lie behind her social media posts.","Juli Vavilova, a 24-year-old video game streamer, has vanished without a trace.

Vance's remarks targeted Harris’s recent policy shifts, including her stance on electric vehicle mandates .At the event, Vance criticized Harris’s approach to energy policy, specifically electric vehicle mandates.""She wants to raise the price of diesel, raise the price of gasoline and have every trucker in this country drive an electric vehicle,"" Vance claimed.Harris led the Electric Vehicle Charging Action Plan in December 2021, aiming for 50% of car sales to be electric by 2030, reported Fox News. The Biden-Harris administration's 2024 environmental regulations also require half of all new car and truck sales to be electric.Ammar Moussa, Harris’s campaign rapid response director, countered Vance's claims in a fact-check email, stating that the vice president ""does not support an electric vehicle mandate,"" despite her past promotion of increased EV sales.Vance also criticized Harris for allegedly altering her positions on other significant issues, including fracking, an automatic weapons buyback program, border wall construction, and Medicare for all. ""If you look at her campaign, the past week and a half, she pretends that she agrees with Donald J. Trump on every issue. She is running a copycat campaign,"" Vance said.Vance further argued that Harris's policies would negatively impact American truckers. ""We have a vice president, Kamala Harris, who wants to be president, who thinks that our truckers, we ought to put them out of business, and that our truckers should all learn computer code,"" he stated. ""If you force all these great truckers to buy electric trucks instead of the trucks they're currently using, you're going to make this inflation crisis way worse than it currently is.""In response, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign emphasized the differences between the two campaigns. ""Unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance, Vice President Harris supports abortion rights instead of ripping them away, cutting middle-class taxes instead of raising them by nearly $4,000, and bringing Americans together instead of dividing them,"" the spokesperson said.

Sullivan's first trip to China as national security adviser was aimed at keeping high-level communications open and stabilising bilateral relations to avoid conflict.The White House statement said both sides would keep lines of communication open, including planning for a ""leader-level call"" in the coming weeks.There was no indication the two leaders might meet in person before Biden leaves the Oval Office.The White House said the two sides also planned to hold a military theater commander telephone call in the near future.China has rapidly expanded its military, and there are concerns that Taiwan and the South China Sea are becoming flashpoints.Wang told Sullivan that Taiwan's independence poses the greatest threat to stability in the immediate region. He demanded that the US ""stop arming the island but support China's peaceful unification,"" according to a statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy that split from authoritarian communist China in 1949, has rejected Beijing's demands that it accept unification with the mainland by peace or by force. The US is obligated under a domestic law to provide the island with sufficient hardware and technology to deter invasion.The White House statement said Sullivan ""underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait "".Sullivan planned to meet with China's Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Zhang Youxia on Thursday morning, according to a senior Biden administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be publicly announced meeting.Zhang has spoken in the past of Beijing's determination to take control of Taiwan. At an international naval gathering earlier this year in northeast China, Zhang said China would strike back with force if its interests came under threat.He said China's territorial sovereignty ""brooks no infringement and its core interests cannot be challenged. We do not provoke trouble, but we will never flinch in face of provocation. The Chinese military will resolutely defend the reunification and interest of the motherland"".Beijing also warned Washington ""not to support or indulge the Philippines to infringe"" upon China's rights and interests in the South China Sea. China and the Philippines have clashed over the Second Thomas Shoal and lately the Sabina Shoal.The US military has pushed back against China's claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, saying this week it would be open to consultations about escorting Philippine ships in the disputed sea amid a spike in hostilities between Beijing and Manila on the issue.The White House said Sullivan reaffirmed the US commitment to defending its Indo-Pacific allies and expressed concern about Beijing's destabilizing actions against ""lawful Philippine maritime operations"" in the South China Sea.The Philippines has called for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to do more. The 10-nation Southeast Asian bloc includes the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, which have South China Sea claims that overlap with each other as well as China's and Taiwan's.The US has shifted its policy with China from engagement to competition. The Biden administration has made it a priority to prevent the competition from spiralling out of control, while seeking to collaborate with China in areas such as climate change, artificial intelligence and enforcement against illicit drugs.John Podesta, the senior adviser to the president for international climate policy, will travel to China, and Sullivan and Wang discussed ""next steps to reduce the flow of illicit synthetic drugs"" and ""continue repatriation of undocumented migrants,"" the White House said.The US Border Patrol in July made 1,851 arrests of Chinese immigrants on the border with Mexico, down from the December high of 5,951.The two sides also agreed to hold a second round of dialogue over artificial intelligence, the Chinese foreign ministry said.Sullivan raised continued concerns about China's trade policies and non-market economic practices, the White House said.Wang demanded the US ""stop suppressing China in the areas of trade, economic and technology,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said.By resorting to protectionism, the US would only ""hurt the global green development and affect the global economic growth,"" Wang told Sullivan.","Beijing and Washington will plan for a phone call in the coming weeks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden.

The remark, which was initially posted by one of Trump’s supporters, suggested that Harris advanced her political career through sexual favors, referencing her past relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown .The reposted comment linked Harris’s career rise to her past relationship with Brown, who was Speaker of the California State Assembly during their relationship. The remark also included a derogatory reference to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, alluding to her husband’s affair with Monica Lewinsky .Trump’s repost, which featured a screenshot of the offensive comment, followed a pattern of personal and sexist attacks against Harris.The reposted image contained a comment that read, “Funny how blowjobs impacted both their careers differently…”—a reference to Bill Clinton’s impeachment and Harris’s past relationship with Brown.This remark has drawn sharp criticism for its explicit nature and the implications it carries about Harris's career achievements.This is the second time in recent weeks that Trump has shared sexually charged attacks on the vice president, reflecting his history of crass insults against political opponents.On August 18, he shared a video from the Dilley Meme Team, which included a parody of Alanis Morissette’s “Ironic” that denigrated Harris in a similar fashion. Trump’s recent posts, including over 30 reposts in a 30-minute span on Wednesday, also featured conspiracy theories and calls for the prosecution of political adversaries.Harris’s campaign has largely avoided engaging with Trump’s personal attacks, while critics argue that Trump’s rhetoric could alienate key voter groups, including women and Black voters. Harris, the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to be a major party's presidential nominee, has faced such attacks throughout her career, which she and her supporters have dismissed as sexist and unfounded.Trump’s history of gender-based attacks is well-documented, including during his 2016 presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton.

Donald Trump: Limited details and divergent views

Impact on suburban women and swing states

Campaign criticisms and economic rebuttals

As the high cost of child and elderly care forces women out of the workforce, strains family finances , and impacts economic growth, the presidential candidates have presented contrasting plans to address these issues. Both Democratic and Republican tickets have endorsed expanding the child tax credit , yet their broader approaches to care differ significantly.Vice President Kamala Harris, who accepted the Democratic Party's nomination last week, has expressed a commitment to building on President Joe Biden’s legacy. Her agenda includes raising the child tax credit, a move she has emphasized in recent speeches. Harris highlighted her personal connection to the issue, recounting how her mother, a single parent, struggled with child care.Harris said in a recent speech, ""That is a vital—vital year of critical development of a child, and the costs can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else."" Her economic platform aims to increase the child tax credit to $3,600 and offer $6,000 for families with newborns. This proposal aligns with Biden administration efforts to reduce out-of-pocket child care expenses and enhance home care support for the elderly and disabled. Her running mate, Tim Walz, has further bolstered these plans with his record of advancing paid leave and child tax credits as governor of Minnesota.Former President Donald Trump has been less specific about his plans for affordable child care in the current campaign. While he supported child care initiatives during his presidency, including a doubled child tax credit and a parental leave policy, his recent statements have been vague. Trump's campaign platform is silent on detailed strategies for child care but promises to support unpaid family caregivers through tax credits and reduced regulations.Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has proposed raising the child tax credit to $5,000. However, Vance has historically opposed extensive government spending on child care, arguing that many children benefit from having one parent at home as a caretaker. Vance has floated policies that would make it easier for a family to live off a single income. “We want to make it easier for families to have one parent stay home if that’s what they want to do,” Vance said.The care issue could be a decisive factor in November’s election, particularly among suburban women who are crucial swing voters. These women, who perform a significant portion of unpaid care work, are increasingly affected by rising child care costs . Both campaigns are targeting this demographic, with Harris focusing on direct financial support and Trump emphasizing traditional family structures.The Trump campaign has criticized Harris's economic record, blaming Bidenomics for rising living costs and inflation. “Harris... has proudly and repeatedly celebrated her role as Joe Biden's co-pilot on Bidenomics,” said Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokeswoman. “The basic necessities of food, gas, and housing are less affordable, unemployment is rising, and Kamala doesn’t seem to care.”","The high cost of child and elderly care forces women out of the workforce and strains family finances.

JD Vance blasts Kamala Harris over Afghanistan withdrawal: 'She can go to hell',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-blasts-kamala-harris-over-afghanistan-withdrawal-she-can-go-to-hell/articleshow/112880847.cms,"In a fiery address, Senator JD Vance took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris , condemning her role in the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and asking her to ""go to hell."" The outburst came during a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, and marks Vance's most vehement criticism of Harris to date.Vance's comments were triggered by a question about former President Donald Trump's recent visit to Arlington National Cemetery.Trump had visited the site with families of service members who were killed during the 2021 attack at Abbey Gate, Kabul, as the chaotic withdrawal unfolded.“Three years ago, 13 brave, innocent Americans died because Kamala Harris failed to do her job,” Vance declared. “There hasn't been a single investigation or firing. To see those 13 lives lost and not hold anyone accountable is disgraceful. Kamala Harris is disgraceful.”He continued, “If we're talking about Abbey Gate, it’s that Kamala Harris is so asleep at the wheel that she hasn’t even bothered to investigate what happened. Instead, she chooses to yell at Donald Trump for showing up. She can, she can go to hell.”The Trump campaign has yet to comment on Vance's remarks, and the Harris campaign declined to respond. Vance later elaborated on his frustration during an interview with NBC News.“I get frustrated, and I get pissed off,” Vance admitted. “Kamala Harris’ leadership failure at Abbey Gate is absolutely something to be angry about. And when she turns the focus onto Trump instead of addressing her own failures, it justifies my frustration.”Vance also criticized the Harris campaign for allegedly politicizing the incident at Arlington National Cemetery, suggesting that Harris' response to the tragedy was more about political maneuvering than genuine empathy.In response to the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate attack , Harris expressed her sorrow for the families affected and reaffirmed her commitment to honoring the service and sacrifice of American troops. She defended President Biden's decision to end the US involvement in Afghanistan, calling it “the courageous and right decision.”The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, culminating in the tragic events at Abbey Gate, remains a contentious issue in American politics, with both parties leveraging it to criticize their opponents.","Senator JD Vance took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris during a rally in Pennsylvania.

Votes from Muslim and Arab Americans could help decide the outcome in battleground states like Michigan , which has seen street protests over the Israel-Gaza war.U.S. President Joe Biden won a large share of the Arab and Muslim vote in 2020, but his support for Israel despite the huge death toll in Gaza has frustrated many community members. They launched an ""uncommitted"" campaign against him in the Democratic nominating contests.Michigan, where Harris is due to visit next week, is home to one of the largest Muslim and Arab American populations in the United States. More than 100,000 voters cast their ballot ""uncommitted"" instead of Biden, who stepped aside as candidate on July 21, in the state's primary.Some activists say they hold Harris responsible for the Biden administration's Israel policy and the crisis in Gaza.Following last week's Democratic convention, pro-Palestinian activists said Harris had failed to demonstrate any break from the status quo.While pro-Palestinian voices are not expected to vote for Trump and have indicated no support for the Republican, some activists have launched a campaign called ""Abandon Harris"" and have urged their supporters to back third-party candidates.Abdelall, Harris' pick for Arab American outreach, most recently served as senior counselor to the Department of Homeland Security's secretary. She joined the agency in January, 2021, shortly after Trump left office, to be chief of staff for the department's civil rights office.Abdelall, who grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, previously ran a food blog and website focused on Middle Eastern cuisine. She has taught Middle Eastern cooking classes at a culinary school in northern Virginia.The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.",Kamala Harris' campaign has hired an Egyptian American lawyer and former Department of Homeland Security official. Brenda Abdelall would be tasked with shoring up support from a community frustrated with US support for Israel's war in Gaza.

VP and running mate visit Georgia in bid to sway GOP strongholds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-harris-and-walzs-bus-tour-vp-and-running-mate-visit-georgia-in-bid-to-sway-gop-strongholds/articleshow/112880745.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , made an unexpected visit to Liberty County High School on Wednesday as part of a two-day bus tour through southeast Georgia . The Democratic ticket is campaigning heavily in the critical battleground state, aiming to make inroads into traditionally Republican areas ahead of the November election.During the visit, the high school band performed their school fight song, and Harris, addressing the students, expressed her admiration and optimism for the younger generation.“We’re so proud of you and we’re counting on you,” she said to the enthusiastic crowd, some of whom were visibly excited by the vice president’s presence, reported AP. Harris encouraged the students, noting that she too had once been in the band, and offered them a piece of advice: “Just keep going at it.”This visit is part of a broader strategy by the Harris-Walz campaign to engage voters in GOP strongholds and to showcase a more personal side of the candidates. The campaign believes that winning over these areas is essential to securing a victory in Georgia, a state that played a pivotal role in the 2020 election. The bus tour is set to culminate in a rally in Savannah on Thursday.Michael Tyler, Harris’ campaign communications director, emphasized the importance of reaching out to communities that don’t typically see Democratic candidates. “We’re competing in all communities,” Tyler said, adding that the campaign hopes these informal stops will generate viral moments that resonate with voters nationwide.In addition to their high school visit, Harris and Walz made a stop at Sandfly, a barbecue restaurant in Savannah, where they interacted with local patrons, including teachers who expressed their appreciation for Walz’s background as a former high school teacher.The bus tour reflects a continuation of the Democratic strategy to connect with voters on a personal level, a tactic used effectively in previous campaigns, including President Biden’s. The campaign has also launched a new ad in battleground states, seeking to tie former President Donald Trump to the conservative “Project 2025,” a plan that includes replacing civil servants with Trump loyalists and reversing certain FDA approvals.The Georgia visit is a makeup for an earlier planned trip that was postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby. Harris is scheduled to continue her campaign efforts with President Biden on Labor Day, just as the election season enters its final stretch.The contrasting approaches between the two campaigns were evident when Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, struggled to engage with workers during a recent visit to a bakery in Valdosta, Georgia. Vance later expressed sympathy for a worker who appeared overwhelmed by the media presence.","Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, made an unexpected visit to Liberty County High School on Wednesday.

What’s at stake

In a highly anticipated event that could shape the course of the 2024 presidential election , former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will face off in their first presidential debate on September 10. With the general election looming just weeks away on November 5, the debate promises to be a pivotal moment in the race for the White House.The journey to this debate has been anything but smooth.Initially, Trump resisted agreeing to a debate with Harris, insisting that he would only participate if she officially secured the Democratic nomination. That milestone was reached last week at the Democratic National Convention, where Harris was formally nominated after President Joe Biden stepped aside. With the nomination confirmed, Trump quickly shifted gears, agreeing to the debate but raising concerns about the use of “hot mics” that could capture off-the-cuff remarks during the event.However, on Tuesday, Trump announced that he had “reached an agreement” with the Harris campaign to proceed with the debate, hosted by ABC News, a network he has frequently criticized as being biased against him.The debate will take place at 9 pm EDT on Tuesday (6:30 am on Wednesday in India), September 10, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The choice of venue is symbolic, as Philadelphia is not only one of the key battleground states in this election but also home to the Liberty Bell and a museum dedicated to the US Constitution, highlighting the foundational principles at stake in this election.Moderated by ABC’s David Muir and Linsey Davis, the debate will be live-streamed on various platforms. The format is expected to follow the precedent set by a previous debate between Biden and Trump in June, which featured muted microphones when candidates were not speaking and excluded a live audience to maintain focus on the candidates' responses.Both campaigns have agreed to the same rules as the June debate, which include muted microphones when candidates are not speaking, no live audience, and no props. There will be two commercial breaks during the debate, giving the candidates brief pauses amid what is expected to be a heated exchange of ideas and accusations.Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic nominee, and Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, are the only candidates currently expected to take the stage. Although third-party candidates have until September 3 to qualify for the debate, they must meet stringent criteria, including appearing on a sufficient number of state ballots and reaching at least 15% support in four national polls. Given these requirements, it is unlikely that any third-party candidates will join Harris and Trump in this crucial debate.With the general election just weeks away, this debate will be a critical opportunity for both candidates to sway undecided voters and solidify their base. For Trump, it’s a chance to reassert his influence and demonstrate his continued relevance in the political arena. For Harris, it’s an opportunity to step out from Biden’s shadow and establish herself as a strong leader ready to take on the highest office in the land.","Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will face off in their first presidential debate on September 10.

But Trump prefers this sort of snake pit because he understands snakes.On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Trump plans to name Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , who both recently endorsed him, as honorary co-chairs of his presidential transition team.Gabbard and Kennedy sought the Democratic nomination for president -- Gabbard in 2020 and Kennedy in this election cycle before starting an independent bid.But these two are only the latest onetime opponents that Trump has pulled into his orbit. Many of Trump's Republican primary challengers from 2016 and 2024 became sycophants, some of them gushing over him at July's Republican National Convention. Some of his most vocal critics in Congress have become his confidants, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, who once called Trump a ""race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.""Even his own running mate, Sen. JD Vance, once wrote that the former president ""is cultural heroin"" and behind closed doors called him ""America's Hitler.""Trump embraces people who will swallow their words and bury their beliefs. He seems to like people to demonstrate that their convictions are hollow. To him, it seems obvious that those are people he can try to manipulate. They are the people he prefers, rather than those who tell him no.Trump is, above all, transactional, and in every transaction, he seeks leverage; once an opponent has bowed to him, he has the leverage he needs.A parade of former Trump administration officials has condemned him or refused to endorse him, but he and his supporters dismiss them as turncoats. In a certain light, they have a point: Trump hasn't changed. They knew -- or should have known -- who he was when they accepted their posts.Many Americans may not fully appreciate how much like ""Game of Thrones"" Washington politics is, how intoxicating political power can be, how proximity to that power orders society.I believe that part of the genius of Trump wasn't really genius at all but simply the clarity of an outsider who assessed and then exploited the cravenness of much of our political culture.He understood this social jockeying from experience: Trump is from New York, where he rose on the fringes of high society because he was too crass to be invited into it. His rise was propelled by, among other things, a hit television show, an assortment of cameo appearances in film and on television, a string of co-written books and being lionized in rap lyrics.In his political career, Trump has turned the Republican Party -- and much of Washington -- into his real-life game of ""The Apprentice,"" with various figures making expedient alliances, trying desperately to avoid elimination and all competing for his approval.Washington, to Trump, is a survivalist game, and in it, compromising oneself is a small price to pay for survival.In the end, in this game there are no victims. The pawns all play willingly. They abandon their morals and ethics of their own volition. They have seen the calamity Trump has brought to the lives of others who cross over to his side, yet they follow suit.On Sunday in an interview on Fox News, Kennedy said, ""I think President Trump is going to make a series of announcements about other Democrats who are joining his campaign, and you know, I want to make America healthy again, and so does President Trump.""Now, Kennedy blows a lot of smoke, but the idea that Trump would make America healthy again is too much to take. When it comes to literal health, he failed as president to take the Covid-19 pandemic seriously and tried his best to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Metaphorically, he threatens to reshape government as we know it -- something Kennedy seemed to recognize in 2020, when he said that in many ways, Trump ""discredited the American experiment with self-governance."" Ditto Gabbard, who once called him ""corrupt"" and ""unqualified to serve.""But they don't care about the obvious contradictions. They're playing the game. Trump wanted the fraction of support Kennedy drew this year and the imprimatur of a former Democratic congresswoman. In exchange, he'll grant them some marginal role and a trifle of power by association. Unless and until he takes it away: ""Ron DeSanctimonious,"" anyone?Washington, by some measures, is the most important city in the country. By others, it is the shallowest. Trump has exposed many of the city's players as apostates and built his Republican Party with these people at the core.","Ruben Navarrette: Donald Trump has surrounded himself with ideological shape- shifters.

Las Vegas Review-Journal honors German

A Neveda jury on Wednesday found former politician Robert Telles guilty of murdering Jeff German , a veteran Las Vegas journalist known for his investigative work and critical articles about Telles. German was stabbed to death outside his Las Vegas Valley home on September 3, 2022.Police and the jury concluded that Telles, who headed an office responsible for managing estates of individuals without heirs, was the attacker.Months before the attack, German wrote an article in The Las Vegas Review-Journal detailing allegations against Telles, including claims of a toxic work environment and an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Telles lost his re-election bid soon after the article was published, and prosecutors argued that he targeted German as an act of revenge.Telles's defense lawyer, Robert Draskovich, argued that Telles was framed and the evidence was manipulated and portrayed German’s reporting as insufficient motive for murder .The country official had also denied his involvement and alleged a conspiracy involving corrupt businesspeople and a professional hitman. He claimed multiple parties, including law enforcement, were involved in framing him.However, Clark County chief deputy district attorney Pamela Weckerly said that the case was solely about the murder, not the political backdrop. “It’s just about murder,” she said, pointing to DNA evidence and video footage that linked Telles to the crime.Glenn Cook, executive editor of The Las Vegas Review-Journal, praised the jury’s decision and called it a measure of justice for Jeff German. Cook highlighted German’s dedication to holding public officials accountable and described him as a man who deeply valued his work and community, according to an AP report. Throughout his journalism career, German investigated many organized crime, political corruption, and various other major issues.","Jeff German was stabbed to death outside his Las Vegas Valley home on September 3, 2022.

Moody's upgrades Pakistan's rating to Caa2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/moodys-upgrades-pakistans-rating-to-caa2/articleshow/112871429.cms,"External financing and political risks

Credit ratings agency Moody's has upgraded Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to ' Caa2 ' from 'Caa3' citing improving macroeconomic conditions and moderately better government liquidity and external positions.The ratings upgrade reflects Pakistan's decreased default risk after a USD7 billion IMF bailout staff level agreement in July.However, despite doubling since June 2023, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves remain insufficient for its external financing needs, according to the agency.""There is now greater certainty on Pakistan's sources of external financing, following the sovereign's staff-level agreement with the IMF on 12 July 2024 for a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of USD7 billion,"" Moody's said in a statement.The IMF stated that the program's approval depends on Pakistan securing necessary financing assurances from its development and bilateral partners. Moody's said it expects the IMF Board to approve the program within a few weeks.Following the upgrade, Pakistan's international bonds made broad gains. The 2027 maturity was up 0.7 cents to 85.9 cents in the dollar by 1007 GMT - not far off the one month high hit earlier in the day, according to Tradeweb data.Topline Securities CEO, Mohammed Sohail, said the credit upgrade was anticipated following the IMF agreement, and another upgrade within a year is plausible.The announcement comes a day after Pakistan's central bank chief told Reuters in an interview that the country would be looking for about USD4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks.Sohail said Fitch's upgrade in July and Moody's upgrade should ""boost bankers' confidence"".Historically, Pakistan has depended on friendly countries to ""rollover"" debt to avoid a repayment crisis.Although Moody's previous concerns about a potential balance of payments crisis have eased, it warned that risks remain high as Pakistan continues to rely on timely financing from official partners.There is also uncertainty over the government's ability to fully implement IMF-mandated reforms, Moody's said.The coalition government, formed after February elections, may struggle to implement revenue-raising measures without stoking social tensions.Moody's cautioned that any slippages in reform implementation could lead to delays in or withdrawal of financing support from official partners.","Moody's upgrades Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to'Caa2'from 'Caa3' The ratings upgrade reflects Pakistan's decreased default risk after a USD7 billion IMF bailout staff level agreement in July.

Overcoming Challenges

KARACHI: Pakistan aims to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year, the country's central bank chief told Reuters on Tuesday, as the country looks to plug its external financing gap .In a wide-ranging interview, his first with any media organisation since taking office in 2022, State Bank of Pakistan Governor Jameel Ahmad said Pakistan was also in the ""advanced stages"" of securing $2 billion in additional external financing required for International Monetary Fund approval of a $7 billion bailout program.Pakistan and the IMF reached an agreement on the loan program in July, subject to approval from the IMF's executive board and it obtaining ""timely confirmation of necessary financing assurances from Pakistan's development and bilateral partners"".Ahmad said he expected the country's gross financing needs would be smoothly met - both over the next fiscal year and in the medium term.In the past, Pakistan has relied on long-time allies such as China, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates to 'rollover' debt rather than force a repayment crunch. Ahmad said he expected similar assurances would be given for the next three years, giving the government more time to get its finances in order.In addition, Ahmad said the central bank reckoned Pakistan's gross financing needs for the coming years would be lower than the 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product projected by the IMF in its latest country report in May.""Pakistan's external gross financing needs have been declining in the past few years,"" he said.""Since (the IMF's) assessment was based on a higher current account deficit than realized in fiscal 2024 and now projected for the next few years, we assess the ratio of gross financing needs to GDP to be lower than the 5.5 per cent level.""Asked about monetary policy, Ahmad said recent interest rate cuts in Pakistan have had the desired effect, with inflation continuing to slow and the current account remaining under control, despite the cuts.Pakistan's annual consumer price index inflation was 11.1 per cent in July, having fallen from highs of over 30 per cent in 2023.""The Monetary Policy Committee will review all these developments,"" Ahmad said, adding that future rate decisions could not be pre-determined.Pakistan's central bank cut rates for two straight meetings from a historic high of 22 per cent to 19.5 per cent, and will meet again to review monetary policy on September 12.There have been some concerns in markets that the government might take advantage of lower interest rates to borrow more, but the central bank chief said this was not his expectation.""We understand that the government will continue on the path of fiscal consolidation, notwithstanding the reduction in interest rates,"" said Ahmad.Ahmad, who was appointed governor of Pakistan's central bank for a five-year term in August 2022, said his first year had been 'quite difficult'.In 2023, Pakistan faced an acute balance of payments crisis with only enough central bank reserves to cover a month of imports.After eight months of tough negotiations over fiscal discipline, the IMF threw Pakistan a lifeline in the form of a nine-month $3 billion bailout program.""Last year was much better,"" said Ahmad. ""Now everything is under control from an external account management perspective.""Ahmad said the central bank would now focus on growth, digitalisation and financial inclusion.""Those are also equally important for job creation and other socioeconomic issues,"" said Ahmad, noting the bank's mandate was to ensure price and financial stability before shifting its focus to growth.","Pakistan aims to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year.

He further said that operations against the insurgents continued on Monday and “those who killed our innocent civilians and security will be dealt with with full force.”The PM said the Balochistan attacks sought to harm Chinese-funded development projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which included roads and rail systems to link western China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s southwestern Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea.In recent years, BLA and other militants have also targeted Chinese nationals involved with CPEC projects.According to a witness, some killed in the latest attacks were ordered off local transport and shot.Sakina Nazir said that while traveling in a bus with her husband, gunmen signaled the driver to halt, following which, the men entered the bus and checked passengers' national identity cards. They called some people out, including her husband after which gunshots were heard by the survivors.Balochistan has long been the site of a prolonged insurgency, with various separatist groups launching attacks, targeting security forces.

In several 'coordinated' attacks on Monday, at least 39 people were killed by militants in the troubled southwestern region of Pakistan .Armed assailants targeted and killed 23 passengers in the Musakhail district of Balochistan province after forcibly removing them from buses, vehicles, and trucks, according to police and news agency AP quoted official sources as saying.Gunmen shot at passengers after checking their identities.The attack, which ranks among the most lethal in the area, took place during the night in the Kusakhail district of Balochistan province. The perpetrators set fire to at least 10 vehicles before making their escape from the crime scene.In a separate incident, gunmen targeted individuals in the Qalat district, also in Balochistan, resulting in the loss of at least 10 lives. Among the victims were police officers and also civilians who were passing by when the attack occurred.In yet another incident, a rail line between Pakistan and Iran and a railway bridge connecting Quetta to the rest of the country were damaged in recent attacks involving explosives.Police said they had found six bodies that have yet to be identified, near the attack on the railway bridge.""We have confirmed 39 people killed in several coordinated attacks carried out by the BLA terrorists,"" Shahid Rind, a spokesman for the Balochistan provincial government was quoted as saying by AFP.The southwestern province faced more violence as insurgents carried out a series of attacks across different districts.Mohsin Naqvi, the interior minister of Pakistan, strongly condemned the attack, describing it as ""barbaric"" and assured that those responsible would face the full force of the law and not evade justice.The attacks came after separatist group Baluch Liberation Army warned people to stay away from highways, as they launched attacks on security forces in various parts of the province.Baloch seperatist elements in Baluchistan have a history of targeting workers and individuals from the eastern Punjab province, as part of their efforts to pressure them into leaving the region. Balochistan has been grappling with a low-intensity insurgency for many years.The majority of such previous killings have been attributed to the banned Baluchistan Liberation Army and other organizations seeking independence from the central government in Islamabad. Additionally, Islamic militant groups also maintain a presence in the province.In a similar attack in April, 11 labourers were killed when they were abducted from a bus in Naushki city of Balochistan.","Gunmen targeted and killed 23 passengers in the Musakhail district of Balochistan province.

It allows users to blur pictures except for specific matches and offers the option of having chaperones oversee meetings.Since its launch in 2015 in Britain, Muzz has attracted over 1.5 million users in Pakistan, making it the app's second-largest market after Morocco.The Lahore event provided a safe space for attendees like Aimen, 31, to step out of the confines of online interactions. “I used the app for two weeks, but when I saw an ad for this event, I thought, why not meet people in person?” she said.Moaz, 27, who has been using Muzz for a year, expressed hope that the event might help him find a life partner.However, he pointed out that many girls on the app expect parental involvement from the start, which he found challenging. ""That is not possible,"" he said, emphasising the importance of getting to know someone before involving families.In addition to Muzz, other events like Annie's matchmaking party in Lahore are also challenging traditional matchmaking norms .Noor ul Ain Choudhary, the 30-year-old organiser, faced criticism online for allegedly promoting a ""hookup culture.""

A high court ruling of Aug 1, 2013 had declared the registration of Jamaat-e-Islami null and void, and on Dec 7, 2018, Election Commission issued a notification cancelling its registration.
