'Wouldn't have given birth': Gaza mother struggles to provide for newborns amid conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/wouldnt-have-given-birth-gaza-mother-struggles-to-provide-for-newborns-amid-conflict/articleshow/113997656.cms,"Wouldn't have gotten pregnant

20,000 infants born in Gaza

How can I carry...

Anniversary of the deadly Hamas

The October 7, 2023, deadly Hamas -led attack which prompted Israel’s devastating counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip, has intensified over the past year, spreading to new fronts. It has resulted in the displacement of 2.3 million Gazans, according to Gaza’s health ministry.According to Reuters, among the displaced is Rana Salah, a Gazan mother who cradles her one-month-old daughter Milana in a sweltering tent at a camp in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza.She expresses the deep guilt she feels for bringing her child into a world ravaged by war and suffering.""If it were up to me, I wouldn't have gotten pregnant or given birth during the war because life is completely different; we've never lived this life before,"" she told Reuters.Reflecting on her past experiences, Rana recalls, ""I gave birth twice before, and life was better and easier for me and the child. Now, I feel like I've wronged both myself and the child because we deserve to live better than this.""Milana was born via a cesarean section in a hospital tent, as complications arose during Salah's pregnancy. The ongoing conflict has prevented the family from returning to their home, forcing them to relocate from one tent to another.According to Unicef data, Milana is among the approximately 20,000 infants born in Gaza over the past year. ""Instead of returning to our house, we keep moving from one tent to another... where diseases are widespread and the water is contaminated,"" Rana said.The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a significant decrease in postnatal services in Gaza, limiting access to necessary care for women who have complications and have less access to the care they need, as do their babies.According to Rick Brennan, the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Regional emergency director, newborns face the threat of malnutrition, especially if their mothers are unable to breastfeed due to the lack of access to breast milk substitutes.He mentioned that constant movement and displacement can be highly disruptive for a newborn, increasing their risk of infection.Manar Abu Jarad, who is currently staying in a school shelter run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency ( UNRWA ), gave birth to her youngest daughter Sahar on September 4th via cesarean section, her husband was killed in the war.Upon learning that she would require a cesarean for the birth, Abu Jarad was concerned about how she would manage to care for her other children while recovering from the surgery. ""I already have three girls. I started shouting... How can I carry (water) buckets? How can I bathe my daughters? How can I help them and my husband is not with me, he was martyred,"" Abu told Reuters.""I've reached the point where I cannot carry the responsibility for this girl ... Thank God I found some help here,"" she said. She has borrowed what she could from family and is forced to use just one diaper a day for the baby, adding that, ""I don't have the money to provide diapers or milk for her.""Abu yearns for the war to end and hopes to return home, even if it means living in a tent beside what was once her house. ""The important thing is to go home. Enough of all the exhaustion we are experiencing here, enough carrying buckets, enough of the dirt in the bathrooms. It's really, really hard and really tiring for us. Diseases are everywhere,"" she added.As the anniversary of the deadly Hamas-led assault on southern Israel approaches, the nation braces for a tense week marked by both mourning and continued fighting.With the security situation unstable, shifting restrictions on public gatherings in Israel have cast uncertainty over memorials planned for the victims of the assault, deepening the anguish as the region remains in turmoil.The current war, a particularly deadly episode in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict , was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.In response, Israeli air and artillery strikes have reduced much of the Palestinian enclave to rubble, and the Gaza health ministry reports that more than 41,500 Palestinians have lost their lives in the Israeli assault.","The October 7, 2023, deadly Hamas -led attack which prompted Israel’s devastating counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip, has intensified over the past year.

Kamala Harris Kicks off media blitz with ‘Call Her Daddy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-kicks-off-media-blitz-with-call-her-daddy/articleshow/113998128.cms,"Harris said the US won’t stop pressure on Israel and “Arab leaders” for a ceasefire deal.

Vice President Kamala Harris is making a push to reach key voters ahead of the November 5 election with a media blitz of television and podcast appearances, including on Call Her Daddy and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.Plans include a visit to New York on Tuesday for appearances on ABC’s The View, The Howard Stern Show and Colbert’s show on CBS, a senior campaign official said.On the Call Her Daddy episode, released Sunday, Harris underscored her support for abortion rights and pledged to “continue to fight for student debt relief.” Her appearance on the podcast reflects the importance of connecting with younger audiences who will be key to the election outcome, according to her campaign.Call Her Daddy and The View have large female audiences, a voter bloc that favors Harris over former President Donald Trump in polls ahead of the presidential election.Harris was viewed very or somewhat favorably by 51% of female likely voters in the latest Bloomberg/Morning Consult swing-state poll, while 44% held those views about Trump.Harris’s media campaign follows needling by Republicans, including presidential nominee Trump and running mate JD Vance, that the vice president has shied away from interviews.In a preview from an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes airing Monday, Harris said the US won’t stop pressure on Israel and “Arab leaders” for a cease-fire deal that also frees hostages taken by Hamas in the group’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.CBS has said that Trump’s campaign backed out of a 60 Minutes sitdown after both candidates initially agreed to interviews with the network.Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz kicked off a media push on Sunday with a Fox News interview that included questions about his history of misspeaking and flubbed statements on the campaign trail that Republicans have capitalized on.Walz redirected criticism about his comments backing access to in vitro fertilization — his wife said she received intrauterine insemination, not IVF — to Trump.“I don’t think people care whether I used IUI or IVF when we talk about this,” Walz said on Fox News Sunday. “What they understand is Donald Trump would resist those things.”During last week’s vice presidential debate with Vance, Walz said he “misspoke” when saying he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing — and added he’s “a knucklehead at times.”“I will own up when I misspeak,” Walz, who’s in his second term as governor of Minnesota, said Sunday. “I will own up when I make a mistake.”On Monday, Walz is scheduled to appear on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live. A senior campaign official said he’ll also appear on a major US podcast, but didn’t specify which.Harris and Walz will visit critical Sun Belt states later in the week. Harris is participating in a Univision town hall on October 10 in Nevada, an attempt to court the Latino voting bloc that the campaign has struggled to grasp as firmly as previous Democratic candidates.Both will visit swing state Arizona, where early voting begins October 9.","Vice President Kamala Harris is making a push to reach key voters ahead of the November 5 election with a media blitz of television and podcast appearances.

"After the deluge, the lies: Top conspiracy theories about Hurricane Helene",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/florida-braces-for-milton-hurricane-helene-conspiracy-theories/articleshow/113997910.cms,"FEMA

faces false claims of fund misappropriation

Weather control conspiracy: Targeting republicans?

Dam and body disposal hoaxes spread fear

Efforts to debunk the misinformation

Political misinformation clouding recovery efforts

(With inputs from agencies)

As Florida braces for the arrival of Hurricane Milton , the aftermath of Hurricane Helene is being further complicated by a torrent of conspiracy theories and misinformation . These baseless claims have worsened the challenges for recovery teams trying to provide aid to devastated communities, making an already dire situation even more complex.Hurricane Helene, which struck on September 26, left over 225 people dead across multiple states, from Florida to North Carolina.Yet, as federal and local relief efforts ramp up, misinformation has emerged online, further muddying the recovery process. Among the most persistent conspiracy theories is a claim that FEMA misappropriated disaster relief funds to support undocumented immigrants.This claim, pushed most prominently by former President Donald Trump , has been widely debunked. Trump has asserted, without evidence, that ""Biden and Harris had used federal emergency funds on people that should not be in our country."" Deanne Criswell, head of FEMA, firmly denied this, saying, ""This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people."" Independent fact-checkers and FEMA officials explained that disaster recovery funds are separate from programs aimed at aiding migrants.Another troubling theory making waves suggests that the US government can control the weather, and that Hurricane Helene was deliberately steered toward Republican-voting areas to influence the upcoming presidential election. This baseless idea, amplified by far-right figures like Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, has gained traction on social media platforms, particularly on X (formerly Twitter).“Yes, they can control the weather,” Greene posted, further fueling the false narrative. The claim, which echoes similar theories from past natural disasters, suggests that Democrats, led by President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, used Helene as a political weapon to harm Republican voters.Other conspiracy theories have spread panic in the hardest-hit areas. In North Carolina, one false claim suggested a dam was about to burst, leading to unnecessary evacuations. Another rumor, widely circulated online, alleged that FEMA was planning to bulldoze bodies under the rubble in some towns. These stories, despite being false, have added to the chaos and distrust in the recovery process.Criswell warned that such baseless claims create fear and prevent residents from seeking much-needed aid. ""It has a tremendous impact on the comfort level of our own employees to be able to go out there,"" she said, noting that the disinformation has even led to threats against FEMA workers.Authorities have taken steps to debunk the most dangerous falsehoods. FEMA has launched a rumor control page to counteract the conspiracy theories and provide accurate information to the public. Local leaders from both parties have also stepped in to calm tensions. Glenn Jacobs, Republican mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, urged citizens to ""put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help.""Yet, despite efforts to curb the spread of misinformation, conspiracy theories continue to flourish, especially on platforms like X, which has become a hub for right-wing disinformation since being acquired by Elon Musk. Some of the most viral posts, including those claiming federal authorities are withholding aid from Republican areas, have garnered millions of views.As federal and state officials work tirelessly to restore devastated communities, the political atmosphere surrounding Hurricane Helene continues to escalate. President Biden has emphasized that his administration ""will continue working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders – regardless of political party."" However, the spread of false information has led to a growing distrust in government efforts, particularly in Republican-leaning areas.With Hurricane Milton now expected to make landfall later this week, officials worry that the disinformation surrounding Helene could further erode trust in disaster relief efforts, making it harder to protect vulnerable communities from future storms.","Hurricane Helene left over 225 people dead across multiple states, from Florida to North Carolina.

'Not 1950s anymore': Kamala Harris responds to 'doesn’t have children keeping her humble' remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-1950s-anymore-kamala-harris-responds-to-doesnt-have-children-keeping-her-humble-remark/articleshow/113997230.cms,"60

US vice president Kamala Harris has responded to Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders ’s recent criticism, which suggested Harris lacks humility because she doesn’t have biological children. Speaking during an appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Harris challenged the outdated notion, celebrating her “modern family” and highlighting the evolving definition of family in today’s society.With her remarks, Harris pushed back against traditional views, reminding listeners that family comes in many forms and that women shouldn’t be defined by whether or not they have children.The controversy began when Sanders, during a town hall moderated for Republican candidate Donald Trump in Michigan, implied that Harris wasn’t grounded because she didn’t have children of her own. ""My kids keep me humble,"" Sanders remarked. ""Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble.""Harris, speaking on the popular podcast hosted by Alex Cooper, addressed the “outdated view”. “I don’t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,” Harris said. “Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life.”Harris, who is married to Doug Emhoff, shared insights into her own life, highlighting her “modern family” that includes Emhoff’s children from his first marriage, Cole and Ella, whom she affectionately calls her own. “We have our family by blood, and then we have our family by love, and I have both. I consider it a real blessing. Cole and Ella call me ‘Momala.’ We have a very modern family, and I’m also friends with my husband’s ex-wife,” Harris saidHarris’s comments come as part of a broader conversation about family and the changing roles of women. The vice president took the opportunity to underscore that today’s families no longer fit into rigid molds of the past. ""This is not the 1950s anymore. Families come in all kinds of shapes and forms, and they’re family nonetheless,"" she added, drawing a clear line between traditional and contemporary notions of family.Harris also touched upon derogatory remarks made by Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, who had previously expressed disdain for what he called “childless cat ladies” running the country. Harris dismissed these comments as ""mean-spirited"" but took the opportunity to steer the conversation in a positive direction. She emphasized the importance of women uplifting one another, saying, “I think it’s really important for women to lift each other up.”Her appearance on the podcast comes as Harris ramps up media outreach in the final month of her campaign against Donald Trump. The vice president’s campaign has been criticized for limited media appearances, but in the coming days, Harris is set to feature on a variety of high-profile programs, including CBS'Minutes, ABC's The View, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and The Howard Stern Show.While on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Harris and Cooper also delved into topics such as reproductive rights and Harris’s career as a prosecutor focusing on violence against women. Cooper, known for centering conversations around women’s empowerment, noted how crucial it was to discuss issues impacting women directly with the vice president, whose campaign has increasingly focused on reproductive rights and gender equality.","Kamala Harris responded to Sarah Huckabee Sanders' criticism that she lacks humility because she doesn't have children.

It also clarifies that past memberships in exclusive or prestigious groups in related fields will be accepted, there is also a relaxation in the conditions relating to publication and clarifications have been issued on exhibitions by the applicant.According to immigration attorneys these updates may broaden the eligibility criteria and aim to provide more transparency and assist petitioners in submitting accurate evidence. However, the exact impact remains to be seen.Awards are one of the ten evidentiary criteria available for EB-1 applicants, who must meet at three. The updated guidance states that team awards will be recognized for EB-1 applicants in categories of ‘lesser’ international and national awards and prizes. Tess Douglas, managing attorney at DGO Legal told TOI, “At the same time the guidance still says that the applicant must be named in the award. So, if a company receives an award for a project that the applicant worked on, it still will not be enough unless the applicant is named as a recipient of the award.” While past memberships in relevant associations will also be accepted. Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, points out that if the EB-1 application is not accompanied by any recent evidence, the length of time since membership could be a determining factor on whether the applicant has sustained his/her acclaim. Published material also helps an applicant substantiate his/her extraordinary ability. Here USCIS has removed the condition that the publication must demonstrate the value of the applicant’s work. Lastly, USCIS has clarified applications can include ‘comparable evidence’ for some non-artistic showcases or exhibitions.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its guidelines for the EB-1 category of visas (aka green cards) This category is available to those who can ‘demonstrate’ extraordinary ability in their field of science, arts, education, business or sports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113944585,imgsize-27930,width-400,resizemode-4/113944585.jpg"
Will Kamala Harris's lead hold? US poll 'Nostradamus' says October surprise will ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-kamala-harriss-lead-hold-us-poll-nostradamus-says-october-surprise-will-/articleshow/113997881.cms,"In a razor-thin election race, political analyst Allan Lichtman , renowned for his accurate predictions, has asserted that the upcoming polls for the 2024 Presidential election will remain unaffected by the so-called "" October surprise .""Lichtman, co-founder of the ""13 Keys to the White House"" system, said, “One of the greatest myths of American politics is the October surprise.I have never changed my prediction in response to such events because the keys gauge the big picture of the incumbent government’s strength and don’t sway by campaign happenings.”Lichtman, who has forecasted the outcomes of nearly every US presidential election over the past fifty years— except the controversial 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore—has confidently predicted that Kamala Harris will emerge victorious in 2024.Lichtman holds a Ph.D. from Harvard University, focusing on modern American history and quantitative methods. He is a distinguished professor at the American University in Washington, DC, and has authored 13 books alongside numerous academic articles.Since joining the race in late July, Harris has consistently led national polling averages against former President Donald Trump . Following a highly publicised debate in Pennsylvania on September 10, which attracted over 67 million viewers, Harris’s lead increased from 2.5 percentage points on the day of the debate to 3.3 points a week later. This gain was accompanied by a slight decline in Trump’s polling average, which fell by half a percentage point.While national polls can provide insights into candidate popularity, they may not be definitive indicators of election outcomes due to the US electoral college system. With 538 electoral votes up for grabs—requiring 270 for victory—most states tend to vote predictably along party lines, leaving only a handful of battleground states to ultimately decide the election.","Political analyst Allan Lichtman has asserted that the upcoming polls for the 2024 Presidential election will remain unaffected by the so-called "" October surprise.""Lichtman, who has forecasted the outcomes of nearly every US presidential election over the past fifty years, has confidently predicted that Kamala Harris will emerge victorious in 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113998322,imgsize-58684,width-400,resizemode-4/113998322.jpg"

"Guns, transgender rights on docket for US Supreme Court fall term",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/guns-transgender-rights-on-docket-for-us-supreme-court-fall-term/articleshow/113997111.cms,"US Supreme Court (AP photo)

WASHINTON: The US Supreme Court returns from its summer recess on Monday with regulation of "" ghost guns "" -- firearms made from kits -- and medical care for transgender youth on a docket that risks being gate-crashed in the event of a contested presidential election.David Cole, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ), which frequently brings cases before the highest court, said he expects ""a much quieter term than we've had in the last couple of years.""""But you know, that could change if the presidential election is close and disputed,"" Cole added in a reference to potential lawsuits stemming from the November 5 White House contest between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.In a landmark decision last term in a case filed by Trump, who is charged with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election, the conservative-dominated court ruled 6-3 that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.The justices also dismissed a Colorado court ruling that would have barred Trump from the November ballot because of his role in the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol by his supporters.One of the first cases the justices will hear -- on Tuesday -- involves ghost guns: firearms sold online or in stores as ""buy build shoot"" kits that can be easily assembled at home.The court will hear a challenge from gun manufacturersand owners to a rule from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that requires ghost guns, like other firearms, to have serial numbers and for their purchasers to undergo background checks.According to ATF figures, some 20,000 ghost guns were recovered at crime scenes in the United States in 2021, a tenfold increase from 2016.Another high-profile case, described by Chase Strangio, an ACLU attorney, as one of the ""most significant LGBTQ cases"" to ever reach the Supreme Court, involves the deeply divisive issue of gender-affirming care for transgender youth.The Justice Department is challenging a Tennessee ban on treatments for transgender minors such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy. Tennessee is one of two dozen Republican-led states enforcing such restrictions.In April, the court allowed a similar ban -- in Idaho -- to take effect while legal challenges proceed. Under the Idaho law, medical professionals who provide treatments to minors can face up to 10 years in prison.Ethics, low approval, reformThe Supreme Court will also hear a challenge to a law in Texas that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of visitors in order to limit minors' access to online sexual content.The law mandating the sites to require state-issued identification from users has been challenged by a trade association representing the adult entertainment industry on the grounds it violates the free speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the US Constitution.The Supreme Court has also agreed to decide whether a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Mexico, accusing American gunmakers of fueling drug trafficking and violence, can go ahead.Smith & Wesson and gun distributor Interstate Arms are seeking a dismissal of the Mexican government's suit, which has been winding its way through US courts since 2021.The politically charged rulings, ethics scandals and the decision two years ago striking down the nationwide right to abortion have contributed to near record-low approval ratings for the Supreme Court, particularly among Democrats.Fifty-two percent of the Americans surveyed in a Gallup poll in July said they disapprove of the way the court is handling its job, while 43 percent said they approve. Sixty-six percent of Republicans said they approve, but only 15 percent of Democrats.The Supreme Court adopted an ethics code last year following reports of luxury vacations received by conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito -- both of whom have denied any impropriety -- but it was criticized for lacking an enforcement mechanism.Thomas and Alito also both rebuffed calls to recuse themselves from cases related to the 2020 election -- Thomas because his wife supported Trump's efforts to overturn the results and Alito because flags linked to Trump's false election claims were flown outside his home.Three of the nine justices on the top court -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- were nominated by Trump, giving conservatives a 6-3 majority on the bench.Democratic President Joe Biden proposed reforms of the nation's highest court in July -- including limiting a justice's current lifetime appointment to an 18-year term -- but there is little to no chance of passage in a deeply divided Congress.","US Supreme Court returns from its summer recess on Monday.

Coming just after the devastating Hurricane Helene , which caused significant damage across the southeastern U.S., Milton is expected to hit the already hard-hit Tampa Bay area. Officials urged residents in vulnerable areas to leave, with over 500,000 people facing mandatory evacuation orders in Pinellas County, which includes St.Petersburg.Milton strengthened from a tropical storm into a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday and is projected to make landfall on Wednesday. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned that the storm’s impacts could be even worse than Helene's, particularly due to lingering debris from the earlier hurricane. ""What's going to happen to that debris? It's going to increase the damage dramatically,"" he said. Schools in Pinellas County have been closed through Wednesday, and six hospitals, along with nursing homes, have been evacuated as a precaution.The storm, currently packing winds of 85 mph, is expected to become a Category 3 or 4 hurricane by the time it reaches the coast. Governor DeSantis expanded the state of emergency to 51 counties and urged residents to prepare for power outages and potential food and water shortages. ""You have time to prepare,"" he said, encouraging residents along Florida's west coast to heed evacuation orders.Hurricane Helene, which hit just days before, has already caused widespread destruction, particularly in the northern regions. The death toll from Helene has risen to at least 230 people, making it the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Hurricane Katrina. Federal assistance is in place for the ongoing recovery, and President Biden has approved over $137 million in aid. Meanwhile, emergency services continue to work around the clock to clear debris and prepare for Milton's arrival.","Milton strengthened from a tropical storm into a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday and is projected to make landfall on Wednesday.

Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump has termed the recent filing of a 165-page brief by federal prosecutors in her father-in-law Donald Trump ’s election fraud case a ""ridiculous ploy,"" suggesting it aims to influence voters just weeks ahead of the election. During an appearance on CNN ’s Talk show 'State of the Union', she expressed concern over the timing of the brief, which seeks to convince US District Judge Tanya Chutkan that Trump's alleged actions following the 2020 election were personal, rather than official, and thus justifiable for indictment, as reported by Newsweek .The brief was partly unsealed on Wednesday, detailing accusations against Trump, who faces four felony counts in connection with efforts to overturn President Joe Biden ’s election victory, culminating in the January 6 , 2021, Capitol riot.

Joe Biden: FEMA administrator hits back at Trump’s 'ridiculous' claims on Biden's Hurricane Helene response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fema-administrator-hits-back-at-trumps-ridiculous-claims-on-bidens-hurricane-helene-response/articleshow/113993436.cms,"<p>Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator Deanne Criswel <span class=""redactor-invisible-space"">(Photo: Reuters) </span><br></p>

As the federal response to Hurricane Helene becomes a focal point in the final stretch of the presidential campaign, US President Joe Biden ’s administration is pushing back against former President Donald Trump ’s unfounded claims about the storm recovery efforts, as per USA Today.Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator Deanne Criswell , appearing on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, assured that FEMA has all the necessary resources to respond to Helene, which has severely impacted parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and other states.With North Carolina and Georgia being key swing states , the political implications of the recovery efforts have been increased.Criswell dismissed Trump’s claims that disaster relief funds were being redirected to support undocumented immigrants, and that aid was being withheld from Republican regions. She called these accusations as ""frankly ridiculous and just plain false.""“This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,” Criswell said. “It’s really a shame that we’re putting politics ahead of helping people.”Trump, who has consistently criticised the response, made a series of remarks during recent public appearances. At a rally in Michigan last week, he claimed, “Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal immigrants,” alleging that this left FEMA with no resources for storm recovery. Trump went on to say, “They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants.”FEMA’s Shelter and Services Programme allocates $650 million for humanitarian support to noncitizens after their detention, but this is separate from disaster relief funding. “No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. None,” clarified a White House statement.Department of Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas claimed that FEMA has adequate funds for immediate needs but may struggle if additional storms occur. “We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have,” Mayorkas said, adding that further funds would be required for a full recovery.Congress recently approved $20 billion for disaster relief, but Biden has indicated that additional funding will be needed to address future storms.Meanwhile, Trump stepped up his criticism during a rally in Pennsylvania, focusing on the $750 payment FEMA offers to disaster victims to cover essential items. “Remember, $750 to people whose homes have been washed away, and yet we send tens of millions of dollars to foreign countries,” Trump said.The Biden administration defended this initial payment, explaining that it is meant to cover urgent needs like food, water, and medication, with additional assistance potentially available after further assessment.","Hurricane Helene has severely impacted parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and other states.

Tupac Shakur: Did Diddy have a hand in Tupac’s murder? Crime scene investigator speaks out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-diddy-have-a-hand-in-tupacs-murder-crime-scene-investigator-speaks-out/articleshow/113990012.cms,"Sean Combs (Diddy) and Tupac Shakur

Sheryl McCollum , the crime scene investigator who worked on Tupac Shakur ’s 1996 murder case , has suggested that Sean "" Diddy "" Combs could be connected to the rapper’s death and an earlier shooting in 1994. McCollum shared her thoughts during an interview with NewsNation, pointing to Combs' presence during key moments in Shakur’s violent history.McCollum highlighted the 1994 incident, where Shakur was shot five times during a robbery at New York’s Quad Studios.At the same time, Combs was in the building with around 40 people, all of whom remained unharmed.“This whole thing to me started in 1994 — the first time Tupac was shot,” McCollum said. “You ain’t gotta shoot somebody five times to take their jewellery and their money.” She added that it seemed suspicious that Combs and his group were untouched during the incident, saying, “How does that make sense to anybody that one person is going to be robbed and not the other 40? Who would have had more money and jewellery? Forty.”Shakur himself suspected foul play, openly accusing Combs, along with The Notorious B.I.G. and Bad Boy Records, of involvement in the 1994 shooting . Speaking to 'Vibe' magazine in 1995, he recalled the strange reaction of those present when he entered the studio, bleeding from his wounds: “Nobody approached me. I noticed that nobody would look at me.”Two years later, in 1996, Shakur was gunned down in a drive-by shooting after leaving a boxing match in Las Vegas. McCollum pointed out the similarities between the two attacks, noting that in both instances, Shakur was “trapped” — first in an elevator, then in a car — with no way to escape. She also noted the lack of video footage at both crime scenes, hinting that someone close to Shakur may have had prior knowledge of his location, according to Page Six.While Combs and Biggie Smalls denied involvement in Shakur’s murder, the theory has resurfaced as Shakur’s family considers filing a wrongful death lawsuit against Combs. This comes after Duane “Keefe D” Davis, who is currently charged with Shakur’s murder, suggested in a 2009 interview that Combs placed a $1 million bounty on the rapper’s life.Combs was arrested on September 16 at a Manhattan hotel and is facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. If convicted, he could face a life sentence. Currently held without release on a $50 million bond, Combs has yet to receive a trial date in the federal case.","Sheryl McCollum, the crime scene investigator who worked on Tupac Shakur ’s 1996 murder case, has suggested that Sean Combs could be connected to the rapper’s death and an earlier shooting in 1994.

Scott Presler: Gays for Trump: Who is Scott Presler?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gays-for-trump-who-is-scott-presler/articleshow/113989194.cms,"Who is Scott Presler?

One of the most notable moments during Donald Trump's return to Butler was an address by Scott Presler , a young man with long hair who may not be widely recognised by mainstream political audiences, but holds significant influence within the MAGA movement , particularly among younger supporters.Presler, known for his pivotal role in registering voters across Pennsylvania and the broader United States, took the stage after being introduced by Lara Trump.His message to voters was energising, as he finally received recognition for his years of hard work in registering Republicans.He emphasised the importance of Pennsylvania, suggesting the state held the power to change the world, and urged residents to check their voter status to ensure they were active voters. Presler reached out to various groups, appealing to union workers by asserting that they wanted their votes to keep jobs in America. He also addressed the Amish community, promising to protect their raw milk, farming, religious freedom, and school choice, as well as ensuring they could afford large families.For hunters, he noted that many were not registered to vote, encouraging them to support the Second Amendment and to register. Presler expressed his deep love for the country and called on Pennsylvanians to use their ballots to support Trump in the upcoming election, reminding them that President Trump had taken a bullet for the nation and now needed their backing.Scott Presler, a conservative activist, gained prominence for his involvement in Republican politics and movements. Born in Florida or Virginia in the late 1980s, he is the son of a U.S. Navy captain and holds a degree in criminal justice from George Mason University.Presler has been involved in conservative politics since around 2015, initially working as a regional field director for the Republican Party of Virginia and supporting Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. He co-founded Gays for Trump and became known for his use of social media to promote Trump and conservative ideas. In 2017, he volunteered with and later worked for the anti-Muslim group ACT for America , organising events such as the controversial March Against Sharia.Presler has been linked to far-right movements, including the Stop the Steal protests, which falsely claimed electoral fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. He participated in demonstrations in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Washington, D.C., promoting these claims, though he did not enter the Capitol during the January 6th attack. In recent years, Presler has shifted his focus towards voter registration , organising neighbourhood clean-ups and running a nonprofit called Early Vote Action , which seeks to mobilise early Republican voting.Openly gay, Presler has voiced his support for several conservative Republican policies, such as Florida's Don't Say Gay law and stances on gun ownership. He has also been a critic of Islamic extremism, particularly after the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando.","Scott Presler, a conservative activist, gained prominence for his involvement in Republican politics and movements.

Over a 100 PTI members were arrested from Islamabad and more than 600 workers were detained in Lahore, where also Imran’s supporters were staging a protest on his call.

Supporters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan reached Islamabad's iconic D-Chowk late on Saturday, despite the government's efforts to deter them by deploying a heavy police force and cutting off internet services in the capital. The police's use of tear gas to stop protesters was largely ineffective as heavy rain in the capital weakened its impact, Dawn reported.Meanwhile, the Islamabad high court ordered the Pakistan government to prevent any illegal protests in the capital during the SCO summit.However, the court instructed government to assign a specific location for supporters of jailed former PM to hold demonstrations.Islamabad was placed under a strict lockdown on Saturday as authorities sought to prevent the demonstration, which comes in support of the imprisoned cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan. His supporters have been consistently staging protests over the past month, demanding his release.The rallies also target the ruling coalition government, which Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ), claims is illegitimate, alleging that it came to power following a fraudulent election.Pakistan army troops were deployed in Islamabad to ensure security as Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters moved forward with plans for a protest.Meanwhile, Pakistan's interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said that more than 80 police personnel have been injured so far in clashes with supporters of Imran Khan taking part in a march near Islamabad.Khan, who was barred from participating in the February elections due to numerous legal cases against him, has been sidelined from the political arena. However, Imran Khan's PTI has continued to challenge the government by organising regular demonstrations and protests despite facing a crackdown.Earlier in the day, the PTI claimed that Pakistani Rangers “forcefully entered” KP House in Islamabad to arrest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur after he arrived in the capital to take part in the protest.PTI workers set out from Khan's stronghold in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Friday, intending to reach the capital Islamabad. However, they were met with roadblocks made of shipping containers and rounds of tear gas fired by security forces.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi warned Khan's party on Friday to cancel the planned protest, saying that there would be ""no leniency"" if the ban on protests is defied. He accused armed supporters of Khan of marching on Islamabad with the intention of launching an assault on the capital. “They should think about what they are going to do with Pakistan by marching on Islamabad with weapons,” he said.“I am very clear that they are going to launch an assault on Islamabad,” Naqvi said. He urged Imran Khan's party to postpone their rally to avoid disrupting the capital city's preparations for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting on October 15 and 16.On Saturday, small groups of protesters persisted in their efforts to enter the capital, defying the government's decision to deploy troops on the streets. The government justified the deployment as a necessary measure to ensure security ahead of the upcoming SCO.""I am so proud of all our people,"" Khan said in a message posted on the social media platform X on Saturday afternoon. ""You showed unfaltering resilience and courage as you came out yesterday and overcame unbelievable obstacles to keep marching forward towards D Chowk.""Lahore's D-Chowk or Democracy Chowk is known in Pakistan as the place where various protests routinely take place. In the past, Imran Khan had a 126-day sit-in protest here in 2014.Imran Khan urged citizens to continue their journey to D Chowk and join the convoy led by Ali Amin. ""I am calling on everyone to keep heading to D Chowk and join Ali Amin's convoy. I especially want to commend our people from KP, North Punjab, and Islamabad. You have defeated insurmountable obstacles, including shelling, chemicals fired from helicopters, trenches & nails on the motorway, with your determination and commitment,"" Imran Khan said.The former Prime Minister also called upon the people of Punjab to gather at Minar-i-Pakistan in Lahore. ""I am also asking our people from Punjab to move towards Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. If they cannot make it there, they must join the protests in their cities,"" he said.Protests were also planned in Lahore on Saturday, but access to the city was restricted as the main road connecting it to the capital was blocked.

The rights group further added, ""These restrictions are part of a worrying clampdown on the right to protest in Pakistan.""Imran Khan, 72, served as Pakistan's Prime Minister from 2018 to 2022 before being removed from office through a parliamentary no-confidence vote. His ousting came after he fell out of favour with the powerful military establishment, which is considered to be the kingmaker in Pakistani politics.Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif's government has claimed that Khan's party aims to weaken the country's economy through violent protests despite the threat posed by the Pakistani Taliban.Despite Imran Khan being in jail since August 2023, candidates supported by him secured the most seats in the general election held in February. However, their numbers were not enough to form a government.Imran's opponents, led by prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, formed a coalition government instead.",Supporters of Imran Khan reach Islamabad's iconic D-Chowk late on Saturday. Police's use of tear gas to stop protesters was largely ineffective as heavy rain in the capital weakened its impact.

Six soldiers and as many terrorists were killed in a gunfight in Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to a statement from the Pakistan military on Saturday.Inter-Services Public Relations ( ISPR ), the military's media wing, said that the exchange of fire occurred during the night between October 4-5 in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan district, which shares a border with Afghanistan.Lieutenant colonel Muhammad Ali Shoukat, aged 43, who was leading the operation against the terrorists, lost his life along with five other soldiers during the ""intense fire exchange"", the Pakistan military said.The banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed responsibility for the attack. The TTP, established in 2007 as an umbrella organization for several militant groups, has been officially declared as 'Fitna al-Khawarij' by the Pakistani government. The interior ministry's notification emphasizes the use of the term 'khariji' (outlawed) when referring to such terrorists.Pakistan has repeatedly accused the TTP of operating from sanctuaries in Afghanistan, a claim that the Afghan Taliban denies. Since the Taliban's takeover of the government in Kabul in 2021, there has been a rise in terrorist incidents in Pakistan, shattering hopes in Islamabad that a friendly government in Afghanistan would help combat militancy.The relationship between the two countries has recently become strained, primarily due to the TTP and frequent border skirmishes.",Six soldiers and as many terrorists were killed in a gunfight in Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

What's on the agenda

Improving ties



NEW DELHI: Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.As per media reports in the Maldives , Muizzu, his wife Sajidha Mohamed, and a high-level delegation of Maldivian government officials traveled on a special flight arranged by the Indian government, a gesture reserved for such visits by Maldivian presidents.Muizzu will receive an official welcome on Monday.During his visit from October 6-10, Muizzu will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi , external affairs minister S Jaishankar and other top ministers to discuss various bilateral, regional, and international issues.The president's upcoming discussions are expected to lead to several agreements that could enhance bilateral cooperation.Muizzu has been criticised for pivoting his island nation sharply towards China, and eyebrows were raised in New Delhi after he decided to break tradition by not making India his first foreign visit after taking office in November last year. Instead, he initially visited Turkey and China - a significant diplomatic shift, particularly given that his administration has been perceived as pro-China and has previously campaigned on an ""India Out"" platform.This change in approach had raised concerns about the future of India-Maldives relations, which had become strained following Muizzu's election.However, ties between the two countries have been warming up with Muizzu publicly acknowledging India's importance, referring to it as ""one of the closest allies and invaluable partners"" of the Maldives. The Maldivian president's acknowledgment of India's role in providing aid during times of need also indicates a willingness to move past contentious rhetoric towards constructive engagement.This shift could pave the way for a more balanced approach that respects Maldivian sovereignty while recognising India's strategic interests in the region.Geopolitically, the Maldives is crucial for India's 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative and its 'Neighbourhood First Policy'. The Maldives serves as a key maritime neighbor in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), making it strategically significant for India's national security interests.The president met EAM Jaishankar on Sunday evening shortly after landing in New Delhi.""Pleased to call on President Muizzu today at the start of his State Visit to India. Appreciate his commitment to enhance 🇮🇳 🇲🇻 relationship. Confident that his talks with PM Modi on Monday will give a new impetus to our friendly ties,"" the external affairs minister posted on X.Official talks and signing of agreements with Indian leadership are scheduled for Monday.President Muizzu will also meet with the Maldivian community living in India, on Sunday.He will also engage in business events in Mumbai and Bengaluru, highlighting the importance of economic ties between the two nations.The delegation accompanying president Muizzu includes foreign minister Dr Abdullah Khaleel, defense minister Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon, minister of homeland security and technology Ali Ihusaan, finance minister Moosa Zameer, health minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, and economic development minister Mohamed Saeed.Other key officials joining the visit are attorney general Ahmed Usham, tourism minister Ibrahim Faisal, transport & civil aviation minister Mohamed Ameen, construction & infrastructure minister Dr Abdulla Muththalib, and chief of staff at the President's Office Abdulla Fayaz, alongside several senior officials.Muizzu last visited India in June to attend the swearing in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the visit, the two leaders met and discussed strengthening bilateral relations between Maldives and India.The two leaders also met on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai in December last year.Relations between the two countries had deteriorated after two Maldivian deputy ministers made defamatory comments about PM Modi and India on social media, amid ongoing discussions about the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the Maldives.The two officials, Malsha Shareef and Mariyam Shiuna were suspended from their roles in the Ministry of Youth and later resigned on September 10 this year.Withdrawal of Indian military personnel was a key pledge of President Muizzu, and the transition was carried out peacefully, with civilians replacing Indian troops as per the agreement between the two governments.Muizzu's administration has since appeared committed to mending relations with India.","Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.
