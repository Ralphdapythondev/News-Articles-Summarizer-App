""The girls had to be young and hot, so I always had a scale nearby in case I needed to make sure.

""Every girl had to wear a party dress, preferably very short, just enough to cover her butt cheeks but no longer than mid-thigh. Cleavage showing. And every single one of them had to be wearing stilettos,"" the former party planner who worked with Diddy in 2004 and 2005 said.The woman said she never stayed around for the Freak Offs and had no idea that those girls were expected to have sex with people which Diddy used to record.

Trump says he's 'opposite of a Nazi' as toxic MSG rally poisons America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-hes-opposite-of-a-nazi-as-toxic-msg-rally-poisons-america/articleshow/114736898.cms,"Donald Trump

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

MAGA Supremo Donald Trump asserted on Monday that he is the ""opposite of a Nazi"" as reverberations from a vile and toxic rally he headlined at Madison Square Garden on Sunday continued to rattle the US political arena.""The newest line from Kamala and her campaign is that everyone who isn't voting for her is a Nazi,"" Trump told a typically raucous rally in Atlanta, fabricating an attribution to his opponent. ""I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi,"" he added, going on to accuse Harris of being a ""fascist,"" which is what some of his own former aides have called him.Trump and some of his allies were visibly rattled by the shock and revulsion Sunday's MSG rally caused across the political spectrum, with some speakers using filthy, vitriolic language to denigrate Kamala Harris and minorities. Many commentators pointed to the use of extremist symbols, idioms, and language to argue the gathering was redolent of a neo-Nazi rally.Political analysts also noted the use at the rally of the song Dixie, which is considered by many as a Confederate anthem celebrating slavery and secession, but which is cherished by some conservatives as an ode to Southern pride. The song is banned in many institutions because it is evocative of a racist America that condoned slavery.While the Trump campaign regretted the crass joke by a comedian who referred to Puerto Rico as “a floating island of garbage,” it notably made no comment on other offensive jibes about Latinos, Black Americans, Jews, and Muslims, and coarse and vulgar references to Kamala Harris.""These Latinos, they love making babies, too.....There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country,” the comedian Peter Hinchcliffe said at the rally in a ""joke"" resonant with Trump's charge that immigrants are ""poisoning the blood of our country.""While there has been much commentary on which demographic -- women, blacks, Muslim-Americans, Jewish Americans, Indian-Americans etc -- could tilt the elections one way or the other, immediate attention is now on Latinos, particularly Puerto Ricans, who form an influential voting bloc in many states.Fortunately for the Trump campaign, nearly 50 million Americans -- about 30 per cent of the expected turnout -- have already voted in early polling. But the fiasco still leaves it vulnerable in what is being called an ""October surprise"" which could be a setback or turnaround in a presidential campaign.The Harris campaign and its liberal and moderate supporters are furiously pounding the issue as both sides wheel out polls and cherrypick surveys showing them ahead, even as they gear up for a electoral gridlock and legal challenges on November 5/6. Many political mavens fear that November 6 could be the new January 6 when Trump stormtroopers besieged the US Capitol to protest a process that formalized a Biden victory in the 2020 election.In an effort to draw a contrast with that event, Kamala Harris is holding a rally on Tuesday evening at the Ellipse, which is diametrically opposite to the Capitol, and where Trump's provocative speech on January 6 let loose his MAGA mob on the seat of US legislature. Harris aides say she will lay out in clear terms her vision for the future, warning that a second Trump presidency would be more dangerous than the first because he would be ""more unhinged and more unchecked.""","'I'm not a Nazi.

Jeff Bezos defends Washington Post’s decision as paper faces subscriber backlash: Presidential endorsements,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/presidential-endorsements-jeff-bezos-defends-washington-posts-decision-as-paper-faces-subscriber-backlash/articleshow/114737969.cms,"According to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post the media is facing a fall in credibility, and endorsing a presidential candidate will only create a perception of non-independence.

Catch up quick

The Washington Post’s announcement marked a notable shift. Historically, the editorial board has endorsed Democratic candidates, but this year, as Republican Donald Trump faces Democrat Kamala Harris , it opted for neutrality.

, it opted for neutrality. The Washington Post cited a need to reduce perceived bias as a reason for abstaining from endorsements.

The paper's decision has resulted in the cancellation of over 200,000 subscriptions, representing 8% of its total circulation.

Notable resignations followed the announcement, including three members of the editorial board and prominent columnists.

Bezos expressed regret over the timing, acknowledging the decision's proximity to the election had unintended consequences.

What They’re Saying

The decision sparked immediate backlash from journalists and subscribers. Critics argue that refraining from endorsing a candidate is itself a political statement, possibly appeasing former President Trump, who has often criticized Bezos and the Washington Post. Bezos countered that the decision wasn’t an effort to protect Amazon or other business interests, insisting it was based purely on principle.

Former editor Marty Baron denounced the decision, describing it as “cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.” Similarly, columnists Robert Kagan and Michele Norris resigned, citing disagreements with the paper’s direction.

Zoom in: Bezos’s defense

Bezos argued that the media’s role as a credible, independent voice is critical, especially in an era where misinformation on social media can drive polarization.

He noted that presidential endorsements contribute to a “perception of non-independence” that undermines public trust.

Bezos wrote: “What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.”

He emphasized that the Washington Post, along with other news institutions, must adapt to this credibility crisis by making difficult choices to rebuild trust.

Polling and public commentary reflect a deep-rooted skepticism among Americans, who view media endorsements as less about informing the public and more about wielding influence.

Bezos highlighted the dwindling public trust in media, pointing out that journalism has often ranked at the bottom in surveys of public confidence. A recent Gallup poll even placed it below Congress, which has historically had one of the lowest trust ratings.

Bezos sees this loss of credibility as a pressing issue, likening it to a voting machine that not only needs to count votes accurately but also to be believed by voters as accurate. He believes that eliminating presidential endorsements, which can be construed as partial, is a step toward repairing this trust.

""Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,” Bezos asserted. “What they actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.”

Bezos’ “complexifier”: A wealthy media owner’s challenges

While Bezos claims that his influence on the editorial staff is minimal, he acknowledges that his vast business interests make him a “complexifier” for the Post. Amazon and Blue Origin, companies he founded and owns, have substantial dealings with the US government, raising inevitable questions about potential conflicts of interest. Bezos is aware that his presence can complicate perceptions of the Post’s neutrality, and he has publicly invited readers to examine his track record since acquiring the paper in 2013.

For Bezos, the issue of media credibility is not solely a Washington Post problem but an industry-wide crisis. In an era of fake news and misinformation, where social media can disseminate unverified information faster than traditional news outlets, the stakes are too high for maintaining public trust in established media. “Many of the finest journalists you’ll find anywhere work at The Washington Post, and they work painstakingly every day to get to the truth,” Bezos wrote, underscoring the importance of the paper’s role in providing credible news.

A broader trend across the US media

The Washington Post is not alone in rethinking its role in political endorsements. Over the years, the number of newspapers endorsing presidential candidates has steadily decreased.

In 2008, nearly all major newspapers chose between the two main candidates, but by 2020, fewer than 55 of the largest papers made such endorsements.

With readership becoming increasingly polarized, many media owners fear alienating half their audience by supporting a candidate.

It’s a stance that can shield their publications from accusations of partisanship but has also invited criticism from loyal subscribers who expect guidance on issues of national importance.

Some media analysts, like Rick Edmonds from the Poynter Institute, told AP that endorsements have become a liability in today’s environment. “They really don’t want to rattle or anger people who are not going to like their endorsement,” Edmonds said. This shift towards neutrality, however, is not universally accepted by audiences. After the Post’s announcement, former subscribers openly expressed frustration, viewing the non-endorsement as a betrayal of journalistic principles.

The big picture context on media trust

This erosion of trust is a problem that affects more than just the Washington Post. Bezos highlighted how people increasingly turn to alternative sources—unvetted social media posts, opinionated podcasts, and partisan news sites—which frequently spread misinformation. Bezos contends that these choices fragment public discourse and drive divisive narratives, a trend that threatens the role of fact-based journalism.

In his note, he reflected: “Voting machines must meet two requirements. They must count the vote accurately, and people must believe they count the vote accurately. The second requirement is distinct from and just as important as the first.” The same, he argued, applies to news organizations. For the Washington Post to succeed as a credible news source, it needs readers to trust not only its accuracy but also its independence.

According to a Gallup poll, the American public's trust in the news media has reached an all-time low, with the institution ranking at the bottom among 10 key civic and political entities that play a role in the democratic process. The legislative branch of the federal government, which includes the US Senate and House of Representatives, fares only slightly better, with a mere 34% of the population expressing trust in its abilities.

The way forward

The Washington Post’s decision to step back from endorsements is a high-stakes gamble in an industry fighting to preserve relevance and credibility. Bezos, for his part, has staked his reputation on what he believes is a principled approach to journalism. But for many readers and even Post employees, the decision feels like a retreat, a step away from the courage that has historically defined the paper.

As the fallout continues, it’s clear that Bezos’ path to restoring trust in the media will not be easy. The modern audience is more fragmented and wary than ever, and while some may applaud the Post’s neutral stance, others view it as abandonment.

When The Washington Post , one of America’s most influential newspapers, announced that it would not endorse a candidate in the upcoming presidential election , the decision was met with polarized responses. Jeff Bezos , the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, defended this decision, calling it “principled” and the “right” one.However, the Washington Post's decision to halt endorsements wasn’t isolated; it aligns with a broader trend as newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, re-evaluate their role in the political sphere.(With inputs from agencies)","The Washington Post announced it would not endorse a presidential candidate.

She underwent dialysis for 10 days in an attempt to save her kidneys.She is one of at least 75 people who fell ill and one of 22 hospitalized due to the outbreak, which is tentatively linked to contaminated onions used in the hamburgers. Mesa County, where Kamberlyn resides, reported 11 illnesses and one death. Federal health officials believe the slivered onions on the burgers are a likely source of the outbreak.Kamberlyn’s mother, Brittany Randall, expressed distress over her daughter’s condition and the broader implications of food safety. ""It's pretty scary to know that we put so much faith and trust that we're going to be eating something that's healthy and for it to be broken,"" she said.Randall plans to sue the fast-food chain after Kamberlyn contracted the E. coli O157:H7 bacteria confirmed in the outbreak, which can cause severe kidney disease complications. According to medical experts, the bacteria can lead to a condition known as hemolytic uremic syndrome.Randall, who works as a jail guard and has three older children, initially thought Kamberlyn had the flu. When Kamberlyn reported blood in her stool, urine, and vomiting blood, Randall realized the situation was serious.On Oct. 11, Kamberlyn visited a hospital in Grand Junction but was sent home with a likely stomach bug diagnosis and instructions to stay hydrated. By Oct. 17, her condition had worsened, and further tests indicated acute kidney failure . She was then flown to Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora.Randall is uncertain about her daughter’s future health and the associated medical costs. “The hospital bills are racking up,” she said. “And I'm a single mom and I just don't know that I can necessarily afford all of what's coming after all of this. And I don't know what the future looks like, either.""",Kamberlyn Bowler was flown 250 miles to a hospital near Denver in mid-October.

The United States has expressed approval over the easing of tensions along the India-China border, following the recent disengagement of troops from both countries along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Matthew Miller , the spokesperson for the US state department , said that the situation is being closely monitored and confirmed discussions with India on the issue. “We are closely following the developments and we understand that both countries have taken initial steps to withdraw troops from the friction points along the LAC. We welcome any reduction in tensions along the border,” Miller said during a press briefing.""We have talked to our Indian partners and taken a brief on it, but we did not play any role in this resolution,"" he added.The disengagement process in the Depsang and Demchok areas of eastern Ladakh is under way. The conflict along the LAC dates back to April 2020 when hostilities began, leading to strained relations between the two nations.

Chinese spokesperson Lin Jian noted that the process is moving ""smoothly.""On October 21, India announced a new agreement with China regarding patrolling along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, marking the end of the prolonged military standoff since 2020.

'Trump’s vision of fear and division not who we are': What Kamala Harris said in her 'closing argument' before election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-vision-of-fear-and-division-not-who-we-are-what-kamala-harris-said-in-her-closing-argument-before-election/articleshow/114754581.cms,"'A new generation of leadership'

Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech one week before Election Day , aiming to draw a stark contrast between her vision for America and that of former President Donald Trump . Speaking from the Ellipse near the White House — the same area where Trump addressed supporters ahead of the January 6 Capitol attack — Harris warned voters about the dangers of returning to a Trump presidency, casting him as a divisive figure obsessed with power. “America, I am here tonight to say: That’s not who we are.”Reflecting on Trump’s past actions, particularly his conduct on January 6, Harris reminded voters of his role in the Capitol insurrection and his continued divisive rhetoric. “Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,” she said.Harris sought to frame herself as a leader for a “new generation,” committed to turning the page on political drama, conflict, and division. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” she told the audience, advocating for a shift away from partisanship and towards unity. “We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms,” she added, calling for a renewed sense of national purpose that transcends political divisions.Harris said that she will prioritise practical issues that affect Americans’ daily lives, contrasting this with Trump’s focus on personal grievances. “Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,” she said. “He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at my table. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans, to always put country above party and above self.”Her speech included specific promises for her potential administration, addressing issues like economic fairness, security, and immigration. “When I am president, we will quickly remove those who arrive here unlawfully, prosecute the cartels, and give border patrol the support they need,” she promised, aiming to offer a balanced approach to immigration reform.Reflecting on Trump’s vision for America, Harris described it as one rooted in discord and hostility. “Donald Trump is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power,” she said.","Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech one week before Election Day.

Biden’s comments came in response to a controversial remark made at a Trump rally, where comedian Tony Hinchcliffe described Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.”Biden condemned the remarks, saying, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we’ve been.” He added that Trump “doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community,” and encouraged voters to “reject [Trump]” in the upcoming election.Biden’s strong language quickly drew a response from Republicans, including Trump himself. At a campaign stop, Trump likened Biden’s words to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 comments about Trump supporters being a “basket of deplorables,” a term that has since become a rallying cry among his base. “Remember Hillary? She said ‘deplorable’… and ‘irredeemable.’ Garbage, I think, is worse, right?” Trump said, drawing laughter from supporters.Trump's running mate JD Vance, also condemned Biden’s comments, calling them “disgusting.” He accused Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of “attacking half of the country.”Democrats, meanwhile, faced internal pressures to distance themselves from Biden’s remarks. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said on CNN that he “would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans, even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support.”The controversy highlighted the intensifying battle for Hispanic voters , with both parties working to shore up support among this increasingly influential demographic. Vice President Harris seized on Hinchcliffe’s comments in an ad targeting Puerto Rican voters, and her campaign received a show of support from popular Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny.","Biden's comments came in response to a controversial remark made at a Trump rally, where comedian Tony Hinchcliffe described Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” Biden condemned the remarks, saying, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.

Elon Musk, the father of at least 12, wants his children to grow together, though some of them are grown-ups and are not at all close to their father. According to a New York Times report, Elon Musk has told people close to him in recent months that he envisions some of his children and two of the three mothers residing at the same compound so that the children could be a part of one another's lives and Musk could schedule time among them.Musk reportedly has a 14,400-square-foot mansion villa in Austin where he envisions the secret compound for his huge family -- there are three mansions for three mothers and their children.The NYT report said Musk initially hoped to build a compound for his family on the hundreds of acres that he and his companies owned outside Austin, near Tesla's headquarters. But the investigation by the Justice Department into whether Tesla's resources had been used for personal use forced Elon to drop the idea.Elon Musk was living with former girlfriend Grimes in a 6,900-square-foot house until Grimes moved out and left Austin in 2023. ""Still Mr Musk continued his home purchase spree. He offered some homeowners 20 to 70 per cent above the value of their houses, according to those homeowners. Some were required to sign nondisclosure agreements just to see the offer, according to three people familiar with the agreements,"" the NYT report said.Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis, mother of three of Musk's children, now lives in Austin.After the death of his first child, Nevada, who died when he was only 10 weeks, Elon Musk welcomed five children with his wife Justin Wilson -- Griffin, Vivian (Xavier before coming out as transgender), Kai Saxon and Damian; X, Exa Dark Sideræl, Techno Mechanicus with Grimes; Strider, Azure and another child whose name and sex are not known with Shivon Zilis.","Elon Musk reportedly has a 14,400-square-foot mansion villa in Austin.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world's most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated.

He stated, ""Some KP ministers are more focused on benefits than promoting the goals of the PTI.""The MNA mentioned that he had received threats of expulsion from the party but asserted that such threats would not dissuade him. He indicated his plan to meet with the PTI founder to discuss the current situation in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. He noted that he would inform Imran about alleged misconduct by certain officials, whom he believes should face prosecution rather than be rewarded with government positions.Citing a previous incident, Marwat criticized the recent promotion of a police officer who reportedly fired at him in Bajaur.

To assist commuters traveling from Teen Hatti, the police offered an alternative route through PIB Colony.The factions of the Battagram Trade Union have announced a complete shutter-down strike and sit-in beginning Tuesday in response to the widespread power outage in Karachi district, Pakistan. Until then, the union will withhold electricity bill payments.The outrage affected small businesses like tailors and welders, creating a virtual halt in commercial activities. This has frustrated both residents and business firms in the same manner as they rely on electricity for their daily purposes.As per the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) department, ""The power cuts took place after an order taken by the High Court related to an alleged incident involving the assault of a female prisoner at the Battagram sub-jail.""Conversely, the trade union has rejected the explanation for the power outage, labeling it as ""ridiculous."" They argue that the daytime power outages are solely to ensure a continuous electricity supply at night for the ongoing operation of CCTV cameras in the sub-jail.The union further contended that the decision to cut power constitutes an ""economic murder"" of local traders, who have been unable to conduct business for over a week. Consequently, the union is urging immediate action to restore power supply in the area, aiming to safeguard the economic interests of both residents and business operators.","Residents of Karachi have been experiencing severe and unusual load-shedding, leading to power outages during the daytime.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities Thursday released Bushra Bibi , wife of jailed former PM Imran Khan , from prison in Rawalpindi, a day after Islamabad high court granted her bail in an alleged graft case involving purchase and sale of state gifts.Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage just ahead of the Feb 8 polls in Pakistan. The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.The case over allegations of illegal marriage had collapsed on appeal and Bibi’s graft sentence was suspended in July, allowing her to walk free from Adiala Jail where Imran remains imprisoned.She was, however, arrested again in a fresh graft case. In the new case, dubbed as “Toshakhana 2,” the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader at a low price, causing a significant loss to the national exchequer. The gift set included a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings.A day earlier, HC judge Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb approved Bushra’s bail in the case, following which a special court issued her release orders, ending nearly nine months of her detention. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) hailed her release, with slogans of “welcome back Bushra Bibi.”“You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaigns and character assassination attempts against you during your illegal time in jail. The Pakistani nation salutes your bravery,” PTI said in a post on X, confirming that Bibi had reached her Bani Gala residence in the federal capital.Meanwhile, the Islamabad HC on Thursday also ordered the jail administration to produce Imran by 3pm in court to facilitate his meeting with his lawyers. “I know you won’t implement my orders, but let me issue directions,” Justice Ijaz Ishaq Khan remarked during the hearing. The judge later softened his stance after jail authorities assured him that they would arrange Imran’s meeting with his counsels in prison.Imran and his party have been at crosshairs of an ongoing tussle between the executive and the judiciary, with the latter accusing the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies of exerting pressure to secure favourable verdicts in political cases, particularly those involving the PTI chief.Imran has not physically appeared in a court since Aug last year, with all hearings being held in the high-security Rawalpindi prison.","Bushra Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31.

While the police dismiss the reports as "" fake news "" designed to incite unrest, protesting students see them as a rare opportunity to publicly address the issue of sexual assault.Despite the conflicting narratives, both sides acknowledge that the case has exposed legitimate concerns. Khadija Shabbir, a 21-year-old protester in Lahore , asserts that girls on campuses feel threatened. Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi, the senior officer investigating the case, admits that harassment is an extremely sensitive subject that most women in Pakistan have experienced to some degree.The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore. When authorities were unable to identify a victim, they dismissed the claims as a hoax. However, student protests erupted, leading to arrests and the closure of educational institutes across Punjab province.Students, who have been banned from officially organizing in unions for the past four decades, continue to protest, driven by a deep-rooted frustration with the lack of trust in authorities to take the matter of harassment seriously. Many protesters cite personal experiences of harassment as their primary motivation for participating in the movement.The Lahore High Court has announced a new committee of judges to investigate campus sexual harassment , indicating that authorities are acknowledging the validity of the protests. However, the confrontation between students and police is taking place amidst a broader crackdown on dissent in Pakistan, with student social media pages and online chat groups disappearing and officials pledging to prosecute those spreading misinformation.As the protests continue, women who have shared their experiences with harassment find themselves sidelined as the demonstrations sometimes turn violent, often led by men. Despite this, young female students remain determined to stand up for their rights and fight against sexual harassment on college campuses.","The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore.
