Jewish Yale student stabbed in eye with Palestine flag during anti-Israel protest reporting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jewish-yale-student-stabbed-in-eye-with-palestine-flag-during-anti-israel-protest-reporting/articleshow/109502848.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sahar Tartak , a Jewish student journalist at Yale University , was assaulted while reporting on an anti-Israeli protest on campus Saturday night.Tartak, who serves as the editor-in-chief of the Yale Free Press, was surrounded by demonstrators and stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag. Despite her attempts to report the incident to campus police, she was told there was nothing they could do, and she had to seek medical attention at a hospital.Describing the attack, Tarak told the New York Post, ""There’s hundreds of people taunting me and waving the middle finger at me, and then this person waves a Palestinian flag in my face and jabs it in my eye.When I tried to yell and go after him, the protesters got in a line and stopped me.""The protest, which saw hundreds of students camping at the campus in support of Palestinians, has been criticized for its egregious behavior, including intimidation, harassment, and other harmful acts.Stop Antisemitism, a nonprofit watchdog group, has shared an image of the demonstrator who jabbed Tartak in the eye and is asking the public for help in identifying him.Yale officials have stated that the university's police department is investigating the assault and that the school does not tolerate violence on its campus. University President Peter Salovey echoed this sentiment in a statement, saying, ""Yale does not tolerate actions, including remarks, that threaten, harass, or intimidate members of the university's Jewish, Muslim, and other communities.""However, some students, such as Noah Rubin from the University of Pennsylvania, have criticized Yale for not enforcing its own policies regarding protests. According to the school's guidelines, protesters are not allowed to block access to building entrances and are considered trespassers if they refuse to leave when instructed.In addition to the violence on Saturday, students are also holding a hunger strike on campus to pressure Yale into divesting from weapons manufacturers affiliated with Israel. The hunger strike has been ongoing for more than six days and has garnered support from various individuals, including drag performer Tifa Wine, who joined the students on Friday to criticize the university's alleged support of Israel.","Sahar Tartak, editor-in-chief of the Yale Free Press, was stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag.

"With homelessness on the rise, Supreme Court to weigh bans on sleeping outdoors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/with-homelessness-on-the-rise-supreme-court-to-weigh-bans-on-sleeping-outdoors/articleshow/109490310.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Supreme Court will consider Monday whether banning homeless people from sleeping outside when shelter space is lacking amounts to cruel and unusual punishment . The case is considered the most significant to come before the high court in decades on homelessness , which is reaching record levels in the United States.In California and other Western states, courts have ruled that it's unconstitutional to fine and arrest people sleeping in homeless encampments if shelter space is lacking.A cross-section of Democratic and Republican officials contend that makes it difficult for them to manage encampments, which can have dangerous and unsanitary living conditions.But hundreds of advocacy groups argue that allowing cities to punish people who need a place to sleep will criminalise homelessness and ultimately make the crisis worse.The justice department has also weighed in. They argue people shouldn't be punished just for sleeping outside, but only if there's a determination they truly have nowhere else to go.The case comes from the rural Oregon town of Grants Pass, which started fining people USD 295 for sleeping outside to manage homeless encampments that sprung up in the city's public parks as the cost of housing escalated.The measure was largely struck down by the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which also found in 2018 that such bans violated the 8th Amendment by punishing people for something they don't have control over.The case comes after homelessness in the United States grew a dramatic 12 per cent, to its highest reported level as soaring rents and a decline in coronavirus pandemic assistance combined to put housing out of reach for more Americans, according to federal data.","The case is considered the most significant to come before the high court in decades on homelessness.

How Melania could help Donald Trump's in his criminal trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-melania-could-help-donald-trumps-in-his-criminal-trial/articleshow/109501534.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former first lady Melania Trump might play a significant role in bolstering former President Donald Trump's defense at his ongoing criminal trial in New York City, according to insights from legal experts. Jury selection concluded recently for the trial where Donald Trump faces 34 felony charges concerning alleged hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign.He has pleaded not guilty, denouncing the charges as a political vendetta.As per a Newsweek report, Melania Trump, who was not present during the initial days of the trial, is speculated to possibly testify. Although her testifying remains uncertain, her presence alone could offer a substantial morale boost to Donald Trump's case. Mark Bederow, a criminal defense attorney and former Manhattan prosecutor, highlighted the potential impact of her support in court, suggesting that her mere presence might convey to the jury that she believes in her husband's innocence, possibly influencing their perception favorably.Legal analysts suggest that Melania Trump's testimony, if it occurs, would primarily symbolize her support rather than contribute direct evidence regarding the allegations. None of Trump’s children have attended the trial, although they, along with Melania, are listed as potential witnesses. Legal pundits emphasize the improbability of Melania Trump being compelled to testify against her husband, citing her minimal involvement in the alleged infractions and the potential risks of such a move by the prosecution.As the trial progresses, the focus is expected to rely heavily on documentary evidence rather than personal testimonies, aiming to steer clear of sensationalism in a case already surrounded by high public interest and media scrutiny.David Pecker, former publisher of the National Enquirer, is anticipated to be the lead witness in the prosecution against Trump, starting Monday. He is likely to testify regarding a central scheme in the ongoing hush-money trial. According to a report by The New York Times on Sunday, which quotes an anonymous source, Pecker is scheduled to testify first.(With inputs from agencies)","Jury selection concluded recently for the trial where Donald Trump faces 34 felony charges concerning alleged hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.

'Forever war': Elon Musk voices concern over 'no exit strategy' in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/forever-war-elon-musk-voices-concern-over-no-exit-strategy-in-ukraine/articleshow/109499893.cms,"NEW DELHI: Elon Musk , CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, has voiced concerns over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, labeling it as potentially becoming ""a forever war ."" His comments were made in response to a new $61 billion funding package for Kiev approved by the House of Representatives.Musk expressed his apprehensions on X (formerly Twitter), in a dialogue initiated by fellow billionaire David Sachs, who commented on the recent legislative approval.Musk stated, “My biggest concern is that there is no exit strategy, just a forever war where kids die in trenches from artillery or charging machine guns and snipers through minefields.”The tech billionaire has previously criticized the lack of accountability in how aid to Ukraine is utilized and called for a comprehensive plan to resolve the conflict. In February, Musk suggested that the United States should cease its financial aid to Ukraine, arguing that it only prolongs the war and that there is ""no way in hell"" Russia would lose. He also mentioned that the ongoing military support does not truly benefit Ukraine, implying that prolonging the conflict could lead to greater losses for Kiev.Musk's involvement with Ukraine has been complex. He provided Kiev with free Starlink internet terminals and access to the satellite-based network. However, he later refused to activate the service near the Russian port city of Sevastopol in Crimea, citing concerns that it could be used to escalate the conflict.Meanwhile, Ukrainian and Western leaders expressed relief and gratitude following the US House of Representatives' approval of a substantial aid package aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defense against Russia's ongoing invasion. The package, which includes significant military aid, was passed during a rare Saturday session, reflecting a bipartisan effort to support Ukraine amidst its prolonged conflict with Russia.Details of the aid packageThe $95 billion aid package is not solely dedicated to Ukraine but also includes assistance for Israel and other U.S. allies. Of this, $61 billion is earmarked for military aid, with $13.8 billion allocated specifically for Ukraine to purchase weapons. This funding is seen as crucial to counter Russia’s incremental advances as the war enters its third year. Ukrainian commanders and analysts have highlighted the necessity of this aid, stating that while it will help slow down Russian forces, more support will likely be needed for Kyiv to regain the offensive.Ukrainian president's reactionUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” expressed his gratitude toward U.S. lawmakers. He emphasized that the aid package would ""send the Kremlin a powerful signal that (Ukraine) will not be the second Afghanistan."" Zelenskyy outlined that Ukraine would focus on acquiring long-range weapons and enhancing air defenses to counteract what he described as an anticipated ""full-scale offensive"" by Russian forces.Russia's responseIn contrast, the Kremlin warned that the US aid package would ""further ruin"" Ukraine and lead to more casualties. This statement underscores the deepening rift between Western support for Ukraine and Russian opposition to external involvement in the conflict.Next steps for the aid packageThe aid package is now headed to the US Senate, where it could be passed as early as Tuesday. President Joe Biden has indicated his readiness to sign the bill immediately upon its passage. However, there will be a delay before the aid can impact the ground situation, as logistics and distribution to the front lines are expected to take weeks.(With inputs from agencies)","Elon Musk voiced concerns over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, labeling it as potentially becoming ""a forever war"" His comments were made in response to a new $61 billion funding package for Kiev approved by the House of Representatives.

Plans are in place, and these flights will go come what may. No foreign court will stop us from getting flights off,” he said.For two months, progress on the bill has been halted as it ping-ponged between the two chambers of Parliament. The House of Lords repeatedly introduced amendments, only for them to be rejected by the House of Commons. While the Lords lack the authority to terminate the legislation, their assent is required for it to pass into law.The ruling Conservative Party intends to utilize Rwanda as a destination for certain asylum-seekers, aiming to dissuade migrants from risking the perilous journey across the English Channel on unsafe inflatable boats. Despite being pursued by three prime ministers over the past two years, this plan has faced obstacles from court rulings and vocal opposition from migrant advocates who deem it both illegal and inhumane.The current legislation, named the Safety of Rwanda Bill, is a response to a Supreme Court ruling that halted deportation flights due to the government's inability to ensure the safety of migrants transferred to Rwanda.Following the negotiation of a new treaty with Rwanda to enhance safeguards for migrants, the government has put forth the new legislation designating Rwanda as a safe country.(With inputs from agency)","UK's first deportation flight could leave the country within 10-12 weeks, PM Rishi Sunak pledged on Monday.

"'Cancer causing spices': Hong Kong, Singapore ban MDH, Everest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/cancer-causing-spices-hong-kong-singapore-ban-mdh-everest/articleshow/109495604.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hong Kong 's Center for Food Safety(CFS) has taken action against renowned Indian brands MDH and Everest of alleged detection of the carcinogenic pesticide ethylene oxide in several spice mixes. This comes after a similar notification by Singapore on April 18.Ethylene oxide is a cancer-causing agent, making it unsuitable for human consumption. The CFS announced its findings on April 5, revealing that the levels of ethylene oxide found in these spice products exceeded the permissible limits set by Hong Kong regulations.The sale of food containing pesticide residues beyond safe limits is strictly prohibited in Hong Kong under the Pesticide Residues in Food Regulation (Cap. 132CM).Centre For Food Safety of Hong Kong special administrative region announced on April 5 that routine surveillance programs had uncovered the presence of ethylene oxide in three spice mixes from MDH Group - Madras Curry Powder, Sambhar Masala Powder, and Curry Powder.""The CFS collected the above-mentioned samples from three retail outlets in Tsim Sha Tsui respectively for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test results showed that the samples contained a pesticide, ethylene oxide. The CFS has informed the vendors concerned of the irregularities and instructed them to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected products,"" it said in a statement.According to the CFS report, “A food for human consumption containing pesticide residue may only be sold if consumption of the food is not dangerous or prejudicial to health.” The presence of ethylene oxide in the spice products violated this regulation, prompting immediate action from the food safety watchdog.Previously Singapore Food Agency(SFA) had recalled India's 'Everest fish curry masala' due to the presence of ethylene oxide, a pesticide that is not authorised for use in food, beyond permissible limits and advised buyers against consuming it. The importer, Sp Muthiah & Sons, has been directed to recall the products, SFA said in a statement on April 18.Everest, the 57-year old spice brand founded by late Vadilal Bhai Shah is India's largest manufacturer of pure and blended spices and is present in more than 80 countries globally.In a statement to TOI, the company said that all its products go through stringent checks before dispatch and before export. Every shipment goes through quality inspection by the Spice Board of India, it said.

Nasa chief: China is hiding military presence in space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/nasa-chief-china-is-hiding-military-presence-in-space/articleshow/109461911.cms,"What is the Tiangong space station?

NEW DELHI: Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson has expressed serious concerns that China is concealing its military operations in space under the guise of civilian activities. Speaking before the House appropriations committee regarding Nasa's 2025 budget, Nelson emphasized the secretive nature of Beijing's space endeavors and stated that the United States is engaged in a space race with China.""We believe that a lot of their so-called civilian space program is a military program.And I think, in effect, we are in a race,"" Nelson remarked, as reported by The Guardian. He voiced hopes that China would recognize the importance of maintaining space as a realm for peaceful pursuits.China, which operates its own space station, Tiangong , manned by a crew of three astronauts, stands in contrast to Nasa's collaborative management of the International Space Station (ISS) alongside partners from Europe, Canada, Japan, and Russia.Nelson also shared concerns that China could potentially reach the Moon ahead of the US and monopolize lunar resources, which he previously described in 2022. This assertion had drawn criticism from Chinese experts who accused Nelson of harboring a ""colonial mindset.""Amid these tensions, both nations have ambitious lunar objectives. Nasa, along with its international partners, plans to establish sustainable lunar bases and aims to land astronauts on the Moon by 2026. Conversely, China has set its sights on sending astronauts to the Moon by 2030, highlighting the competitive nature of the ongoing space race.The Tiangong space station, also known as ""Heavenly Palace,"" is China's modular space station orbiting Earth. It represents a significant step in China's ambitions to become a major space power, marking their independent capability to maintain a long-term human presence in space. Here are some key details about Tiangong:Similar to the International Space Station (ISS), Tiangong is modular, meaning it is built in sections or modules, which are assembled in orbit. The core module, named ""Tianhe,"" serves as the living quarters and control center. Additional modules provide facilities for science experiments and expanded living space.The station's construction began with the launch of the Tianhe module in April 2021. China plans to expand Tiangong by adding more modules over the next few years, aiming for a fully operational and habitable space station by around 2022-2024.While the Tiangong space station is primarily a national project by China, there have been discussions and indications that China might open up the station to international astronauts and researchers, promoting international collaboration in space exploration.The station is equipped for various scientific research activities in fields such as astronomy, Earth observation, and biological sciences. It includes state-of-the-art facilities for conducting experiments in microgravity and other space-specific conditions.Strategic significance: The development of the Tiangong space station is part of China's broader space strategy, which includes missions to the Moon and Mars. Tiangong not only enhances China's capabilities in space but also serves as a symbol of national pride and technological advancement.","Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson has expressed serious concerns that China is concealing its military operations in space under the guise of civilian activities.

H5N1 bird flu strain detected in milk: WHO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h5n1-bird-flu-strain-detected-in-milk-who/articleshow/109438308.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday announced that the H5N1 bird flu virus strain had been found in significant quantities in raw milk from infected animals , though the duration of the virus's survival in milk remains unknown.Earlier in 1996, Avian influenza A(H5N1) initially surfaced, but since 2020, there has been a remarkable surge in outbreaks among birds, with an increasing number of mammals also falling victim to the disease.This has resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, along with infections in wild birds, as well as land and marine mammals.Last month, cows and goats were added to the list of affected animals, surprising experts who previously didn't consider them susceptible to this strain of influenza. The outbreak of bird flu in cow has affected at least 13 herds in six states, as per the New York Times.The reports of sick cows began to emerge in Texas and New Mexico. Dead birds were also found on some of these farms, and laboratory testing confirmed that some cows were infected with bird flu.Earlier this month, US authorities reported a case of a person recovering from bird flu after exposure to infected cattle on a Texas dairy farm.""The case in Texas is the first case of a human infected by avian influenza by a cow,"" said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization.""Bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow and cow-to-bird transmission have also been registered during these current outbreaks, which suggest that the virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood,"" she told a media briefing in Geneva.This incident marks only the second case of human infection with bird flu in the United States, following illnesses in herds apparently exposed to wild birds.""Now we see multiple herds of cows affected in an increasing number of US states, which shows a further step of the virus spillover to mammals,"" Zhang said.""The virus has also been detected in milk from infected animals.""Zhang said there was a ""very high virus concentration in raw milk"", but experts were still investigating exactly how long the virus is able to survive in milk.The Texas health department assured that infected cattle do not pose a threat to the commercial milk supply since dairies are mandated to discard milk from sick cows, and pasteurization effectively kills the virus.""It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming only pasteurised milk and milk products,"" said Zhang.(With inputs from agency)","The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday announced that the H5N1 bird flu virus strain had been found in significant quantities in raw milk from infected animals.

Indian-origin men involved in Canada's largest-ever gold and money heist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indian-origin-men-involved-in-canadas-largest-ever-gold-and-money-heist/articleshow/109415390.cms,"It was a brazen theft: thousands of gold bars and millions of dollars in bank notes stolen a year ago from Toronto's international airport.Canadian and US authorities said on Wednesday six people, including two Indian-origin men , have been arrested and three more are being sought in connection with what they called the largest gold heist in Canadian history - a cargo of over C$22 million ($16 million) in gold and currency.The arrests were announced after a long-year investigation under Project 24K. The suspects, including two Air Canada employees, forged an airway bill to steal a cargo arriving from Switzerland of C$20 million-worth 6,600 gold bars weighing 400 kg and C$2.5 million in foreign currency, police officials said. The gold was melted down and used to purchase illegal firearms. ""This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,"" said Nishan Duraiappah, chief of Peel police, responsible for law enforcement at Toronto airport .The gold theft appeared to be remarkably simple. The gold and cash arrived at the Toronto airport in a special container aboard an Air Canada flight from Switzerland on April 17, 2023, and it was moved to one of the airline's warehouses. The container held gold bars that were destined for a Toronto-based bank and bank notes bound for a currency exchange. About two hours later, a truck driven by a man who was arrested in Pennsylvania pulled up at the warehouse. The man carried a waybill - a document usually issued by a carrier with details about a shipment - that gave him access to the warehouse. It was actually a duplicate of a waybill, printed on an Air Canada printer, for a shipment of seafood that had been picked up a day earlier. The container with the gold bars and bank notes was loaded into the truck. Video recordings showed the truck travelling down Canada's busiest highway before eventually disappearing from sight in a rural area west of the city.Peel police officers were called early the next morning after an armoured truck of Brinks, an American cash handling company, arrived with the actual waybill for the shipment of gold and bank notes. Canada police said Wednesday that they believe the gold bars, which had serial numbers, were all melted down and that they had seized smelting pots. The only gold recovered, police said, was six bracelets made out of C$89,000 worth of gold.Air Canada employee Parmpal Sidhu, 54, from Brampton, Ontario, jewellery store owner Ali Raza, 37, from Toronto, Amit Jalota, 40, an Oakville, Ontario resident, Ammad Chaudhary, 43, from Georgetown, Ontario and Prasath Paramalingam, 35, from Brampton are among those that have been arrested. According to a PTI report, Sidhu and Jalota are of Indian origin. Police are searching for former Air Canada manager Simran Preet Panesar, 31, from Brampton as well as Archit Grover, 36, from Brampton and Arsalan Chaudhary, 42, from Ontario.Peel detective sergeant Mike Mavity said the truck driver that allegedly picked up the gold, Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old from Brampton, is currently in custody in the US. Sixty-five illegal firearms were found in his possession, two of which had been modified to have fully automatic capabilities.They were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada.

Trump set to return to court for opening statements in his historic hush money trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-set-to-return-to-court-for-opening-statements-in-his-historic-hush-money-trial/articleshow/109504179.cms,"NEW YORK: Opening statements in Donald Trump 's historic hush money trial are set to begin Monday morning, setting the stage for weeks of unsavory and salacious testimony about the former president 's personal life and placing his legal troubles at the center of his closely contested campaign against President Joe Biden.A panel of New Yorkers — 12 jurors and six alternates — was sworn in last Friday after four days of jury selection and will hear what is the first-ever criminal trial against a former U.S.commander-in-chief.Trump is accused of falsifying internal business records as part of an alleged scheme to bury stories that he thought might hurt his presidential campaign in 2016.At the heart of the allegations is a $130,000 payment made to porn actor Stormy Daniels by Michael Cohen , Trump’s former lawyer and personal fixer, to prevent her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump from surfacing in the final days of the race.Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of such payments in internal business documents. Trump has denied having a sexual encounter with Daniels, and his lawyers argue that the payments to Cohen were legitimate legal expenses. He has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.The hush money case is the first of Trump’s four indictments to reach trial.Currently:— Key players: Who’s who at Donald Trump’s hush money criminal trial— The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases. See the others here— Trump cancels rally because of weather, proving the difficulty of balancing a trial and campaign— Trump was forced to listen silently as potential jurors offered their unvarnished assessments of him— Live video of man who set himself on fire outside court proves challenging for news organizationsHere's the latest:New York state law regarding media coverage of court proceedings is one of the most restrictive in the country.Regulations limiting media coverage in courtrooms date back nearly a century, when the spectacle of bright flashbulbs and camera operators standing on witness tables during the 1935 trial of the man accused of kidnapping and killing Charles Lindbergh’s baby son horrified the legal community, according to a 2022 report by the New York-based Fund for Modern Courts.Yet an interest in open government chipped away at these laws and — slowly, carefully — video cameras began to be permitted in courts across the country, often at the discretion of judges presiding in individual cases.New York allowed them, too, on an experimental basis between 1987 and 1997, but they were shut down.The allegations at the heart of this case don’t accuse Donald Trump of an egregious abuse of power like the federal case in Washington charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election, or of flouting national security protocols like the federal case in Florida charging him with hoarding classified documents.But the New York prosecution has taken on added importance because it may be the only one of the four cases against Trump that reaches trial before the election. Appeals and legal wrangling have delayed the other three cases.MICHAEL COHEN — Donald Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. He was once a fierce Trump ally, but now he’s a key prosecution witness against his former boss. Cohen worked for the Trump Organization from 2006 to 2017. He later went to federal prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations relating to the hush money arrangements and other, unrelated crimes.STORMY DANIELS — The porn actor who received a $130,000 payment from Cohen as part of his hush-money efforts. Cohen paid Daniels to keep quiet about what she says was a sexual encounter with Trump years earlier. Trump denies having sex with Daniels.KAREN MCDOUGAL — A former Playboy model who said she had a 10-month affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. She was paid $150,000 in 2016 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for the rights to her story about the alleged relationship. Trump denies having sex with McDougal.DAVID PECKER — The National Enquirer’s former publisher and a longtime Trump friend. Prosecutors say he met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in August 2015 and agreed to help Trump’s campaign identify negative stories about him.HOPE HICKS — Trump’s former White House communications director. Prosecutors say she spoke with Trump by phone during a frenzied effort to keep allegations of his marital infidelity out of the press after the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape leaked weeks before the 2016 election. In the tape, from 2005, Trump boasted about grabbing women without permission.Donald Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and could face four years in prison if convicted, though it’s not clear if the judge would seek to put him behind bars. A conviction would not preclude Trump from becoming president again, but because it is a state case, he would not be able to attempt to pardon himself if found guilty. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.Unfolding as Trump vies to reclaim the White House, the trial will require him to spend his days in a courtroom rather than the campaign trail. He will have to listen as witnesses recount salacious and potentially unflattering details about his private life.Trump has nonetheless sought to turn his criminal defendant status into an asset for his campaign, fundraising off his legal jeopardy and repeatedly railing against a justice system that he has for years claimed is weaponized against him.For the first time, prosecutors will present a criminal case against a former American president to a jury Monday as they accuse Donald Trump of a hush money scheme aimed at preventing damaging stories about his personal life from becoming public.The statements are expected to give jurors and the voting public the clearest view yet of the allegations at the heart of the case, as well as insight into Trump’s expected defense.Hearing the case is a jury that includes, among others, multiple lawyers, a sales professional, an investment banker and an English teacher.The case will test jurors’ ability to set aside any bias but also Trump’s ability to abide by the court’s restrictions, such as a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses. Prosecutors are seeking fines against him for alleged violations of that order.","Donald Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. At the heart of the allegations is a $130,000 payment made to porn actor Stormy Daniels by Michael Cohen.

Trump hush-money trial kicks off with opening statements in New York,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-hush-money-trial-kicks-off-with-opening-statements-in-new-york/articleshow/109503395.cms,"Tight Race

NEW YORK: Donald Trump on Monday will hear prosecutors explain why his alleged cover-up of a hush money payment to a porn star during his 2016 campaign broke the law, as the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president begins in New York Lawyers for the Republican presidential candidate will also make their opening statement in what may be the only one of Trump's four criminal prosecutions to go to trial before his Nov.5 election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.Prosecutors say Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen 's $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier deceived voters in the waning days of Trump's 2016 campaign, when his candidacy was struggling from other revelations of sexual misbehavior.Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsification of business records brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and denies having had a sexual encounter with Daniels.The case is seen by many legal experts as the least consequential of the Trump prosecutions. A guilty verdict would not bar him from taking office, but it could hurt his candidacy.Reuters/Ipsos polling shows half of independent voters and one in four Republicans say they would not vote for Trump if he is convicted of a crime.Prosecutors have said the Daniels payment was part of a broader ""catch and kill"" scheme hatched by Trump, Cohen and David Pecker - the former chief executive of tabloid publisher American Media - to pay off people with potentially damaging information about Trump before the November 2016 election. Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.Pecker is the first witness prosecutors plan to call after opening statements, the New York Times and CNN reported on Sunday. According to prosecutors, Pecker agreed during an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen to act as the campaign's ""eyes and ears"" by looking out for negative stories about Trump.American Media, which publishes the National Enquirer, in 2018 admitted as part of a deal to avoid criminal prosecution that it paid $150,000 to former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal for rights to her story about a months-long affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. American Media said it worked ""in concert"" with Trump's campaign, and it never published a story.The tabloid reached a similar deal to pay $30,000 to a doorman who was seeking to sell a story about Trump allegedly fathering a child out of wedlock, which turned out to be false, according to prosecutors.Trump has said the payments were personal and did not violate election law. He has also denied the affair with McDougal.In the New York trial, Trump is charged with falsely recording his 2017 reimbursement of Cohen for the Daniels payment as a legal expense in his real estate company's books. Prosecutors say he did so to conceal the fact that Cohen's payment exceeded the $2,700 limit on individual campaign contributions at the time.Testimony about the payments to McDougal and the doorman could help prosecutors establish that Cohen's payment to Daniels was part of a broader payments scheme that Trump was trying to prevent from coming to light.Pecker's testimony may also help corroborate testimony by Cohen, the trial's central witness. Prosecutors have acknowledged Cohen may face credibility issues as he was convicted and imprisoned on federal campaign-finance charges for his role in the scheme.Prosecutors plan to call at least 20 witnesses total, according to Trump's defense team. The trial could last six to eight weeks.Trump's legal woes have not hurt his political prospects so far. His approval rating soared among Republicans after the New York charges were announced in April 2023, and polls show him locked in a tight race with Biden.He faces three other criminal indictments stemming from his efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat and his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021.Trump has pleaded not guilty in those cases, and he portrays all of them as a broad-based effort by Biden's Democratic allies to undercut his campaign.Justice Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the hush money trial, imposed a limited gag order on Trump after he criticized witnesses, prosecutors, the judge and his daughter. Prosecutors are pressing Merchan to penalize Trump for violating that order.","The first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president begins in New York.

His message was a response to distressing events, including protestors at Columbia University advocating violence against Jews.He stated, “The events of the last few days, especially last night, have made it clear that Columbia University’s Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students’ safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy.”He further recommended that students should leave the campus for their safety. “It deeply pains me to say that I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved,"" Buechler wrote.The situation has required intervention by the NYPD, as indicated by the university's decision to authorize police action to manage the protests. Columbia University President Minouche Shafik expressed her commitment to tackling antisemitism, stating in a congressional testimony that she is “personally committed to doing everything I can to confront it directly.”The protests have led to significant arrests, including over 100 students for refusing to vacate a pro-Palestinian encampment, among them Isra Hirsi, the daughter of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN).

""We're dead serious about protecting our territory - that's why we do these Balikatan exercises,"" Col. Michael Logico, who speaks for the Philippine military on the combat drills , told The Associated Press.As the disputes between China and the Philippines have escalated, President Joe Biden and his administration has repeatedly warned that the United States is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if it is attacked.U.S. Marine Lt. Gen. William Jurney said in the ceremony that the large-scale military exercises will demonstrate that the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty between the U.S. and the Philippines ""is no mere piece of paper.""Washington lays no claim to the contested waters but has declared that freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of the disputes are in its national interest.Philippine military chief of staff Gen.

No missile would be fired but the aim was to build familiarity among military participants with the hi-tech weaponry in a tropical setting.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian expressed China's grave concern over the deployment of the missile system ""at China's doorstep.""""The U.S. move exacerbates tensions in the region and increases the risk of misjudgement and miscalculation,"" he said in response to a question in a news briefing in Beijing last week. ""The Philippines needs to think twice about being a cat's paw for the U.S. at the expense of its security interests and stop sliding down the wrong path.""The Biden administration has been strengthening an arc of alliances to better counter China, including in a possible confrontation over Taiwan, an island democracy that Beijing claims as its own.That dovetails with efforts by the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to defend its territorial interests by boosting joint military exercises with the U.S. He has also allowed rotating batches of American forces to stay in additional Philippine military camps under a 2014 defense pact, including in his country's north, which lies just a sea border away from Taiwan and southern China.","The annual exercises by the longtime treaty allies will run until May 10.

Papua New Guinea PM dismisses Biden's 'loose' talk on cannibalism as a 'blurry moment',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/papua-new-guinea-pm-dismisses-bidens-loose-talk-on-cannibalism-as-a-blurry-moment/articleshow/109489215.cms,"'The truth'

PORT MORESBY: Papua New Guinea 's leader has dismissed Joe Biden 's unlikely suggestion that his uncle was eaten by cannibals there as ""loose"" talk that does not reflect the US president's feelings for the country.""Sometimes you have loose moments,"" James Marape said in an interview after Biden's contentious remarks, adding that the relationship was stronger than ""one blurry moment"".Biden said last week that his uncle Ambrose Finnegan was shot down over the Pacific nation during World War II, suggesting his body was never found because ""there were a lot of cannibals"" in the area.""I've met him on four occasions, until today, and on every occasion he's always had warm regards for Papua New Guinea,"" Marape said.""Never in those moments (has) he spoke of PNG as cannibals,"" he added.US defence records showed Finnegan's courier flight was actually ""forced to ditch in the ocean"" off the island's coast ""for unknown reasons"".Finnegan's aircraft hit the water hard and three crew members failed to emerge, while one survived and was rescued by a passing barge, the official defense POW/MIA Accounting agency said on its website.A search the next day found ""no trace"" of the missing crew, the agency said, and White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed Finnegan died when he ""crashed in the Pacific"", not over land.Biden's cannibalism quip comes on the back of a string of recent gaffes.Earlier this year, Biden regaled an audience with an anecdote about meeting former German chancellor Helmut Kohl in 2021 -- who at that point had been dead for four years.Days earlier he appeared to confuse long-dead French president Francois Mitterrand with current leader Emmanuel Macron.Critics -- including his Republican rival Donald Trump, himself 77 -- have questioned whether the 81-year-old is sharp enough to withstand another gruelling term in office.Biden has repeatedly asserted there are no problems with his memory or cognition.Historically, cannibalism has been documented among a small number of tribes in remote parts of Papua New Guinea.But the nation has for decades tried to shed outdated tropes that paint it as a wild nation full of savagery.""There are much, much... deeper values in our relationship than one statement, one word, one punchline,"" Marape said.He urged Biden and the White House to instead focus on clearing up the unexploded ordnance that still litters Papua New Guinea today.In a separate statement on Sunday evening, Marape said the people of Papua New Guinea ""live with the fear"" of being killed by bombs left over from the Second World War.""I urge President Biden to get the White House to look into cleaning up these remains of WWII so the truth about missing servicemen like Ambrose Finnegan can be put to rest.""In a single bomb disposal expedition on the island of Bougainville in 2014, troops from Australia and the United States destroyed 16 tonnes of wartime munitions.The US government's own travel advisory for Papua New Guinea cites unexploded ordnance as one of the main dangers in remote areas.","Papua New Guinea's leader dismisses Joe Biden's cannibalism quip as ""loose"" talk.

Authorities have deployed hundreds of additional police and paramilitary forces to ensure security during the visit.Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant violence in recent months, mostly blamed on Pakistani Taliban and insurgents targeting security forces in Pakistan and neighboring Iran.Sharif welcomed Raisi with a guard of honor ceremony in front of the premier's office, broadcast by the state-run Pakistan Television.According to a statement released by the premier's office, the two leaders discussed a range of issues to promote bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields and vowed to cooperate to fight terrorism.Raisi and Sharif are also expected to hold a joint news conference later Monday.Both are expected to sign several cooperation agreements, according to Sharif's office.

The warning came after Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (FSVPS) issued a notification regarding violations of international and Russian phytosanitary requirements over a shipment of rice imported from Pakistan.Dated April 2, the notification highlights the presence of a quarantine organism, ""Megaselia scalaris (Loew),"" in the rice consignment.Pakistan's trade representative at its embassy in Russia was asked to carry out an immediate investigation into the matter.The Russian authorities have written to the Pakistan embassy to prevent such violations and ensure all Pakistani rice exporters follow phytosanitary standards to ensure the safety of agricultural products traded between the two countries.The trade wing of the Pakistani embassy in Moscow, while forwarding the Russian authority's letter to the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) in the Ministry of Food Security and other relevant government offices, has warned of a possible ban on rice exports in future if more complaints were received from Russian authorities.Russia had previously imposed a ban on rice imports from Pakistan in 2019 because of health safety reasons.Similarly, in December 2006, Russia stopped the import of rice from Pakistan for not meeting food safety standards.Chairman of the Pakistan Rice Exporters Association, Chela Ram Kewlani, said that Pakistani rice exporters needed to be very careful in choosing and packaging all rice for export.He said that Pakistan had benefited from India banning exports of non-Basmati rice last year, given that India has a nearly 40 per cent share in the globally traded rice.Last year, India banned the export of white non-Basmati and parboiled rice.According to a leading Pakistani rice dealer, about 700,000 tonnes of rice were exported in December 2023 alone, the highest in a month for the fiscal year.He said Pakistan exported rice with an increase in higher production and demand and elevated global prices last year.The Rice Export Corporation is projecting a 60 per cent jump in exports of Basmati rice to over a million tonnes and a 36 per cent jump for non-Basmati rice to 4.25 million tonnes from Pakistan.It is eyeing exports of above five million metric tonnes of all rice in the fiscal year of 2023/2024, which would be much higher than last fiscal year's exports of 3.7 million tonnes.",Russia has warned Pakistan that it would ban rice imports again if Moscow's phytosanitary concerns are not addressed in future consignments.

Despite the conflict's international ramifications, it has not garnered widespread attention.In recent months, resistance fighters in Myanmar's remote areas have been consistently defeating the ruling military junta , surprising analysts and raising the possibility of the junta's collapse.The war has become a human rights disaster , with Myanmar's economy in shambles since the 2021 military coup, plunging millions into extreme poverty. The country's reputation as a center for drugs, online scams, and money laundering is growing, and its instability has created strategic challenges for China, India, the United States, and other nations.The civil war has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 3 million others. The country is riddled with land mines, and extreme inflation has contributed to a significant reduction in the middle class, according to the United Nations . The health sector is in crisis, with childhood vaccinations essentially halted and a substantial increase in malaria cases. Experts are concerned about the spread of HIV and tuberculosis.The conflict has regional and international implications. According to the United Nations, Russia and other countries have sold the Myanmar army at least $1 billion in weapons since the 2021 coup. China sees threats to its infrastructure projects across the country, while India, which has long feared chaos in its borderlands, is deporting Myanmar refugees.Thailand is similarly concerned about the estimated 40,000 or more refugees that the United Nations predicts will cross the border this year. Bangladesh sees obstacles to its efforts to repatriate the Rohingya , and the United States has begun providing nonlethal aid to armed resistance groups.","The civil war has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and displaced nearly 3 million others.

Police conducted raids in Central Sulawesi province between Tuesday and Thursday, said Agus Nugroho, the provincial police chief, adding that five suspects were arrested in the city of Palu , two in Sigi, and one in Poso which is a known extremist hotbed.Two laptops, several cellular phones and documents, including jihadist books were seized and suspects were being interrogated, Nugroho said.National Police spokesperson Trunoyudo Wisnu Andiko said the arrests were the result of information obtained from 59 suspected militants detained in October 2023.""(The eight) all actively participate in organisation activities, particularly in military-style training and collecting funds for alleged plans of terror acts,"" Andiko told reporters at the National Police headquarters in the capital, Jakarta. He added that convicted leaders of the group and veteran fighters in Afghanistan were recruiting and training new members.Jemaah Islamiyah is responsible for several attacks inside Indonesia, namely, the 2002 bombings on the resort island of Bali that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. A court banned the group in 2008 and constant counterterrorism crackdowns, supported by the United States and Australia, have weakened it further.Last year, police arrested a total of 142 suspected militants, including four women, and fatally shot two others on southern Sumatra island.Militant attacks on foreigners in Indonesia have been largely replaced in recent years by smaller, less deadly strikes targeting the government, mainly police and anti-terrorism forces, and people militants consider to be infidels, inspired by Islamic State group tactics abroad.","Police conducted raids in Central Sulawesi province between Tuesday and Thursday.

Her son Kim Aris said in Feb that she was still being held at the special compound in Naypyidaw. The compound had no air conditioning in searing heat and the concrete cells leaked during the monsoon, according to Australian economist Sean Turnell, a former advisor to Suu Kyi's govt who was also detained there.","Suu Kyi, 78, and Win Myint, 72, among the elderly and infirm prisoners moved to house arrest.
