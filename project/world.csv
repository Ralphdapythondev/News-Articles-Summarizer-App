In a dramatic scene that unfolded, Trump halted his speech to address the crowd after an attendee appeared to need immediate help.The event, which was Trump’s first outdoor rally since a shooting incident at his Pennsylvania campaign stop last month, took a tense turn when the former president noticed a commotion in the crowd.“What’s wrong?” Trump asked, his voice laced with concern, before amplifying his plea into the microphone: “A doctor, please!”As the sweltering heat bore down on the crowd—many of whom had waited for days to attend—Trump, visibly empathetic, turned his attention to the area where the attendee was being assisted. “It is very hot here,” he noted, acknowledging the challenging conditions. “Take your time, doctor, take your time, thank you!”In a show of solidarity, Trump joined the crowd in applause before stepping away from his bulletproof podium, flanked by Secret Service agents. He approached the area where the individual was receiving aid, offering a hug and words of reassurance before returning to the podium amid chants of “We love Trump.”Newsweek quoted the Secret Service saying that the incident was heat-related and that the individual received prompt care from EMTs.

He offered strong support for Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, painting Harris as a leader capable of addressing the nation’s challenges.“Kamala Harris will work to solve problems, seize opportunities, ease our fears, and make sure that every single American, however they vote, has a chance to chase their dreams,” Clinton said.He further praised Harris’s qualities, emphasising her vision, experience, and temperament.“Kamala Harris is the only candidate in this race with the vision, the experience, the temperament, the will, and yes — the sheer joy — to do that on good and bad days.

Gaza Conflict: Biden to Netanyahu over Gaza conflict: 'Urgency of bringing ceasefire and hostage release deal to closure',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-to-netanyahu-over-gaza-conflict-urgency-of-bringing-ceasefire-and-hostage-release-deal-to-closure/articleshow/112695469.cms,"Talks in Cairo to address obstacles

Challenge of Israeli troop presence

Netanyahu’s assurance to right-wing groups

President Joe Biden engaged in a discussion with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, emphasising the urgency of agreeing to a cease-fire in the Gaza conflict amid ongoing efforts by the United States to mediate a “bridging proposal” between Israel and Hamas . Vice-President Kamala Harris also participated in the call from Chicago.Biden “stressed the urgency of bringing the ceasefire and hostage release deal to closure,” according to a statement from the White House.The leaders aimed to use upcoming high-level talks in Cairo, involving mediators from the US, Israel, Egypt and Qatar to address the “remaining obstacles” to an agreement.Despite intensive diplomatic efforts, the hope for an immediate deal seems to be fading. Challenges persist particularly concerning Israeli troop presence in key Gaza corridors, which has cast doubts on a swift agreement.Last Friday, President Biden expressed optimism about a possible deal after consultations with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who hold crucial roles in dialogues with Hamas.However, by Tuesday, Biden’s tone was more reserved, noting that “Hamas was now backing off,"" though the US remains committed to pushing for a cease-fire.Biden made his call to Netanyahu from Santa Ynez, California, where he is vacationing at the estate of medical technology mogul Joe Kiani. They also addressed escalating tensions between Israel and Iran and Tehran-backed groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.This conversation occurred in the context of secretary of state Antony Blinken’s recent meetings with officials in Israel, Egypt and Qatar before a new round of talks in Cairo planned for later in the week.“This is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a cease-fire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,” Blinken stated after meeting with Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv on Monday.Egyptian officials revealed obstacles to the bridging proposal that prevent Hamas from agreeing to it, beyond concerns about whether the proposal would genuinely end Israeli military presence in Gaza.An Egyptian official privy to the negotiations, who requested anonymity, indicated that the proposal’s initial phase involves Hamas releasing vulnerable civilian hostages taken in their October 7 attack. Subsequent phases would be negotiated without guarantees from Israel or mediators.The official detailed that the proposal lacks clear commitments from Israel to withdraw its forces from the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors in Gaza. Although Israel has offered to downsize its forces in the Philadelphi corridor with ""promises"" to eventually withdraw, Hamas demands a complete withdrawal, including from the Philadelphi corridor—a narrow strip along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt.Earlier this week, Netanyahu met with right-wing groups representing families of fallen soldiers and hostages, who oppose a cease-fire. They reported Netanyahu’s assurance that Israel will not abandon its hold on the strategic corridors. Netanyahu's office has not commented on these claims.Blinken, after his visits to Egypt and Qatar, affirmed that the bridging proposal “is very clear on the schedule and the locations of withdrawals from Gaza,” though specific details remain undisclosed.","Biden made his call to Netanyahu from Santa Ynez, California, where he is vacationing at the estate of medical technology mogul Joe Kiani.

Trump’s response came during a campaign rally in Asheboro, North Carolina.During his keynote speech on the second night of the DNC, Barack Obama took aim at Trump’s fixation on crowd sizes, making a viral hand gesture that seemed to mock the Republican nominee.Michelle Obama also weighed in, turning one of Trump’s controversial campaign lines into a critique of “Black Jobs.”Trump expressed his frustration to the crowd: “Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night taking little shots? He was taking shots at your president and so was Michelle,” Trump said.""He was very nasty last night. I try and be nice to people, you know? But it's a little tough when they get personal…’, he further said. “They always say, ‘Sir, please stick to policy, don’t get personal,’ but they’re getting personal all night, these people.”Later in the rally, Trump polled the crowd on whether he should take a personal approach in his response. The crowd cheered loudly for the personal option. “Should I get personal, or should I not get personal?” Trump asked, with the former winning by cheer volume.“We’d rather keep it on policy, but sometimes it’s hard when you’re attacked from all ends,” Trump said. He’s repeatedly said he’s been asked by allies to tamp down the attacks, and instead focus on the economy, where polls show he’s more trusted than Harris.Trump's rebuttal followed Barack Obama’s and Michelle Obama’s DNC speeches, which marked a departure from their 2016 call for higher standards in political discourse. Their remarks animated the convention with a scathing critique of Trump.This latest exchange adds to the ongoing tension between Trump and the Obamas. Trump has previously promoted the birther conspiracy questioning Barack Obama's citizenship and has made disparaging remarks about Kamala Harris's background.Despite advice from allies to focus on policy rather than personal attacks , Trump challenged this guidance. “Do I still have to stick to policy?” he questioned, as his supporters cheered his defiant stance.In his DNC address, Barack Obama had labeled Trump a ""78-year-old rich guy"" and criticized him for a “constant stream of gripes and grievances.” Obama highlighted Trump’s “childish nicknames, crazy conspiracy theories, and bizarre fixation on crowd sizes” as part of a broader pattern of behavior.Michelle Obama also took aim at Trump’s approach: “Going small is petty, it’s unhealthy, and, quite frankly, it’s unpresidential,” she said. “It’s his same old con: doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better.”","Donald Trump responded to Barack and Michelle Obama's criticisms of him during the Democratic National Convention.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's main opposition party BNP on Tuesday urged India to extradite deposed PM Sheikh Hasina to face trial in murder and other cases registered against her since she took flight on August 5 in the face of a student-led uprising. ""It is our call to you that you should hand her over to government of Bangladesh in a legal way.The people of this country have given the decision for her trial.Let her face that trial,"" BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said in Dhaka after paying tribute to the party's founder president Ziaur Rahman.Alamgir said Hasina being allowed to take refuge in India isn't aligned with the country's commitment to upholding democratic principles. ""Staying there, she has started various plots to thwart the revolution that happened in Bangladesh.""Bangladesh and India have extradition treaty based on which they are required to hand over people against whom proceedings have been initiated in courts for any ""extraditable crime"", including financial offences liable to invite a minimum punishment of a year in jail.BNP, whose ailing chairperson and ex-PM Khaleda Zia was freed from house arrest after Hasina fled, said the murder and extortion cases filed against the latter were in the ""extraditable"" category.The bilateral treaty isn't applicable to cases that are ""political in nature"", although this exemption is not available to those charged with serious crimes like murder, sources said.India can turn down any request for Hasina's extradition by citing Article 8 of the treaty, which allows the signatories to refuse requests that have ""not been made in good faith and in the interests of justice"". The BNP secretary general alleged that Hasina's Awami League was ""still conspiring in New Delhi to falsify the victory"" of students and other citizens of Bangladesh. ""I am saying this strongly, and we want to make it clear that I do not think that India can get much love from the people by sheltering the enemy of the people of Bangladesh, who had to flee from the country,"" Alamgir said.Awami League has criticised Bangladesh's interim government for cases registered against Hasina, terming them ""false and politically motivated"".","Bangladesh and India have extradition treaty based on which they are required to hand over people against whom proceedings have been initiated.

Obama’s call for a new chapter

A swipe at Trump’s ‘Stale act’

Praise for

Joe Biden

and Tim Walz

A convention highlight

Barack Obama energized the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday with a powerful endorsement of Kamala Harris and a sharp critique of former President Donald Trump . Addressing a cheering crowd, Obama asserted that America is ready for a new chapter under President Harris, dismissing Trump's approach as stale and ineffective.Barack Obama, America’s first Black president, urged delegates to back Harris as she seeks to make history on November 5 as the first woman and the first Black and South Asian US president.“I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling fired up!” Obama said, rallying the crowd with his characteristic enthusiasm.He praised Kamala Harris, declaring, “America is ready for a new chapter. America’s ready for a better story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.” Obama highlighted Harris’s dedication and hard-fought journey to success, contrasting her with Trump’s divisive rhetoric.Obama took a moment to reflect on the international stakes of the election. “By the way, that doesn’t just matter to people in this country. The rest of the world is watching to see if we can actually pull it off,” he said. “We shouldn’t be the world’s policeman, and we can’t eradicate every cruelty and injustice in the world. But America can be, must be, a force for good – discouraging conflict, fighting disease, promoting human rights, protecting the planet from climate change, defending freedom. That’s what Kamala Harris believes – and so do most Americans.”As the crowd erupted into chants of “Yes, she can!” Obama championed Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, as leaders dedicated to the working class. “In this new economy, we need a president who actually cares about the millions of people all across this country who wake up every day to do the essential, often thankless work to care for our sick and clean our streets and deliver our packages,” he said. “Kamala will be that president.”Obama did not hold back in his critique of Trump. “It’s one of the oldest tricks in politics – from a guy whose act has gotten pretty stale. We don’t need four more years of bluster and chaos. We’ve seen that movie – and we all know that the sequel’s usually worse,” Obama said.He dismissed Trump’s tenure as a series of grievances and conspiracies, referencing Trump’s fixation on crowd sizes and nicknames. “Here’s a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator,” Obama quipped.Turning to Joe Biden, Obama expressed pride in his former vice president’s tenure and character. “This country will remember him as an outstanding president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger,” Obama said, adding that he was “even prouder to call him my friend.”Obama also extolled Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Biden’s running mate, for his genuine character and commitment to service. “Tim’s the kind of person who should be in politics – somebody who was born in a small town, served his country, taught kids, coached football, and took care of his neighbors,” Obama said, noting Walz’s authentic style.At 63, Barack Obama played a significant role in persuading Biden to step aside and endorse Harris. Harris, 59, has gained momentum with record-breaking fundraising and enthusiastic support.Speaking virtually from a rally in Milwaukee, Harris criticized Trump for his lack of remorse over the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. ""I do believe, you know, bad behavior should result in a consequence. Well, we will make sure he does face a consequence and that will be at the ballot box in November,"" Harris asserted.The former president’s speech, following Michelle Obama’s heartfelt introduction, was a highlight of the convention. As the jumbotron displayed images of Tim Walz and his supportive wife Gwen, the crowd responded with enthusiasm.Michelle Obama, introduced by her husband, echoed the call for change. ""America, hope is making a comeback,"" she said, referencing her husband’s first campaign in 2008. She warned that Trump would attempt to distort Harris' truth, likening his attempts to previous efforts to discredit the Obamas. ""His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,"" Michelle Obama said, prompting a strong response from the crowd.The convention also saw Republicans who have distanced themselves from Trump address the delegates. Former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and former Trump supporter Kyle Sweetser shared their experiences, with Grisham recounting her resignation after the January 6 Capitol attack. Republican Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona, called for a return to the principles of the late Senator John McCain, emphasizing the need to move beyond Trump’s influence.Outside the convention, a protest near Chicago's Israeli consulate turned briefly violent, with a smaller group clashing with police. Most convention speakers avoided the topic of US support for Israel in the Gaza conflict, although Senator Bernie Sanders called for an end to the war and an immediate ceasefire.",Barack Obama urged delegates to back Kamala Harris as she seeks to make history on November 5 as the first woman and the first Black and South Asian US president.

Michelle Obama delivered a powerful and confrontational speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Tuesday, sharply criticizing former US President Donald Trump and reinforcing her support for Kamala Harris .In a direct attack on Trump, Michelle invoked his previous controversial comments about undocumented migrants taking ""Black jobs."" “Who’s going to tell him that the job he is currently seeking might be one of those Black jobs?” Michelle said, referencing Trump's remarks.This comment highlighted the former president’s history of racially charged rhetoric and his claims questioning President Barack Obama’s eligibility for office.“For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us,” Michelle continued. “His limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking and highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black.”Obama's criticism didn’t stop there. She also addressed Trump’s insinuations about Kamala Harris and other Democrats not being “real Americans,” asserting, “No one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American, no one.”The former First Lady’s speech was not solely focused on attacking Trump; she also issued a call to action for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation. “Look, I don’t care how you identify politically, whether you’re Democrat, Republican, independent, or none of the above, this is our time to stand up for what we know in our hearts is right,” Michelle said. “To stand up, not just for our basic freedoms, but for decency and humanity, for basic respect, dignity, and empathy for the values at the very foundation of this democracy.”Turning her attention to Kamala Harris, Michelle praised the vice president as one of the most qualified candidates ever to seek the presidency. “Kamala Harris is more than ready for this moment. She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency,” Michelle said, highlighting Harris’s accomplishments and her dignified representation, which she attributed to a legacy of strong women.Michelle opened her speech with a message of hope, reflecting on a nation fraught with uncertainty and subtly critiquing Trump’s tenure. “America, hope is making a comeback,” she declared, sparking a standing ovation from the crowd.","Michelle Obama delivered a powerful and confrontational speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Tuesday.

Storage containers were placed around the perimeter to create additional walls and obstruct sight lines, while snipers were positioned on the venue's roofs.The 78-year-old Republican candidate, speaking in front of vintage warplanes at an aviation museum, attacked his Democratic rival Kamala Harris calling her the ""most radical left person"" to ever run for president and warned that her victory in November would result in millions of jobs disappearing overnight.""Your life savings will be totally wiped out,"" said Trump. He also claimed that if ""comrade Kamala wins this November, World War III is virtually guaranteed to happen.""Trump also criticised his predecessor Barack Obama for making ""nasty"" comments about him during the Democratic National Convention. The former president asked the audience if they had watched the speeches given by the Obamas the previous night. ""He was taking shots at your president. And so was Michelle. You know, they always say, 'Sir, please stick to policy. Don't get personal.' And yet they're getting personal all night long, these people,"" said Trump remarked.Additionally, Trump accused President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of being responsible for the deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan and for conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.This was Trump's first major outdoor event since being slightly injured in an assassination attempt at a similar open venue in Pennsylvania's Butler, which left one rally attendee dead before the 20-year-old assailant was neutralized by a Secret Service sniper.Following the incident, the Secret Service advised Trump to adhere to more easily securable indoor locations such as sports arenas, leading to about a dozen indoor events since then.","Former President Donald Trump held his first outdoor campaign rally in North Carolina behind bulletproof glass.

Elon Musk's Neuralink says implant working effectively in 2nd trial patient: What it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-neuralink-says-implant-working-effectively-in-2nd-trial-patient-what-it-means/articleshow/112695718.cms,"Neuralink , a brain technology startup of Elon Musk , announced that its implant is functioning effectively in a second trial patient. The implant is designed to enable paralysed individuals to operate digital devices solely through thought .The company said that the second patient named Alex did not experience ""thread retraction"" issues, which contrasted with the experience of Noland Arbaugh, Neuralink's first patient who received the implant in January.Arbaugh encountered a significant decrease in the number of electrodes capable of measuring brain signals due to the retraction of the implant's tiny wires post-surgery.However, Neuralink stated that the threads have now stabilised for Arbaugh.To prevent similar complications in their second patient, Neuralink implemented several measures, including minimising brain motion during the surgical procedure and reducing the space between the implant and the brain's surface.Currently, Neuralink is in the testing phase of its device, which aims to assist individuals with spinal cord injuries . The first patient has demonstrated the ability to engage in various activities using the device, such as playing video games, navigating the internet, posting on social media, and controlling a laptop cursor.Neuralink had successfully implanted the device in the second patient last month. Since then, the patient has been utilising the device to play video games and acquire skills in designing 3D objects.The Nueralink implant device is nearly the size of a coin and is implanted beneath the skull.According to Neuralink, the device uses 64 tiny wires (or threads) and is equipped with over 1,000 electrodes that help it to read neuron activity in the brain and connect with a computer or smartphone.In 2016, Elon Musk along with a team of scientists and engineers founded Neuralink. The company claims that its mission is to ""create a generalised brain interface to restore autonomy to those with unmet medical needs"".","Neuralink announced that its implant is functioning effectively in a second trial patient.

However, the American Airlines staff were unfazed.“McCoy was polite, but he dropped his name several times,” the source was quoted as saying by the Times Union. Despite his efforts, “the American Airlines person didn’t care or know who he was.”The airline agent reportedly told McCoy, “You shouldn’t have gone and gotten food; you would have made your flight.”Unable to board, McCoy and his staffer were forced to book a different flight to Chicago on another airline later that day.When contacted, McCoy’s spokesperson, Mary Rozak, declined to comment on the specifics of the airport incident, saying, “I can’t speak to what happened or didn’t happen at the airport.” She did clarify that no public funds were used for the trip to the DNC.This incident comes amid speculation that McCoy might be positioning himself for a future role at the airport. The Albany County Airport Authority, where McCoy appoints three of the seven board members, recently chose not to renew the contract of the current long-serving airport director, fueling rumors about McCoy’s potential interest in the job.While many politicians faced delays en route to the convention due to a storm system in the region, McCoy’s delay was uniquely caused by his detour for a chicken sandwich .","Albany County Executive Dan McCoy reportedly tried to use his political influence to board an American Airlines flight to the Democratic National Convention.

At least 55 arrested after clashes with police outside Israeli Consulate in Chicago during DNC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-least-55-arrested-after-clashes-with-police-outside-israeli-consulate-in-chicago-during-dnc/articleshow/112691469.cms,"CHICAGO: At least 55 protesters were arrested following violent clashes with police in Chicago on the second night of the Democratic National Convention , a situation the police chief called “a danger to our city.”Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said Wednesday that those arrested outside the Israeli Consulate, about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from the United Center where Democrats were meeting, “showed up with the intention of committing acts of violence, vandalism.”“As the Chicago Police Department, we did everything that we could to de-escalate that situation,"" Snelling said during a news conference.""But there’s only so much de-escalation that you can attempt before it becomes excessive repetition.”The intense confrontations between pro-Palestinian protesters and officers began minutes into the demonstration, after some protesters — many dressed in black, their faces covered — charged at a line of police who had blocked their march. They eventually moved past the officers but were penned in several times throughout the night by police in riot gear who did not allow protesters to disperse.Snelling said protesters showed up to ""fight with the police"".""“We were not the initiators of violence, but we responded to it,"" Snelling said.Snelling said that between 55 and 60 people were arrested. Two people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, one for knee pain and one with a finger injury, Snelling said. Two officers were injured but they refused medical attention because they did not want to leave fellow officers, Snelling said. He said three journalists were among those arrested, but he did not have details on charges.“Last night was a danger to our city and a danger to our citizens in this city, our residents’ property. And CPD has to protect that,” Snelling said.The Israeli Consulate has been the site of numerous demonstrations since the war in Gaza began in October, and protests during the DNC have largely focused on opposing the Israel-Hamas war..The group behind the protest Tuesday night is not affiliated with a coalition of more than 200 groups that has organized permitted rallies and marches — one that took place Monday and two more expected Wednesday and Thursday. Another rally, organized by the U.S. Palestinian Community Network, a Palestinian and Arab community-based organization, is planned for Wednesday afternoon near the United Center.On Tuesday night, organizers rallied demonstrators under the slogan “Make it great like ’68,” invoking the anti-Vietnam War protests that seized the city during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.“That was what they brought here to Chicago,” Snelling said. “It’s 2024. And the Chicago Police Department proved that. So let’s get off of 1968. Let’s stop talking about 1968. This is 2024.""A large portion of the arrests happened at the end of the night, as police pinned demonstrators in a plaza and blocked them from leaving. Snelling denied that police had “kettled” protesters, a tactic that involves corralling people in a confined area, which is banned under a federal consent decree.Snelling, who has been present at all major demonstrations so far during the convention, praised his officers. He said some female police officers were subjected to “vicious, nasty, sexually explicit” comments but that they ""stood their ground and they did what they had to do.”""I could not be more proud of the work that the men and women of this department are doing right now to keep this city safe,” he said.Snelling rejected criticism that the police response was overwhelming.“We wanted to overwhelm them,” Snelling said. “We wanted to overwhelm those people who decided to come to our city and destroy it. Now, overwhelming doesn’t mean that we were excessive. The response was proportionate.”The largest protest so far, which attracted about 3,500 people on Monday, was largely peaceful and resulted in 13 arrests, most related to a breach of security fencing. Two were arrested Sunday night during another mostly peaceful march.Also on Wednesday, a man who escaped from a Mississippi courthouse and is wanted on murder and armed robbery charges was taken into custody following a standoff with police at a restaurant about half a mile from the United Center. There was no indication that he had any connection to the convention.","At least 55 protesters were arrested following violent clashes with police in Chicago on the second night of the Democratic National Convention.

'I want to study'

DADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan , 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.""I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,"" Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.""But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.""Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity .The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.""This has led to a new trend of ' monsoon brides ',"" said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.""Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.""Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.""Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,"" said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.""They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done"".Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.""My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,"" she said.""I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,"" she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.""Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.""Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.""We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,"" said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.""They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,"" she added.""The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.""Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.Unicef has reported ""significant strides"" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.""We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,"" it said in a report after the 2022 floods.Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.""When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities',"" the daily wage labourer told AFP.Mehtab was just 10 years old.""The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep,"" said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.""I have told my father I want to study,"" she said. ""I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself.""","Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years. But after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise. The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112579857,imgsize-1225816,width-400,resizemode-4/112579857.jpg"
"Amid outrage over internet slowdown, Pakistan government admits installing cybersecurity firewall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/amid-outrage-over-internet-slowdown-pakistan-government-admits-installing-cybersecurity-firewall/articleshow/112574986.cms,"ISLAMABAD: After weeks of hue and cry from internet users and digital rights activists over the disruption of digital platforms and slow internet speed, Pakistan government on Thursday confirmed that it was upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.Over the past few weeks, internet speed had dropped by 30-40 per cent, as Pakistan moved to implement its much-debated nationwide firewall to block malicious content, protect government networks from attacks, and allow government to identify IP addresses associated with what it terms “anti-state propaganda”.government sources said telecom authorities had completed a second trial run of the newly installed firewall. The first trial was carried out in July, which resulted in the slowing down of social media platforms.PM Shehbaz Sharif’s government had allocated more than 30 billion Pakistani rupees in the development budget for the acquisition and installation of this filtering system.However, the adverse impacts after installing the firewall drew criticism from netizens and digital rights groups, who expressed fear about the future of internet-based businesses in Pakistan.government authorities had so far feigned ignorance over the internet disruptions being linked to firewall installation, and had blamed telecom and internet service providers for connectivity issues.On Thursday, however, IT minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said her ministry was addressing complaints of slow internet speed, even though she did not link the problem with thecybersecurity firewall .“There have been complaints of slow internet and I have asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to provide data of the last two weeks to look at the data traffic to know the speed issue,” she told reporters.Asked about the installation of a firewall, the minister said it was a cybersecurity matter and that countries around the world used the technology. “Previously, government was managing the web system, but with increasing international cybersecurity attacks on the country, there is a growing need for the state to strengthen its ability to prevent these attacks,” Khawaja said.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.The association of internet service providers have blamed the slow internet speed and outages on increased security and surveillance. “It’s a very discouraging situation for our customers. Many are leaving the smaller ISPs because they cannot sustain the poor service quality any more. If this continues, we will see a mass exodus of businesses from Pakistan,” read a statement issued by service providers.","Pakistan government confirms that it is upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.

Pakistan govt admits tinkering with internet: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-admits-tinkering-with-internet-report/articleshow/112565175.cms,"ISLAMABAD: For the first time, the Pakistan government has confirmed that it was upgrading its "" web management system "" to cope with cyber security threats amid speculation about the installation of a so-called 'firewall' that could be leading to internet disruptions in the country, according to a media report on Friday. Millions of people across Pakistan have been facing trouble accessing internet services for some time now due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions.So far, official stakeholders in Pakistan have either been feigning ignorance in response to public outcry and media queries, or claiming that the problems were because of telecom and internet service providers, or even Meta.While talking to reporters after the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Tele­communi­cation meeting on Thursday, Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said the government had sought a report from Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and other institutions over the internet disruption.""The internet should never be slow. We have even been talking about bringing 5G technology to Pakistan. There is no doubt about that, and conversations about higher internet speed are underway,"" the Dawn newspaper quoted Khawaja as saying.When the minister was asked about the 'firewall' - a blanket term used by the public to describe the causes of internet disruption in the absence of any official explanation - she said the issue had been ""blown out of proportion"".""The government has been operating a web-management system. The system is now being upgraded.""She also called the process ""a routine exercise"" across the globe to enhance internet security, without giving any detail to substantiate her claims about which other countries have deployed this system.""It is the right of the government to take measures to protect its interests given the cyber security attacks that Pakistan is facing.""This was the first time an acknowledged the government's actions, which have been blamed for everything from slow browsing speeds, the arbitrary blocking of social media platforms and WhatsApp connectivity issues on mobile data, the paper said.Meanwhile, on Thursday, users continued experiencing pro­blems in accessing social media platforms, including WhatsApp.Downdetector, a website that provides real-time information about internet outages, received an unusually high number of complaints about disruptions in WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram between 12 noon and 1 pm.Meanwhile, a petition was filed in the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday against a ""nationwide internet shutdown"", seeking immediate restoration of internet access.",Pakistan government confirms it is upgrading its web management system to cope with cyber security threats.

Pakistani minister says more arrests expected in retired ISI chief's court-martial case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-minister-says-more-arrests-expected-in-retired-isi-chiefs-court-martial-case/articleshow/112564172.cms,"LAHORE: More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed in a housing scam, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday, a day after three more retired military officers were arrested in the case. Hameed, who served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, was arrested following action in the complaint of a private property developer over alleged misuse of official authority.""Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has wielded considerable power in security and foreign policy matters.","More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed.

The BNP has on several occasions demanded that they be unfrozen.Later, she was allowed to withdraw a certain amount of money every month from Rupali Bank's Shaheed Moinul Road branch of Dhaka Cantonment for running regular expenses.The then caretaker government also blocked Sheikh Hasina's bank accounts but they were unfreezed after she became prime minister.The latest move comes after a mass uprising toppled Hasina, a long-time rival of Khaleda, on August 5, ending the Bangladesh Awami League's 15-year rule.
