France: Will quell New Caledonia riots 'whatever the cost',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/france-will-quell-new-caledonia-riots-whatever-the-cost/articleshow/110259781.cms,"What triggers the current unrest

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: French security forces are intensifying efforts to regain control over New Caledonia, a French Pacific archipelago, amid ongoing and deadly unrest . Using armored vehicles and construction equipment , they have cleared nearly 60 barricades on the crucial RT1 highway connecting the capital, Nouméa, to the international airport, La Tontouta. Over 600 gendarmes have been deployed in this major operation, aimed at reopening the airport to commercial flights and restoring supply chains disrupted by the violence.The French High Commission in New Caledonia reported a relatively calmer night from Saturday to Sunday but still noted incidents of arson and looting.Authorities have imposed a state of emergency, a nightly curfew from 6 pm to 6 am, and granted security forces emergency powers, including house detention for those deemed threats and expanded search and seizure capabilities.After six nights of violence that have left six dead and hundreds injured, French government high commissioner Louis Le Franc warned in a televised address that new raids on independence strongholds would be staged.""Republican order will be re-established whatever the cost,"" Le Franc said, adding that if separatists ""want to use their arms, they will be risking the worst"".French interior minister Gérald Darmanin, in a statement on social media platform X, affirmed the government's commitment to fully regaining control of the highway and stabilizing the region. The airport's closure since Tuesday has left thousands of tourists stranded, and the French government is coordinating with Australian and New Zealand authorities to facilitate the evacuation of their nationals once the situation allows.French President Emmanuel Macron has convened a series of emergency defense and security council meetings to address the crisis. The French government high commissioner Louis Le Franc has stated that ""Republican order will be re-established whatever the cost,"" indicating a firm stance against the pro-independence militants responsible for the violence.The immediate trigger for the current wave of unrest in New Caledonia was the debate and subsequent approval of voting reforms by the French legislature in Paris. The National Assembly passed a bill that allows residents who have lived in New Caledonia for ten years to vote in provincial elections. This legislative change has been fiercely opposed by pro-independence supporters, particularly the indigenous Kanak population, who fear that the new rules will dilute their political influence in favor of pro-France politicians.Protests against these reforms began peacefully but quickly escalated into widespread violence. Demonstrators erected barricades, set fires, and engaged in armed clashes with security forces. The situation deteriorated further, leading to the closure of La Tontouta International Airport and significant disruptions to daily life and essential services across the archipelago.New Caledonia has a long history of tension between its indigenous Kanak population and descendants of European settlers. The archipelago has been a French territory since the mid-1800s, and its political landscape has been shaped by the ongoing debate over its status. While some factions seek full independence from France, others prefer to maintain ties with Paris.Indigenous Kanaks, who make up about 39% of the population, generally support independence, citing historical grievances, socio-economic disparities, and a legacy of segregation and discrimination. In contrast, the European-descended population and other non-indigenous residents tend to favor remaining part of France, benefiting from the economic stability and infrastructure support provided by the French government.The current unrest is the most severe in decades, reflecting deep-rooted divisions and the complexities of New Caledonia's political identity. The recent voting reforms have intensified these divisions, highlighting the challenges of balancing democratic representation with the protection of indigenous rights. As French authorities work to restore order, the long-term resolution of New Caledonia's political status remains uncertain, with significant implications for its future governance and social cohesion.","French security forces are intensifying efforts to regain control over New Caledonia.

She also kickstarted a military modernization drive, including a program for building indigenous submarines at more than USD 16 billion each.Tsai's leadership during the pandemic split public opinion, with most admiring Taiwan's initial ability to keep the virus largely outside its borders but criticizing the lack of investment in rapid testing as the pandemic progressed.","Lai entered politics as mayor of the southern city of Tainan and then rose to vice president.

'A wake-up call to West': Europe on edge after assassination attempt on Slovakian PM Robert Fico,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/a-wake-up-call-to-west-europe-on-edge-after-assassination-attempt-on-slovakian-pm-robert-fico/articleshow/110164222.cms,"Who is Robert Fico?

Europe on edge

In a disturbing incident that has sent shockwaves across Europe, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was targeted in an assassination attempt that left him seriously injured. The event unfolded on a seemingly ordinary day in Handlova, Slovakia, when Fico was approached by a gunman as he was engaging with supporters. The assailant fired five times at close range, critically wounding the prime minister.The PM's bodyguards swiftly intervened, tackling the gunman and whisking Fico away in a government vehicle.He was subsequently airlifted to a hospital for emergency medical treatment.""I was very shocked ... fortunately as far as I know the operation went well - and I guess in the end he will survive ... he's not in a life-threatening situation at this moment,"" Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Minister Tomas Taraba told the BBC's Newshour.The attacker, identified as 71-year-old Slovak poet Juraj Cintula, was arrested at the scene. The motivations behind the attack appear to be politically charged, reflecting deep divisions within Slovakia and broader regional tensions. Cintula reportedly made a ""confession"" in custody, blaming Fico's media policies for his drastic actions.A seasoned figure in Slovakian politics, Fico was born in 1964 and began his political career as a member of the Communist Party before Slovakia became its independent nation. With a law degree and vast experience in legal and governmental roles, Fico has been a dominant force in Slovak politics.Fico's political journey is marked by significant milestones, including his first election to Slovakia's parliament in 1992 and his subsequent rise to become the chairman of the Smer (Direction) party in 1999. His tenure is characterized by a left-populist ideology, though comparisons have been drawn with right-wing leaders like Viktor Orbán of Hungary.After a hiatus, Fico reclaimed the prime ministerial position last year, marking his third term and establishing him as the longest-serving head of government in Slovakia's history. His recent electoral victory was fueled by a platform that controversially aligned more closely with pro-Russian stances and criticized US and Nato policies, especially regarding the situation in Ukraine.This assassination attempt occurs against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tension. Fico, known for his pro-Putin stance, has been a controversial figure in European politics, especially regarding his opposition to supporting Ukraine against Russian aggressions.Starting his fourth term as prime minister, Fico administration stopped arms shipments to Ukraine, and critics are concerned that he might steer Slovakia — a Nato member with a population of 5.4 million — away from its pro-Western trajectory towards a path similar to that of Hungary under populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.Russian President Vladimir Putin , who has shown support for Fico in the past, condemned the attack. Describing the shooting as a ""monstrous"" crime, Putin said in a telegram sent to Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova: ""I know Robert Fico as a courageous and strong-minded man. I very much hope that these qualities will help him to survive this difficult situation.""The implications of this attack are far-reaching, raising concerns about the stability of not only Slovakia but the entire European region. Fico’s policies and his alignment with Russia have been divisive, and this incident may further inflame political tensions.World leaders, including US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , have condemned the attack. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized that such acts of violence undermine democracy and have no place in society.Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of UK's 1st Royal Tank Regiment, expressed his concerns to Daily Mail, saying, ""There are high stakes in Europe and the threat of a wider war only benefits Putin.""He further warned, ""This is yet another wake-up call to the West. If we ignore this latest threat to Western security the chances of getting drawn into a wider war in Europe are manifestly greater.""(With inputs from agencies)","Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was targeted in an assassination attempt that left him seriously injured.

Xi Jinping is now Vladimir Putin's 'big brother': How Russia-China ties changed over the years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/xi-jinping-is-now-putins-big-brother-how-russia-china-ties-changed-over-the-years/articleshow/110162516.cms,"Driving the news

This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and the second in just over six months to China.

However, this is Putin's 19th visit to China since he became the Russian president.

In February 2022, China and Russia announced a ""no limits"" partnership during Putin's visit to Beijing, occurring just days before he deployed tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, sparking the most severe land conflict in Europe since World War Two.

Putin's decision to choose China for his first overseas visit after being inaugurated for a new six-year term, extending his leadership until at least 2030, underscores the significance he places on his bond with Xi and his global strategic priorities.

In a discussion with China's Xinhua news agency, Putin commended Chinese President Xi Jinping for fostering a ""strategic partnership"" between Russia and China, which he described as rooted in national interests and profound mutual trust.

Zoom in

This visit is not just a routine diplomatic engagement but a strategic display of defiance against Western pressures.

The frequency and depth of military collaborations, such as joint naval drills near strategic global areas, signal a growing military camaraderie.

However, these maneuvers signal more about the depth of their partnership than actual operational military alliances. The joint naval patrols near American waters and the inclusion of Russia in Chinese-led military drills are significant developments that the West views with increasing concern.

Moreover, the economic interdependence, highlighted by China’s role as a critical supplier to Russia’s defense sector, showcases the depth of their bilateral ties, which are becoming increasingly consequential in the global arena.

Why it matters

The strengthening bond between China and Russia is pivotal as both nations seek to assert their power on the global stage against a backdrop of American dominance.

This alliance is particularly critical for Russia as it continues to face extensive economic sanctions from the West.

China’s support not only bolsters Russia’s economy but also enhances its military capabilities through joint exercises and technology transfers.

As per a report in the Economist, the flow of Chinese technology and other valuable goods to Russian weapons manufacturers has become a significant concern for the United States. According to US secretary of state Antony Blinken China was the ""top supplier"" of various items considered be ""dual use,"" including machine tools, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose, a vital component in artillery shells. These items have both civilian and military applications.

""Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support,"" Blinken said. In a later conversation with Borge Brende, the president of the World Economic Forum, Blinken said that over the past year, Chinese technology had been facilitating Russia's production of weapons and ammunition, such as missiles and tanks, at an unprecedented rate in its modern history, surpassing even the levels seen during the Cold War era, the Economist report added.

What they are saying

""It was the unprecedentedly high level of the strategic partnership between our countries that determined my choice of China as the first state that I would visit after officially taking office as president of the Russian Federation,"" Putin said.

""We will try to establish closer cooperation in the field of industry and high technology, space and peaceful nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy sources and other innovative sectors,"" Putin said.

""This is Putin's first trip after his inauguration, and it is therefore intended to show that Sino-Russian relations are moving up another level,"" independent Russian political analyst Konstantin Kalachev told AFP.

""The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it,"" Xi told Putin.

""China is willing to ... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world,"" said Xi.

""The United States still thinks in terms of the Cold War and is guided by the logic of bloc confrontation, putting the security of 'narrow groups' above regional security and stability, which creates a security threat for all countries in the region,"" the joint statement said. ""The US must abandon this behaviour.""

The 'big brother' role reversal

The relationship between Russia and China has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, with Moscow becoming increasingly dependent on Beijing as it faces Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

Once a partnership of equals, the Russia-China dynamic has become increasingly asymmetrical, with China holding the upper hand. While China accounts for around 33% of Russia's overall trade, Russia makes up only 4% of China's trade, according to data provider CEIC Data.

China has emerged as a critical source of essential goods for Russia, supplying everything from electronics to washing machines to tractors.

However, Russia's arms exports to China have fallen precipitously in recent years, while China has become a significant provider of optics, microelectronics, drone engines, and other materials that enable Russia's weapons production. The energy trade between the two countries has also shifted in China's favor.

""It's a strategic partnership where both sides need each other but it's increasingly asymmetrical in China's favor,"" Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, told the Wall Street Journal. ""China is not only the more powerful partner, but also the one that has many more options than Russia and the war has exacerbated that.""

Russia, with its oil and gas now shunned in Europe, has had to sell at significant discounts to China.

China’s upper hand is evident in negotiations over new projects like the Power-of-Siberia 2 gas pipeline, where Beijing's reluctance to finalize terms highlights its leverage over Moscow.

Putin, who is sometimes known for his haughty displays of making other leaders wait during their visits to the Kremlin, has adopted a noticeably deferential tone towards Xi Jinping, a LA Times report said.

No wonder, an Economist report described the visit as ""Vladimir Putin will meet his big brother in Beijing.""

What next

China, once the junior partner of Moscow in the global Communist hierarchy, has emerged as by far the most powerful of Russia's friends in the world.

Consequently, in the evolving personal relationship between the two ""presidents for life"", Xi has emerged as the ""big brother"" to Putin.

At the same time, the strengthening ties between China and Russia represent a significant shift in global alliances and power structures. The implications of their collaboration will undoubtedly extend far beyond their own borders, challenging the current international order and testing the diplomatic resilience of the Western powers.

Sheer madness. To close the border and leave them there, that is madness. The migrant has to be received,"" the pope said.""Thereafter you see how you are going to deal with him. Maybe you have to send him back, I don't know, but each case ought to be considered humanely,"" Francis said.Record numbers of migrants have been seeking to enter the United States, largely from Central America and Venezuela, as they flee poverty, violence and disasters aggravated by climate change.The matter has emerged as a top political issue in the November US election, with President Joe Biden 's Republican challenger, former president Donald Trump , pushing the topic front and center.""The globalization of indifference"" on migrants, Francis said, ""is a very ugly disease.""- 'A human fact' -Francis, 87, also addressed criticisms by conservative US bishops who oppose his efforts to revisit certain teachings and traditions.A ""conservative is one who clings to something and does not want to see beyond that,"" he said when asked about the bishops, adding ""it is a suicidal attitude.""Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has insisted on the importance of a church open to all, including member of the LGBTQ+ community, but he has faced strong resistance from conservative Catholics.There was a particularly strong reaction when Francis opened the door to the blessing of gay couples last year, especially in African countries.Calling gay people ""a human fact,"" Francis said in the interview: ""To bless each person, why not? The blessing is for all.""The pontiff also touched on the controversial topic of sex abuse within the Catholic Church.He has made combatting sexual assault in the Church one of the main missions of his papacy, and insisted on a ""zero tolerance"" policy following multiple wide-reaching scandals.""Unfortunately, the tragedy of the abuses is enormous,"" he told CBS, adding that abuse ""cannot be tolerated.""""When there is a case of a religious man or woman who abuses, the full force of the law falls upon them,"" Francis said.But, he added, ""there has been a great deal of progress.""","Pope Francis speaks in his native Spanish for the first time since his election in 2013.

"Andhra-born Gopi Thotakura makes history, becomes first Indian to go to space as tourist",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/andhra-born-gopi-thotakura-makes-history-becomes-first-indian-to-go-to-space-as-tourist/articleshow/110255096.cms,"India-born Gopi Thotakura made history on Sunday evening as he became the first Indian citizen to venture into space as a tourist. He was part of the elite crew for Blue Origin ’s New Shepard-25 (NS-25) mission, which took off from the company’s West Texas launch site in the US around 8:05 pm (IST), an hour late from its scheduled launch time of 9:35 am (local US time).Born in Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh), Gopi, an entrepreneur and a pilot, journeyed to the edge of space beyond the Earth’s atmosphere along with five others — Ed Dwight, Mason Angel, Sylvain Chiron, Kenneth L Hess and Carol Schaller. Ed Dwight (90) is now the oldest man on Earth to go to space.Gopi has retained his Indian passport despite working in the US. Although he became the first Indian citizen to go to space as a tourist, he is officially the second astronaut from the country after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma, who flew as a professional cosmonaut to space on board Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984, as part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme. Astronauts Kalpana Chawla, Sunita Williams, Raja Chari, and Sirisha Bandla were all US citizens of Indian origin who also went to space as professional astronauts. TOI had earlier reported on Gopi’s probable entry to the elite astronaut club.Following takeoff, the NS-25 vehicle reached beyond the boundary of space smoothly. The rocket and capsule then returned to Earth, with the rocket landing upright a few minutes after takeoff. The capsule successfully touched down, using two of its three parachutes, roughly 15 minutes after takeoff. It was Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin’s first crew launch in nearly two years. “Capsule touchdown. Welcome back, NS25 crew!” Blue Origin said in a post on X.Introducing the Indian space tourist , a Blue Origin statement said, “Gopi Thotakura is a lifelong pilot and aviator who learned how to fly before he could drive. He flies jets commercially, in addition to piloting bush, aerobatic, and seaplanes. Gopi is a co-founder of Preserve Life Corp, a global center for holistic wellness and applied health located near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.”He studied for a BSc in aeronautical science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, US. A trained pilot, Gopi had worked in medical air evacuation services in India in the past. “A lifelong traveller, his most recent adventure took him to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro,” the statement said.In another first, America’s first Black astronaut candidate, Ed Dwight, finally rocketed into space 60 years later. Dwight, a former Air Force captain who was selected in 1961 but never got to fly to space with NASA, finally reached the edge of space — at 90 years, 8 months, and 10 days. He thus became the oldest person to go to space, narrowly surpassing Star Trek actor William Shatner, who was almost two months younger when he launched with Blue Origin in 2021.This flight is Blue Origin’s first tourist mission on New Shepard since August 2022. The company was forced to halt flights of the rocket after a New Shepard vehicle suffered an engine failure mid-flight during an uncrewed mission in Sep 2022. Blue Origin spent most of 2023 investigating the failure and making design corrections, and the company successfully returned to flight with another uncrewed mission in Dec.This mission was the seventh human flight for the New Shepard programme and the 25th in its history. Earlier, Blue Origin launched six tourist missions, flying celebrities like William Shatner, Michael Strahan, and Bezos himself to space. In all, New Shepard has flown 31 humans above the internationally recognized boundary of space, the company said.The company, seen as a future key strategic rival to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, plans to debut a much larger and more powerful New Glenn rocket later this year, capable of launching cargo to orbit. Blue Origin also aims to send humans to the moon later this decade for NASA.","India-born Gopi Thotakura made history on Sunday evening as he became the first Indian citizen to venture into space as a tourist.

Greene responded, ""I don't think you know what you're here for.

"Billionaire investor Ray Dalio warns of 40% risk of civil war in US, jokes about Taylor Swift for President",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/billionaire-investor-ray-dalio-warns-of-40-risk-of-civil-war-in-us-jokes-about-taylor-swift-for-president/articleshow/110251376.cms,"A surprising endorsement

NEW DELHI: Renowned investor and billionaire Ray Dalio has raised alarms about the escalating political divisions in the United States , warning that the probability of a civil war could be as high as 40%. Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates , the world's largest hedge fund, made these remarks in a recent interview with the Financial Times, saying, ""We are now on the brink,"" and foreseeing ""much more turbulent times"" ahead.Dalio has long been vocal about his concerns regarding the political and economic instability in the US. He has repeatedly highlighted the dangers posed by extreme levels of government debt, significant wealth inequality, rising internal divisions, and ongoing external conflicts. According to Dalio, these factors can lead to war, revolution, and a new world order.In his latest prediction, Dalio pegged the chances of a civil war at 35% to 40%, though he clarified that this might not necessarily entail a shooting war. The financial historian has been warning about these risks for years. In late 2020, he cautioned that the US was ""seeing a form of civil war"" as people moved between states for political and tax-related reasons. By early 2021, he lamented that America was in a ""terrible financial state and terribly divided.""Dalio's concerns are not limited to domestic issues. After the Israel-Hamas conflict erupted in October, he declared that the risk of a world war involving the US and China had surged from 35% to about 50%.In a surprising twist, Dalio half-jokingly suggested that pop star Taylor Swift could be the solution to America's divisions. After attending one of Swift's concerts, he remarked on her ability to bring together people from diverse backgrounds and nationalities. ""I saw how she brought people of all sorts — and many nationalities — together,"" he said. ""I say this partly as a joke, but if she ran for president and would listen to great advisers, I'd consider supporting her.""Dalio revealed his admiration for Swift when he posted a selfie from one of her ""Eras Tour"" concerts in March. Although he later clarified in a follow-up post that he was joking about endorsing her for president, he emphasized that ""she can bring people together a lot better than either of the presidential candidates.""Even if Dalio was just having fun with his talk of a Taylor Swift presidency, his comments reflect a serious recognition of the need for a unifying leader at a time when the world is on edge and people seem further apart than ever.","Billionaire Ray Dalio has raised alarms about the escalating political divisions in the United States.

Until a coup last year Niger had been a key partner in Washington's fight against insurgents in the Sahel region of Africa, who have killed thousands of people and displaced millions more.The agreement between Niger's defence ministry and the U.S.Department of Defence, reached after a five-day commission, guarantees the protection of U.S. troops until their withdrawal and establishes procedures to ease the entry and exit of American personnel during the withdrawal process.""The Ministry of Defence of Niger and the U.S. Department of Defense recall the common sacrifices of the Nigerien and American forces in the fight against terrorism and welcome the mutual efforts made in building up the Nigerien armed forces,"" they said in a joint statement.""The withdrawal of American forces from Niger in no way affects the pursuit of relations between the United States and Niger in the area of development.

(With inputs from AP)

NEW DELHI: A disturbing security video aired on Friday shows Sean Combs , also known as Diddy, physically assaulting singer Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016, the footage closely aligns with the description of an incident detailed in a November lawsuit filed by Cassie which captures Combs, clad only in a white towel, punching and kicking the R&B singer, who was his protege and a longtime girlfriend at the time.The video also shows Combs shoving and dragging Cassie, and throwing a vase in her direction. The security camera video, dated March 5, 2016 resembles the incident at an InterContinental Hotel in the Century City area of Los Angeles.According to the lawsuit, Combs allegedly paid the InterContinental Hotel $50,000 for the security video. The media outlet CNN obtained, published the video and verified the location by comparing the footage to publicly available images of the hotel but did not comment on how it did that.Although Cassie's lawsuit was settled the day after it was filed, it triggered intense scrutiny of Combs, leading to several more lawsuits in the following months and a federal criminal sex-trafficking investigation that resulted in raids on Combs' mansions in Los Angeles and Miami.Earlier Combs had denied the allegations in the lawsuits, and his lawyers maintain that he denies any wrongdoing and will fight to prove his innocence.His representatives did not immediately comment on the video.In a statement on Friday, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office acknowledged the ""disturbing"" video allegedly depicting Combs assaulting a woman in Los Angeles but said that it had not been presented with a case. Even if law enforcement presents a case, the statute of limitations would prevent prosecutors from charging Combs due to the incident occurring in 2016.""If the conduct depicted occurred in 2016, unfortunately we would be unable to charge as the conduct would have occurred beyond the timeline where a crime of assault can be prosecuted,"" the office said.""We encourage anyone who has been a victim or witness to a crime to report it to law enforcement or reach out to our office for support from our Bureau of Victims Services,"" it added.An attorney for Cassie Douglas Wigdor, who has filed other lawsuits against Combs, said, ""The gut-wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs.""""Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Ms. Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light,"" he added.In a recent lawsuit, it is alleged that Sean Combs became ""extremely intoxicated"" and punched his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura , leaving her with a black eye.The incident was captured on video, which shows Ventura attempting to leave with a packed bag and heading to a bank of elevator before Combs wakes up and begins yelling at her, chasing her down the hallway, the suit said.The video footage depicts Combs forcefully grabbing Ventura, throwing her to the ground, kicking her, and hurling vases in her direction.According to the lawsuit, Ventura managed to escape but later returned out of fear of facing more severe abuse if she didn't. As she came back, hotel staff encouraged her to return to her apartment. She eventually fled and sought refuge with a friend in Florida.The lawsuit claims that Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the security video. The release of the video comes as Combs and his legal team have started to counter the allegations that have been consistently emerging since November.They recently filed motions to dismiss parts of a lawsuit alleging he sexually assaulted a woman in 1991 and to dismiss entirely another lawsuit claiming that he and two other men raped a 17-year-old girl in 2003. The court filings labeled both sets of allegations as false.Homeland Security Investigations executed search warrants on Combs' residences in Los Angeles and Miami as part of a sex-trafficking investigation on March 25. His lawyer described it as ""a gross use of military-level force."" The investigation is ongoing, and Combs has not been charged.Combs, a three-time Grammy winner and the founder of Bad Boy Records, is one of the most influential hip-hop producers and executives of the past three decades.He has expanded his hip-hop success into a broader business empire that includes private-label spirits, fashion, and a TV network. Since the allegations began surfacing, he has had to step back from some of his business roles.Ventura gained recognition for her hit single ""Me & U,"" which reached the top spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart in 2006.Combs and Ventura started dating in 2007 and had an on-and-off relationship for more than a decade.","A disturbing security video aired on Friday shows Sean Combs physically assaulting singer Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016.

This decision marks the culmination of a 13-year legal battle and various periods of detention for Assange.The two judges at the High Court in London will determine whether they are satisfied with the assurances provided by the US that Assange, aged 52, would not face the death penalty and could rely on the First Amendment right to free speech if he were to face a US trial for espionage.Assange's legal team believes that he could be on a plane to the US within 24 hours of the decision, released from jail, or that his case could be further delayed by months of additional legal proceedings.""I have the sense that anything could happen at this stage,"" his wife Stella said last week. ""Julian could be extradited, or he could be freed.""WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which were considered the most significant security breaches in US military history.The organization also released a classified video in April 2010 depicting a 2007 US helicopter attack in Baghdad, Iraq, that resulted in the deaths of 12 people.The US authorities intend to prosecute Assange on 18 charges, primarily under the Espionage Act, alleging that his actions with WikiLeaks were reckless, compromised national security, and put the lives of agents at risk. Assange's supporters worldwide view the prosecution as an assault on journalism and free speech, as well as retaliation for causing embarrassment to the US government.Assange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a Swedish warrant over sex crime allegations that were later dropped.

"'Young voters will stay out of polls this November,' Biden campaign remains hopeful amid protests and democratic discontent",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/young-voters-will-stay-out-of-polls-this-november-biden-campaign-remains-hopeful-amid-protests-and-democratic-discontent/articleshow/110244294.cms,"NEW DELHI: Despite recent polls showing many Democrats unhappy with President Joe Biden's policy on Israel's offensive in Gaza, White House aides remain confident that protests across US college campuses will not significantly affect Biden's chances in the upcoming electionThe White House's optimism on the issue, shared by many in the Biden campaign, contrasts with dire warnings from some Democratic strategists and youth organizers.They caution that misjudging the situation could be costly for Biden in a tight race against Republican rival Donald Trump. Several aides advised Biden to remain above the fray, avoiding direct engagement with the relatively small groups of protesters on college campuses, arguing their numbers are too insignificant to harm his reelection campaign.Many officials despite the protests remain confident that, faced with a choice between Biden and Trump in November, even Democrats who oppose US policy will choose Biden. Reuters interviewed nearly a dozen top White House officials, but only two expressed concern about the impact of the protests and Biden's handling of the issue.The issue returns to the spotlight on Sunday, when President Biden makes the commencement address at Morehouse College. This comes amid objections from some students and faculty, and a warning from the college's president that the ceremony will be halted if there are protests. Most officials Reuters spoke to believe housing costs and inflation are more pressing issues for young voters than the war in Gaza, citing a recent Harvard poll that ranks Israel/Palestine 15th on a list of concerns, after taxes, gun violence, and jobs. Several aides refer to the protesters as ""activists"" rather than students.Asked for comment, White House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said Biden understands this is a painful moment for many communities and is listening. He noted that Biden has expressed sorrow over the loss of civilian lives in the ""heartbreaking"" conflict and emphasized the need to prevent further innocent casualties.Biden and Trump are nearly tied in national polls, with Trump leading in battleground states that will decide the election. On economic issues like inflation, Trump scores higher with voters overall than Biden. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll found Democrats deeply divided over Biden's handling of both the war in Gaza and the US campus protests against it, with 44% of registered Democrats disapproving of Biden's handling of the crisis and 51% disapproving of his handling of the protests.Young voters still favor Biden, but support has dropped significantly since 2020. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in March showed Americans aged 18-29 favor Biden over Trump by just 3 percentage points—29% to 26%—with the rest favoring another candidate or unsure. Two White House officials emphasized that Biden's support among young voters is not where it was in 2020 and expressed concern that the administration is not taking the drop seriously enough.With over 35,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza since the war began in October, US support for Israel's government could heavily influence the presidential election in November.""There is almost a level of defiance when it comes to some of the president's closest advisers on this issue,"" said a senior White House official with direct knowledge of the matter, who did not wish to be named. ""They think the best approach is to simply steer clear and let it pass.""Protests over Israel's war in Gaza have erupted at over 60 colleges and universities this year, disrupting Biden's events nationwide, prompting some Democrats in key battleground states to vote ""uncommitted,"" and causing divisions within the Democratic Party.Biden, known for his candid remarks even when they are politically risky, has been cautious regarding the Gaza protests. In early May, he emphasized the importance of upholding the law while defending free speech and later addressed the threat of antisemitism on college campuses. However, he largely avoided the core issue driving the protests—young Americans' dissatisfaction with his support for Israel. He did assert unequivocally that protests would not alter his Middle East policy.Protest organizers argue that the recent halt to some weapons deliveries to Israel was insufficient and came too late. They are planning new demonstrations, although the summer break may temporarily reduce campus activism.Michele Weindling, political director of the climate-focused youth group the Sunrise Movement, said ""young people are incredibly disillusioned, they are angry at the way the president has treated this conflict.""""A huge risk right now is that young voters will completely stay out of the electoral system this November, or deliberately vote against Biden out of anger,"" Weindling said.That has the potential to cost Biden dearly, given 61% of the more than half of Americans aged 18 to 29 that voted in the 2020 general election voted Democratic, a Tufts University research group found. The youth turnout was up 11 points from 2016.",White House aides remain confident that protests across US college campuses will not significantly affect Biden's chances in the upcoming election.

Deadly storms leave Houston area reeling with power outages and health risks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deadly-storms-leave-houston-area-reeling-with-power-outages-and-health-risks/articleshow/110243609.cms,"HOUSTON: As the Houston area works to clean up and restore power to hundreds of thousands after deadly storms left at least seven people dead, it will do so amid a smog warning and scorching temperatures that could pose health risks.National Weather Service meteorologist Marc Chenard said on Saturday that highs of around 90 degrees (32.2 C) were expected through the start of the coming week, with heat indexes likely approaching 100 degrees (38 C) by midweek.""We expect the impact of the heat to gradually increase ... we will start to see that heat risk increase Tuesday into Wednesday through Friday,"" Chenard said.The heat index is what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with the air temperature, according to the weather service.""Don't overdo yourself during the cleanup process,"" the weather service's Houston office said in a post on the social platform X.In addition to the heat, the Houston area could face poor air quality during the weekend.Heavy rainfall was possible in eastern Louisiana and central Alabama on Saturday, and parts of Louisiana were also at risk for flooding.The Houston Health Department said it would distribute 400 free portable air conditioners to area seniors, people with disabilities and caregivers of disabled children to contend with the heat.Five cooling centers also were opened - four in Houston and one in Kingwood.Hundreds of thousands remain without power: The widespread destruction of Thursday's storms brought much of Houston to a standstill. Thunderstorms and hurricane-force winds tore through the city - decimating the facade of one brick building and leaving trees, debris and shattered glass on the streets. A tornado also touched down near the northwest Houston suburb of Cypress.More than a half-million homes and businesses in Texas remained without electricity by midday Saturday, according to PowerOutage.us. Another 21,000 customers were also without power in Louisiana, where strong winds and a suspected tornado hit.""It's been a madhouse out here,"" Cypress resident Hallie O'Bannon said. ""You know we don't have any power. No hot water. It's been really crazy.""""Everyone is pretty resilient, and everyone's just trying to get back to normal and help each other out and the best way we can,"" O'Bannon added.CenterPoint Energy, which has deployed 1,000 employees to the area and is requesting 5,000 more, said power restoration could take several days or longer in some areas, and that customers need to ensure their homes can safely be reconnected.""In addition to damaging CenterPoint Energy's electric infrastructure and equipment, severe weather may have caused damage to customer-owned equipment"" such as the weatherhead, which is where power enters the home, the company said.Customers must have repairs completed by a qualified electrician before service can be restored, CenterPoint added.High-voltage transmission towers that were torn apart and downed power lines pose a twofold challenge for utility companies because the damage affected transmission and distribution systems, according to Alexandria von Meier, a power and energy expert who called that a rare thing. Damage to just the distribution system is more typical, von Meier said.How quickly repairs are made will depend on a variety of factors, including the time it takes to assess the damage, equipment replacement, roadwork access issues and workforce availability.Storm caught many off guard: Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez reported late Friday that three people died during the storm, including an 85-year-old woman whose home caught fire after being struck by lightning and a 60-year-old man who had tried to use his vehicle to power his oxygen tank.Houston Mayor John Whitmire previously said at least four other people were killed in the city when the storms swept through Harris County, which includes Houston.School districts in the Houston area canceled classes Friday for more than 400,000 students and government offices were closed.Houston Independent School District Superintendent Mike Miles said Saturday that he hoped to reopen schools on Monday, but that is dependent upon the restoration of electricity in school buildings.""If a school doesn't have power, it will remain closed,"" Miles told reporters during a tour of the heavily damaged Sinclair Elementary School.Whitmire warned that police were out in force, including state troopers sent to the area to prevent looting. He said the speed and intensity of the storm caught many off guard.Noelle Delgado, executive director of Houston Pets Alive, said she pulled up at the animal rescue on Thursday night and found the dogs and cats - more than 30 in all - uninjured, but the building's awning had been ripped off, the sign was mangled and water was leaking inside.She hoped to find foster homes for the animals.""I could definitely tell that this storm was a little different,"" she said. ""It felt terrifying.""State and Federal recovery assistance on the way: In light of the storm damage , Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo and Whitmire both signed disaster declarations, paving the way for state and federal storm recovery assistance.A separate disaster declaration from President Joe Biden makes federal funding available to people in seven Texas counties - including Harris - that have been affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding since April 26.",More than a half-million homes and businesses in Texas remain without power. Highs of around 90 degrees (32.2 C) are expected through the start of the coming week. Heat indexes likely approaching 100 degrees (38 C) by midweek.

Trump exclaimed to laughter from the pro-gun crowd. Trump, who is dealing with multiple criminal indictments for attempting to overturn the 2020 results and was twice impeached as president, described Biden as ""crooked"" and a ""threat to democracy."" He claimed that if Biden were a Republican, he would be ""given the electric chair.""Meanwhile, Biden campaigned in the crucial swing state of Georgia, warning supporters that his ""unhinged"" opponent poses a threat to American democracy.Speaking to supporters at Mary Mac's Tea Room, a Black-owned restaurant in Atlanta, Biden said, ""Our democracy is really on the line."" He criticised Trump for being ""obsessed with losing in 2020"" and described him as ""clearly unhinged,"" suggesting that something ""snapped"" in Trump after that election. ""Trump isn't running to lead America. He's running for revenge,"" Biden added. ""We cannot let this man become president. Our children's future is at stake... We have to win this race, not for me but for America.""During his Texas campaign stop, Trump took a break from his criminal trial in New York. He faces criminal charges in Washington, Georgia, and Florida, which he claims are part of a conspiracy by Biden to block his return to the White House.The NRA, a 150-year-old organisation whose longtime CEO resigned in January amid a graft lawsuit, is closely aligned with the Republican Party in opposing firearm restrictions despite routine mass shootings and high rates of gun violence in the US compared to other nations.Trump previewed his speech's tone on Friday, telling a fundraising dinner in Minnesota that gun owners must vote Republican because ""the Democrats want to take their guns away—and they will take their guns away.""Biden has repeatedly called for reinstating a long-lapsed ban on military-style assault weapons, among other restrictions. Last month, the White House moved to tighten controls on firearm sales at gun shows and online that evade federal background checks, prompting several Republican-led states to sue to block the measure. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there were more than 40,000 gun-related deaths in the US last year.","Donald Trump launches a fiery attack on President Joe Biden in a speech to the National Rifle Association.

Fresh corruption allegations levelled against ex-Pak PM Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fresh-corruption-allegations-levelled-against-ex-pak-pm-imran-khan/articleshow/110249925.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's accountability watchdog has levelled fresh corruption allegations against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accusing him of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts linked to the state gift repository when he was in power, media reports said on Sunday. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) launched an inquiry against the 71-year-old Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi over the alleged misuse of the Toshakhana -- the state gift repository, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.The beleaguered former first couple has been convicted in earlier Toshakhana corruption cases as well.In January, Khan and Bushra were sentenced to 14 years in jail each by an accountability court for alleged corruption in state gifts they got from the state repository. The sentence was later suspended by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The previous Toshakhana graft case was filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the charges of hiring the sale of state gifts.The NAB investigation centres on the illegal possession and sale of seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts, including diamond and gold jewellery, the report said.According to the inquiry, items such as Graff and Rolex watches and diamond jewellery were allegedly sold without being legally owned or deposited in the Toshakhana, as required by law.The Toshakhana is a department under the Cabinet Division that stores gifts given to rulers and government officials by heads of other governments and foreign dignitaries.Under the rules governing Toshakhana - a Persian word meaning ""treasure house"" - government officials can keep gifts by paying a price, but first, the gift should be deposited.The gifts were purchased/retained at ""considerably lower rates"" and were ""routinely sold"" without properly declaring them. The expensive Graff watch set was also allegedly sold without ""retention"", according to the report.The NAB's findings suggest collusion between the buyers of the Graff watches and a private appraiser, who allegedly undervalued the watches by Rs 30 million.The undervaluation, confirmed via an email from Toshakhana, meant that only Rs 20.1 million, or 20 per cent of the watches' actual value of Rs 100.9 million, was deposited into the government treasury, the report said.""During the course of the inquiry, it was revealed that the value of luxury gift items was assessed in an unscrupulous and slipshod manner by a private appraiser [...] was not even an industry expert and did not possess the required experience or expertise to make these assessments,"" Geo News said, citing the report.After the report findings, the accountability watchdog was authorised to conduct further probes against Khan and Bushra. Separate call-up notices had also been served to them, which they have challenged in the IHC.The court will hear Bushra's appeal on June 4 and Khan's appeal on June 24, the report said.The former-cricketer-turned-politician has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August last year. Since his removal from power in a no-confidence motion in April 2022, Khan has been convicted in at least four cases, including the cipher (secret diplomatic communication) case.","Pakistan's accountability watchdog accuses Imran Khan of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts.

Pakistan government forecasts USD 72 bn investment needed to meet 50 pc surge in power demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forecasts-usd-72-bn-investment-needed-to-meet-50-pc-surge-in-power-demand/articleshow/110249530.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a comprehensive overview of Pakistan's energy landscape, the government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade. This forecast, outlined in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP 2024-34) submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), aims to bolster the country's power infrastructure to meet escalating demand, Dawn reported.Under the proposed plan, renewable energy sources are slated to account for a significant portion, with an expected surge to 46 per cent of the total energy mix within the next decade.This surge in capacity, estimated to rise from 42,000MW to 57,000MW, underscores the government's commitment to embracing sustainable energy solutions .The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has provided insights into the anticipated growth in electricity demand, projecting increases ranging from 46 per cent under a low-growth scenario to 74 per cent in a high-growth scenario over the next ten years. To accommodate this surge, an estimated investment of USD 62-64 billion would be required, reflecting the scale of the challenge at hand, as reported by Dawn.The Transmission System Expansion Plan (TSEP 2024-34) outlines an additional USD 8.7 billion investment imperative for enhancing the transmission network. This allocation includes funds for both ongoing projects, requiring USD 3.2 billion for completion, and new projects necessitating USD 5.5 billion in funding.Employing state-of-the-art generation planning software, PLEXOS, the least-cost, long-term generation expansion plan has been meticulously developed. This plan factors in existing and future generation projects, policy frameworks, contractual obligations, natural resource allocations, and prevailing Grid Code provisions. It adheres closely to the National Electricity Policy 2021 and incorporates a series of assumptions to guide strategic decision-making.In crafting the base case scenario, NTDC has meticulously accounted for existing contractual obligations and projected retirements of power projects as stipulated in their respective Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), with the exception of KAPCO. The plan also factors in the retirement of 8,330MW of existing power generation capacity over the planning horizon.The forecasted demand is calibrated to accommodate the intermittency of variable renewable energy resources such as wind and solar PV, critical elements in achieving the government's ambitious renewable energy targets. With an estimated 87,600 hours of energy and peak demand forecasted from FY24 to 34, the plan aims to balance the evolving energy landscape with a diversified and resilient energy mix.By 2034, the envisioned energy mix will reflect a notable shift towards indigenous fuel sources, with local coal and renewables playing a prominent role. Hydropower is expected to contribute 46 per cent of the energy mix, accompanied by 10 per cent from variable renewable energy sources. The plan minimizes reliance on imported fuels, with RFO making no contribution and imported coal and RLNG accounting for a modest share of total energy requirements, Dawn reported.","The government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade.

The investigation found that Khan had illegally obtained and sold seven watches from the state gift repository during his time as the country's leader.The latest case involves accusations of keeping and selling ten high-value gifts without properly declaring them to the authorities or depositing them into the Toshakhana, as mandated by law.Regulations stipulate that any gifts received by the head of state, first lady, or president exceeding PKR 30,000 in value must be registered in the state gift repository, as reported by Geo News.The inquiry report also revealed that Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi , who was previously convicted in a Toshakhana case , received and kept a watch, a ring, and a necklace, which should have been submitted to the gift depository.The report further stated that the state gifts were acquired or retained at much lower prices, with discrepancies found in the valuation of luxury items by an inexperienced private appraiser who lacked the necessary expertise.One of the controversial items, a Graff watch set, was sold to Mohammad Shafiq for PKR 5,10,00,000 before its retention, with the entire retention cost of PKR 2,00,00,000 also being paid by Shafiq to the Protocol section staff, while the remaining amount was given to the assistant protocol section, according to the Geo News report. Subsequent assessments by various authorities indicated that the valuation of the retained gifts was significantly higher than initially appraised.Following these findings, NAB has been authorized to conduct further investigations against Khan and Bushra Bibi, who have both received separate call-up notices.
