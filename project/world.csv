Sean 'Diddy' Combs: More legal woes for Diddy: New sexual assault lawsuits include 10-year-old victim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/more-legal-woes-for-diddy-new-sexual-assault-lawsuits-include-10-year-old-victim/articleshow/114712270.cms,"Sean 'Diddy' Combs (Picture Credit: AP)

Sean 'Diddy' Combs is facing a new lawsuit for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old boy in 2005, adding to the existing list of hundreds of rape allegations against him.The lawsuit is one of two filed on Monday in a Manhattan state court by attorney Tony Buzbee , who represents over 150 alleged victims of Combs and has filed at least 17 lawsuits against him.In the complaint involving the 10-year-old, a California plaintiff identified as John Doe claims he was an aspiring actor and rapper when a consultant arranged an ""audition"" with Combs at a New York hotel.According to the suit, after Doe said he would “do anything” to succeed, Combs allegedly gave him a drugged soda, pushed him down, and forced him to perform oral sex.The plaintiff said he lost consciousness, waking up sore with his pants undone. He also said that Combs threatened to harm his family if he told anyone.In Monday's second lawsuit, another male accuser said he was a 17-year-old auditioning for the reality TV show 'Making the Band' in 2008 when Combs and a bodyguard allegedly assaulted him.In this complaint, another California plaintiff identified as John Doe said that Combs forced him to perform oral sex on both himself and the bodyguard, presenting it as a ""test"" of his dedication to the music industry.According to the suit, Doe was ultimately rejected from the audition after Combs deemed him ""untrustworthy"" for expressing reservations about the assault.Combs' lawyers responded with a statement similar to those issued after previous lawsuits from Buzbee, saying, ""The attorney behind this lawsuit is more interested in media attention than in the truth. In court, the truth will prevail: Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone—man or woman, adult or minor.""Diddy has been held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center since his arrest on September 16. He faces charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking , and transportation for prostitution, involving over 120 alleged victims, including his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura.

'For the economy'

'Sense of community'

ATLANTA: Locked in a tight race for the US presidency, Republican Donald Trump has been pushing hard to make inroads with young, first-time voters .AFP spoke with three such teenagers in Georgia , one of the most hotly contested of the swing states that will decide the US election on November 5.Kamron can't wait to blow out the candles for his 18th birthday on Thursday, just in time for the presidential election.For this high school student, who was wearing a red cap bearing Trump's name, there is no doubt about who he is voting for.""A lot of young men don't like what's going on in the US right now,"" he said, adding that he believes the Democrats were spending too much time on ""LGBTQ agendas, transgender agendas"" and not enough on everyday problems.""That's not really what the young men are looking for right now, they're looking for a strong, powerful leader that has a backbone, they're looking for someone to look up to,"" he said.On Monday, Trump held a campaign rally on the Georgia Tech university campus in Atlanta.Cesar Viera, 18, said he's ready to vote for the billionaire as early as ""tomorrow,"" taking advantage of early voting arrangements, which are in place in several states.""Trump would be way better for young Americans,"" he said, a US flag draped across his shoulders.""He's just the best for the economy right now,"" said the teenager, a craftsman who refurbishes houses and who already has concerns about never being able to afford his own.At 78, Trump would be the oldest man to take oath as US president if he wins. For Viera, however, there are no concerns about his age.""I think it doesn't matter, it just matters how he's doing mentally,"" he said.""Neither candidate is perfect,"" said Trenton Dykes, a 19-year-old computer engineering student from Kennesaw, Georgia.Dykes was unmoved by allegations of racism leveled at Trump, who has repeatedly characterized migrants as ""animals"" and ""criminals"" throughout his campaign.""Based on policy, we've already seen him in office four years, I don't think he did anything racist,"" said Dykes.The student initially supported Robert Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate who dropped out of the race to support Republican Trump.""I don't vote based on character,"" he said, adding that Trump was ""bringing people across party lines.""This would be Dykes's second rally for the septuagenarian, and he said he was drawn to ""the sense of community, people coming together with the same set of beliefs.""","Republican Donald Trump has been pushing hard to make inroads with young, first- time voters.

The incident occurred close to a well-known primary school.Videos circulating on social media depict two children on the ground, while another image shows a man with blood on his face being restrained by bystanders, AP reported. This incident adds to a troubling trend of knife attacks in China, particularly targeting school children.Earlier in September, a tragic attack in Shenzhen resulted in the death of a 10-year-old Japanese student near his school. This followed another incident in June, where a woman and her child were injured at a school bus stop, and a Chinese woman who intervened was killed.In early October, a separate knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket claimed three lives and injured 15 others. The suspect in that case, a 37-year-old man surnamed Lin, was detained shortly after the attack.While China maintains strict gun control laws, incidents involving knives and homemade explosives have become more common. Authorities have noted an increase in such attacks, often attributing them to mental health issues.In 2022, a stabbing spree at a Shanghai hospital injured 15 individuals, with the perpetrator expressing resentment toward society. This surge in violence has raised significant concerns among various communities, particularly those of foreign nationals living in China.","A knife attack near a primary school in Beijing on Monday afternoon left five people injured, including three children.

Kamala Harris McDonalds: Photo of Kamala Harris in McDonald's dress going viral. Is it real?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/photo-of-kamala-harris-in-mcdonalds-dress-going-viral-is-it-real/articleshow/114634790.cms,"The truth of Kamala Harris' McDonald's stint

What McDonald's said

A photo of a young Kamala Harris donning a blue dress apparently of McDonald's when she did a stint there has gone viral. But MAGA supporters pointed out that it was a doctored image shared mostly by pro-Kamala Harris accounts on X. They shared the original image of a McDonald's staff which they claimed had been manipulated to put Kamala Harris' face.Working at McDonald's emerged as a key flashpoint between the GOP and the Democrats as Donald Trump claimed Kamala Harris lied about working at McDonald's 41 years ago. To emulate her 'false claim', Donald Trump last Sunday worked a shift at a McDonald's outlet in Pennsylvania and said he worked 15 minutes more than Kamala Harris because Kamala Harris never worked at any McDonald's -- as there is no record of it.“We have checked with McDonald’s, and they say, definitively, that there is no record of Lyin’ Kamala Harris ever having worked there,” Trump wrote after his McDonald's shift. “In other words, she never worked there, and has lied about this ‘job’ for years.”Kamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983. But the Trump campaign claimed that there has been no record of Kamala Harris working at McDonald's she claimed and hence she lied. But reports said it was a pre-digital era and no record found may not hint at 'never worked'.McDonald's said it is true that no records of Harris' employment exist but this is not an aberration and not a reason to think that she didn't work at a McDonald's. ""Though we are not a political brand, we’ve been proud to hear former President Trump’s love for McDonald’s and Vice President Harris’s fond memories working under the Arches. While we and our franchisees don’t have records for all positions dating back to the early ’80s, what makes ‘1 in 8’ so powerful is the shared experience so many Americans have had.""",Kamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983.

It was meant to be funny. Instead, it could turn out to be a serious mistake. Throwaway lines by a comedian who labeled Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage,” at Trump rally , bookended by other speakers calling Kamala Harris a ""devil"" and suggesting she began her career as a prostitute, has exploded across US political spectrum with just about a week to go before Election Day on November 5.At a packed rally in Madison Square Gardens (MSG) in New York City which critics said had echoes of a Nazi rally in 1939, speaker after speaker excoriated Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party, minorities, and immigrants in disparaging and derogatory terms to an extent even moderate Republicans reeled back.Few were more toxic and coarse than Tony Hinchcliffe , a little-known comedian, whose ""humorous"" riff included the following lines: “I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.” He then went on to say, “These Latinos, they love making babies, too.....There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country.”Among speakers who preceded Trump's address to his MAGA faithful, his childhood friend David Rem referred to Kamala Harris as “the Antichrist” and “the devil,” and Businessman Grant Cardone told the crowd that Harris ”and her pimp handlers will destroy our country.” Other speakers called for metaphorically ""slaughtering"" political opponents, while Trump himself spoke of an ally ""decapitate"" a fake reporter on a tv show.The slurs caused outrage among many Latinos, minorities, and women even as a panicked Trump campaign said Hinchcliffe's joke “does not reflect the views of President Trump."" Prominent Latinos of Puerto Rican heritage, including superstar Bad Bunny , one of the biggest recording artists in the world, singer Ricky Martin, and actress Jennifer Lopez among others shared videos expressing supporting Kamala Harris even as MAGA Republicans running for office in areas with Latino voters quickly dissociated themselves from the smears.""This joke bombed for a reason. It's not funny and it's not true. Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans!"" said Rick Scott, a Trump acolyte who is running to retain the senate seat in Florida, which has a large Latino and Puerto Rican population. ""This is not a joke. It’s completely classless & in poor taste. Puerto Rico is the crown jewel of the Caribbean & home to many of the most patriotic Americans I know,"" said Carlos Giminez, a Cuban-American lawmaker also running to retain his seat in Congress.The timing of the smear could not have been worse for MAGA candidates, coming just hours after Kamala Harris wrapped up a campaign to court Latinos in Pennsylvania by visiting a local Puerto Rican restaurant in Philadelphia. She talked about a new plan she announced on Sunday to bring economic opportunities to Puerto Rico, discussed her visit there after Hurricane Maria, and said that even as a senator she had “felt a need and an obligation” to “make sure Puerto Rico’s needs were met,” reminding them that as president,Trump had resisted sending aid to the island after back-to-back hurricanes, and had offered nothing but “paper towels and insults.”Puerto Rico, a Caribbean island, is unincorporated US territory, and although it is not technically an American state, Puerto Ricans are considered US citizens and can vote in US elections if they are registered in the mainland (but not on the island). Since 2017, there has been an exodus of Puerto Ricans from the island, and they constitute significant voting blocs in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina -- all battleground states -- and Florida.","Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage"" at Trump rally.

With Diwali falling just days before November 5, 2024, Bhutoria said, ""This Diwali, let's drive out the darkness: vote for Harris-Walz. This election season coincides with Diwali, the festival of lights celebrated by millions of South Asians around the world.

Over the years, the festivities have included President Barack Obama lighting a diya in the Oval Office and then-Vice President Biden hosting a reception in 2016. In 2017, President Donald Trump continued the tradition by lighting a diya with his daughter Ivanka and Indian American members of his administration.

The rally was enormous -- and raucous. Madison Square Gardens was filled to the rafters with 20,000 people, with thousands more outside. The speeches were fierce, vitriolic, and in some instances, racially loaded. Elon Musk , the world's richest man and MAGA's social media megaphone, introduced Melania Trump, making a rare campaign rally appearance; and she in turn introduced her husband, Donald Trump . For the MAGA faithful, the rally was a celebration of unity, the energy indicative of imminent victory.For many liberals, Democrats, and even moderate Republicans, it was a neo-Nazi gathering, scarily evocative of a 1939 rally when more than 20,000 supporters of Adolf Hitler packed into MSG for a so-called pro-America rally. Trump's own niece, Mary Trump, a fierce critic of the MAGA supremo, posted pictures of the 1939 and 2024 rallies side by side on X, wondering, ""So, we're really doing this again. Eyes wide open."" Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz noted: ""There’s a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden ... And don’t think that he doesn’t know for one second exactly what they’re doing there.""Liberal media channels ran images of the two events in tandem. Other critics called it a ""freak show"" ""a total embarrassment to the US"" and a ""hate rally."" Meghan McCain, daughter of late Republican Senator John McCain, wondered: ""I actually think this rally could backfire...This is maga on steroids.""MAGA principals pushed back, sneering at the comparison, pointing out that the rally included the group ""Jews for Trump,"" and Blacks, Latinos, and Hindus (including Trump acolyte Vivek Ramaswamy) spoke at the event. They pointed to a Star of David, a symbol of Jewish identity and Judaism, draped inside the auditorium. Elon Musk posted a meme on X with the caption, ""If he's Hitler why didn't he do Hitler things in the first term?""Just because he didn’t do it in the first term does not mean he will not in the second, countered liberals, arguing that he is now emboldened by the support he has got for proposals like internment camps, mass incarceration, and use of Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law crafted in the early years of the republic when women and black had no voting rights. Trump himself ramped up his rhetoric, speaking of “an eye for an eye” (with reference to tariffs) and chuckling about a journalist critic who was (metaphorically) “decapitated” by his supporter on fake news NBC.Hours after the event, Elon Musk posted a photo of a black MAGA cap with the words MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Critics noted that it used the Gothic-Fraktur typeface favored in Nazi Germany. “This font … is an homage to Nazi lettering. They are not hiding their Nazi love, anymore,” read one post on X, among several that raised alarm.","The rally was enormous -- and raucous.

The Philadelphia district attorney 's office filed a lawsuit on Monday to prevent a political action committee led by billionaire Elon Musk from giving $1 million to registered US voters in key battleground states before the November 5 election .The complaint, filed by the top prosecutor in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, alleged that the giveaway by Musk's America PAC , which supports Republican former President Donald Trump , constituted an ""illegal lottery"" that encouraged Pennsylvania residents to disclose personal information.Lawrence Krasner, the chief prosecutor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city and a Democratic stronghold, claimed that the giveaways violated state consumer protection laws.

The post revealed a Michigan resident as the recipient of the $1 million prize and stated that additional awards would be distributed daily until the election.Pennsylvania is one of seven crucial battleground states that will determine the outcome of the presidential election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris , a Democrat. The candidate who secures the state's 19 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to win will emerge victorious.According to a CNN report last week, the Justice Department has sent a letter to America PAC cautioning that the billionaire Tesla CEO's giveaways for registered voters who sign his free-speech and gun-rights petition may violate federal law.Legal experts consulted by Reuters last week had differing opinions on whether the giveaway violates federal laws that criminalise paying or offering to pay someone to register to vote.The Trump campaign heavily relies on outside groups for voter canvassing, which means that the super PAC established by Musk, the world's wealthiest individual, plays a significant role in what is anticipated to be an extremely close election.","Philadelphia district attorney's office filed a lawsuit on Monday to prevent a political action committee led by billionaire Elon Musk from giving $1 million to registered voters.

Is it safe to eat at McDonald’s? Sales slump after E. Coli outbreak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-it-safe-to-eat-at-mcdonalds-sales-slump-after-e-coli-outbreak/articleshow/114711652.cms,"McDonald’s has tried to reassure customers that it’s safe to eat at its restaurants.

McDonald’s Corp sales plummeted following news of E. coli infections linked to the chain’s Quarter Pounders .Transactions fell as much as 6% from the prior year in the days after the outbreak became public on Tuesday, dragging down total sales, according to Bloomberg Second Measure data through October 25. The group tracks debit and credit card transactions from US consumers.The outbreak dealt a blow to McDonald’s, which had been working to reverse slumping traffic with offers such as a $5 meal deal and a splashy marketing campaign behind the limited-time Chicken Big Mac. McDonald’s transactions had been growing in the weeks before the issue was disclosed, Second Measure data shows.McDonald’s has tried to reassure customers that it’s safe to eat at its restaurants. In a message Sunday, Joe Erlinger, the chain’s US president, apologized to customers.“I know that our relationship is built on trust. You trust us to serve you safe food every time,” he said in a video. “On behalf of the McDonald’s system, I want you to hear from me: we are sorry.”McDonald’s has said it suspects that raw slivered onions that garnish the Quarter Pounder are the carriers of the pathogen. The chain, which had pulled the burgers from about 20% of its more than 13,000 US locations, said Sunday it planned to bring them back this week after ruling out beef as the source of the contamination. They’ll be served without onions at those restaurants.Traffic fell across the US, but states where the burgers were pulled reported even larger declines, according to an analysis of Placer.ai cellphone mobility data by Gordon Haskett. Colorado, which has recorded the largest number of cases, had a 33% decline on October 25 from the prior year.The outbreak has sickened 75 people across 13 states and caused one death, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday. The CDC said it believes the risk to the public is “very low,” citing actions taken by McDonald’s and the onion supplier, Taylor Farms, which recalled several batches of the product. McDonald’s said it would stop buying onions from the facility that’s become the focus of the investigation.","Transactions fell as much as 6% from the prior year in the days after the outbreak became public on Tuesday.

'Enemy understands strength'



WASHINGTON: North Korea has sent some 10,000 troops to train in Russia , Washington said Monday, tripling its estimate and prompting Nato as well as EU warnings of a dangerous expansion of the Ukraine war .Pyongyang -- with whom Moscow signed a mutual defense pact -- is already widely believed to be arming Russia for its invasion, but troops on the ground would mark a new escalation in the conflict.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned North Korea could ""soon"" have as many as 12,000 soldiers on Russian soil, while US President Joe Biden slammed the deployment as ""very dangerous.""""We believe that the DPRK has sent around 10,000 soldiers in total to train in eastern Russia that will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks,"" Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told journalists, using an abbreviation for North Korea's official name.Washington had previously put the number of North Korean troops in Russia at more than 3,000.Nato chief Mark Rutte likewise called the troop deployment ""a dangerous expansion of Russia's war"" and ""a sign of Putin's growing desperation.""Rutte noted more than 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since the conflict started in 2022, adding the Kremlin was unable to sustain the invasion without foreign support.Despite the cost, Russia has been making steady territorial gains in Ukraine.Moscow's army has advanced 478 square kilometers (184 square miles) into Ukrainian territory since the beginning of October, a record since the first weeks of the war, according to an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War.Those gains followed 477 and 459 square-kilometer advances in August and September, respectively, and come amid amid major shifts on the front line, in particular in eastern Ukraine around Pokrovsk.Speaking in Brussels after a briefing with South Korean intelligence officials, Rutte said he could confirm that North Korean military units had been deployed in the field in Russia's western Kursk region.Ukrainian troops launched a ground offensive in Kursk in August and control several hundred square kilometers of Russian territory.""The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security,"" Rutte told reporters in Brussels.Experts have said that in return for the troops, North Korea is likely aiming to acquire military technology, ranging from surveillance satellites to submarines, plus possible security guarantees from Moscow.EU chief Ursula von der Leyen also warned that North Korea sending troops ""for the first time"" represented ""a significant escalation of the war against Ukraine and threatens global peace.""She made the comments after a phone call with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, during which she assured the leader that ""the EU's response to this development will center on cooperation with the Republic of Korea and other like-minded partners.""The United States likewise told China -- an ally of both Moscow and Pyongyang -- it should be ""concerned about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and North Korea,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister who took over the reins of Nato this month, called on Moscow and Pyongyang to ""cease these actions immediately.""At a press conference in Iceland on Monday, Zelenskyy had warned that there were already around 3,000 North Korean soldiers on Russian land -- with four times that expected imminently.""We think that they will have 12,000 soon,"" the Ukrainian leader added.""This is an escalation. Sanctions alone are not enough. We need weapons and a clear plan to prevent North Korea's expanded involvement in the war in Europe,"" Zelenskyy 's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on social media Monday after Rutte's comments.""Today, Russia brings in North Korea; next, it could broaden their engagement, and then other autocratic regimes may see that they can get away with this and come to fight against Nato ,"" he warned.""The enemy understands strength.

He claimed that the ""outrageous rhetoric"" from the Harris campaign has likely contributed to two assassination attempts on him in the past three months.""My father used to always say, never use the word Nazi. never use the word Hitler. And yet they use that word freely, both words. They use it, he's Hitler. And then they say he's a Nazi. I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi,"" the former president added.""This is the kind of outrageous rhetoric that has resulted in two assassination attempts in the last three months,"" he added.The former president also addressed the topic of fatigue, saying that despite campaigning for 58 consecutive days, he does not feel tired. He contrasted this with Kamala, who he claimed took days off during the campaign, alleging, ""she's taking a day off. Like, a couple of days ago, she took, like, two days off in a row.""Concerns surrounding Trump's rhetoric have intensified, particularly after retired General John Kelly, Trump's longest-serving chief of staff, stated in a recent interview that the former president fits the definition of a fascist.Tensions have soared as polls indicate a tightly contested race, fuelled by fears that Trump may once again refuse to accept defeat, as he did in 2020. The campaign has been further complicated by troubling reports of ballot box fires in competitive districts in Washington and Oregon, raising concerns about election integrity .During his rally, Trump again targeted Harris, calling her a ""hater,"" and urged his supporters to ""get out and vote.""

Meanwhile, Harris has been actively campaigning in Michigan, emphasising unity and condemning Trump's divisive rhetoric. ""He is focused... on dividing our country,"" she said.With early voting well underway, more than 47 million Americans have cast their ballots. The stakes are particularly high in Georgia, one of seven swing states that could ultimately determine the outcome of the election. Trump is actively courting key voter demographics, including religious groups, asserting, ""I think this is a country that needs religion,"" and framing Harris's administration as a threat to traditional values.Harris is set to deliver a ""closing argument"" in Washington, a location imbued with historical significance after Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021.","Donald Trump in Atlanta, Georgia, declared, ""I'm not a Nazi,"" as he sought to counter accusations of authoritarianism from critics.

The US Supreme Court received a request from Republicans on Monday for an emergency order in Pennsylvania that could potentially lead to the exclusion of thousands of votes in the upcoming election in this crucial swing state .The court is being asked to intervene in a dispute regarding provisional ballots cast by Pennsylvania voters whose mail ballots are disqualified for not adhering to technical procedures outlined in state law, just over a week before the election.In a 4-3 decision, the state's high court ruled that elections officials are required to count provisional ballots cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were invalidated because they were received without the mandatory secrecy envelopes.On the same day, Virginia also sought the Supreme Court's intervention in a dispute concerning the purging of voter registrations . The high court had previously weighed in on pandemic-related changes to voting rules in several states, including Pennsylvania, four years ago.Republicans, in their filing to the high court, requested an order to either put the state court ruling on hold or, alternatively, to require the segregation of provisional ballots and exclude them from the official vote count while the legal battle continues.

Authorities on Monday were investigating incidents of early morning fires destroying hundreds of ballots in ballot drop boxes in Portland , Oregon, and Vancouver , Washington.According to the Portland police bureau, officers and firefighters responded to a fire in a ballot drop box around 3:30 am and determined that an incendiary device had been placed inside.Tim Scott, the Multnomah County elections director, said that a fire suppressant inside the drop box protected nearly all the ballots, with only three being damaged. His office planned to contact those voters to assist them in obtaining replacement ballots.Later, in Vancouver, located across the Columbia River, television crews captured footage of smoke pouring out of a ballot box at a transit centre.Vancouver is the largest city in Washington's 3rd Congressional District, which is expected to have one of the closest US House races in the country between first-term Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Republican challenger Joe Kent.Greg Kimsey, the Clark County auditor in Vancouver, told The Associated Press that the ballot drop box at the Fisher's Landing Transit Center also had a fire suppression system inside, but for some reason, it wasn't effective. Responders pulled a burning pile of ballots from inside the box, and Kimsey said hundreds were lost. ""Heartbreaking,"" Kimsey said. ""It's a direct attack on democracy.""Surveillance cameras covered the drop box and surrounding area, according to Kimsey. The last ballot pickup at the transit centre drop box was at 11 am Saturday, and anyone who dropped their ballot thereafter that was urged to contact the auditor's office to obtain a new one.Kimsey said the office will be increasing the frequency of ballot collections and changing collection times to the evening to prevent ballot boxes from remaining full overnight when similar crimes are considered more likely to occur.On October 8, an incendiary device was also found on or near a ballot drop box in downtown Vancouver. It did not damage the box or destroy any ballots, according to police. The FBI and other agencies had been investigating.Both Washington and Oregon are vote-by-mail states, where registered voters receive their ballots in the mail a few weeks before elections and then return them by mail or by placing them in ballot drop boxes.Last week in Phoenix, officials reported that approximately five ballots were destroyed and others damaged when a fire was set in a drop box at a US Postal Service station.","Firefighters responded to a fire in a ballot drop box in Portland, Oregon.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world's most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated. In severe cases, polio can cause permanent paralysis and death.","Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year.

He stated, ""Some KP ministers are more focused on benefits than promoting the goals of the PTI.""The MNA mentioned that he had received threats of expulsion from the party but asserted that such threats would not dissuade him. He indicated his plan to meet with the PTI founder to discuss the current situation in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. He noted that he would inform Imran about alleged misconduct by certain officials, whom he believes should face prosecution rather than be rewarded with government positions.Citing a previous incident, Marwat criticized the recent promotion of a police officer who reportedly fired at him in Bajaur. He noted that the officer has now been elevated to the position of senior superintendent of police (SSP) in Peshawar.The report further stated that the PTI leader stated that he would update Imran on grievances to confront the current situation within PTI's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leadership. He urged for a strong strategy to aid in securing the release of the party's founder.Marwat's comments follow reports of internal conflicts within the PTI that surfaced during the D-Chowk protests earlier this month and later over the voting for the 26th Constitutional Amendment , where some party members voted in favour of changes that contradicted the party's policy.In a related development, Zain Qureshi resigned as the PTI's deputy parliamentary leader in the National Assembly a day ago after receiving a show-cause notice for severing ties with the PTI leadership during the passage of the amendment in both houses.

To assist commuters traveling from Teen Hatti, the police offered an alternative route through PIB Colony.The factions of the Battagram Trade Union have announced a complete shutter-down strike and sit-in beginning Tuesday in response to the widespread power outage in Karachi district, Pakistan. Until then, the union will withhold electricity bill payments.The outrage affected small businesses like tailors and welders, creating a virtual halt in commercial activities. This has frustrated both residents and business firms in the same manner as they rely on electricity for their daily purposes.As per the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) department, ""The power cuts took place after an order taken by the High Court related to an alleged incident involving the assault of a female prisoner at the Battagram sub-jail.""Conversely, the trade union has rejected the explanation for the power outage, labeling it as ""ridiculous."" They argue that the daytime power outages are solely to ensure a continuous electricity supply at night for the ongoing operation of CCTV cameras in the sub-jail.The union further contended that the decision to cut power constitutes an ""economic murder"" of local traders, who have been unable to conduct business for over a week. Consequently, the union is urging immediate action to restore power supply in the area, aiming to safeguard the economic interests of both residents and business operators.","Residents of Karachi have been experiencing severe and unusual load-shedding, leading to power outages during the daytime.

Eight people were killed, and five others sustained injuries on Saturday when a suicide bomber triggered an explosion at a checkpoint near Mir Ali, a town situated in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, close to the Afghan border .The attacker detonated the bomb while riding on the back of a motorbike rickshaw, according to an unnamed local police officer who spoke to AFP.The casualties included four police officers, two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians. The police officer further stated that among the five wounded, three are in critical condition and have been moved to a nearby military hospital for treatment.An unnamed local government official corroborated to AFP the reported number of fatalities and injuries resulting from the attack.This comes a day after ten police officers were killed in an attack on a check post near the Afghan border.

In the most recent operation Pakistani security forces killed nine insurgents, including a high-level target, in a shootout overnight in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in the volatile northwestern region that borders Afghanistan, the military said Thursday.According to a Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, violence increased sharply in 2024, with a 90% surge in fatalities in the third quarter alone.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities Thursday released Bushra Bibi , wife of jailed former PM Imran Khan , from prison in Rawalpindi, a day after Islamabad high court granted her bail in an alleged graft case involving purchase and sale of state gifts.Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31. She and her husband were convicted of corruption and illegal marriage just ahead of the Feb 8 polls in Pakistan. The Islamabad-based accountability court had sentenced the couple to 14 years in jail in what is known as the “toshakhana” (state repository) case.The case over allegations of illegal marriage had collapsed on appeal and Bibi’s graft sentence was suspended in July, allowing her to walk free from Adiala Jail where Imran remains imprisoned.She was, however, arrested again in a fresh graft case. In the new case, dubbed as “Toshakhana 2,” the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader at a low price, causing a significant loss to the national exchequer. The gift set included a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings.A day earlier, HC judge Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb approved Bushra’s bail in the case, following which a special court issued her release orders, ending nearly nine months of her detention. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) hailed her release, with slogans of “welcome back Bushra Bibi.”“You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaigns and character assassination attempts against you during your illegal time in jail. The Pakistani nation salutes your bravery,” PTI said in a post on X, confirming that Bibi had reached her Bani Gala residence in the federal capital.Meanwhile, the Islamabad HC on Thursday also ordered the jail administration to produce Imran by 3pm in court to facilitate his meeting with his lawyers. “I know you won’t implement my orders, but let me issue directions,” Justice Ijaz Ishaq Khan remarked during the hearing. The judge later softened his stance after jail authorities assured him that they would arrange Imran’s meeting with his counsels in prison.Imran and his party have been at crosshairs of an ongoing tussle between the executive and the judiciary, with the latter accusing the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies of exerting pressure to secure favourable verdicts in political cases, particularly those involving the PTI chief.Imran has not physically appeared in a court since Aug last year, with all hearings being held in the high-security Rawalpindi prison.","Bushra Bibi, 50, was arrested on January 31.

While the police dismiss the reports as "" fake news "" designed to incite unrest, protesting students see them as a rare opportunity to publicly address the issue of sexual assault.Despite the conflicting narratives, both sides acknowledge that the case has exposed legitimate concerns. Khadija Shabbir, a 21-year-old protester in Lahore , asserts that girls on campuses feel threatened. Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi, the senior officer investigating the case, admits that harassment is an extremely sensitive subject that most women in Pakistan have experienced to some degree.The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore. When authorities were unable to identify a victim, they dismissed the claims as a hoax. However, student protests erupted, leading to arrests and the closure of educational institutes across Punjab province.Students, who have been banned from officially organizing in unions for the past four decades, continue to protest, driven by a deep-rooted frustration with the lack of trust in authorities to take the matter of harassment seriously. Many protesters cite personal experiences of harassment as their primary motivation for participating in the movement.The Lahore High Court has announced a new committee of judges to investigate campus sexual harassment , indicating that authorities are acknowledging the validity of the protests. However, the confrontation between students and police is taking place amidst a broader crackdown on dissent in Pakistan, with student social media pages and online chat groups disappearing and officials pledging to prosecute those spreading misinformation.As the protests continue, women who have shared their experiences with harassment find themselves sidelined as the demonstrations sometimes turn violent, often led by men. Despite this, young female students remain determined to stand up for their rights and fight against sexual harassment on college campuses.","The controversy began with social media posts claiming that a staff member had raped a woman in the basement of a Punjab College campus in Lahore.
